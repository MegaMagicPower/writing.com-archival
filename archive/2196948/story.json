You were a tan skinned teenager with ginger hair braided on one side. You spoke with a Louisiana accent, it was somewhat mocked by the 'tough guys' of the school who said you sounded like you came out of a swamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't exactly wrong, your family had been in Louisiana a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that meant a LOOOOOOONG time. You were directly descended from the famous Voodoo Priestess Marie Levaeu. To hear your family tell it you were half human and half Loa. The Loa were deities and spirits associated with the practice of Voodoo. The reason you have Levaeu blood in your veins was that long ago the madam performed a ritual that summoned a rather handsome spirit to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Marie Levaeu had had trouble finding a date due to her reputation...and a woman has needs after all. So she was impregnated (after a night of pleasure) by the Loa. She gave birth to a half-Loa child, and centuries and many offspring later...here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was normal for you at Yokai Academy...well..as normal as it could be. That changed when you bumped into a purple haired girl sucking on a lollypop. You both fell as you were in a hurry to get to class, though the girl seemed to not be in the same hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shit, sorry about that!\" You said as you stepped over to her and offered your hand to help her up. \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore opened her eyes after wincing from the impact...and saw quite the handsome sight. \"I...I'm ok...\" Mizore said in her quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow...she's cute...\"</i> Was what went through your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were wide and she had a blush slowly appearing on her cheeks. \"Aw man, you dropped your sucker...sorry about that.\" You apologized as you reached into your backpack and pulled out a bag of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...you can have whichever flavor you like!\" You said cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sealed the deal for Mizore.</span></div></div>",

Right boys?\" Saizo asked his two cronies, who chuckled and nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" You rolled your eyes, no one taking notice of the snow woman peeking around the lockers. \"I don't have time for this...I'm almost late for class!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, wouldn't want the loser to be late now would we?\" Saizo mocked before shoving you into the wall. \"You gonna pay up? Or does this have to get ugly?\" Saizo cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny...I thought we were already at the ugly part, since you showed up.\" You smirked.

I'll teach you to disrespect me!\" Rearing his fist back, the bully prepared to deal a punch to your face. Mizore was about to discreetly intervene..but it seemed she wasn't needed. A strange 'tear' in the air between you and Saizo swallowed the oncoming fist. Another 'tear' opened up next to Saizo's head, the fist came out of this new one and slammed into Saizo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore was impressed, what exactly was your monster power....to be able to get bullies to hit themselves? Saizo fell to the floor, his arm returned to its normal place and the tears in the air closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAaaAh....W-what just happened?\" Saizo asked in his dazed state. You proceeded to hop over him and pushed past his two cronies, headed to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at class just as the bell rang. \"Well...better than than never I suppose-meow!\" Ms. Nekonome cheerfully said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Mizore?\" Moka asked, only for the stalker snow girl to emerge from the ceiling and plop into her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh...how many secret stalker holes do you have?\" Kurumu groaned, rather creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A stalker never reveals her secrets.\" Mizore calmly replied, her eyes focused on you as you took your seat and class began.</span></div></div>",

Then the weird feeling returned once you got back to paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith class finally over, you stand up out of your seat and prepare to leave with everyone else, only for Ms. Nekonome to stop you on the way out. \"Excuse me Mr. Ambrosine, may I have a word with you?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.... sure ma'am.\" You stutter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me ma'am-meow!

But, your shadow had regrown the moment you left the room, as Mizore resumes her watching from before.

They are voodoo spirits that come from the few areas of the Americas where that's practiced. Physically, their strength isn't that much higher than ogres, but they make up for it with insane mystical powers. Or at least, so they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Her friends awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since your hearing seems to be faulty, how about I just show you instead?\" You suggest. You break your arms free from his goons' grip before you grip their faces with one hand each. With a glow of your hands and a muffled scream from each of them, they go limp as you release your grip and let them flop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?! What did you do to them?!\" Saizo asks with a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, they'll live. They'll have a hell of a headache when they wake up, but they'll live.\" You affirm. \"Now, on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a glowing hand, and with a flick of the wrist, you send Saizo flying into a tree, where he crumples to the ground, but still conscious. \"What the hell?\" He gasps as the wind is knocked out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then open two tears, one on either side of him. \"Ha, I know this trick now. I'm not about to punch blindly like last time and hit myself.\" He scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I don't need you to.\" You remark as you move the tears, making them swallow his fists and forearms. \"I can do all the work myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open a third tear in front of his face and watch as a fist flies out of it, knocking him in the jaw. While it was retracting into the tear, a fourth one opened, sending another fist square into his chest. At blinding speeds, you open and close tears in front of him, pummeling him in a barrage of his own fists. Then, with one final blow, you launch him through the tree and halfway into the wall behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fight concluded, you turn back to your normal look as you dust yourself off. You recollect your things and prepare to head off once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Just toss your box over and I'll have it filled with the Bayou's bounty in two shakes.\" She says. You do as instructed and throw your lunchbox into the portal where she catches it on the other end. You were confused, however, by the raised brow she had when she opened it. \"What's with this plate? I don't remember sending 'dem last daddies on a plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit! You forgot that you left the plate from Mizore's curry in your lunchbox. Well, no getting around it now that she knows. \"Actually mama, that was a gift from someone else. I was gonna wash it for her and give it back today.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears pricked up at the word \"her\". \"What's 'dis now? My baby boy's got himself a girl? What's her name? What's she like? When can I expect grandkids?\" She fires off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit at her questioning. \"No mama, it's not like that. I just met her yesterday and I have a picnic lunch planned today. I figured that since she liked the one crawdad I shared yesterday, that she'd like more, is all.\" You explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I getcha. Well then, if my baby needs a picnic to please his new lady friend, then mama's got you covered.\" She slides your tiny lunchbox aside and pulls out a much larger basket. \"This gal about to get a real cajun meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then puts in another large serving of crawfish, a few beignets, and a small pot of gumbo. \"That'll do it.\" She says with pride before handing the basket back through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, it's only two people eating lunch. We aren't serving the whole school.\" You argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Y'all need to eat, and this lady needs to learn the taste of the south. Don't worry bout your lady friend's plate, I'll have it cleaned by tomorrow. Have fun now baby.\" She says before closing up your portal. Well, looks like you're bringing all this now.

Is it really as simple as a blow to the head to takr them away?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. It seems like those guys just got lucky. They hit my head in just such a way that my spine couldn't carry signals to my body, and by extension my powers, for a minute or so.\" You explain.

She was called Marie Levaeu. She was a powerful voodoo priestess that a lot of people were afraid of. So she had to summon a Loa to basically...y'know...secure her bloodline.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore blushed but asked the obvious question, \"She...summoned a spirit to have sex with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled sheepishly, \"Yeah...it's weird I know but she was probably really lonely and wanted a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore looked down slightly, \"I...can understand that, being all alone gets old.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed her looking a little sad so you reached over and gently cupped your hand on her cheek. \"It's okay, you'll never be alone anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore's eyes widened and tears began to form in her eyes. \"T-thank you...I'm so happy that you're here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you both leaned in, and your lips touched.</span></div></div>",

It must've felt pretty long for your slithery buddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he wants to go home...he wants to stay with you.\" Mizore said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you two understand each other after all...\" Kurumu snarked before a freezing wind blew at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right, buddy? You wanna stay?\" You ask the snake as you pet him on the head. The snake to everyone's astonishment, seems to nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess he's staying.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAAAT?!\" Everyone besides you and Mizore yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? He's friendly...\" You shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the teachers? Do you REALLY think they'll allow you to keep a SNAKE?\" Tsukune tries to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The teachers around here don't seem to give that much of a shit about anything...\" Mizore acknowledges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..she's got a point.\" Yukari hums in thought.</span></div></div>",

Can you please spit him out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant look, Ray begins the process of spitting out his meal, a strange-looking bat. \"Hey, I resent that comment wheeee.\" The bat says as if talking to someone. \"Sorry miss Kokoa, but if that thing's here, then I'm not wheeee.\" It says before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coward.\" Kokoa says before realizing that she was all alone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, still want to fight me without your little friend?\" You ask. </span></div></div>",

I want you to do a panty raid, and I want you to raid a very specific room.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kurumu?! What the hell?! You remember that Mizore's my girlfriend now, right? I can't just  go snooping in another girl's room and stealing her underwear.\" You yell in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you better not get caught then, huh?\" She asks before writing on a piece of paper and handing it to you. \"Here's the dorm room you'll be raiding. Sneak in tonight and grab a pair of her underwear, then bring them to me tomorrow.

Night soon fell and you decided to make your move. Whoever this is, her light hasn't come on yet, meaning she still hasn't come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your chance. Using a tear, you get up to her window and use your new visibility to open another tear inside the room. You use this one to walk right in. You found the dresser and quickly check drawers for the one you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you found your mark. A drawer full of panties. You decide on a rather plain pair of white ones before closing the drawer. Before you can tear out of their, though. You hear the door open and the light click on. Luckily for you, the dresser blocked you from sight of the doorway for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a familiar voice. \"Such a fun day with him. Wish I knew where he went after Kurumu took him away.\" Crap! This was Mizore's room?! Kurumu must've set you up. You tuck yourself in a corner, hoping she still hasn't noticed you while you plan your next move.</span></div></div>",

Why do you two talk about my breasts like it's some kind of insult?\" Kurumu asks as she takes another slash at Mizore, who effortlessly blocked it with her frozen blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you didn't flaunt them so much, we wouldn't see the need to make fun of them.\" Mizore responds as she knocks back the succubus and jumps back a bit. \"Speaking of flaunting...\" She says before thawing one of her hands and reaching into her pocket to pull out a bright red thong. \"You certainly have a skimpy taste in underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu's face turns a brighter shade of red than the underwear when she pulled them out. \"Wh-where did you get those?!\" She stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Dwayne left from your little 'initiation' and you went to go to the club meeting, I snuck into your room for a bit of payback of my own.\" Mizore bluntly responds. \"As I see it, an eye for an eye, panties for panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are so dead.\" Kurumu says, fuming as she retracts her claws and dives right for Mizore, knocking her back as the two land into a nearby mud puddle. You are now a witness as your girlfriend and her friend essentially mud wrestled in front of you as they didn't bother to get up and simply rolled around, trying to pin the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You are a Dekura, a demonic being with the ability to damned the minds of your enemies into the eternal torment of their most inner nightmares and feed on their fear. Your father was a demon, but your mother was human and they agreed eternal love before you were born. When they discovered Yokai Academy, it was the perfect place for you to learn the ways of the human life as well as the different species that comes here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school wasn\u2019t all that bad. Sure, at first, there was some problems with the fighting and being anti-social, but you actually grew fond over this place. You keep your human form at all times because you were told to only use your abilities as a means of self-defense. You don\u2019t really have that many friends here. But you seemed to be okay with it for now. That is until you\u2019ve bumped into something, or \u2018someone\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!

She has short light blue hair with a purple headband on, purple eyes, big boobs, a white long-sleeved shirt with a tie in underneath a vest with a miniskirt on.

I\u2019m such a clumsy idiot.\u201d The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d You said as you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Woah! She\u2019s...

Well, bye.\u201d Kurumu said before she officially left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then left yourself as you can still feel what\u2019s inside of you.

However, despite searching high and low in the main building, you can't find any sign of her. You even start to think she's hiding again and start looking in nearby hiding spots to try and find her. The most you found was a purple-haired girl hiding in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" She says as she notices you spotted her. \"Please don't mention that I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that experience out of your mind a bit, you find yourself wandering around.

So why wasn't she showing up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the realization hit you like a ton of bricks. <i>I never even picked a time or place to meet her. How am I supposed to date her if we never even said where to meet?!</i> You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in defeat a bit at the missed opportunity to date such a cute girl, you resign yourself to loneliness for the day and begin to make your way back to your dorm room. On your way, you passed by the girl's dorm, where a familiar voice called out to you. \"Hey Shinro, up here!\" The voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Kurumu leaning out of a window on one of the higher floors. \"I was just getting ready to come find you. Wait right there and I'll be right down.\" She calls out before ducking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kurumu was outside the building jogging towards you. \"Hey, sorry I took so long.

I was so excited I forgot to even set a place for us to meet.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.

Would you mind helping me out with what we should do on this date of ours?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really are new, huh? Well, lucky for you we succubi know a thing or two when it comes to dating. I've got a few ideas on what we can do.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" You plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we wait a little longer for the sun to go down, we could go for a sunset walk through the woods. That always serves as a nice first date.\" She suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, we could rush up to our rooms real quick and grab some swimsuits and head for the school pool.\" She offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Isn't the pool supposed to be full of man-eating mermaids?\" You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so many episodes ago. They've been cleared out for a while now and everyone is free to swim as they please. So how does that sound, I'll even bring my favorite bikini for you.\" She says with a flutter of her eyes. \"Or if you're not comfortable with that yet, we can still go for a nice walk.

Your species is so powerful that even some of the best monsters out there has a hard time beating them. However, a great cataclysmic event happened and the dragons should\u2019ve been extinct. But a few of your kind survived and went into hiding for centuries. No one had seen a dragon ever since and you\u2019re all considered to be nothing but a legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your father found out about this school, he found this as a chance for the dragons to once again walk in the outside world with everyone else. You accept it and managed to get enrolled. You made it there and was about to go into your new dorm room when you got hit by a bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! That actually made me dizzy.\u201d You said rubbing on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m so sorry! Are you alright?!\u201d A female voice said worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve been hurt worse. No harm done. So uhh....\u201d You stopped when you see something, or someone, that made you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a girl with long pink hair and green eyes wearing the academy attire along with a necklace with a cross attached to it. She\u2019s so beautiful just looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Umm. I-Uh.\u201d You stuttered to find the right words, only you can\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d She asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d You said getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill feel bad. My name is Moka.\u201d Moka introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyuno. And don\u2019t feel bad. Could\u2019ve been worst.\u201d You said tapping on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Moka said before she spotted something that made her panic. \u201cKyuno! You\u2019re bleeding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to see the left side of your face has a slash on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small cut. It\u2019ll heal up eventually.\u201d You said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I-.\u201d Moka stopped when she got a whiff of your blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoka? Are you okay?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Kyuno\u2019s blood. It\u2019s so intoxicating. It\u2019s the best scent of blood I\u2019ve ever smelled. Must drink.</i>\u201d Moka thought as she got her face to your neck and bares fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tired to bite down you, but she can hardly get her fangs into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>His skin is hard. I can barely get into him.</i>\u201d Moka thought as you just looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Moka?\u201d You wondered as Moka just jumped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that... well... I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d Moka said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re with an actual vampire?! You heard about them, but never seen one. This is a surprise to you and you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool?\u201d Moka wondered in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet a vampire. It\u2019s because I hear you\u2019re so strong. Never thought they look cute though.\u201d You said still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! T-Thank you, Kyuno.\u201d Moka blushed before she remembered something. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m going to be late! Bye, Kyuno!\u201d Moka said before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya.\u201d You waved to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart pounding so fast as if you\u2019ve fallen for the vampire. This is going to be a interesting school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You know you want a piece of us.\u201d One boy said creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I like to be around nice men.\u201d Moka rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t want us.\u201d Another one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not pretending.

That\u2019s cute. A little nerd is here for the rescue. You must be new here. So let me tell you something. We rule this school and punks like you are below us wether you like it or not.\u201d The main creep said so smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. If you bitches are running this place, then this school will be a walk in the park.\u201d You said to provoke them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d He asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here and find out.\u201d You dared them while cracking your knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys ran right towards you and you quickly dodged his attack before punching him to knock him out. The other one comes and you just give him the old neck chop. That leaves you and the remaining bully left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll run now.\u201d You said daring him to come at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell I will.\u201d He said before charging at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to punch you in the face before you completely caught his wrist. You squeeze his wrist and he went down on his knee while feeling the pain. You then see his wallet on the ground with his I.D showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaizou huh? Well, jackass, I\u2019m going to let you go for now. But the next time this happens to her, I\u2019ll make Hell look like summer camp.

Let\u2019s get to class.\u201d Moka said and you go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Saizou watched from the shadows with an angry look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>This isn\u2019t over.</i>\u201d He said before leaving.</span></div></div>",
