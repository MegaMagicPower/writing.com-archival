Chris had completely lost his train of thought.\"God this is not my day!\" exclaimed Chris as he slammed his quill into the oak table. \"I've got all my notes on the many races of Dawnwake but I just can't seem to start this book\" Chris spent most of his childhood with the races and creatures of Dawnwake. Taking notes and documenting them had become a hobby of his however over the past 2 years, after his uncles death he had to spend more and more time at his shop.\"I will start again tomorrow\". Getting up from his chair Chris then proceeded to walk over to his draws, he pulled out a blue shirt and brown trousers and began to dress himself. Looking over at his mirror to check his hair he took a moment to look over himself. Chris stood at 5 foot 10, with a slightly tanned complication, his brown hair was just long enough to hide his eyes from view but if you push back his brown hair you would come to see his turquoise green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Chris are you here?\" called a familiar voice from inside the shop. \"I will be with you in a minute\" Chris shouted back. Chris raced down the stairs and through a heavy looking door with a iron deadbolt haphazardly nailed to it. Chris came to a screeching halt almost trapping over his wolf sized dog ironically named Tiny for being the smallest of the litter. Chris looked up after cursing Tiny to come face to face with Ben his closest friend. Ben was around Chris's height, who was taller was open for debate, however this did course a lot of childish arguments between them. Chris and Ben looked very similar and there was a roamer that they where in-fact twins, this roamer was what started there friendship. The only major difference was that Ben possessed jet black hair. \"Chris I have bad news\" \"what is it?\"Chris asked back. \"Its the Imperial soldiers. They have decided to remove the Lamia's living within the caves to the North\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What when did they decide this?\"questioned Chris \"I heard that the king has been ordered the removal. I only over heard one of the soldiers at the barracks complaining about not being involved in the attack and something about cheese. When i asked him about it all he told me was that they left about half an hour ago\"explained Ben. \"They should be at the caves by about now\" Ben then looked over at Chris, Chris's face was unreadable like many times before Ben was unsure what his friend would do next. \"umm Chris what should we do?\" asked Ben \"there's only one thing we can do......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its my battle and i don't want you to be dragged into it.\" explained Chris \"I am involved i was with you when you first found them in the caves, i should be there to help you\" \"Ben I don't want you to get hurt you cant even wield a sword. I'm sorry friend but somethings i must do alone\". Ben looked frustratingly at Chris but realized Chris was only trying to protect him, and it was true he could not wield a sword, he almost beheaded Tiny when he first tried to mimic Chris's sword play. \"at least let me help get your horse ready\" said Ben smirking at Chris \"That would be helpful\" said Chris smirking back. With that Ben belted out of the back door into the stables behind the shop. \"Tiny wake up were going on an adventure\". The instant Chris said Tiny, Tiny literally jumped to his feet and ran up stairs, Chris quickly followed suit. As Chris reached his bedroom door Tiny had already pulled out Chris travel pack and weapons. \"I really lucked out when i chose you as a pet\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few minutes later Ben was standing outside with Chris's horse saddled and ready. \"Chris where are you?\"Ben asked no one in particular \"I'm up here\" shouted Chris as he lept from his bedroom balcony, as he fell he did a front flip, then landing on his horse. Chris's horse protested at the sudden change in weight.\"Show off\" Ben said as he shock his head. \"You better hurry\" \"don't worry i know a short cut hopefully i will get there before they reach the settlement\" with that Chris began to ride the horse up the street towards the mountains followed seconds later by Tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After 10 minutes of fast riding Chris was at 'the short cut' it was a very small opening it was about half a meter wide and just high enough for Chris to stand upright without banging his head. The cave entrance was well hidden by the trees around it and by the way the entrance almost looks like one of the cracks running up and down the mounties. Chris began to hear screams as he entered the caves this accelerated his movements as he pulled his hood over his head to hide his face. Within moments he entered a large cavern that was dimly lit by a few lamps and torches, however Chris could make out at least a two dozen dead Lamia and a few dead soldiers. \"shit i was two late\" cursed Chris at that point Chris hear more screams and shouts coming deeper within the caverns. Chris ran furtherer into the caverns, and found himself in a cavern smaller then then first. There was 7 dead lamia and 3 soldiers. \"I think thats all of them\" said the first soldier \"the rest of them seem to have gone deeper into the cavern\" said the second soldier \"I'm sure that they won't be coming back anytime some are. Are work here is done\". Chris was standing in the shadows as the soldiers where about to get ready to leave. Chris had a instant feeling and acted apone it but bucking, milliseconds later a blade slices where his neck was. As Chris ducked he began to spin on his toes to face his attacker. Pulling on the hilt of his sword pulling it out with such force that the sword slams the attacker in the stomach. Chris followed through and struck the head of forth soldier that tried to attack him. The soldier was knocked out but this alerted the other three soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the soldiers where apone him but Chris had far superior skills and disarmed and neutralized the three without breaking a sweat. \"This was all my fault i did this\". Chris feel to his knees as he clutch the hilt of his blade. Tiny nuzzles his head under Chris's arm, \" Tiny I told you to stay with the horse\". Chris sulked in self pity for a few seconds when suddenly Tiny lifted his head and began to bark. \"what is it?\" said Chris lifting his head slightly. Tiny continued to bark as he got up and ran over to one of the dead Lamia's. Chris got up and followed Tiny, Tiny began to claw at the ground next to the Lamia. Chris with some difficultly pulled the lamia over. the lamia was a young women about 24 years of age with long black hair but what was underneath the dead lamia was a small crack in the wall. In the hole there was another lamia she was much younger the the one she hide under she looked around 15 years old but Chris could not tell because it was  too dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What should Chris do?</span></div></div>",

The lamia looked Chris deep into his eyes. \"trust me I'm hear to help i can get you out of here you just have to trust me\". The lamia continued to stare at Chris, and then she spoke \"You are the one who who came here first. yo...you brought them here\" whispered the lamia \"I didn't bring them here but i was the course of this, but i never know that they would do this\" retaliated Chris \"I'm trying to make thing right but we need to get out of here before more soldiers come\" Chris stretched out his and towards the lamia, which reluctantly took it.Chris pulled her out of the hole, as she got out Chris go a better look at her. She had long fiery red hair that when all the way down her back to where her human half turned to her snake half. Her tail scales matched her hair being many shaded of red which glistened in the low light. her eyes where deep pools of sapphire blue. She looked 15 when she was hidden but no Chris thought she looked more like she was 17-18 years old it was her hight that made her look a lot younger then she was. Her breasts where about B cup in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chris pulled his backpack off his back and pulled out a large black clock \"here put this on and then we will get out of here\".said Chris \"Why would i do that\" said the young lamia \"Just put it o..\" Tiny began to growl at a nearby tunnel, a faint glow was gradually getting brighter.\" Shit just put it on quickly\" ordered Chris, the young lamia flung the clock over her shoulders. the instant the clock touched her skin the tail began to grow smaller and travel back towards her. her tail quickly began to change colour from red to a more pinky - cream colour, and her scales began to fuse and become one. Then her tail when it had almost reached her upper body it split into two fine long legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what did you do to me where did my tail go\" cried the lamia a mix of worry and anger in her voice. \"its a complex illusion and alteration spell i will explain later but we must get out of here\" with that Chris grabbed the lamia by the hand and pulled her down one of the many tunnels leading out of the cavern. Tiny followed at the heels of the lamia. \"I think Deran's group went this way\"called a voice echoing down the tunnel \"Shit what happened here\" said another \"they all seem to be alive, we should search this entire place for the rest of the lamia and kill them for what they have done here\" said yet another voice which slowly became quieter. The rest of the conversation was not heard as it became to quiet to be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"so what's your name? because i can't call you her or she or lamia\" asked Chris as they ran through the pick black tunnels \"my name is Nel\"said Nel \"i have two questions one- whats your name, and two how can you see in these dark tunnels, humans eyesight is very bad?\" questioned Nel \"I'm Chris and i can see very well and i spent a lot of my childhood in these caves, i know them as well as i know the back of my hand\". Within minutes they where outside to find that they where surrounded by 15 soldiers. \"Chris I should have know that you where here this is your favorite place and this IS your horse\" Said the soldier in front of all the others. He was wearing the same armor as the rest however he had a blue star etched into his upper left chest plate. \"hello Captain Verdes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n what should Chris do ?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben was waiting for Chris to return. As Chris entered his shop Ben lit up he was so happy to see his best friend \"How did it go? did you get there in time?\" pestered Ben \"no i didn't, i was to late\" Chris hung his head in shame. At that moment Nel entered with Tiny happily panting hugging close to her legs. \"um so the shipment will be here tomorrow\" Ben panicked as he quickly changed the subject, Chris looked puzzled at Ben's sudden outburst. \"oh look Chris you have a costumer\" Ben pointed out. Chris quickly put 2 and 2 together, Ben changed the subject because Nel walked in. \"Ben don't worry she won't say anything she was the only lamia i could save\". \"no thats possible she's human she's got legs not a tail.\"stating Ben with a very good observation. \"she's wearing an enchanted clock that makes her look human\" explained Chris. \"where in the hell did you get one of those?\" \"I made it obviously\" \"i knew you where good with magic but this is unbelievable thats so amazing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"so this is Nel and Nel this is Ben\" introduced Chris \"now Ben can you not tell anyone about this clock it could mean disaster\" \"thats fine mate i will keep it a secret.

The directions were simple: Over the hills and through the woods, to warlocks house we go. Followed by the wheels on the train go 'round and 'round. Followed by something, something, desert, something and he'll be there. Or he can just follow a giant storm over the skies of a distant castle. He's doing the latter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hills were a breeze. Just an open plain outside the town. Was peaceful while it lasted, until Kabol forgot to bring his trust weapons. On his hips rested two swords. Yellow steel swords that were similar to katanas, but shorter and with no guard. He also had two retractable blades hidden under his arms, being prepared for the most dire situations.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His ear twitched. A scurry across the grass. He pounced and cupped his hands, pulling out a small field mouse. It scurried int he air. Kabol shrugged and tossed it. It didn't do anything wrong. If he was truly hungry, he'd have eaten it. He's lived long enough to see there isn't any real luxury in food, except to the starving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He watched it scurry along the forest floor. Shaded and covered in leaves in twigs. That mouse must be on an adventure like him, but with a better view. As Kabol was watching, he noticed something moved across one of the patches of light on the floor. He looked up at the tall trees and prepared to draw his swords. It could be vree, or a cockatrice, maybe a wild cat even. He noticed a scaly tail sliding behind one of the tree trunks above. It was a... Lamia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol sighed and dropped his guard. He pretended he was up to nothing. Leaves shook above, making Kabol roll his eyes. He turned around to see a lamia; Black short hair, green eyes, white human torse with leaves covering the breasts, and a dark purple snake tail.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol threw his arms in the air to his sides, as if he was going to hug, \"Sup, naga,\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young snakewoman was taken aback. She hissed, \"So you found me. I guess I was a little sloppy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A little?\" Kabol placed his palm on his face, \"Lady, letting me see your tail was a little sloppy. Shaking the leaves just made you look stupid.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She slithered closer. She was almost twice the size of Kabol.

I've been hungry for about a week now, and nekos are my favorite prey.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol changed his tone to a higher annoying pitch, \"I've been hungry. Nekos are my favorite prey.\" Kabol mimicked. He rolled his eyes again, \"No wonder you're hungry, you suck at your job.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll have you know-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll have you know.\" Kabol interrupted with the high pitched mimic voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She hissed, \"That's pretty immature.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lady,\" Kabol pointed at her, \"You freaking eat people, and you're judging me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naga had enough. She lunged at him with sharp claws.  Kabol jumped back, drawing out his swords. The lamia raced towards him and did another dive. Kabol merely jumped to the side, dodging her. Kabol ran up and jumped on her back. He held a sword against her neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naga attempted to roll, but was stuck. She took the time to study her situation. There was fishing wire wrapped around a few tree stumps, and she was entangled between them. She looked down at her hands to realize they are stuck to her chest. They were not tangled, but Kabol's weight made it so that she can't lift them away. Due to her careless pouncing and lashes, she was trapped. Just as Kabol had planned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol held a sword to her throat, \"At first I was worried that a lamia wouldn't have fallen for this, but now I'm glad I didn't let that mouse trigger it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, wait!\" The naga started to cry, \"Please don't kill me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol smiled. \"Don't worry, I'm not going to cut your throat. That would be a waste of a meal.\" He said as he placed his hand on her back, revealing his secret power.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia gasped. She became weary. She can feel the world getting bigger. No! She was shrinking! Kabol opened his hand to see the small and frightened creature. Kabol shrugged and placed his hand to his mouth. He opened it, revealing his fangs and rough tongue. She tried to grab onto something but her tail was already in his mouth. He slurped her up to where only her human half was dangling out of his mouth. \"What is this? No! Don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So here's the deal,\" Kabol began, his voice muffled a little by the frightened girl, \"I'm not very hungry. But I am willing to swallow you whole, just for the sake of irony.\" His words made the creature struggle even more, \"So what to do...\"</span></div></div>",

She tried to pull herself from between the lips, She began to weep, \"Please don't do it! I want to live!\" Kabol began to slurp her more in his mouth, Her human belly passed through his lips. She pushed harder, begging again, \"No! I'm sorry I tried to eat you! I'll be your slave, just let me live!\" Kabol slurped again, feeling her precious good upstairs slide on his tongue. Only her head, shoulder, and arms were sticking out. She bit tried grabbing whatever she could. It was futile. She closed her eyes, \"I'm scared!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Kabol slurped the rest of her body in. She laid on his rough tongue that felt almost like sand paper. The mouth was humid. She was already drenched in his saliva and some of her tail was dangling down the throat. She trembled in fear on the lukewarm tongue. The only source of light is from the parted lips and teeth in front of her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An entire moment of stillness confused her. For a second she even thought she had a chance. Kabol was merely using it to let the moment sink in. He sloshed her about in his mouth and savored her taste. Her human half tasted a bit salty, while the snake half tasted like venison. Kabol teased her by laying her on top of his teeth a few times, and nibbling on her. He can still hear he crying.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol leaned back his head, making the naga freak out and try to grab something. It was too late. with a single swallow, the naga was sent slithering down his throat. A lump was apparent for the widest part of the naga, but it disappeared at the base of the neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol was content he didn't settle with the mouse. He wiped some of his spit from his lips and continued walking. He can feel the naga bang against he walls of his stomach, he's sure she's begging as well. Kabol knows how it feels to be swallowed. Happened to him a few times. But the naga doesn't have any blades that she can cut out with, so she's going to have to settle with digesting in the remains of his lunch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He laid down, preparing to take a nap and letting his gut have all the energy it needs. He soon felt a few bumps. It was the naga trying to escape the stomach from where she came in from. Kabol poked below his ribs, \"If you think you can climb out, try it. But you'll be going back in several smaller pieces.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia stopped struggling, letting Kabol forget about her and rest.</span></div></div>",

He did it once more, this time engulfing her entirely. She hung on tightly to kabols small fangs; small to him, not to her. After feeling this, he tilted his head back and opened his mouth. She was almost free hanging, her human belly just grazing his tongue and her snake tail is almost down his throat. All it will take from him is a gulp or two and she'll be history.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol threw his head forward, and spat her out on his hand. \"Now this si going to happen,\" Kabol smirked, \"You're my newest friend. And by friend I'm using lamia terms. In other words: I'll tolerate you until I'm hungry.Sound good?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please turn me back to normal!\" She pleaded, \"This isn't right!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's just no pleasing you, is there?\" Kabol said, \"You ask that I don't kill you, then that I don't swallow you, now you want to be normal, next you'll be wanting a pony. No. No, no, no, I think you are staying like this. So what's your name kiddo?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naga attempted to pry herself from his grasp, but to no avail. She gave it, sniping back, \"Kiddo? I'm eighteen!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello Eighteen.\" Kabol smirked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The snakewoman grolwed, \"Smart-ass. My name is Sherheshk,\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello, Cherish.\" Kabol tossed her in the air and grabbed her with his left hand, \"Well, make yourself at home.\" Kabol placed her in his pocket next to his heart and continued on his way, \"Did I mention nagas are my favorite prey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He walked until sundown. Cherish kept quiet, perhaps fearful of making Kabol upset. Kabol was at the edge of a forest. Just several dozens of meters away was a town full of anthropomorphic animals. Or people with animal features. He never understood the differences. His parents were similar to them, but he knows he isn't welcomed in that town. Beast and men do not get along. And when they do, it's an abomination. His mother was crushed to death by his own grandmother, who in turn placed a curse on Kabol. That was over  two hundred-and-something years ago, Kabol still hasn't let it go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol made a fire. Didn't take him too long. He's still brooding over being different from the anthropomorphs. The humans accept him as one of their own. Not entirely, but at least he can sleep in their towns. He rolled a mat from his bag and let out a blanket as well. He pulled out Cherish. She was sleeping, but not anymore. She started to panic, as if her time was up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To her surprise, she wasn't going directly to his mouth. He gave her several sniffs and whiffs and set her next to him on the ground, \"I don't want to go to be hungry, and you aren't keen on getting eaten. So how about you go hunting for me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"At this size?\" She complained.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't see a problem with it. But if you don't want to hunt, I'll be sure to give you a warm place to sleep.\" He licked his lips. Cherish frowned and nodded before heading off in the woods. Kabol called to her, \"And I have your scent, so don't go running off or I'm having slug-girl for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol fell asleep in less than half an hour. A book laid itself on his face and the fire sizzled itself out.</span></div></div>",

Kabol blinked and reached for one of his swords. He was relieved to see that it was merely Cherish coming back with several berries on a leaf. She looked almost as if she was struggling. The berries aren't heavy, but there's enough that it would take a bit of effort to move it. She dragged it in front of you and dropped the leaf. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She fell over and started to shiver, \"Please, Kabol. I'm tired, and hungry, and cold, and scared. I learnt my lesson, I just want to go home.\"<br>\r\n{indent\"Grapes?\" Kabol asked as he sorted through the berries. Where did she find grapes in the forest? Wait, are grapes naturally in the forest? Some are, but these are purple grapes. The kind you find in vineyards. \"Where did you...?\" Kabol looked in the direction of the town and shot his gaze back at Cherish. \"You didn't hunt, you stole these from someone. Do you have any idea how much grapes cost?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia started to seem worried, \"I-I... I'm too small to hunt- to do anything!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol laughed, \"I'm just messing with you. If someone lost grapes to someone the size of my finger then they don't deserve the luxury.\" He started eating the food. The grapes tasted delicious to Kabol. He still thinks food is food, but that doesn't mean he can't enjoy it when he can.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The lamia looked around nervously, \"May I have some?\" Kabol tossed a single grape towards her. The lamia thanked him and unhinged her jaw. She shoved it in her mouth and swallowed it whole. Kabol thinks he can compare that to him trying to eat a watermelon in a single bite. But he's mortal enough that his neck and jaw won't want to play along with that idea.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol finished all the grapes, and double checked the berries to see if they were poisonous before eating them. After having a late dinner, he is understandingly not filled. Kabol gestured his finger for Cherish to come by. \"Alright, Cherish, you ready to sleep?\" The woman nodded. Her gut was plump a moment ago, but now it seems that the grape went deeper into her. Most likely it's in her snake tail part thing. She slithered her way to Kabol's chest and tried to climb into his pocket. Kabol grabbed her tail with two fingers and pulled her out. \"Are you cold blooded?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The woman hesitated at first, but she nodded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I don't want to roll on your in my sleep, so you'll have to sleep somewhere else. And I can't keep a fire, so let's improvise.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia was pondering at first, but Kabol already had an answer. He shoved her upper body in his mouth and slurped her in. She began to freak out, for quite some time too, but Kabol ignored it all and attempted to go back to sleep. The lamia, scared, curled up around under his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol woke up again, lying on his chest. This time it was the birds chirping and the dew doing whatever dew does that interrupted his sleep. Kabol sat up and stretched his back. His tongue felt sore, reminding him of his apparent hostage. He held out his hand and spat her on it. She was breathing heavily, enjoying the fresh air.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was disgusting!\" the naga coughed out saliva, \"I never had such a horrible sleep in my life. Why your mouth? Do I look like a spider?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought nagas liked warm, dark, damp places.\" Kabol said before setting her in his pocket and starting to clean up his camp. \"All you need are six more legs and you're not too different. Now quit whining, and don't cry. Where we're going, we need all the hydration we can get.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where we're going? Hydration?\" She looked worried, \"You mean the desert! No! Why? What about my home?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol stopped cleaning almost entirely. His eyebrow twitched in disbelief. \"Home? You mean to tell me you have shelter somewhere in these woods? Lady, I just slept on the cold hard ground. My back-\" Kabol tilted his neck to the right, making several popping noises \"Has kinks in almost every vertebra. My knuckles in my hands have their own headaches from the cold that my sore mouth protected your cool blood from, and all I get in return is you complaining. Yes. You're coming with me in the killer desert of death.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia shuffled her fingers together, \"Can I at least go home and get supplies?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol looked at her and thought about what he could saw or do. She might not return. If she doesn't return, he isn't sure how he's going to handle that. He doesn't want to go through the trouble of hunting her down when he's so close to his next part of his journey. Even if she does come along how is he going to keep tabs on her if she makes a move. But he alone doesn't have enough supplies to bring the both of them. Even if she is shrunken, he can't really take care of her at night, he could choke. He could take care of her now. She's edible enough.</span></div></div>",

Within a few seconds she morphed into her original size. He pointed vertically from the town, and continued, \"I will meet you a little ways that way. And if you don't find me, I'll find you. Don't let me find you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish nodded and slithered off when Kabol let her go. He continued to clean up the campsite, deep down wondering if she will really return. And why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol sat at the edge of a railroad track, of a knocked over tree. <i>The stump on my rump has so many bumps busting my hump, i need a jump.</i> That was his attempt at rhyming to pass the time. Half an hours of work went into that. He checked his watch again. She's late, perhaps not even coming. He looks at his pocket watch, it has indeed been thirty minutes. He sighed and sat back. Maybe he was too hard on her. She hasn't eaten in a while and all he did was pick on her. He would apologize if he saw her again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He heard several twigs start to snap behind him and panting. That must be her. Kabol turned to see Cherish slowing to a halt next to him. \"I'm...\" She began panting and he can hear some harsh breathing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol lifted his hand, \"Take a breather. Alright. I want to say that I am sorry. I realize I have been kind of a jerk.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish rolled onto her back over the fallen tree, letting a large bag of hers hang loose on an arm. Her chest went up as she inhaled a large portion of air and calmly breathed it out. \"Wait, you're apologizing to me? Even though I'm late?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol shrugged, \"I've been kind of a bully to you. Entangled you, shrank you, almost ate you, sent you on an impossible, made you uncomfortable. I've been rude.\" He shot his glare at her, \"I'm not going to stop any time soon, just know I plan on toning it down a little.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish snuck her way under the log and next to Kabol, \"Well... I guess I can thank you for not killing me all the times you had the chance. I've met people... I know people who wouldn't have thought twice about it.\" She laid her head on her crossed arms on the ground and exhaled, blowing some bangs off her forehead. Her brow raised. \"You feel that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol could feel the ground shake beneath him. \"That's our ride.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looked down the tracks to see a dreadnought train of dwarven design. The front was tall and had blades curving towards the top. Any branches it ran into was cut with utter ease. In the middle of the sleek bronze plated train engine round window showing the flames of the engine. At the top of the block like engine was a trail of smoke leading to the heavens. Kabol backed up a few steps and Cherish followed behind him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here's the plan,\" he said, \"We'll late the train pass and get on the caboose. From there we'll ride it until we get to the Badlands.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not getting on that!\" She snapped back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You shouldn't have said that.\" Kabol retorted, placing a hand on her human like belly and shrinking her down. He stuck her top half in between his lips again and grabbed her bag. It was heavy, and he's pretty sure it's full of mostly cans of water.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The train passed by him at a quick pace, but not one that can be considered fast. He thinks he could outrun it, but he lacks the stamina to beat it to its destination. As the engine passed by, Kabol was able to see the cargo. There were no civilian passengers. There were Human soldiers inside the box cars and trolleys. After a few of them passed, flatbeds with mechanical beasts of dwarven designs. Tubes made to shoot rocks with gunpowder were sat stationary on a steel wagon with treads. There were two of them on each flatbed, a total of eight. War.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every time Kabol thinks of humans, he remembers the tales of how they pride themselves off of killing beasts. As if a naga, or a griffin was an actual trophy. The must know little of this land. Even though the vast majority of all of it was unknown, the humans see it fit to say it's theirs. Kabol never truly had a problem with humans. Not all of them are bad, only the ones with power.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the war-machines passed came several box cars of food, ammunition, even slaves. Kabol wanted to bite his teeth when he saw a whole box of anthropomorphic chained to the insides of wooden car, but the being between them convinced him otherwise. Finally the caboose was nearing. Kabol reached out his hand and held on tight to any luggage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He jumped lightly. His outstretched arm snagged a railing on the caboose, and he pulled himself and the bags to the top. He placed his bag on a decorative pylon on the top right of the caboose and the nagas on the top left one. The caboose was pretty damn decorated. If you're going to war, you better look freaking fancy. But metal railings aren't impressive when you can tell what you are sitting on is wood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol pulled the snake girl out of his mouse and laid her next to him before returning her to her original size.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the hell is wrong with you! Why do you keep doing that?\" She growled, though he doesn't think she was as angry as she sounded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol laid on his back and placed his hands behind his head, \"What? You didn't like the plan so I improvised. Admit it, it made things a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She opened her mouth to say something, but kept silent before asking, \"So how long are we going to wait on this thing. It's really creepy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not an animal, it's a machine. So long as you don't fall between it and the tracks, it's harmless.\" Kabol placed his fedora over his face. The train was going slow enough that he didn't worry about it flying away. \"And to your question, at this pace, we have six hours to kill.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia was silent. She knows she can't talk a convincing argument. She looked at Kabol and asked, \"How do you shrink people? Can you teach me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol moved his hat up and looked at her, \"I don't want to talk about it. Now let me take a nap.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol felt the train hit a bump.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His bones ached from all the rattling. He's been awake for a while, but silent for most of the time, as was his partner too. She laid facing away Kabol, her tail curled back under Kabol's feet. Kabol shuffled through his bag and grabbed out a piece of candy he had from the town days ago. He bit into the chocolate wafer, wondering why his companion is so silent.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Hey,\" Kabol poked her bare back, \"You asleep?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you want?\" She said in a grouchy tone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I noticed you haven't eaten since that little grape, so I thought maybe you'd like something.\" Kabol poked her back with the candy. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She reached under her shoulder with an arm and grabbed it. She inspected it with a glance and a couple of sniffs, \"What is this?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"People call it candy, chocolate specifically. It's something you eat.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not hungry.\" She grunted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then pretend it's me.\" Kabol jested. Cherish turned her head and shot a look at Kabol. She narrowed her eyes, before turning back to the candy and ravenously biting it. The first few bites she downed too fast to taste, but once the flavor started to settle in she stopped almost abruptly. She looked at the chocolate wafer with wide eyes before chewing gently. Her eyes were wide with bewilderment. She almost didn't want to swallow because how good it tasted. She took another bite, closing her eyes to help savor the moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turned toward Kabol, \"Chocolate? Do you have anymore?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol smirked and pulled out a piece, \"It's the last one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia lashed her hand out towards the candy. Kabol reacted instinctively and withdrew his arm. Cherish nearly rolled onto Kabol, grabbing his arm wielding the candy. Kabol placed his free hand on her chest and pushed against her as he placed the wrapped chocolate between his lips. She stopped moving for a moment and retreated back into her corner and covered her chest, facing her body away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you alright?\" Kabol asked with the candy hanging from his mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't like it when you touch me.\" She muttered, \"I'm afraid you'll shrink me again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, hey,\" Kabol said softly with concern, placing his hand on her bare back. She winced and cringed, fearing what he'll do. He continued, \"I promise I will not shrink you without telling you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naga turned back, keeping her upstairs goods covered, she hesitated, \"You promise?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol nodded, taking the wrapped candy out of his mouth, \"And you can have this candy.\" She reached out her hand quickly to grab it but slowed it down and held out her hand. \"Before I give it to you, I need you to promise not to try to kill me while we're together. If you agree, I won't shrink you at all. And when we're done, I'll get you more candy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her face lit up and Kabol set the candy on the carriage. She nearly tackled it. She laid on her gut and tore the wrapper off the candy as if it were a an insulting banana peel. When the treat was exposed, she bit into it excitingly and slurped it in within a second. She noticed Kabol was looking at her and turned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's wrong?\" Kabol asked, able to hear the sound of her chewing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon she answered in more of a mutter, \"You left my bra on the ground when you shrank me to get on the train.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol nodded in realization, \"So that's why you were quiet; too busy covering up.\" Kabol reached in his bag and pulled out some bandages. He tossed it to her, \"You can figure something out with that, right?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish nodded with a hum, \"Look away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol rolled to face the woods. \"I never thought nagas were so conscious about their parts.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't call me that. Nagas are an insult; something those humans call us. Just call me Cherish... I mean... Whatever, just don't call me naga. You can look now.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have something against the humans?\" Kabol rolled over to see her on her back facing the sky. Her breasts were covered in bandages. It appears she has used them all. She held her hands on her gut and fiddled her fingers between each other.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked hesitantly at Kabol, \"When I was little, a bunch of humans attacked the caves I lived in.\" She started biting her lips and looked back at the sky. \"I was very young. I was playing hide and seek with my mom before they came, so I think I was the only one who got away.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol frowned and looked at the sky as well. \"I'm sorry to hear that. Did the lamia do anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't even remember my mothers face, so I couldn't tell you. What about you? Do you think humans are okay?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not all of them are bad.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Crimson Shields...\" Cherish trailed off, \"So, where are we going anyways?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol sat up and looked around. He can see the forest start to clear up. He tapped her on the shoulder and pointed through the trees. Behind them lied a tower off in the distance that had what seem to be a black thunderstorm above it. It was far off. The skies above Kabol are cloudy but not bearing water.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia got up, straightening her elbows and resting on her palms. She looked back at Kabol, \"That has to be days away. Why in Dawnwakes sake would you go there?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol flicked his tail from side to side. \"I have my reasons.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You feel like telling me, perhaps?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol looked past her towards the tower for a few seconds before turning back to face her, \"Nope!\"</span></div></div>",

Sand dunes and rocks replaced the green trees. For as far as the eye can see there was nothing but several shades of brown. None of which matches Kabol's hat and coat. He placed it back in his pants pocket and poked Cherish to see if she was awake. There was no immediate reaction, but she turned and looked at Kabol and blinked. \"Is it time?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol answered positively and got to his feet. It is probably the worst time to be in the badlands. The sun is high above in the middle of the sky. Kabol changed his mind, this is the second worse time. Everyone knows that the most dangerous part about the desert isn't the heat. What's worse, he remember that Cherish is cold blooded. The forest's humidity made it feel almost as hot as the Badlands but here it is much dryer. And then there's night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol could see the spire off in the distance. He doesn't know what is beyond the Badlands, but he will find out. The train continued its slow and steady pace, making it easy for Kabol to simply hop off. After a few steps forward he felt smooth rocks under him. The sleek ground slid from under his feet. He nearly lost his balance but managed to save himself from falling by leaning his body forward. He reached a sand filled pit at the bottom of the small slope.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looked around the rim of the slope and noticed that it wasn't that big. If he would have jumped any sooner or later, he would have missed it. It doesn't look naturally made either. Gashes were made along the sides, and in front of Kabol was a small cave. <i>Spider!</i> Kabol thought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He jumped out of the hole and noticed there were others scattered about. <i>Spiders?</i> Kabol thought again. Perhaps he was wrong. They were in rocks and hills. Long dunes trail in between them wherever sand was present, as if something was dragged through them. The holes seem to be dormant and weren't used in some time. Near one of the holes was a leather satchel. It looked like it was backed in the hot sun for months Cherish picked it up and sorted through it. She pulled out some spoiled food and a hot metal canteen. The satchel fell apart in her hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you think caused this?\" Cherish turned to Kabol, placing the canteen in her bag.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Something I don't want to run into.\" Kabol answered, brushing off the sand from his coat, \"Come on, we should start walking. The sooner we leave the Badlands, the better.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia slithered at Kabol's walking pace. She asked, \"Are you sure you don't have any candy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I have another one, would you let me ride your back for a little bit?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No!\" The lamia snapped, before turning her head away, \"Well, yes. I would.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, don't have any.\" Kabol laughed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish crossed her arms and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour of waking in the hot sun, Kabol noticed Cherish was sweating a lot and starting to breathe heavily.. The holes from earlier were less abundant as he continued deeper in the Badlands. Dunes have also become less apparent. They have been replaced by cliffs and cacti. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol took a break, leading Cherish to a cliff and letting her hide in the shade. She curled up and took all the space in it. Kabol didn't care too much, he just sat against her snake tail. She was panting too much to care, but she wrapped him up and dragged him into the shade with her. Kabol can feel the heat almost steam off her scales. Kabol handed Cherish some water from his bag and she drank half the canteen.  \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be a burden. But this heat just gets to me.\" She handed back the water and rested her head on a rock.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol patted the tail that coiled him. It's the first time Kabol was embraced by such a creature that didn't want to consume him. He scuffed, \"How are you with the cold?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Better than this heat.\" She's no longer panting, and her vision was fixed on a pile of bones. A few minutes pass and the shadow has inched away from the duo. For a moment, Kabol thought Cherish was asleep until she asked inquisitively, \"Kabol, are there two skulls in that pile?\" She pointed to the pile of bones. Kabol inspected it. Not only did it have two skulls of different animals, but it also had more bones than any one animal should have. Some bones even have blood on it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol sat up and got Cherish's attention, raising his voice \"We need to move!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he said that he heard a growl from above. A shadow made it's way on the ground before them. Kabol couldn't distinguish it other than a blob, until it jumped directly in front of them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was a vree. A brown bear like creature with long spikes down it's spine and ears the belong to a fox. It bore a slain coyote in its jaws that wielded two lengthy teeth at the end of a long skinny snout. The vree dropped the coyote and growled at both Cherish and her neko friend.</span></div></div>",

Cherish released her grips on the neko and get in a defensive position to combat the menace. Kabol pulled out his swords and prepared to strafe behind the vree, using numbers to his advantage. Before anyone can go anywhere, the ground began to shook.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vree's piss yellow eyes looked filled with fear. The bristles lower to a more timid position and its neck hunched down. It whimpered and turned tail, running through the pile of bones and jumping from rock to rock in a scurry away from the den. The ground stopped shaking before trembling again, this time lighter. Kabol looked at where the vree fled and then back at Cherish.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, I'd run from me too.\" He jested with a smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lamia slid closer to Kabol, \"I've never seen a vree run in fear from something.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'd like to refer you to my first statement.\" Kabol smirked and sat in the shade. The shaking in the ground can barely be felt now. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you think that earthquake was natural?\" Cherish asked. Kabol shook his head. Cherish looked around in the sky, \"The sun is going to set in a few hours. Do you want to start walking?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol nodded and sat up. He climbed to the top of the rock he kept shelter under and looked towards the tower. It still looked days away. When he began this journey, he knew it would take long. However, he didn't think about bringing a companion, or how much of a burden they could be. He would have been halfway out of the Badlands by now. Kabol tried to think of a path from what he could see. Desert, rocks, desert, hills, dunes desert and more desert dune rocks. If he looks closer, he might be able to find a desert dune rocks on a hill. That could be the highlight of his day. This isn't going to be fun.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're going to have to walk at a quicker pace if we want to gain ground by night. A lot more dangerous creatures come out, most are probably venomous if I know how deserts work. So It's best we hunt now...\" Kabol stopped talking at the sound of what seemed like someone slurping noodles. He turned to see Cherish with the coyote tail sticking from her lips. She looked a bit embarrassed and swallowed the rest quickly. Kabol tossed his hands in the air, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry,\" She blushed. Kabol can see lumps crawl through her gut as the coyote travels deeper towards her snake bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm just upset you didn't ask if I wanted any,\" Kabol smiled and turned away, \"Come on, we should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sun was about to disappear over the horizon. The air already turned cold. Kabol and Cherish covered at least six miles this time. Something he could have done alone, so he was impressed his companion was able to keep up this time. He can see Cherish begin to shiver. \"Are you alright?\" He said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just a little cold is all. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have an idea that could help us both.\" Kabol said. He stopped and jumped on her tail. He went to the back of her human torso and wrapped his arms around her shoulders and legs around her waist, proclaiming \"Piggyback ride!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" Cherish tried to shrug him off until she felt some of his body heat. He wasn't too warm, not much of his skin made contact other than from his open trenchcoat and hands, but he was much warmer then the air cooling around her. She stood still for a moment trying to decide what to do. \"Fine,\" She muttered, \"This is so insulting. I swear, if you tell a single soul-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll take my chances.\" He smirked, \"Okay, I'm joking. I won't tell anyone, and no one's around to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol rested his eyes for a few hours. The only thought going through his mind was telling him how great it is to be a cat. The lamia continued on, going on any soft terrain she can find to help Kabol sleep soundly. Cherish tried her best to imagine Kabol as just a backpack that generates heat. His skin has made her feel warmer the longer he was on. The sun was gone completely, has been for a little while. The lamia stopped and shrugged Kabol awake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol. Kabol wake up. I'm tired and it's so dark I can barely see the ground.\" She nudged him with her head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol opened his eyes and yawned, \"Alright, I'll make a fire.\" He jumped off Cherishes back. She felt cold rush up her spine in the absence of warmth. \"It might take a little time, but we'll be warm when we-\" Kabol froze when he felt an icy touch. The snake tail found it's way under his coat and wrapped around his waist and torso. He found that only his arms and head were free from the snake woman's coils. She then rested her human half on her tail, facing down. She grabbed Kabol's arm and wrapped it around her human waist. She rested still after the whole ordeal and a smile crept on her face. It was her bodies way of reacting to a warm source. Kabol continued, \"When we sleep. Okay then,\" Kabol managed to remove his blanket from his sack and wrapped it around her body and him, \"I guess I have guard duty.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol yawned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Stay awake you old goof.</i> He yelled at himself inside his head. He's gotten pretty warm in the naga's coils. He's sure that the outer side of the twisted tail was much colder. He felt a lump travel through the tail by the side of his left thigh. <i>That better not be that coyote,</i> Kabol rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he did he noticed something distant near his right. It seemed like an aura of light. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and noticed there was also smoke. And when there's smoke, there's fire. And come fire comes people. And come people come food and shelter. He forgets what comes after that; it was either hospitality or hostility. Either one is welcomed at this point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol patted Cherish's scales, \"Cherish, get up.\" He whistled, \"Come on, up up. Got nice tasty candy at home if you wake up.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Candy..\" She muttered in her sleep and tightened her tail around Kabol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He felt an unnatural amount of pain go through his legs and body, \"Ow! Too tight! Yep, you're crushing me. Now wake up.\" He held her nose between two fingers and closed her nostrils, while at the same time keep her mouth closed. Her eyes shot up and she looked at Kabol with a predatory gleam. \"You're squeezing me. Also...\" Kabol let go and pointed to the light and smoke. She lost the look of a predator and stretched with a yawn, soon remembering how cold it is. The tail loosened it's grip on Kabol but not enough to let him fall through. He caught his breath a little and continued, \"There's a fire over there. That means there's other people, maybe even shelter. Let's go check it out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish kept the blanket to herself, encasing her human half as she followed Kabol to the light.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't too far, about a two minute walk. They got to see what made the smoke and light; a hovel in a pit similar to the den Kabol and Cherish shared during the day. It was built into the rock, using rock. If they were traveling here by day, they'd had missed it entirely. Kabol scratched his head, \"Strange place to live. Let's check it out.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait,\" Cherish slithered in front of him, \"What do you expect they're going to do? How would you react to a random neko and lamia traveling together?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol hopped into the pit, \"So long as they don't ask me if I heard about their spiritual savior, the All-Maker and the Duo I wouldn't care.\" The lamia followed as Kabol continued, \"Worse case scenario they're humans that don't like company.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, because a human who likes company would live in an empty desert.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol took a deep breath and put on a smile before knocking on the door of the house. \"Just let me do the talking.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door soon shot open. A woman, human with skin almost as tan as Kabol's, held a triple-barreled crossbow towards Kabol's chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol held up his palms, and in a panic, \"Hello! May I interest you about our spiritual savior, the All-Maker and-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young woman took the safety off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We'll come back never.\" Kabol pointed both index fingers to the distance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Zerah, is that company?\" An old voice called. The woman, turned her green away and brushed red bangs off her forehead with a huff of air. Before she could say anything the old man said, \"You know how much I love company. Let them.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Papa,\" She called back, \"You can't be too trusting. They could be scouting for raiders. Let the cold take them.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old man got from his chair and walked towards the door. He pushed her from the door frame and shook Kabol's hand, \"Hello, mister.\" He looked well for his age. Seemed that only his voice was calling him on his age. He had a few grey hairs on an otherwise jetblack hair. His skin wasn't as tan as the woman, making Kabol guess that he doesn't get outside as often. His blue eyes even seemed welcoming to Kabol. \"I don't get much visitors, and I assure you there isn't anything worth stealing here. Come in, come in. Oh my...\" He noticed the lamia and cleared his throat, \"Hello, miss. You're welcomed in as well. Zerah, move the furniture to the  guest room. The rooms will be switched for the night. Don't worry about her, she has her mothers will and features, along with her temper. But she means well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol thanked him and walked inside. Zerah was pulling away two chairs from the fire and into another room. The lamia slithered in past him gently into a large open room. It looked as if it was built into the rock. In the middle of the room was a fire pit that the naga found itself sitting around. She kept the blanket on her human half. She looked up at the old man and shivered, \"T-thank you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, she's cold blooded. It's a good thing she has you for warmth. Sometimes it gets so cold that water freezes. If she was a normal snake, or maybe even a normal human, she wouldn't have it this bad. I'm sorry, I tend to be a chatter mouth. I didn't even tell you my name yet. You can call me Fenrir good sir. And you are?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm Kabol.\" He shook his hand again, following the old man. The both sat on the naga's tail as if it were a couch. \"Thank you for letting us in.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's my pleasure, sir. I see your naga has noticed the fire.\" Cherish gave a glance at the old man, but forgave his word in honor of his kindness. Kabol took a closer look at the fire. Instead of wood, it looked like ice. It also gave no odor. The old man continued, \"Glass stone. Even the name is a conundrum. They last a long time too. Sorcerers, I tell you. One day they'll figure out immortality I tell you. Trader comes by every year or so and gives us some.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why would he do that?\" Cherish asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess there are just some people in this world who are good.\" The old man smiled, \"You came at a good time. Zerah and I were about to have some coyote stew. Would you like to have some?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zerah came in from another room and handed a bowl to Fenrir, \"Papa, if we give them any, we will have nothing for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol rose a hand and reached for his bag, \"We have our own food, it's quite fine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old man nearly slapped Kabol's hand away from the bag, \"No. You are our guest. We won't allow you to eat stale food.\" He handed Kabol his bowl. Zerah, hesitantly, handed Cherish her bowl. Cherish thanked her. When Cherish started sipping the bowl, Kabol was the only one in the room that saw the look Zerah gave. She seemed almost angered as she returned to the room and continued cooking. The old man continued, \"Does she have a name? Your naga?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I call her Cherish.\" Kabol said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's a big woman.\" Fenrir slid his hand across her tail in a petting motion before stopping and holding his mouth, \"Oh, I didn't mean it like that. Compliment wise. I was admiring her size, her stature.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's alright, Fenrir.\" Cherish said, \"Thank you for the compliment. Please don't call me a naga, or imply I'm his.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old man nodded his head, \"I didn't mean it like that either. I meant, you know partner wise?\" Kabol raised an eyebrow. The old man shrugged, \"I guess I shouldn't have assumed. I wouldn't have blamed you. I've seen weirder couples.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zerah handed Fenrir a bowl of stew and sat on the other side of the lamia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the rest of the night, Fenrir chatted up Kabol and Cherish about how he and his wife moved here to avoid raiders, robber and other human acts. It started to get late, Fenrir and Zerah went to another room to sleep, while Kabol slept on a mattress Fenrir made Zerah give up. Cherish cuddled with Kabol, sharing the blanket, refusing to become a further bother to the old man and his daughter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Cherish fell asleep, she whispered in Kabol's ear, \"For a human, I really like that old man.\"</span></div></div>",

The light from the windows was in Kabol's eyes but he can see Fenrir was sitting in a chair next to the fire. He was warming his hands before noticing the two jump up from their sleep. He rose a hand, \"Don't worry, it's just a sandshire. They can't get us in here. Just be quiet and we'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol at the man. He sat and acted as if this was a casual event. \"Fine?\" Kabol asked, \"How can you be so calm?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old man looked at him, shaking his head, \"Honestly, I'm not. Zerah's out there. She went to catch breakfast but hasn't returned. I fear that she may be after the sandshire. She never forgave them for taking her mother.\" The trembling slowed for a moment before getting heavier. Cherish curled around Kabol. The old mans face looked curious. He stood up gently, \"That doesn't feel right.\" The ground stopped shaking, only to return to a much more violent state, \"Zerah!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old man rushed out of the house. Kabol slipped out of Cherish's grasp and chased after him. Fenrir looked around, his eyes filled with horror. Kabol heard a call from the distance. He can tell it was Zerah's but he didn't understand what she said. Fenrir called her name again. It was silent for a moment. Kabol can hear Cherish slide our of the house. She was about to say something but Kabol gestured her to be quiet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zerah's voice was heard again, faint, but Kabol can hear it, \"Run!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fenrir called back, \"What?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ground trembled again, more violent than ever. Kabol was knocked off his feet, so was the old man. Kabol got up to see that the ground started to crack at the sides of the pit. Kabol hopped to his feet. Fenrir wasn't so quick. The cracks traveled in Fenrir's direction and the ground opened up. What looked like a worm with seven flaps covering it's mouth emerged. Within a second it opened all of them at the same time, revealing a snake mouth inside, before charging at Fenrir. It slammed into the ground, engulfing him and disappearing as quick as it came. It's long body traveled behind it, covered in countless spikes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Papa!\" Zerah cried at the top of the pit. Her crossbow only had a shot left. The cracks in the ground soon turned it's way to the woman. It went around the hill. Zerah's eyes followed it, turning a full 180 degrees. She whipped back around and scream, \"Run!\" She jumped down and ran to her house. The hill she jumped off of started to fall apart. Kabol rushed and tackled the woman out of the way. Streaming behind him was the sandshire. Cherish moved out of it's way, allowing its open mouth to smash into the house, demolishing it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol turned back to Cherish and repeated, \"Run!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He got up and dashed out of the pit. He heard the lamia slither faster and pass him up. In front of him seemed to be a pillar and some ruins serveal meters ahead. He was about to suggest going there, but the lamia already was on her way there. Kabol turned his head to see Zerah is almost on his tail. When he turned back he can see Cherish is already crawling up the pillar. Then his leg started to sting intensely.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He fell down. A shadow coasted over him as he looked to see a crossbow bolt pierced his leg. He almost cursed, but stopped himself when he felt a tremor. Zerah lost her footing and fell. Kabol looked past his leg to see that sand started to build up into a pile and race towards him. Zerah was right in front of him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He has an idea, and only one shot. He picked up a nearby stone..</span></div></div>",

Zerah looked back at Kabol. She smirked and rolled to his side. Behind him was an emerged sandshire charging at her with an opened maw. She didn't have enough time to dodge, and no bolt to fire at it. She was soon engulfed by the voracious beast, which soon disappeared in the ground under her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol tore the bolt in half and removed it carefully before he stood up. Where Zerah was at was now replaced by a hole similar to what he fell in when he jumped off the train. Kabol felt sad rather than angry. He used to always be happy when a plan comes together, but he still killed a woman in sake of revenge. He looked up and was able to see the look on Cherish's face. She saw the whole thing. \"You don't blame me right?\" Kabol asked, taking off his trenchcoat and hat, pulling out his swords.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, what are you doing?\" Cherish called.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm clearing up my conscious.\" Kabol can't see any dunes. He can feel the shaking, however.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol, no!\" Cherish nearly fell off the column, \"Run!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He pointed a sword at Cherish, \"Be quiet, please. I'm trying to concen-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol was interrupted by the sandshire emerging directly from under him. It reached meters into the air. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the tallest point, Cherish can see his sword hit the ground. \"No!\" She screamed as the creature sunk back into the ground. Cherish can hear nothing but silence. For the first time since she met Kabol, she felt alone and scared. She felt her heart sink and she wanted to throw up. Her eyes became watery. She almost lost her grip when the ground started to quake again. The sandshire emerge on the ground, spinning and twirling its body against the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish felt angry towards it. Enough to be described as hate. Suddenly it started to roar. It was loud enough that Cherish held her ears. The worm began to flail from side to side before letting out a final bloodcurdling roar and laid limp. Cheris was confused, until she saw one of Kabols swords stick out from a side. Cherish felt a revitalized hope and crawled down the pillar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol cut through the sandshire's flesh and crawled out. Its juices drenched his pants and fur on his ears, as well as his skin. He fell on his knees and screamed, \"That freaking hurt!\" He reached back into the laceration and pulled out Zerah. Both the woman and Kabol were bleeding, Kabol less so. The woman was much less responsive.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol,\" Cherish rushed up, spreading her arms either for a hug or in disbelief, \"Are you crazy?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't touch me!\" Kabol held out his hand and started to drag Zerah with the other one. \"You think I'm crazy That s'um'bitch had circles and rows of teeth in its throat. This-\" He pulled out a tooth from the side of his waist, \"feels like daggers, and it's everywhere in there. The tube only got smaller.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish helped Kabol drag Zerah, \"What about Fenrir.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol was silent for a moment, \"He was in too deep. I... I don't want to think about what may have happened to him.\" Cherish looked sad, the shadow of her bangs covered half her face. Kabol continued, tossing Zerah on his shoulder, \"Let's take care of her first. She's in shock. Go get my stuff and meet me back at the house.\" <i>Or what's left of it,</i> He thought</span></div></div>",

At least two or three hours. Her shock was worse than Kabol thought, making her drift into unconsciousness for almost an hour. She was on the table from the kitchen in the living rooms shade. Kabol's own person was also damaged and bloody for the longest time before washing up. The only wound that really bothered him was the one in his leg made by the bolt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even after hours of inactivity, Kabol can feel a throbbing pain with each heartbeat. The curse was a double-edged sword. Because of it, he has hours of constant pain, but if it was absent, he'd have been dead. Not just now, but many times over. At least this time he has a couple of giant tooths to add to a collection. He scrounged his lips realizing this si the first time he kept a souvenir on his many adventures. Kabol heard the lamia slither over next to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked curious, \"You saved her, even though she tried to kill you. Why?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol brushed some dirt from his fedora, \"She tried to kill me, then I tried to kill her. I got even.

You walked out of it with teeth stuck in you and bleeding just as much. How?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol shot a glance to the snakewoman, \"You're not going to stop unless I tell you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So tell me!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol hummed a thinking tone before answering, \"Nope.\" Before the lamia can snap back, Zerah woke up. Her eyes shot open and she rubbed her head. She looked around, mouth agape as she saw her home in ruins.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Papa?\" She looked at Kabol, \"Where's my papa?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol shook his head, \"He didn't make it.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" She closed her eyes and shook her head, \"No. No, this isn't fair!\" She began to cry. As tears streamed, she reeled a fist back and struck Kabol. She ran into the kitchen and brought out a knife, \"You left him to die! Get out!\" Kabol was about to protest. He did what he could, and her refusal to appreciate it made him feel upset. Before he can think of something to say, Zerah charged, \"Get out!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went in to stab. Kabol tried to reach for her arm, but from his peripheral vision he can see Cherish reach in. She grabbed Zerah by her neck and  held her off he ground with a single hand and an outstretched arm. Zerah tried to cut the lamia, but Cherish grabbed the hand with the knife and twisted it until the blade was dropped. \"Listen to me you runt.\" The lamia's glare burnt deeply into the woman's soul. Cherish can see the fear and sorrow on Zerah's face, she enjoyed every moment of it. She growled, \"I saw what you did to him, and I wish he'd had left your sorry ass in the worm. But if you're too heartbroken, or too stupid to see it, let me remind you. He risked his life to save you and you better damn well thank him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish dropped the woman on the ground. She fell on her hands and knees and rubbed her neck. She didn't hesitate to grab the knife and stab at the snakewoman. The knife drew blood from the tail.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol reached in faster than the lamia and punched the girl in the gut. He grabbed her shirt and she quickly disappeared. Cherish thought for a second that she vanished in thin air, until Kabol sorted through the shirt and pulled out a shrunken Zerah. She looked confused, scared and horrified all at the same time. Kabol reached for Cherish and placed the frightened woman in one of her hands. \"Cherish, I seemed to have made the wrong move when I saved her. This time, the choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol folded her fingers around her newest prey and headed out of the pit. The last thing he saw was the lamia hungrily looking at the woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol scanned the skies. The sun was directly over head. Noon. It's going to be too hot for Cherish to travel again. He heard the lamia slither in the center of the pit, \"So how did she taste?\" Kabol asked without looking back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't eat her.\" She said. Kabol turned around and raised an eyebrow. She continued, \"The poor girl lost everything in a single day. And the day is only half over. Can we leave? Find some other shade? This place is depressing.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol nodded, \"Let me just get a few things.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol headed towards the house. As he was about to step inside, he heard crying. Zerah was small and weeping at the corner of the door frame. Kabol heard her cry the same word repeating, \"Papa.\" She gasped when she saw Kabol loom over her. Kabol ignored her and grabbed his blanket by her. He looked around, grabbing the knife and a bowl on the ground and placing them in his bag. He grabbed another bag that hung off a nearby wall. \"Hey! What are you doing?\" She called when Kabol started scooping up the glass stone in his new bag, \"I need those!\" Kabol ignored her, heading into the kitchen and taking any spices she had. As Kabol passed her at the door frame she cried, \"Wait. You can;t just leave me like this!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure I can. I'm about to too. Just watch.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait!\" She called again as he turned away, \"If you're going to leave, then eat me!\" Kabol stopped and looked back. She wiped a tear off a cheek with her arm, \"If you don't eat me, then the vrees will. At least you'd remember doing it. Please, just don't leave me alone.\"</span></div></div>",

Kabol had no intentions of killing her. Zerah looked confused when she wasn't in his mouth, but rather back to her orignal size with her shirt thrown at her. Kabol turned and stalked out of the door. Before he got too far, he turned back and pointed to the direction from whence he came, \"Go that way until you hit a forest. Keep going, not too far past it will be hills and then a town. Pack up and go.\" Kabol couldn't believe what he was doing. She's going to want her stuff back. He continued, \"And if we ever see you again, you'll have a first hand look at what it's like inside a lamia.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He turned away, refusing to see the woman's reaction. He did, however, see Cherish's reaction. A wide smirk. She let Kabol pass her and slithered at his pace, \"She's going to die out there, you know?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What makes you say that?\" He turned his head. Cherish held up the triple barreled crossbow full of bolts. Kabol shook his head with a smile, \"I guess it wouldn't make sense letting her keep that. Thanks for sticking up for me back there.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She slung a quiver full of boats around her shoulder. \"Thanks for trusting my judgement. She didn't deserve to be un-shrunk. She tried to kill you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sound familiar?\" Kabol said playfully as he rose an eyebrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish pushed Kabol to his side in a friendly manner, \"Whatever. Alright, I guess you have a point. Let's find some shade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol found himself in her coil once more. It's been hours since he left Zerah in the rubble of what was once her home. They didn't find any good shade for about an hour. When they did, Cherish thought it was a waste of another hour to stay longer. Now it's night and Kabol was coiled up, even though the glass stone allowed him to create a good fire. At least the both of them traveled a lot of ground today. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He can feel his warmth in her scales and body, and he enjoyed most of it. Wasn't worth his elbow room. Kabol saw that Cherish bore a smile, possibly from having a good dream, possibly for other reasons. The more Kabol thought about it, the happier he was that he let the lamia live. He still, however, can't figure out why she tagged along. His threats were intentionally unfounded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol? You awake?\" Cherish asked, opening an eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish looked hesitant. She still laid on her tail next to his head, but she started to look more uncertain. She continued, \"I've been wondering, and I know I keep asking, but how do you shrink people? Can you teach me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't shrink people, I shrink people who are a threat to me.\" Kabol can feel the woman's tail uncoil itself. Kabol stretched his arms as the naga slithered around close tot he fire. He said, \"And do you think you can teach me to swallow people whole? Or are you like me, and you were pretty much born with that gift?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" The woman almost looked disappointed. Kabol sat next to the fire, feeling the woman slither next to him for warmth yet again. She didn't curl around him, rather laid next to him and let him use her body as something to lay against. She started fiddling with his ears playfully before turning away, \"Well, it's my turn to keep watch.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol was amazed and alerted at the sight before him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Geysers, hot springs and pools of green-blue crystal clear water in craters. He's glad he left the Badlands, but now he's in an area that just yells 'volcano'. He can smell the sickening scent of sulfur. The sky was a little cloudy, but he assumes that's just from the geysers. Kabol checked his map from his bag. This area was nowhere on it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol looked at Cherish. The lamia was glad to be somewhere where the sun didn't bake her like a live pancake. The sky was kind enough to provide shade, at least for now. The heat, in spite of the shade, still existed, just not as prominent. Cherish was more focused on the pools of water.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she started to sliver towards them, Kabol jumped in front, \"No! Don't touch them. Those pools are extremely hot. Watch.\" Kabol looked around on the ground for anything to throw. Luckily, he found a beetle. He picked it up and tossed it into a nearby pool. As it broke the surface tension of the water, it made a sizzling sound.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish looked around, dismayed. There was steam climbing out of large pools of water. There was almost no ground for the lamia to slither on. \"How am I going to get through then? Can we go around?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That would be a waste of time. I know a way I can get your through, but I need your permission.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish frowned. She knew what he meant, what he was planning on doing. Behind her, a scurry was heard. Kabol and Cherish turned to see three vrees climbing over a ledge several meters behind them. Cherish shook her head, quickly agreeing to Kabol's plan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol placed his hand on her tail and shrank her. He remembered to pick up her bra this time before placed her in his pocket and running away between the hotsprings. The ledges were thin, but Kabol's natural balance let him keep his footing. One slip could be the end of both him and his lamia friend. He heard a splash and squeals of pain, along with the sound of siring flesh. One of the vrees must have fallen in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He made it safely to the other side and hoped up a ridge. The other vrees started to flee. The third one was dead in a pool. Kabol took a breather. It wasn't hard crossing the ridge but the pressure if death was a good motivator; an anxious one too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay! You did it.\" Cherish poked out of his pocket, \"Can you let me out now?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't think that's an option.\" Kabol said as he looked to the distance. The pools were cleared up, and there was a little more room to walk. But the room to walk was still little. Cherish put on a pouty face as Kabol started walking.</span></div></div>",

It was carved in the stone of the ground. Cherish popped out of Kabol's pocket, curious as to why they've stopped. \"It's just a staircase.\" Cherish pointed out the obvious.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The area he was in was clear of any hotsprings and geysers. Now there's just sulfuric rocks, large rocks and large sulfuric rocks along with a pool here or there. Cherish is able to slither around, however, without the fear of getting boiled alive. A slide on rocks were heard behind Kabol. Cherish tried to look over his shoulder, but he didn't allow her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're being followed. Have been for sometime.\" He pushed her head back down in his pocket, \"Don't look. Alright, so here's the plan. I'm going to bring you back to size, I distract, and you go get her.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Her?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol turned around, able to something scurry behind a rock just in time. \"Yes, her.\" He set the lamia on the ground and turned her to her original size. After giving her back the bandages, Kabol pointed to his right and motion his arm to tell her to flank. Kabol kept his eyes on the rock. He saw a side of a human face peep from the side of the rock before cowering back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon the lamia appeared behind her and greeted her before pulling her out into the open and wrapping her tail around her prey. Kabol walked towards the struggling Zerah. The lamia was spinning her as she tightened her grip. Zerah tried to speak but couldn't get the air in her lungs. Kabol rose a hand, \"You can stop now.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you to tell me what to do?\" Cherish sniped. Kabol crossed his arms and tilted his head with a look. Cherish frowned, \"Point taken.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol strode up to the lamia and the curled girl. \"Zerah, honey, what part of 'don't follow us or we'll killl you' did you not understand?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol,\" Zerah gasped in air, \"Kabol, listen! I didn't mean any harm, I just want my crossbow back.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you can shoot us?\" Kabol slung the crossbow into his arm, \"I don't think so. In fact, I think Cherish could use some target practice.\" Cherish shook her head. Kabol rose an eyebrow, \"No? Ah right. Judging by the way she looks at you, she wants you alive and well. Cherish?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish placed her hands on Zerah's shoulder and moved her head next to the neck before biting on the chin. Kabol turned, not willing to see the inevitable consumption of the woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol wait!\" Zerah called, \"The sorcerer! He doesn't live in the tower, don't go there, it'll lead you to your death. The Naseer- Ah!\" She was interrupted as Cherish's jaw unhinged and started to engulf her chin.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol turned around, \"Naseer?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish stopped eating the girl and pouted. Zerah coughed out saliva, drool was smeared across her face. After coughing up a fit she managed to spit out, \"The Naseer, a great beast at the top of the spire. The sorcerer conjugates the storm to deter explorers. He lives elsewhere, nearby in fact. let me take you to him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish folded her arms, \"Am I ever going to get to eat anything that isn't already dead? I mean, I could eat her and she could tell you the directions inside, if she's loud enough.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zerah squirmed heavily, \"No, no, no!\"<br>\r\nThe lamia's idea isn't too half bad, but entirely unnecessary and risky.</span></div></div>",

But if you make one step out of line, you're mine. Other than that, we can be friends.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish released the struggling girl. Zerah biffed the landing and fell on her legs. She tried to recompose herself but Cherish picked up the woman to her feet and pushed her towards Kabol. Zerah took point leading the duo a little off from the direction of the spire. Kabol handed Cherish back her crossbow and kept it pointed at the human.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She lead them to a rocky formation away from the Hotsprings. One thing Kabol noticed was that there were more and more stairs carved into the rocks the closer he got to the rocks. When they got to it, there was a cliff and a chasm behind the rocks that dropped directly down at least a dozen meters. erah pointed to the side of the cliff she was over, showing that there was a giant door made of stone and wood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's in there.\" Zerah pointed out the obvious, \"Do you have a way to get down?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol pulled out a rope, handing one end to Zerah, \"Tie this around your waist.\" When she was done, Kabol pushed her over the edge. As the rope began to shorten, following her, Kabol tied a quick noose on his end and tossed it on a nearby stalagmite. Once the noose was wrapped around it, the rope tightened and bounced. An 'Umph' noise was heard from the chasm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol slid down the rope. The woman was two meters in the air. dangling. \"What the hell is your problem?\" She sniped at Kabol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol hopped off the rope at a safe distance, \"What? Humans don't land on their feet?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish slithered down from stalactite to stalactite until she reached the bottom. She was memorized by the scale of the door. It had intriguing engravings of dragons and wizards of old time past. Dozens, maybe even a hundred creatures and people were fighting dragons. They look like hours of work was put into each character. Despite being out numbered, the dragons were flying above the ground and keeping the battle at a stalemate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is amazing.\" Cherish said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can't wait til I see the inside.\" Kabol complimented the work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A little help?\" Zerah called, unwilling to tie herself from the height she's at.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol and Cherish silently agreed to ignore her and tried to open the doors. They were heavy, but Kabol managed to open it once he stepped on a stone button on the ground. The doors slid open, hovering just above the ground. Cherish and Kabol headed inside to see the walls were carved with intricate art just like the door. Flames flickered on torches next to them, showing the detail to an almost lifelike design. Kabol looked hard at one of the creatures, a naga curled around a warring dwarf, and was able to see the veins in between the muscles and skin if he looked hard enough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Such design was impossible for anything human, or hybrid-like.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hallway poured open into an auditorium.

It's teeth were stubby, and looked as if they were used to hold prey. It's eye were a burning amber, with a glistening glare. Every step it took, the ground felt like it trembled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish didn't have feet to worry about losing hold of. Kabol lost his footing. He fell on his hands, thinking he sprained them. He checked to see if his wrists and the blades accompanying them were okay, and as he did noticed a small ladder on the wall.

She was frozen in posture and a frown grew on her face. The dragon dived it's head in and grabbed the lamia with it's blunt-toothed jaws. Her tail was sticking out, but not struggling too much, unwilling to risk getting bit in half. Her human half, however, was quite the opposite, wailing in protest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol didn't worry about her. The teeth wouldn't be able to pierce a leaf, and if she's swallow, he could just go in and get her. Instead, Kabol was more interest in the hole. He was near enough to it and tapped his foot on the ground. \"Knock, knock, you have company. I know you're in there, I can smell you.\" The hole was still dormant. Kabol added, \"It's alright, I'm not going to eat you. Speaking of which, your dragon out here is nomming on my friend, if you could do something about that... Before I do?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon scurrying was heard in the hole and out popped an anthropomorphic mouse. He was tan furred and dress in an extravagant gown. His brown hair dropped behind his shoulder and he fixed his foggy spectacles. He waved, \"Hello there, good cat, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol heard the winged lizard behind him make an almost crunching noise on the woman's scales as it tried to get a better position to gobble her up; her please becoming fainter. \"Well, there's that.\" Kabol shot a thumb behind him, \"But first, I was wondering if you could get a curse off of me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A curse? That's easy what kind?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Immortality,\" Kabol responded, hearing the soft crunch noise again, \"with a dash of intensified pain.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wizard shook his head, \"Immortality? That's going to be a bother. I do know the spell, and how to cast it, but it requires something... Unattainable.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True love?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The blood of the Naseer.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got it!\" Kabol stood up and headed towards the door. He almost skipped in joy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait your not going to ask who, or what or what?\" The wizard asked, getting used to having company.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope! I'll be back with a head of a spirit-forsaken naseer head.\" Without turning, he changed his tone, \"Cherish, quit playing with the dragon and come on, we're leaving.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mph!\" She squealed back, almost entirely consumed by the creature.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mouse ordered the dragon to let her go, calling it by the name Asmodeus. It obeyed, lowering its head and letting her roll onto the ground. She gasped for air and quickly slithered away next to Kabol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not having fun out here anymore, can we go home? Seems everywhere we go, someone is in someone else's mouth. I'm the victim most of the time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol wrapped an arm around her snakelike hips, the human half wet with dragon drool, \"When you're traveling through a gullet made of teeth, you have my permission to complain. Until then, bear with me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The duo open the doors, via a button.</span></div></div>",

So was his sleeping bag and half the food. Kabol also noticed the lack of Cherish's crossbow. He rolled his eyes, noticing the lamia's worried look.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's gone...\" Cherish stated the obvious, but it was mostly out of disbelief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can I just take a moment of contemplation to take in what we've been through?\" Kabol started to count off using his fingers, \"I got you shrunk multiple times, fun while it lasted; I've been on a slave train, literally; I've traversed lands never explored only to meet more humans, who either died or were jerks; I got eaten trying to save someone, never got a thank you; chased by vrees, almost got boiled alive, stalked, agreed to kill a magnificent beast and now our stuff is stolen. Cherish, do you want to write a book with me when we get home? Because I've yet to figure out if this is a normal story.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish was about to say something, but Kabol kicked a biscuit of bread off the ground in anger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was so close!\" He yelled, flipping off the cut rope that dangled meters in the air. There isn't enough food here to make a journey back. If he does remove his immortality, he'll starve to death.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish slithered, \"Kabol-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lady, I'm royally pissed out of my mind to the point I'm begging myself not to murder that dragon in there.\" Kabol grit his teeth.

How the hell did she get herself cut down?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol!\" Cherish screamed and wrapped herself around his body. His hands were kept out of the coils and pinned straight. He had trouble breathing. Any tighter and his ribs may start to give. Only his head stuck out from her grip. Cherish grabbed Kabol's chin, forcing him to look at her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her face was the face a disappointed mother, \"Shut up and listen to me! This whole time I've been taking crap from you, with you, and for you. You're not in this alone. We don't have food, but I can hunt. We don't have rope, but I can climb. I could go home, but I choose not to leave your hide here because we're friends; you're not alone. So quite your griping and pick up your crap.

She picked up his stuff and put it all in a bag before handing it to Kabol and tossing him on her back. She slithered up the stalagmites and stalactites. She reached the top of the cliff. She pulled Kabol off and gave him a tight hug, before tossing him on the ground. \"Okay friend,\" She began in a much more polite tone, crossing her arms, \"We could go after Zerah, get some good tasty revenge, or you and I can kill that Naseer thing and get this adventure over with.

For the first time in a long time, Kabol was excited. Excited to be with Cherish, excited to see the Naseer and excited to rid his curse. Cherish also seemed excited. She slithered fast like she had a purpose. Kabol did his best to hang on without letting his head bang into the back of hers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While on her back, he began to think of all she's been through; through all the things she put up for him. He never figured out why, be he wants to assume it isn't because she thgouth her life was on the line. It hasn't been in some time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol, for the first time in a long time, felt warm inside. He found a new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time has past. Kabol was at the base of the rocky spire. It was kilometers high. The storms covered the pinnacle. Its clouds were violet and the lightning was completely silent. Sharp rocks jut our of the sides and surrounding area. Other than that, it was completely barren. Kabol wondered what this tower was used for before the Naseer came. He wondered if the Naseer made it or if it's always been a scary, no-good, spooky-dooky horror rock with no soul since its conception.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, let's go.\" Kabol strutted towards the dark, evil spire of doom only to be tugged back. Cherish held a hard grip on his coat. Kabol looked up the arm and then straight in Cherish's eyes. She kept her glare on the rocks. Kabol hesitated, \"What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol...\" She began, \"I was wondering if we could eat together. It may be our last time together, I mean, I'm not saying we will die, but... Just in case, I want to at least have one meal with you.\" She finally looked down and met him at eye level, and with her voice almost cracking from the pressure of death asked, \"Please?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol saw what she meant and nodded. He sat against a spiky rock. The only things left are some loafs bread that's been kicked and a couple of pears from some cacti you snagged from the badlands. It's a terrible last meal, but it will do.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kabol,\" Stress intruded her voice, \"I heard about your, uhm, curse when the dragon was... Anyways, you want to rid yourself of immortality?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Kabol admitted, \"I know, it sounds stupid. It wouldn't be too bad if I didn't feel more pain than I used to. That's the worse part. A slap could feel like a blow from a hammer. A sun burn feels like actual fire. Things like that. People say immortality is a curse on it's own. Everyone you know and love will constantly die, beauty becomes a myth, and you'll spend eternity alone. But honestly, it isn't that mad. You get used to everything, and what is eternity to an immortal?\" Kabol noticed he got off track, \"It's the physical pain of this world that drives the everlasting insane. You can get eaten, crushed, stabbed, crushed, thrown around, crushed and all around you just fear large objects in general.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish finished her food while he was talking, \"That's terrible.:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not all bad I guess. I can shrink things! Oh, the look on a predators face when-\" Kabol stopped remembering Cherish's terrified face, \"I- well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cherish slithered and gave Kabol a hug, \"You're a terrifying person, you know that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kabol closed his eyes and sullied in her embrace. The warm feeling flared up again. \"Cherish,\" he began, \"Why did you stick with me all this time?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could tell you.\" Cherish smirked, \"But I won't. Not until the Naseer's dead. It's so you and I have something to look forward to.\" She hugged tighter. All of Kabol's problems felt like they melted away, \"Just makes sure I don't die.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment he thought of the idea to just give up the chase and go home with her. But he can't, not that he didn't want to, but he's sure she would never let him do that. They prepared to continue to hunt down the Naseer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A large arch of stone and spikes that looked artificially made. The stone under his feet turned to tiles.

This had to be one of his dullest jobs yet, for what it was going to pay. One would expect there to be bandits and monsters breaking coming in endless waves for a job that paid for about eight months of his living expenses. Still, here Kesh was. Sitting beside a old wooden door and making sure nobody entered the room. Suddenly, a shadow slipped across the grandfather clock. Kesh had some company.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kesh stood up and placed himself in front of the door while three shady-looking people walked down the hallway.

The girl's hood fell and she was just staring at what was left of her weapon in shock. Kesh then knocked the blade out of the door and slid it the girl.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry about your sword, but I will only give one more warning.

But Nixie is a wild card for whoever wishes to pick up on her story and I couldn't think of any other way to introduce her, so I gave you the legend of the Mermaid of Redfalls' Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Ish-Pan, the child of a succubus and a slime-nymph. Ish-Pan was once a young boy with tan skin and short white-blond hair. Now, he appears to be a young man that has ghastly white skin and straight, messy hair that seems black enough to absorb light and is sealed into a local shrine. He has been asleep for years having dreams of his best friend, first love, and the girl he forced to seal him into this prison. His seal has been broken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Nixie, the mermaid of Redfalls' Lake. \"There were once four sister's, all born of the most beautiful woman ever to live in our town of Redoak, as well the founder of this town's only four children. They were so enchanting that men would abandon their loves and wives to attempt to court one of the sisters. Eventually, the women who lost their love's eye grew envious of the sisters and planned to murder them to claim back what they had lost.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So all the women got together and arranged a party for all the women in town, making sure that the four sisters would attend, then after everyone had arrived they lured the sisters to the small stream that poured into the lake from a large cliff. The oldest of the four sister's realized their plan when she saw weapons that were in the hands of their fellow townsfolk. She got in front of her three younger sisters elongating their life by being a shield, she was gutted like a fish for attempting to stop the women. And so, The first of the sister's dropped into the stream spilling her life into the flowing water and over the cliff's edge. The second sister attempted to flee, but was quickly cut down by a woman who thought that it would be funny if the sisters who ran had their legs cleaved off. Her blood filled the stream as well. The third oldest sister pleaded for her life and had her tongue cut out and her lungs pierced with wooden stakes. Her blood flowed into the waterfall and into the lake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lastly the woman converged on the youngest of the four daughter's. Her eyes were staring into the crowd of women, they had no fear. For a girl who had not come of age, she stared at all of the women with boiling hatred she spat in the nearest woman's face and screamed at them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What good does killing four innocent girl's do? Does it make you happy? Do you think that your former loves and husbands will ever return to the woman that killed the person who stole their heart? And I swear you and your blood will join my sister's crimson blood and me in the lake.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With those harsh, painfully truthful words she jumped off the cliff and onto the rocks below. All of the woman looked over the cliff, seeing the small girl who's name was Nixie crumpled up between the rocks at the base of the cliff. Some of the women realized that what she said was true, flinging themselves over the cliffs edge. Others attempted to return to their husbands and loves, who either rejected their existence or flung themselves over the cliff in the name of love. Those poor women that were left alone joined the sister's they murdered by either jumping off the cliff or drowning themselves in the bloody water.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, after the remaining townspeople gathered and began to bury their dead they realized that the youngest of the four sister's was missing from the dead and that there small handprints and drag marks from where the youngest sister's body fell. The founder of this town, Lord Redoak looked towards the stained red water of the lake and saw a young girl with crimson hair waving at him. It was Nixie and it is said she still lives in the lake, waiting to return to land when the stained water forgets the sins of the town's people.\"</span></div></div>",

How many years since I've felt the warmth of the brightness... Too long... It's been far, far too long...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hea... -ey...\" A blurry noise began to fade into the darkness, almost like someone's voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey! Sludge fer' brains! Wake up already. It's almost noon.\" Suddenly, the endless abyss gave way to the sight of a girl. Her long blond hair and sky blue eyes sparkled in the sunlight, as well a drop of spit dangling from her mouth. It is wiggling a few inches from the end of a nose... <i>My nose.</i> A pair of arms shoot up and push the girl back, forcing her to suck the saliva back into her mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eli-Beth. I sware if you ever actually spit on me like that. I'll, I'll get a bunch of frog eggs and put It in your tea!\" A pouty voice said with a childish tone... <i>My voice... Has it... Has it really been that long?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Pan, if you ever did that I'd do it twice!\" Her voice was filled with a smug happiness and her smile gave off a overconfident radiance... <i>How I miss that snobby smile...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The darkness began to engulf the image of a girl smiling and a hand reached out trying to grab it before is faded... <i>My hand reached for the fading image.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>This darkness... I wish... I wish that I could see the light... No, I wish I could see that smile... Her smile, one last time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sliver of light split the void in two, but gave sight to a much darker scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A woman with raven back hair and near flawless body with the complexion of fresh snow bounced on a married man like a wild beast. His hair grew whiter and his skin grew paler as the woman continued to thrust her hips and moan loudly, then without any warning the man went limp. His eyes were glazed over and his face had a expression of fear and regret. This was the power of a succubus... <i>This was the power of my mom...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I thought you were gonna be a lot better than this, hun. I mean, with how loudly your dear wife screams at night I thought that you had to be great.\" She unmounted from the man's still throbbing rod and slid down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess your wife is just really sensitive. Maybe she'll be my next partner...\" She licked up the shaft of the dead man's penis and continued talking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean it's only fair that if I sleep with you I sleep with her.\" The woman then gave her new toy a kiss with her scarlet lips, a kiss that quickly turned into a throat-deep swallow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A shaking hand raised and quivered with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh... That's the night... The night I realized I wasn't human... The night... I ended that murderous monster... The night I forced Elisabeth to seal me away... I miss her so much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hand quivered as it curled into a fist of sheer fury. Everything grew warm... My blood was boiling. A leg... No, My leg... kicked open the door and my mother spun around. My fist slammed straight in between her two large breast... The blood... Her blood had already begun to dribble down her skin... Yet her look of surprise only grew into a twisted smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see you finally found out. Good. You should know that this is what we are.\" She paused and looked at the fist embedded in her chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you are more than this. Not only are you my son. You are also that beautiful dryad's son.\" She coughed up some blood with a chuckle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your other mother was a very unique monster. She was half slime, half dryad, and the only being to last long enough to impregnate me.\" This time she laughed like she had no worries.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only one out of millions of beings I've killed in my immortal lifetime, what a funny thought.\" She just stared at me and continued to smile with her twisted red lips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I got so mad. I wanted to scream at her. I wanted to beat her until she couldn't do this to anyone ever again... <i>I wanted to kill her...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I lifted my arm away from her chest and punched. And punched. And punched. I didn't stop punching, until I couldn't feel my arms. They were so numb...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm immortal, remember? You can't kill a immortal being unless you erase their entire body from existence, silly boy.\" Her smile hadn't faded and blood was pouring from her mouth and the small hole in her chest. I looked at my hands... they were so mangled they looked more like mauled strips of flesh than hands... My body had become goo-like, I had lost the stability of my physical from attacking her so brutally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hated her... I hated her so much... She just murdered my friend's father... My best friend's father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The torn flesh...<i> My flesh...</i> Had become red sludge. The goo had began to move on it's own leaking into the hole in her chest... I knew it was going to destroy her heart, but I let it... I felt as the heart began to melt...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I killed my mother by throwing her into a pool of holy water... She suffered dearly for murdering my best friend and his family... I guess... Like mother, Like son...\" With that the last of her heart sank into the sludge that had turned pitch black... <i>I had turned pitch black...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I remember... I remember the pain and rage I felt... My mother had always told me that murder was the ultimate sin... Yet she lived murder... No, she was born to murder... I can remember everything that happened after my mother died... It's such a blur...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>After my body returned to normal I ran... I ran straight to my best friend... Elizabeth... I told her everything... She just stared in horror... I had changed... My skin looked like it had never seen the sun and my hair had grown long and was stained black... She was two years older than me and I towered over her by at least a foot... I could never return to my old life... I ran to our favorite spot... A old rock...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I was crying... Elizabeth followed me... She never said anything until she gave me a strange piece of paper... She told me it was the only way I would find peace... A witch-made sealing talisman... The next part happened so slowly... It hurt so much... My heart hurt so much...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pan. I'm sorry about your mother.\" Elisabeth had a sad look on her face normally enthusiastic face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eli-Beth, I'm really sorry about your dad.\" I could hear the words escaping my mouth, but it wasn't my voice... <i>It sounded like my mother's...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elisabeth placed the talisman on the rock and muttered something under her breath. It began to glow along all the strange symbols and so did I. I had already began to vanish.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Elizabeth! I have liked you for a really long time.\" The words flew out of my mouth, I couldn't help them. She ran up and embraced my disappearing form, tears were streaming down her face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've known that for a long time Ish-Pan, I've had the same feelings for you.\" With a smooch the world turned black... <i>How I miss my old life...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A rust red head popped out of the pond. Carefully looking around, the slime searched for threats. Seeing only a couple of birds and a squirrel, she climbed the rest of the way out. Standing up she stretched, her body distorting before snapping back into the shape of a slender young woman. Cautiously she walked towards the abandoned castle. Her caution was not with out cause. Once a wandering troll had caught her on the castle grounds and had smashed her with a hammer. While it hadn't really hurt, a slime's being being tied to an almost indestructible gem rather than their gelatinous outer bodies, it had forced her to spend days hiding in her pond recuperating. Frankly she didn't really need to stay at this castle. She could easily drain her pond and search for a new place to live. But she stayed here.<br>\r\nSlimes lived by absorbing and discharging liquids, as evidenced by the damp footprints that she left. But they could acquire a taste for other things. Some slimes loved jewels, ending up in treasuries and dragon hordes. Others became fond of paper and ink, their moist bodies becoming the bane of libraries. This particular slime loved metals. She had been minding her own business, at the river were she lived with other slimes, when someone started scooping them up into bottles. A day later and a bump in the road found her sitting outside this castle. She had found the pond to soak in and regain her strength. Then she had gone exploring. And found it. Rusted armor and tarnished swords lay scattered around the castle. At first she had only looked, wondering what they were. Then curiosity got the better of her and she put the rusted tip of a knife in her mouth. Now every piece last piece of arms in the castle gleamed and her body had turned into the color of the rust she had consumed. She loved cleaning, and loved even more the taste of a clean metal blade, or a polished breastplate.<br>\r\nShe froze in place at the sound of heavy footsteps. Panicked she looked around for a place to hide before diving into a suit of armor, squeezing her body through the open visor. Reorienting herself, she peeped through the visor, then held very still as someone came into view.<br>\r\n\"So how long has this castle been abandoned?\" The slime heard a woman's voice coming from the boots in front of her.<br>\r\n\"It's hard to tell,\" A man's voice replied. \"Given that monsters tend to end up in places like these, the upkeep and decay can be fairly erratic. Some creatures have almost a compulsion to maintain their living space.\" The man had musical accent. \"Others do the opposite and take pleasure in destroying their surroundings.\"<br>\r\nA low gruff voice spoke up. \"So what has been living here.\"<br>\r\n\"What ever it is, it definitely does some cleaning.\" The woman said. \"Look at the shine on this blade.\" The soft rasp of metal on stone echoed through the hall. With a start, the slime sat up, completely forgetting that she was hiding. They were touching her metal!<br>\r\n\"Look out!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorcery!\"<br>\r\nThe slime looked around, confused by the shouting. At one end of the hall she say two men, one elf and one dwarf drawing their weapons. Then she saw a human woman holding a sword. It was one of her favorites, a long bladed hand and a half sword with a hilt wrapped in bronze wire. And that woman had it. The slime thought she said something, she must have because the woman started and tossed the sword at her. While the slime juggled the sword, the human rushed her. The slime reacted. The sword hilt fell neatly into one hand. The other hand lashed out, armored knuckles smashing into the woman's brow.<br>\r\n\"Anne!\" The slime whirled around. The human's companions looked on in shock as the woman dropped cold. There was a moment of indecision as they decided wither or not to attack what they saw as an animate suit of armor Then a roar filled the castle. A roar of the kind everyone recognized. \"Troll!\" The dwarf yelled, \"Run!\"<br>\r\nThe slime didn't want to tangle with the troll again. But at the same time, she knew would happen to the woman if she got left there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wondering what she was doing, the slime grabbed the unconscious woman by the shoulders and dragged her towards the a staircase. The entrance hall was the only place the troll could get to inside. If she stayed quite, the troll shouldn't notice her. Still she held very still. As the trolls heavy footsteps shook the castle. She heard the troll huff and puff, as it looked around the room. The woman, Anne, stirred.<br>\r\n\"Hnn,\" The slime clamped her hand over Anne's mouth, \"Shh!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm!\" Anne quickly woke up and struggled in the armored slime's grip. \"Hmmm!'<br>\r\n\"Troll!\" The slime hissed. At that Anne froze. Everyone knew better than to take a troll without a trained squad. A massive foot planted itself at the base of the stairs. The slime knew from experience that the troll couldn't reach up the stairs. That wouldn't stop it from trying to go through the wall if it thought something was there. The foot stayed there for a minute, before a load noise echoed through out the castle. Then the troll stomped away. The two females gagged at the stench of the trolls fart. At the slime's signal the human followed her up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne followed the strange creature into an empty room, were it drew the moth eaten drapes aside from an arrow hole and peeked. The armor was smallish. More suited to woman or boy than a grown knight. In her mind, animated armor would explain the pristine condition of the weapons in the castle. \"Excuse me. Sir Armor?\"<br>\r\n\"Who?\" The creature turned around. \"Oh do you mean me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Anne said, \"Can you tell me what manner of sorcery animates you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorcery? What are you talking about?' Genuine confusion emanated from the suit. \"Oh! I'm still wearing this.\" The armor reached up and fiddled with something at its neck before removing the helmet. Anne looked on in shock as the rust red head of the slime was revealed. \"Hi!\"<br>\r\n\"You're a slime? What are you doing in that armor?\"<br>\r\n\"Hiding from you.\" The slime said like it was obvious. \"You're Anne right? Sorry for hitting you. I just didn't want you touching my metal.\"<br>\r\n\"Buh wha?' Anne stuttered. \"<i>Your</i> metal?\"<br>\r\n\"Well I live here, and no one else was taking care of it. So, my metal.\"<br>\r\nAnne rubbed her temple. If framed from a slime's point of view she supposed it made perfect sense. \"Do you... Wait, what's your name anyway?\" The slime responded with a complicated series of burbles. Anne couldn't even begin to remember what the slime just said let alone try to pronounce it. \"I can't say that. Can I just call you...\" She cast around for a name, before settling on a color. \"Rusty. Can I call you Rusty?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Rusty, then. Do you really need all this metal?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, no.\" The newly named Rusty answered. \"And it isn't really all that safe taking care of it with that troll coming in and out.\"<br>\r\n\"So would it be okay if me and my partners took some of it with us?\"<br>\r\nRusty thought about it for a moment. She didn't really need all this metal. The armor and that sword would be enough, now that she thought about it. \"Were your partners that elf and dwarf? Because they took off when they heard the troll.\"<br>\r\n\"Those bastards left me for dead?!\" Anne could actually believe it, unfortunately. Neither of those males were the finest examples of their respective races. \"I suppose they took the cart with them.\"<br>\r\n\"Cart?\" Rusty looked thoughtful. \"Big wooden box with wheels, right? I know were there's one. We can use it to take the metal with us.\"<br>\r\n\"You have a cart? That's great! Wait,\" Anne stopped and went over what Rusty just said, \"What do you mean by us?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you of course. If your gonna take all my metal, there's no real reason for me to stay here.\" Rusty started for the stairs, \"And I'm starting to get tired of always running from that troll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the small cart was loaded up with weapons and armor. Anne and Rusty looked upon their handy work with pride. Until Anne noticed something, \"What's going to pull the cart.\"<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Rusty, her head once more covered by the helmet, stepped into the harness. Anne looked on doubtfully. Rusty was shorter than than the human. She didn't think the small slime could pull the loaded cart. She was wrong. Without any visible effort Rusty pushed against the harness and pulled the cart out of the castle with Anne following.</span></div></div>",
