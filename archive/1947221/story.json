Such as someone having a great ability with water magic but still knowing how to use lower level earth magic.<br>\r\nThere are currently 3 branches of the MAS; located in England, the United States, and also Japan. Where your character goes is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease leave a review, and before you leave a bad one realize this is my first attempt at a story.</td>",
