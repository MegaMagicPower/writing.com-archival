Omen thought as he ran in this dream that wasn't a dream and as he ran thinking this a crackling, thunderous, and decaying voice as if the being that made this voice had just rose from a fresh grave called out to him. The booming dead sounding voice formed from everywhere and nowhere all at the same time calling out to omen by name as if it had always known him and watched over him his whole life. The voice screamed a warning to him as parent or loved one would scream a warning, \"Run Omen my little one run away or they will catch you. They will catch you and take you and they mustn't or they will bind you, seal you, and take away what you are run and be wary they hunt your trail once more,\" boomed the dead sounding voice then a second similar voice joined the first and together they started to chant, \" be swift and wary in this hunt for the hunted must make the hunter the hunted and the hunted must become the hunter. Be swift for you must find us to do so seek your name sake seek the great omen.\" At hearing these last words omen realized only to late he had stopped as the creatures that had been chasing him bit down one on each of his hands. Biting him, branding him, and marking him for what he was and as this happened Omen heard a voice in his head a voice similar yet different than the others tell him, \"Omen, listen and listen well you are soon going to start to change and learn about what the world is really like all that you know will be tested and you shall learn much some will enchant you, some will frighten you, some you will know from your dreams,  and some will make you wish it was all a dream but it isn't it is all very real and very dangerous so stay strong and search for us we all wait.\" At hearing this Omen sat bolt upright wide awake screaming in a cold sweat after starting to calm down Omen thought, \"Ok it was just a dream,\" and then he looked at his hand and on the back of each one is a unique colorful symbol tattooed into his flesh and at seeing this a scream left omens throat that dwarfed every scream he had ever made before. Unknown to Omen at seeing the two symbols tattooed into his hands one on the right hand the blood red sun the symbol of vampires and strength and the left hand the sky blue moon the symbol of werewolves and steath had caused the third symbol to form turning his irises blood red symbol of the liche and wisdom and the begin of many more changes.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Omen Dranic, a young ten year olds life is changed forever when one night he is attacked by two creatures that have been hunting him since the day he was born. Omen, who is two in one and knows nothing of his past or what he is. Since Omen was young all he saw in his dreams were horrors of the darkest sort the type that made him wake screaming and ready to fight, ready to kill. He didn't know himself Omen didn't know his own secrets,didn't know he was hunted, and he didn't know he was a spliced or that the world of horrible and wonderful fantasy and science he saw ever time he closed his eyes was real. But on this night starts his journey to find himself. What he truly is and what he is to become for to save not just himself but all of blice the world that overlaps earth the world veiled to the human eye.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                            ground rules <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           1. no time jumps he is ten he has a life make it grow and unfold.<br>\r\n           2. he is a hybrid werewolf, vampire, and liche (though the only things such as his slightly pointed ear's, his strange appetite, or his strangest thing and unknown to him his complete lack of a heart beat that give away that he isn't fully human.)<br>\r\n           3. Blice is a fantasy and scifi wonderland and nightmare if you can think of it good or evil it has probably happened and been disguised as a natural or wartime disaster. Such as when a thundergod got pissed off at his brother and destroyed half of japan they said it was a bomb.<br>\r\n           4. no sex.<br>\r\n           5. there is only one spliced (spliced are demi-god level in power when fully mature at 18.)<br>\r\n           6. monsters, demons, golems, weres, kitsunes, and creatures of scifi and fantasy if you can think of it exists in blice. ( But please be reasonable nothing like a dragon living in a city park. A golem as an art statue in a museum, a vampire as a nighttime  tollbooth operator, or a flesh golem pretending to be a hospital patient is all ok and other similar things.)<br>\r\n           7. stick to the plot and the plot is that he is searching for his past and at the same time find his future.<br>\r\n           8. yes omen can change to a were form it looks like a pitch black human shape that sucks in light and leave all who see it knowing what they face is not fully mortal. ( Omen's were form is extremely powerful and very dangerous to both his opponent and himself Omen's were form need's three unique artifacts called the dur' o' deem toot or jewels of blood ashes that have been hidden away and an amulet he has had for as long as he remembers. it is called the furs' o' hi' duuth or necklace of the dead. </td>",
