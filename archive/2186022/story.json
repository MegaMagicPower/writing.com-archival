Even though it seems exciting to most (sarcasm) you have always inspired to become something more fulfilling and creative. So, one day you arrive home from your busy day at the office. Tired and ready to just sit alone in your single apartment to enjoy an evening of tv dinner. But to your surprise a package is at your door in which you open to see a letter from your mother that reads *found some of your old things was wondering if you wanted them.  Love mom*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take it inside and search through the junk. One thing you find that sticks out to you is your old game system and a harvest Moon game. With nostalgia on your mind you begin to plugin and play. \"The message comes on the screen in typical harvest moon game fashion that reads (are you ready to quit your job and become a farmer)\". In which you say yes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sucked into the world of Harvest moon. Being confused and very scared you look around at your new environment to see a little guy thing with a pointy hat that greets you. Thinking that this guy was crazy you shoved him away from you trying to get forward. This angry the sprite and he decided to shrink you and then he teleport you out of his sight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you end up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
