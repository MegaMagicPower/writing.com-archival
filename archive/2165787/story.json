It is actually a true story of my neighbour because I just can not make things up, I don't know why but I just can't write anything but reality)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man woke up and walked into a room. He picked up a jacket reflectively.<br>\r\nIt was the jacket that the love of his life had gifted to him on their anniversary. It still carried her scent from the recent time he had hugged her despite her indifference to him.<br>\r\nNow she was gone. She had deserted him solely because she was now wealthier than him and felt no need for him.<br>\r\nHe was a cool Muslim guy so kind and gentle and despite the fact that she and him had had a hot love affair before marriage, yet she still fell out of love and separated from him for no reason whatsoever.<br>\r\nExcept that she is being paid a salary higher than her husband and so thinks she is independent of men. She seems to have eyes on other men and unsuccessfully tried to attract my hubby.<br>\r\nI see the guy walking into an empty desolate house, heartbroken and unable to understand what went wrong. He had been married to her for a decade now yet she had begun showing the cold shoulder much earlier and slept in separate rooms for months with him unable to do anything about it.<br>\r\nHe gave her such expensive anniversary gifts but nothing seemed to make her love him as madly and passionately as she did before they were married. <br>\r\nIt makes me more convinced that premarital love affairs and fornication since it is forbidden by God is what leads to heartbreak and unhappy couples. <br>\r\nI see a man, my neighbour suffering in melancholic solitude and the wife lives in a separate house probably equally messed up. </span></div></div>",
