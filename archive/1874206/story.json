You guys are going to have so much fun\" As your mom says this your jaw literally drops \"I don't need a babysitter, I'm 15 for fucks sake!!!\" \"Peter Joseph Handlemen! How dare you use that type of language, just for that he'll be staying over the whole time!\" With that she slams the door and you curse yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my big mouth...\" You head outside to wave your parents goodbye and check the mail. Your parents drive off without even noticing you, and as you look into the mailbox you notice a package. \"Strange I didn't order anything..\" You take it out and look at the address and notice its for your creepy next door neighbor \"I should really go give this to him, but I wonder what kind of stuff he buys\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside your living room you tear open the package and see it's nothing but a small remote, similar to a remote start for a car \"Haha I wonder if I can mess with him a bit and start his car from here\". You head over to the window and aim the remote at the car, press the green button and.......nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I guess he has to register it to his car or AHHHHHHHH!!!\" You suddenly feel like you are falling, and falling the sensation was way to much and you eventually pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only awake because of a loud booming sound \"YO PETER, IT'S ME MARK\" \"Mark what the fuck are you yelling fo.....\" You trail off as you see Mark enter your house, he's unbelievably huge. Still trying to pice together what happened to you, you just stand there in shock and watch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER?\" He starts scanning the room, \"MAYBE HE'S UPSTAIRS, OH ALMOST FORGOT\" He bends down and slips his well worn vans off his feet. Your parents had a \"no shoes on the carpet\" rule. Once he's done he stands there for a moment and wiggles his socked toes, you can see fog forming around his feet on the tile from the heat and sweat and the smell was horrible! Mark usually had bad foot odor but nothing like this!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER, YOU UPSTAIRS?\" He calls out and begins to walk to the stairs...right where you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if you couldn't feel him or see him the smell would've told you how close he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow comes over you and you snap back to reality \"Oh fuck\" you try to get out of the way but are just too slow to avoid Marks giant sweaty foot and get stuck right underneath his gigantic toes. You're trapped in sweaty, hot, rank darkness with the weight of a giant teen bearing down on you. Fortune did smile on you, however, for the simple fact that Mark and incredibly sensitive feet and immediately felt something lodged underneath his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasps whatever you with his toes to hold you in place and raises his sole so he can inspect it. You look out and stare at him....holy fuck he's huge. Your thoughts are interrupted by Mark's booming voice \"PETER? IS THAT YOU? HOW DID YOU GET SO TINY AND WHY ARE YOU UNDER MY FOOT?\" \"I don't know why I'm small and you stepped on me!!\" You yell up at him, but his face indicates he cannot understand you. \"HANG ON LITTLE GUY\" he takes one enormous hand and grabs your tiny form, everything is happening so fast it's disorienting but before you know it you're right in front of his giant youthful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW WHAT DID YOU SAY LITTLE GUY?\" \"I said I don't know how I shrunk I used that key chain thing by the window!\" Mark looks over to the window and spots the device, he walks over and with one hand picks it up. \"THIS THING?\" \"Yeah don't touch it, it'll shrink you too!!\" He either can't hear you or doesn't want to, he keeps looking the device over until one of his fingers brush against the red button and zaps himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK\" he exclaims as he realizes just what he's done. Soon he'll be as small as you are and will probably get squashed or eaten by a mouse but the shrinking feeling he expects never comes, in fact the room seems to be getting a little smaller...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully he doesn't forget about little ol' you, his babysitting charge, after he finally stops growing when the ceiling and walls begin to crack ever so slightly. He points the remote at you, and holds the button down until you're back to regular size, which means you only come up to his ankle or somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare in horror and awe at the gigantic socked foot in front of you, its odor now filling up the entire house as the toes inside of it wiggle and spread a bit underneath the dirty gray cotton, Mark is eyeing the remote with a smirk and a glint of mischief in his eyes never present before. You hear his voice from beyond the wall of yellowed cotton say, \"You better get outta here lil dude, things are gonna get intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean Mark!? Please don't destroy my house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its too late, the giant socked foot has already started to enlarge before you as Mark grunts and groans at the cramped feeling he's getting from your puny house which soon will burst outward from his massive bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush outside, or rather, you have no other choice because Mark's malodorous foot pushes you through the door and you are knocked unconscious. So you do not witness the destruction of your house nor do you see the giant Mark stand up and continue growing until he's a whopping 60 ft. in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing is for sure, this stinky footed skater teen has mischief on his mind as he sets out to get revenge on all those who wronged him in the past...</span></div></div>",

He looks down at the rubble by, on, and around his feet. \"I-I'm a fucking giant\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts memories started flooding back, not good memories either. Memories of being tossed in a dumpster, being shoved in a locker, being kicked, spit on....the more he remembers the angrier he becomes until one memory becomes burned into his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast week in the locker room, three jocks help him down while their leader the \"alpha jock\" Kevin made Mark lick and sniff his feet...He glances down at his feet a second time and wiggles his toes in his surprisingly still sweaty socks and catches a wiff of his own foot odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, let's see how much you like MY feet Kev....\" With that he starts walking off to Kevins house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks through town the ground shakes before him and he leaves sweaty foot prints in the cracked asphalt in his wake. People stare and cars stop or swerve trying to avoid the boy's giant feet. \"This is pretty cool\" about halfway to Kev's house he spots one of his only true friends: David. David was a skater like Mark but he was into more geeky stuff. He always had his head in a book and almost never spoke unless spoken to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that didn't save him from being bullied. Having gotten; attomic wedges, made to sniff the jocks pitts, or like Mark made to worship his feet, it's safe to say he could also use some revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a bookworm he was so engrossed in his book he never felt or heard the giant Mark approach until he smelled something. \"Ugh what's that sm...MARK?!\" \"HAHA YUP, IT'S ME DAVID. LISTEN STAND STILL\". He wasn't given much choice for Mark had already shot David with the growth ray, and kept growing him until he reached Mark's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude this is awesome! How did you do this? Where did you get that? Where are-\" Mark put his hand over David's mouth, \"Shhhhh C'mon there's a certain little jock who's begging to smell our feet\" And with that they stomped off towards Kevin's house</span></div></div>",

Eagerly they surrounded the house, their toes wiggling in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark reached down and ripped the roof right off the frame of the house, as fortune would have it Kevin's room was in the attic so within seconds of the roof being torn off the house he woke up. The last thing he expected to see was the two wimps he picked on utterly gigantic and towering over his house.....but there they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kevin, do you remember the time you had me and David worship your feet? Well we you to show some love to ours, though it'll be a much bigger job HAHAHA\" David reaches down and unties his sneakers, he smiles as he can smell his foot odor and blushes a bit as he realizes so can Mark. \"Hey don't worry about it, I kinda like it and plus the more our feet stink the more HE loves it. Isn't that right Kev?\" Mark and David then both bring up one sweaty smelly socked foot and on the count of three bring them down into Kevin's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's eyes bugged out when he saw 2 giant sweaty socked feet push themselves into his house. \"Fuck this\" He said as he goes to try and escape the giant feet. The thought that his family will also be crushed dosn't even cross his mind, nor does it faze him when he does think about it. \"Better them then me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
