You only picked the worst sport in High school to try and become popular: however your plan backfired when the coach said you would be the water boy. Being the water boy you have to wash the teams uniforms, jockstraps, and the equipment. Since you are the water boy it gives the players an excuse to torment and bully you. Today was the last game of the season, and you knew the players were going to torture you before and after the game. You thought back to the first game of the season when the coach told you that you were going to be the water boy, and you thought back to the sadistic faces the players showed when they heard that. During the game while you were filling up the water bottles one of the players sat his ginormous butt on you, and farted making you smell it until the coach told him to get in and take the centers place. You thought to yourself I hope that doesn't happen again. Well you were wrong. After your team won the game the coach told the team to hit the showers and for you to go wash the teams uniforms, and he went to his office and left for the night, leaving your with the players. When you walked out of the coach's office the players had all stripped naked and threw their dirty jockstraps at you, and said they want them to smell minty fresh, and if their not this will happen to you everyday after practice and the games. Before you knew what was going on, the player grabbed you and sat on you with his hairy globes. You were stuck in his crack and he farted making you smell it up. You took his warning to heart and didn't mess with anything. You weren't picked on all year until when you washed their jockstraps and as a prank put Nare hair remover in the crotch area and put itching powder in their pants that why you knew you were going to be tortured. An hour before the game the players started arriving, and put their jockstraps and pants on before realizing what you did. You started running when one of them spotted you, and told his friend to grab you.</span></div></div>",

You start to move away from Donovan in case he decides to sit down near there. The last thing you want to do is be trapped under a giant man's ass, right? You get a short distance down the bench when you feel something heavy coming down on your body. You look up and you realize that this hot jock had just thrown his boxer briefs down on top of you. You struggle frantically to free yourself from the fabric, but before you even begin to move, you feel the world shift around you, and before you know what's happening, you see a massive foot enter the fabric on either side of you, and you look up just in time to see yourself heading up toward his crotch. You scramble and try to run, but that was probably a mistake, because when the fabric reaches his body, you find yourself wedged between this beautiful man's ass cheeks, face to face with his hole. But you soon lose sight of that, as he pulls up his jeans, and sits down, pressing you tight up against his sweaty rectum... He stands up after a short while, and you're rubbed relentlessly between his cheeks as he walks home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every fibre of your being tells you to try and escape, every last one, but a tiny voice telling you that for now Donovan doesn't know you're there. If you start moving he might notice you. It's a little voice of reason that keeps your body as still as possible. As Donovan keeps walking the cheeks on either side keep rubbing over your body, slowly covering your entire body with ass-sweat, which makes it actually better as the skin slides easier over you. The smell reminds you of your job as equipment manager and you can manage, however... the tast is something else. At first you think it's gross, being forced to tast a man's ass-sweat, but as Donovan keeps walking you notice it's actually not that bad as you imagined. Sure it's no ice-cream sundae. But it reminds you a bit of some bittersweet candy, but with a salty kick. Suddenly Donovan makes a sharp turn and he starts going up some stairs. You try to remember what you know, you remember Donovan being an orphan and living in the schools dorms. A building full of single studios, because the school believes that everyone deserves privacy and should not be hindered by the schedule of a room-mate. Finally Donovan arrives at his place and you hear him open the door. You hear him drop his bag and next you feel yourself fall as he suddenly sits down. \"What the?\" you hear him say. And suddenly he gets up again and before you know it you are being pulled out of your position and dangle upside down, with your legs between his fingers as he lifts you to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, dude?\" Donovan looks shocked, \"What are you doing in my briefs?\" Still hanging upside down you stutter \"S... So... Sorry D.. Don... Donovan, it was an a.. acci...accident.\" Donovan lowers you to his other hand and drops you, so you can sit up. \"An accident?\" You nod and explain what happened. Donovan listens to your story and by the end he can't hold his laughter. \"Oh, man, I'm sorry about that.\" He places you on a his desk and turns fetches a can of soda for himself and pours some of it in a bottlecap for you. He sits down at his desk and watches you gulp down the soda to rinse your mouth. \"So, how much do you hate your task?\" You look up and blink, Donovan smiles gently though. \"A lot.\" you admit, \"But at least it makes me part of a sportsteam and let's me stay in school.\" THis time Donovan blinks, \"WHat do you mean?\" you shrug, \"If I'm not on a sportsteam I'll get kicked out.\" Donovan shakes his head, \"But why would you pick basketball, I mean, of all sports, this is the one with tall man like me, probably the biggest size difference of all.\" You grin faintly, \"Because it's the one sport I imagine I never get put out in the field to be stomped on, because putting me in would be virtually useless and the amount of players on the team is to small to risk losing one over me.\" Donovan nods at your explanation, \"That actually makes sense. But still, I've seen you after practice, dragging the dirty towels around and even worse, the jockstraps. I'm surprised you get things done.\" You shrug again, \"To be honest, I don't do everything myself, most of the time coach helps out after an hour or so. He's pretty cool, but knows about the rule and keeps up appearances.\" Donovan fishes out his phone from his pocket. \"Need me to send coach a message about how you accidently ended up in... my gymbag?\" You nod, \"If you would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan types the message and a few seconds later his phone buzzes. and he reads. \"Okay, thanks for letting me know, be gentle. C.\" He tops of your bottlecap again and leans back giving you a view of just how tall he is. \"So... since your here, How's your math?\" You grin, \"A+\" DOnvan grabs his bag and takes out some books. \"Great, cause I need some help with one of the equations.\" As he opens his book and starts looking, you are a bit weirded out by what's happening. This tall titan is asking you for help? But as soon as he found the problem and you climb onto the book to help him out, you almost forget about the size difference. Soon the two of you are so involved in math, you don't even notice how close his face hovers over you. Or the fact his breath is really warm. \"So if A equals B than C x D equals A and the answer is A = 37?\" You grin and hold up your palm, \"Correct, high six.\"Donovan answers your high five with a single touch of his indexfinger. \"Thanks man, I was stuck on that all weekend. You're not so bad a tutor.\" You blush slightly, but realise Donovan won't notice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there is a knock at the door, when Donovan gets up to answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

And he pushes past Donovan. \"Where is he?\" Donovan looks a bit baffled but points at the desk and coach comes over. He raises one of his eyebrows as he sees you standing on the math-book and the notes Donovan took. \"You're tutoring him?\" you nod, \"On math?\" you nod again. \"That's good, his grade was slipping almost enough for me to have to bench him.\" Coach puts down somehing next to you and you see it's you bag. Donovan walks over and chuckles, \"What did you think coach, I'd have eaten him or something.\" Coach gives him a scowl, \"Don't joke about that Donovan, it happens more than you think. And other stuff too.\" Donovan gulps, but coach continues, \"But I'm glad to see you did put in some time for the team.\" he gives you a wink. \"Maybe if you keep tutoring this lazy-ass, and maybe some others, I can take you of equipment duty and still tell the principal you are a valueable part of the team. What are your best subjects.\" You cringe, \"Erm, well... I have...\" you drop your voice, \"Straight A's.\" Coach grins, and Donovan's eyes open wide. \"Figures, that's why princy had to resort to some archaic rule of forcing you to compete in a sports or he wouldn't be able to kick you out.\" he nods, \"Good, that's settled, I'll compile a list of players that need some tutoring and I'll probably let you do it in my office after practice to keep an eye on them. At least until you tell me you trust them enough to take it outside.\" After that coach leaves again and you and Donovan are alone again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returns to the desk and looks down, \"What did coach mean by other stuff happening?\" You shrug, \"Well, things like what happened earlier today by accident, but on purpose.\" Donovan laughs, \"Coach thought I'd shove you down my pants?\" You laugh with him and answer, \"Well, to be completely honest... you did.\" Donovan laughs again, \"Touch\u00e9. But there are people that do that on purpose?\" You shrug, \"Like coach says, it happens more that you think.\" You point at his phone, \"Use your search engine and type in microphelia.\" Donovan starts typing and a second later he gasps. \"over 1000 hits?\" he clicks comething and gasps, these man are abusing tinies to lick their feet?\" he clicks again, \"Here's one of them tossing multiple tinies down their pants.\" once more he clicks, \"Gross, a tiny in a toilet?\" His next video makes him put his phone down.\"Eating tinies? Who comes up with this stuff?\" you shrug. \"Well, a lot of people apparantly, at least a 1000.\" Donovan grins at that. \"So do you like those things?\" You shake your head and answer a bit too soon, \"Not really, but it pays quite well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan blinks, \"You made movies like this?\" You try to think of a smart answer, but can't, \"A few.\" Donovan grins, \"Can we google those?\" You shake your head, \"I'm not giving you anymore.\" Donovan grins some more, \"Fine I won't google, but at least tell me what kind.\" You sigh, \"Some ass-play and pit-play.\" Donovan chuckles, \"I hope it was with a hot woman?\" You shrug, \"Not really, yousaw the videos, and macrophiles are predominanatly male.\" Donovan chuckles \"You licked a guys ass for cash?\" you nod, \"Yes, you know, we have something in common?\" Donovan looks interested, \"I'm an orphan too and let me tell you, school is not cheap for someone without a grant.\" Donovan gasps, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" He thinks a bit, \"So that's why you're trying so hard to stay in school?\" You nod. \"I have to graduate, so I can get a nice normal job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan thinks some more and suddenly asks \"So is that the reason you weren't freaked out too much by being stuck in my underwear?\" you give a slight nod, \"I've had worse.\" Donovan chuckles.\"I guess that explains why you never complain about the smell of the towels and stuff.\" Again you nod and add, \"Well and the fact that my whole life is spent amongst people's sweaty feet.\" Donovan grins again. \"I never thought of that,\" He leans back a bit and seems to think, but suddenly he leans forward again and points at another math problem. Which you help him solve and several others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Donovan suddenly gets up and stretches. \"Ugh, it's getting late and I'm getting hungry.\" He looks down. \"So you want me to take you home, or do you want to stay for dinner? I have enough for me, but I guess I could spare a bite for you.\"</span></div></div>",

Donovan walks over to his small kitchenette, gets a meal from the fridge and pops it in the microwave. five minute later he comes back with a plate of pasta for him self and some mushed pasta on a small saucer for you. \"Sorry, I don't have plates or spoons in your size.\" You climb on the saucer and walk to the cheesy pasta. As you wait for it to cool you see Donovan starting to eat. Slowly and deliberately he fills his spoon, blows on it and stuffs it in his mouth, thoroughly chewing before swallowing. After a little while you touch the food in front of you and as it has cooled enough to touch you slowly grab a but in your hand and start eating yourself. After a few bites you glance up and see Donovan looking down at you as you keep eating. Suddenly he says, \"It's really hard to picture someone as \"ordinary\" as you being involved in porn. No offence.\" you look up, \"None taken.\" you keep eating and Donovan takes a few bites too. \"So, did you enjoy it?\" You llok up and sigh, \"It was just work, I didn't really enjoy it, but than again, it wasn't the worst thing.\" Donovan whistles softly, \"You didn't hate licking guys?\" you shrug, \"I worked with \"professionals\", they actually treated me fine behind the camera's, taking some time to get to know each other, easing me into learning their smell. It's actually pretty boring most of the time.\" Donovan chews his food lost in thought. \"So knowing someone's smell makes it less bad?\" You nod, \"of course, think of it as eating some smelly food, like blue cheese the first time. At first the smell makes you not want to eat it, but than you eventually taste it and you actually find out that something that smells horrible, doesn't mean it tastes awfull and you actually start to like the smell.\" Donovan nods, \"I like blue cheese.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finish almost at the same time. Donovan leans back and belches. \"So you didn't hate to lick someone's pits?\" you get a feeling you realise what Donovan is thinking. So you shrug and answer honestly, \"Most of the time no, except those times they made them extra sweaty or the giant put on deodorant.\" Donovan chuckles, \"I can imagine that would make it worse, but still, I can't imagine licking someone's pits.\" You chuckle too, \"But you can imagine someone licking yours?\" Donovan thinks on it for a second. \"Well, yeah, I guess I can see how making someone lick an intimate place like your pits could feel good. I mean it would be a bit like someone sucking your cock I suppose. Having them be submissive in a certain way. But I can't think of anyone who would be tough enough to handle my pits without gagging.\" You laugh to yourself, \"So what was the worst you ever did? must be licking someone's ass, right?\" you chuckle, \"Nope, not even close, most of the time licking ass was easier than licking someone's pits.\" Donovan grins, \"You're joking.\" you shake your head. \"I guess the worst would have to be the one time we did the shower scene.\" Donovan leans in a bit. \"Shower scene?\" You nod. \"I played the role of the sponge.\" Donovan's eyes widen for a second and next he burst into laughter. \"That sounds awfull, but also pretty funny.\" you grin back, \"It paid a lot of bills, and it wasn't so bad the first two times, but the third time they did a prison scene, with five giants passing me around.\" Donovan laughs even harder. \"Haha, okay, now you must be joking.\" You sigh, \"Promise never to tell anyone?\" he nods \"Type in: Deathrow tiny clean-up.\" Donovan grabs his phone and types it in. \"Seconds later the awfull music of bad porn comes out of his phone and he looks for a while, forwarding a bit and suddenly he grins. \"It really is you, and there really are five of them.\" he skips to the end, where you remember being left in the drain, gasping for breath. \"Wow, those guys where rough, I can imagine it was bad.\" You chuckle, \"It was worse than it looks, the problem was that to shoot the thing we spent almost six days in those showers to get all the shots. one with every guy seperately and one of them with them passing me around or the scenes where they scrubbed each other with me. The normal shower scene's only took a few hours.\" Donovan gasps, \"six days of being scrubbed on those guys. Damn, I mean if I take a really long shower it would take what, an hour max?\" you grin, \"That wouldn't even make me break a sweat by now.\" Donovan smiles, \"I can hardly believe that. I mean I can't imagine how it must be for someone as small as you to be rubbed over a body like mine. Also the thought of having a human as a washcloth sounds just crazy?\" You shrug, \"That one week paid a full year of college and then some, so It wasn't all that bad. As you might imagine, not may tinies were standing in line to take that gig.\" Donovan chuckles, \"I can imagine.\" You chuckle too, \"But actually those guys were pretty nice about it. There were actually plans of a sequel, something about the tiny in the jailhouse gym. But so far the plans haven't been worked out.\" Donovan grins, \"You'd work with those guys again?\" You shrug, \"Sure. it's better to work with professionals like those guys. And if I can manage to stay in school, by keeping up with the team, I need the cash to pay for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan leans back and thinks about it. \"I guess I can see your point, I mean it's not like you can take up a paper-route, or get a scholarship on you achievements in sports.\" He looks down, \"But what if they don't make that sequel?\" You shrug, \"Then I'll do some shorter gigs.\" Donovan nods, \"But if you don't mind, couldn't you just... erm... offer your services to regular people?\" You laugh, \"And risk being stomped, eaten or whatever by some random internet contact?\" Donovan blinks, \"Oh, right. I guess you'd need someone to take care of you.\" You nod, \"There are some giants that are actually know for... pimping out... people like me. But of course they take a percentage that I'd rather not pay.\" Donovan chuckles again. \"Well, you could always just offer your services to some guys of the team. You probably realise some of them have their very own fantasies.\" You shudder at the thought. \"Yeah, I know, but I never went... off-script.\" Donovan laughs at that. \"Oh, I see, you always knew what was coming, which made it more bearable?\" You nod. \"So you must have been scared at least a little when I accidently scooped you up with my undies?\" You nad again, \"A little yes, but you never showed any evilt tendencies, so I took my chances of staying hidden and...\" you stop, but DOnovan finishes, \"And hoping for a chance to escape unseen.\" You nod a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan laughs and gets up to clean away the dishes, you hop of the saucer and wait for him to return, which he does with two cups (or something akin to it) of coffee. \"So, I guess I should take you home after coffee, I mean I am expecting visitors tonight to play some videogames. You nod and drink your coffee, you never really liked the stuff and did not get offered milk you usually add, but you drink the bitter stuff and wait for Donovan to finish his. From over the rim of his cup he looks down. \"I still don't get it, didn't any of the other guys ever go off-script. I mean you should have learned by now not everything goes according to plan.\" You shake your head, \"It's sort of like an honour code. You never go off-script without checking. So no.\" Donovan nods, but his face tells you he's still not convinced or satisfied. \"But what happens to you like today, when everything DOES go off-script. Are you ready for that? Are you trained for that?\" you shrug, \"No, not really, never had to worry about it until today actually.\" Donovan chuckles, \"Well, I guess running around a locker-room like ours it is bound to happen sooner or later, or should I say, bound to happen again. Escpecially since coach is gonna force you into close contact with some of the others. So you probably could use some training, sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Donovan looks down at you and grabs you. \"Sorry about this, but you understand right.\" And next he stuffs you down the pocket of his tight jeans. Letting you slip deep down where the pants open up just a little to make room for something, you realise, can only be his crotch. You're fear is indeed confirmed as Donovan starts moving and with every step he takes a large bulge is pressed up against you through the thin material of the pocket, only to slip away when he moves his other leg with you away from it. You hear him open the door and suddenly two other voices you find faintly familiar mix with Donovan's. And he begins walking again, After a few steps he sits down and this allows gravity to take hold and lower you right on top of Donovan's massive bulge. Soon the voices of the boys are drowned out by the sounds of a game-system starting up and a little while later Donovan leans back and suddenly from the outside a weight is pressed down on you. It takes you a second to realise Donovan is letting his hand holding the controller rest in his lap. Probably not realising this isn't really comfortable for you. Because you are to afraid to move and accidently arouse the beast next or under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like days to you, but probably is only a few hours, filled with rumbling controllers. Donovan getting up a few times for drinks and snacks and getting slowly but certainly more smelly as time passes by, the others get up too and Donovan shows them out the door. As sson as he closes the door you feel his hand enter his pocket. and slowly plucks you out. \"Sorry dude, I guess this was a bit of an unscripted moment?\" He look a bit embarrassed, but also grins slightly. You nod in his grip, \"Yeah, pretty much unscripted.\" Donovan sits down and places you on the armrest of his couch. \"Guess I'll wait a few minutes for the guys to leave before taking you home.\" You look around. \"What time is it?\" Donovan points at a clock on the wall and you see it's almost 10 PM. \"Crap, that's too late, giants aren't allowed in our district after 9:30\" Donovan stretches and looks at you, \"So, can I drop you of somewhere close enough for you to get home safely?\" You think hard, but Donovan notices your hesitation. \"Don't worry, you can sleep over and I'll take you to school in the morning. It's not like I don't have room for someone like you.\" As soon as he's said it he gets up and walks over to his dresser. He rummages a bit through it and comes back with two pieces of clothing, a sock and a pair of briefs. \"I don't have anything proper for you to uses as a blanket, but you could probably use either one of these. Don't worry, they are completely clean.\" You look from the regular black tubesock, to the brightly coloured briefs. But before you can choose Donovan transfers them to one hand and reaches down to grab you with the other, carrying you over to his bed. Slowly placing you between his pillow and the wall. And placing the possible blankets next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns away and leaves you to decide. From your point of view you see Donovan taking of his clothes, showing off his perfectly sculpted torso. But due to the pillow you do not get a good view of what is below his waist, which suits you just fine. You touch the wool of the sock and the cotton of the briefs and decide that it's probably to hot for wool. You move around a bit and fold the briefs with some difficulty until it looks like something you can sleep on and in. By that time Donovan is sitting down at the edge of the bed and follows your movements. \"I guess I never thought too much about being so small that even making a bed would be a chore.\" You look up and shrug, \"Getting around in a giant world is not really something new to me. But I guess I can see where you're coming from.\" You take of your shirt and crawl in your makeshift bed. Donovan gets up and turns of the lights. A few seconds later you feel the bed quake as he lies down. Youl lie on your back and notice the large shadowy silhouette of Donovans head as he looks over the edge of his pillow.</span></div></div>",

Turning back around your peripheral is cut short as you gaze between Calebs hairy thighs, looking up, his package sways right above you as he goes through his locker, pulling out a tank top and a pair of jeans, leaving his choice of underwear to be... You try to get out of the pouch but it lurches before you get very far. His legs appear on either side of you as he slowly pulls up the strap towards his ominous package. You'd never been stuck in Calebs underwear, you had idea if he'd even feel you, meaning you could be stuck all day and night if you didn't act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb!!! Down here!\" You shout loudly. Your ascent slows a bit as Caleb..,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your ascent slows with the jockstrap being a foot from Caleb's swinging junk. You watch from your fetal position as the belly above the colossal dick scrunches up as Caleb's face comes into view, scanning the concrete bench in front of him for the source of your voice. He sighs, \"&lt;Your Name&gt;, stop screwing with me kid, I don't have time to play hide and seek, I have to get to math, can't take another tardy.\" He say as he straightens back up, cupping himself and giving his Balls a quick rub before gripping the waistband again. That was the Caleb you knew, always incompetent about everything going on. You sigh as he begins pulling you towards his nether regions, knowing you weren't going to see light for awhile. His balls easily covered your entire body, encompassing you with moist, squishy flesh. Your face somehow still pulling oxygen into your nostrils despite being smothered into ball skin. If it wasn't bad enough yet, Caleb, being the proud man he is, rubbed the underside of his bulge to smooth out any creases. This of course pulled more flesh around you to the point where you were sure that you were no longer visible from the outside. You hear the shuffling of pants and your space shifts slightly as the jeans slip over Caleb's package. The balls above you slide back and forth around you as Caleb begins walking towards class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     That little runt, next time he thinks he can screw with me, ill shove him up my ass. Caleb thinks as he strides down the hallway, freshmen scampering out of the way of his mighty form. He didn't hate the tiny guy, he just didn't think he should be anywhere near wrestlers that could do as they please with him. Caleb had had his fair share of awkward and overpowering encounters with the runt, once he was taking a shower and found him in his crack, he had been in there all day and throughout the night. Whatever, Caleb thought, tinie's always shrugged off sexual and humiliating encounters with normal people, some made it a living for such encounters. Scratching at his crotch, Caleb walked into algebra unaware the tiny he thought about was snuggled under his sack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Sweat was already accumulating on you as Caleb's sperm factory tried to keep itself cool being held so close to this god of a guy. Caleb's movement ceased for a moment before a flat force pushed you deeper into the scrotum, making you assume he sat down in class. Caleb shuffled in his seat, grinding his balls back and forth with you wrapped up in them as he pulled the straps of the jock out of his beefy butt without using his hands. After he settles, you have slide farther underneath him, still under his sack but closer to his taint, his skin keeping you glued to it and every movement he makes pulls you a little closer to his taint and...his crack. You knew from experience with Caleb and other guys that once any part of you gets caught up in an ass crack, a few cheek clenches later and you are completely sucked in and out of sight. You've been in asses the most of any place on the male anatomy, but you have only partially been pulled into someones asshole, Brick's, but you fear Caleb might be your first time one day, with him being so numb to your struggles sometimes. You begin to slowly squirm to try to let Caleb know you were down in his jock, pushing against the soft flesh to cause stimulation, but not in an irritating way. You do get a reaction, but not quite as you had expected. Caleb quickly slides back and forth in his seat twice, still not registering the possibility that its one of his teammates causing the sensation, the small one. The shifting slides you rapidly and you end up....</span></div></div>",

Even though he had just taken a shower, his ass was still rank as his potent natural musk was one of the toughest odors to get rid of. To make a bad situation worse, Caleb suddenly unleashed some pent up gas. \"Ah~ that's the stuff,\" quietly said Caleb, enjoying the sensation of alleviating the built up pressure in is bowels. However, for the rest of the kids in his Algebra class it was anything but. The pungent odor of Caleb's fart quickly spread throughout the classroom, causing many to pinch their noses and moan and grown. 'pussies, that wasn't even that bad. They should see what I'll be like after I eat that extra large burrito for lunch!\" though Caleb. If you had known that Caleb's farts could get any worse you would have wished for death to take you right then and there as you remained dazed from Caleb's sudden ass blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA class waned on your situation became progressively worse as more of Caleb's ass' natural musk return, much to the dismay of your nostrils. To make things worse, the A/C was out which made Caleb's massive globes into a oven that was cooking you alive. Suddenly, the bell rang and Caleb stood up to leave. 'Yes, finally I'm one step closer to getting out of the death valley that is Caleb's crack,' you thought ecstatically, unknowing of the fact that Caleb was now on his way to lunch. Unfortunately for you, due to the heat Caleb's ass was extremely sweaty which would normally be bad on its own but because he was walking, his sweaty cheeks acted like a slip-n-slide, funneling you closer to his filthy hole. \"Oh shit oh shit OH SHIT, CALEB, CALEB!!!!\" you yelled at the top of your lungs as you desperately tried to get Caleb's attention while struggling as hard as you could. However, your cries were muffled by Caleb's meaty ass and your struggles acting against you as they only made you move closer to his hole faster. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll try the treadmill if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Brick and Landon take a deep whiff of your stinky little one inch body and hold their noses making fun of you.  Brick is wearing his sweaty singlet underneath sweatpants and a sweatshirt. You look up at him from the palm of his hand and start to shake a bit from fear. He is massive. You know from the stats book that he is 6'4\" and 300 pounds of nearly pure muscle. He does have a bit of a musclegut, but that's from too much beer. He just sneers down at your pitiful little body knowing that his buzzcut and facial scruff are intimidating. He's one of the few guys that can grow a beard on the wrestling team. He closes the hand that you are in, enjoying the knowledge that he could totally crush you like a bug without breaking a sweat. He guides the hand you are in up into his stinky sweatshirt and then down the front of his singlet. His thick fingers shove you in between his raunchy smelling cock and disgusting jock cup. The smell is nearly bad enough to make you gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Brick pulls his hand out, he high fives Landon and then he gets on the treadmill. You screamed and begged to be let free, but the noise from the treadmill starting back up drowned you out. That might not be the only thing drowning \u2013 you were freaking out more than ever now \u2013 banging on the hard cup holding you prisoner. That wasn\u2019t working, so you tried pounding on Brick\u2019s sweaty cock. BAD IDEA! It started growing and taking up more and more room. You now stayed away from the manmeat, hoping to keep from getting crushed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick was running at a good pace now. \u201cDude, he\u2019s really getting tortured down there now,\u201d he told Landon. \u201cWhen you had him, at least your singlet gave him a little air. Imagine him trapped in my cup with Big Brick Junior smacking him around. And, to make it worse, these sweats I have on are making me sweat a ton and don't breath real well, so it is getting miserably hot.. I can feel my fluids pooling up around him. Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torment was getting worse by the second. You were enduring hellish heat, being pummeled by your team mate's schlong and having a hard time getting air with all of the sweat raining down on you. This was all in addition to the horrendous body odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick was having fun but Landon was getting a bit restless. \u201cBro, let\u2019s tag team wrestle this little maggot now!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Landon must have been pretty rich to have a full gym and wrestling ring in his basement. Brick started peeling off his disgustingly wet sweatshirt and pants. Both boys climbed into the ring facing each other in their singlets. Brick reached in and pulled the jock cup out of his nasty singlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your sadistic team mates. They seem to be enjoying seeing you so beaten, pitiful and soaked in their noxious body odor. Not knowing what to expect, you pleaded for mercy, \u201cPlease guys, just bring me back to my place. I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. You had your fun. PLEASE\u2026\u201d They acted like they didn\u2019t hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandon looked at Brick and asked, \u201cDid our little opponent say that we are wimps and challenge us to a wrestling match?\u201d Brick replied with mock anger, \u201cThat shit thinks he can beat us? Let\u2019s show him who is BOSS!!!\u201d He pinched your tiny body in between his meaty fingers and set you on the mat in the middle. Then, he tossed his cup out of the ring. Both beasts were standing on either side of you. They reached up and gave a double high five, \u201cLet\u2019s decimate this little shrimp!\u201d You saw their massive hands clapping together above you \u2013 sweat raining down on you. Both boys had enormous biceps. Hell, everything about both opponents was massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock, Paper or Scissor for who starts,\u201d Brick told Landon. Brick won with Rock. Landon just took a few steps back to enjoy seeing his buddy torture you. Brick took a couple steps back and yelled \u201cTIMBER!\u201d Landon started laughing his ass off as Brick fell forward. You screamed like a little girl and ran to get away, but Brick had perfect aim. His hairy, rancid armpit landed on you with a thud. The stink and sweat invaded you. The weight was so much that you worried he might have broken something. \u201cLandon \u2013 my pit just body slammed that tiny nobody \u2013 ha!\u201d Next, Brick lifted his arm to see you curled into a ball crying and then dropped it back down again, \u201cI love pit-slamming this punk!\u201d Landon egged him on, \u201cDo it a few more times buddy.\u201d That was all it took, Brick slammed his pit into your bruised and battered body over and over for nearly 10 minutes before just laying there comfortably as you suffered being squashed between his hairy pit and the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandon got down on the mat by his buddy\u2019s pit, \u201cDamn, you stink! That kid has gotta be in hell.\u201d Then, he tagged Brick, \u201cI wanna play with the little turd!\u201d Without even giving you a minute reprieve, Landon starts with a mean...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were so relived to be released until he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also be glad it wasn't chest day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thrust you into the deeply wooded valley that was between the coaches pecs.

Sweat started to roll down the valley and soak you. Their musky, manly smells combined to over power all your senses.

You had experienced your fathers ungodly gas but never without two layers between you and/or after leg day. You could all ready smell your fathers ass from here and you were a foot away. As you were brought closer no amount of squirming could free you. The sweaty hairs brushed across your body and the smell overwhelmed all your senses. The coach eventually squeezed you into your fathers tight crack and trapped you in the hairs.

After about three seconds of squishing you your father release the first bomb. You heard a loud rumble from behind and soon after a massive gust of hot, disgusting, manly wind hit you dislodging you from the crack and flinging you deep into your coaches crack.

This was the rankest smell you ever experienced as you were thrown from sweaty and dirty crack to sweaty and dirty crack. The farts entered your body and senses sending your gag reflex into overdrive. The smell entered your skin and stained you with its smell. After a minute of their steady fart stream you feel into one of their cracks and became tangled in their dirty rank ass that trapped the gas that was produced in with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I feel him in my crack.\" your dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then take him home and have some fun.\" coach replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both pulled up their tight shorts and went home, still full of gas to release on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why his wife took off and left him with the runt was beyond him. He didn't hate his son, rather the opposite, but the tiny runt failed all of his expectations. He gave his enormous mountains of glutes a squeeze and felt his son wriggle in terror as he was pulled deeper up into the fatty muscles. Ted grunted in delight and rubbed at the front of his sweats before starting the jeep. At least his son gave him some pleasure, perhaps he'd leave him trapped in his godly ass for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gasp as you slide further between your fathers smooth glutes, he was a super heavyweight bodybuilder and had won quite a few shows, leading to you having quite the comfy life, except on occasions like now. His cheeks were quite hairy, and had a healthy coating of fat cushioning you from his bone crushing muscles, the fat a product of it being off season for bodybuilding. Typically he kept his crack shaved but you guessed he was being lazy this year. You squirm a hand into your pocket and pull out your phone before squeezing your arm through fat, muscle, and hair to your face, flipping through your sadly short contact list to your dads number and called him. After a second a vibration reached you through the muscle groups in the direction of your dads left thigh, he shifted his weight to try to pull his phone out of the tight sweats, his shifting squeezed the breath out of you and you swore your eyes were going to pop out of your skull. Pressure subsided as your father retrieved his phone, letting out a scowl as he saw who was calling him. He flexed his ass, pulling you further in but surprisingly he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What boy? Unless you're genuinely hurt, which I know you can take this abuse, I don't want to hear a word out of you! You messed up my routine with this stunt, take your punishment and keep your mouth shut!\". He hung up before you could speak. A second later he began to systematically flex his giant glutes, making them move in a wave like motion, pulling you deeper within them. You panic and let out a sob, digging your nails and feet into your fathers hardened cheeks, scratching at the flesh and pulling hairs when you got them in your hands. Your father grunted at the unpleasant feeling but continued his anal abduction of you. You grit your teeth and worked your phone back into your pocket so you didn't lose it to the abyss of your dads crack. Somewhere above you, a reverberating sound shook your walls, and the atrocious smell of some kind of digested meat and veggies assailed your senses, your dads protein rich diet produced some rancid smells. You thought he had been pulling you in deeper just to gas you, but when his flexing continued a minute later you realized he intended to use you as a butt toy. Before you got much further however the engine died and your father slid out of the car, taking you along as he walked inside and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ted kicked off his shoes and wandered into his bedroom, throwing off his tank top, his large pecs tensed at the cool air of the room, his nipples perked from the air and stimulation from his rear. He passed a hand over his enormous chest and soft stomach, the latter carrying a layer of fat soon to be worked into more muscle mass. He looped his thumb into the tight sweats And let them drop, exposing his thick cock and balls to the cold air, causing them to draw up a little. He rubbed his hands down his thighs and brought them back up his backside. He flexed his glutes again and felt his tiny son squirm feebly inside their clutches. His dick twitched at the movement and he let out a soft chuckle. Time to have a good father/ son bonding time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another flex pulled you ever so slightly deeper into your fathers crack, you took in a raspy gasp, your chest feeling bruised from the constant pressure. Before you finished the breath however, rough fingers grasped your legs and whisked you out of the canyon in a long pulled motion and before you could figure out what had happened you were deposited on your dads stomach near his navel. He had his head propped up with pillows and looked at you over his large chest and you got a good look at him. He kept his hair buzzed to a quarter inch on his scalp and had a clean shaven face. His warm green eyes looked upon you with disapproval and took in a deep breath, his chest getting larger and your spot raising up as well. Despite all he did to you, your dad was without a doubt a god among men.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Son I need you to take off your clothes, they're chaffing me, and your shoes are uncomfortable as well.\" He said rubbing his left pec and squeezing the nipple that stuck out from it, grunting as he did so with slight pleasure. You glanced over your shoulder and paled to see his member at full mast and his other hand slowly stroking it. You whip back around and stammer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"D-dad, I'll just go to my room and do my homework, and leave you to yourself alright, there is no need for me to-\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut up boy and do as I say\" He said without raising his voice. You gulp but comply, awkwardly tossing your shoes and jeans to the side near his belly button, your shirt followed quickly after. A second didn't pass after your boxers came off when your dad gripped you again and brought you to his handsome face. You hung awkwardly and embarrassed in front of your dads giant gaze as he checked your body for a second.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shame.\" he said. \"Your body is like a miniature version of my body at your age, if you were my size, you could look like me one day.\" He said with a note of sadness. You ducked your head at the sting of his words. You however quickly looked back up as you were lowered towards your dads large lips which parted as you approached.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dad, wait, Dad!\" You said in a frantic fashion. Your father however closed his eyes and let go of your tiny nude form. You tumbled towards the back of your dads throat only for his tongue to lift from it's resting place and slammed you into the roof of his mouth. You sputtered as you swished around inside your fathers mouth, being shot back and forth between his cheeks. After a minute of this he spat you into a palm and smiled at his now soaked son.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not gonna lie, you taste really good son. Now onto the main event....\"</span></div></div>",

You were still in a form of shock from the near encounter of being swallowed by your dad. You couldn't move or speak as your dads knees slid up the bed towards his body, the muscles in his thighs and calves contorting smoothly to compensate for the motion. The hand rounded your fathers shin and gave you a good look at your previous prison. His cheeks were splayed but his hole still wasn't exposed from the girth of the cheeks. The balls that you originated from hung over the crevice, each ball many times larger than you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Time for your punishment squirt, next time just grit your teeth and do as coach says.\" He said calmly before his free hand slipped between his leg and thigh and pulled a cheek away, finally exposing your fathers pink pucker. It drew in a bit in unconscious reaction to the chill in the room, but relaxed and twitched in preparation for its meal. You wrapped your arms around your fathers thumb and squeezed it, trying to persuade him to let you go, he wasn't relenting however. Instead he used your grip against you as he flipped the palm over, leaving you hanging from the thumb. His index pressed your legs towards the large pucker and your toes grazed its clammy rim, where it quickly pulled in on itself at the sensation of your cold toes, but came back and simply twitched at your presence. You whimpered as your father guided your feet over the bloated, hot surface of his hole, using you as a probe to locate its center, you could see the deep divet that was the center with ease, but you sure as hell weren't gonna help him out here. After a couple seconds however your left foot found purchase and slipped up to the ankle in the searing hot orifice, which once again drew up and applied near bone breaking pressure to your foot. After the initial clench though your father relaxed and began shoving you in. His hole was remarkably calm as it did so, barely even twitching as you went up to your knees. Your father let out a genuine, pleased sigh and a pressure built around your feet, you looked down in time to watch as the fleshy walls conformed around your legs peeled away, showing the deeper inner walls of your fathers rectum as his ass let loose a torrent of foul gas. You gagged as your father simultaneously pressed you deeper in, not letting the loosening of his hole go by. Still gagging on the smell, you were now almost up to your waist and looked down again at the hole eating you and winced. Your own cock was full mast and rested in a wrinkle of the hole where the clenchings were giving it a good rub. You let out your own little groan as your dad unknowingly jerked you off. It didn't take more than a dozen clinches that your own minuscule climax occurred, shooting your seed over the pink flesh, slipping into crevices around your dads sphincter. Your fathers hand gave you one more push on the head and pushed you up to your chest, your hands still free but not strong enough to free yourself from the anal grasp. You watched from your sideways position as the hand that had pushed you into your predicament drifted up, letting its fingers graze his drooping balls before grasping something beyond the behemoth balls. Your father began to beat himself off, enjoying the feeling of his miniature son being pulled into his body by his asshole. He grunted as he beat himself furiously, his balls above you bouncing up and down and his hole clenching in rhythm with the pumping motions. You were still being pulled into him, but it was less coordinated than it had been before and your progress had greatly slowed. After a minute your dad finished hot spunk shooting from his mammoth cock, coating his thighs and the bed sheets between them. He let his dick go and its semi erect form drooped past his balls, its urethra blinking at you and causing a rogue drop of cum to fall from it and splash on to your forehead, you sputtered as your dad sighed above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know son, that was the best jerk I had in awhile, we should do this more often! But for now your grounding takes precedence.\". He said with a winded voice. The clenching continued, except they were very spaced and long, causing you to be taken into him much faster. Soon only your face was exposed, and you looked out past the valley of your fathers lifted legs and took in your last fresh breath before a clench pulled the sphincter around your head and tugged you fully into your fathers rectum. A few more quick clenches pulled you in deeper and stopped, and your senses were now filled with heat and stench. The walls around you squeezed and contorted you with a force that you had no strength to stop. So instead you let your body go limp, and the pressure became more bearable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ted let his ass clench a few more times before letting his cheeks fall back in place, his dick still dripping cum onto the bed sheets. He didn't know if he'd leave his son in his ass for the night, but damn did he feel good in there. He got out of bed and walked into the bathroom and took a real quick shower to wipe off the mess, before returning and wiping the sheets. He walked into the kitchen. He was nude still but that was usually how he walked around the house, his son was the only one who lived here but Ted often forgot he was home, an the few times he did realize he was, he just went on without a care. He ate dinner and settled down to watch a show and before long...</span></div></div>",

Landon feels and says, \"Oh, I don't want you to be uncomfortable! Here, have a blanket!\" He say sarcastically as he reaches to his but and pulls apart his cheeks with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you are plunged into his cheeks. It wasn't that bad until he released the cheeks and they came topping towards you then squishing you between them.

You wretch at the smell, but there is nothing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hear the boys enter the weights room your eyes widen. \"Ready for a little exercise?\" Brick asked.

You then see some light as Landon pulls you with a squelch, then a pop. He and Brick laughed at your state. You were dripping with butt sweat and you could practically see your stink lines!

You could see the pit stains on both of them but Bricks was more dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandon was always the stinker that farted a lot and Brick was always the sweater covered in pit stain all the time. You look to see two bags as well, a bag of dirty wresting socks and a bag of dirty wrestling underwear. You recognise these bags, lost and found. These socks and underwear hadn't been washed in months! And you can say the same about Bricks armpits. He doesn't wash them and loves to parade around with his as he says 'beautiful pit marks'.

THIS ISN'T RIGHT, YOU MONSTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I said it I knew I fucked up. The locker room was silent for a few seconds then Brick started soeaking, in a low voice that sent shivers of fear down my spine. \"Did you hear that boys? The runt thinks it can talk back to a superior being like one of us. I think it needs to apologise.\" A chorus of agreement goes around. \"I think that if you don't want to be crushed to death runt you better start licking in there, and font you sare stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other jocks laugh at my predicament, I helplessly lower my head into his pit and start licking, savouring the light as he lowers his arm and leaves me in darkness. His sweat tastes as bad as it smells; a salty liquid that makes me want to wretch. I keep licking until he finally decides to let me stop, a few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is __</span></div></div>",

So I swallowed my pride and licked at his sweaty skin like my life depended on it- and it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his arm closed off from the world I couldn't see. It was just me and the matted armpithair jungle all around me. I clung onto some hairs to pull myself up deeper into his armpit as I licked and licked at his sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow and torturous task but over the course of an hour I licked up and down his pit again and again until his sweat was replaced with my spit. I kept having to suppress gags as I swallowed the sweat building up in my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I licked I found a spot of his armpit that seemed particularly ticklish. As I lapped at it with my tongue I felt Brick shutter. I paused, built up my saliva, and tried again. Again the giant shuttered and this time I heard a low moan pass through his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" I thought to myself. \"He acts all big and tough but I've just found a way to make him squirm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd squirm he did. I got to work licking faster and harder than I had before and with each flick of my tongue I felt Brick quiver. Within a minute I had him full on groaning. He let out one giant moan and suddenly he must have realized the attention he was bringing to himself because his pit opened up and his fingers snagged me out of his tangled airport hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was brought face to face with Brick. His angry eyes scowled at me and as I glanced around and saw the wrestling team surrounding us I realized I had embarrassed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like faggot here is enjoying his job too much,\" Brick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really likes to please,\" Pete, another teammate, said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gives me an idea.\" A grin spread over Brick's ugly dumb face. I really didnt like where this was going but I didnt dare speak up. Anything I said would get me in more trouble with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like to pleasure so much, why only have you lick my pits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick makes you...</span></div></div>",

You have already disturbed the class and I don't want it to continue.\" He says in his deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly look around and make your way over to the tiny section of the classroom. When Dan leads the meditation time the students sit in circles with him at the center. He keeps the tinies in the innermost circle for protection as they tend to cause a disruption when near the larger students. Furthermore he tends to have some ulterior motives for keeping them close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the only open space is located behind him. Knowing what Dan does you begin to look for a way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Sir may I go to the nurse's office? I am starting to feel a bit sick.\" You say aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I am tired of your excuses, sit down and don't say another word or you will regret it\" Dan responds with a malevolent stair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to push your luck sit in the miniature cushion and close your legs. The seat is located a mere six inches from your teacher's seat. Dan then strips off his Gi revealing his well folded fundoshi underneath. Maneuvering over to his cushion he slowly sits down. You gulp as your teaches ass fall from the sky. Each globe is covered in a forest thick dark hairs as it comes closer you can see pieces of lint and other things trapped by the fur. Finally it lands with a thud knocking you into the air. As you stair at the hairy backside you pray that today's session isn't too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot 5 minutes into the class the barrage begins. No warning is given as a fetid odor envelopes you. Dan is known to release some of the most vile farts in the school. Many students have passed out from the horrid scents and now rush to get seats out of the firing range. You are unlucky in this regard and must endure the full force of his intestines. The silent fart is a combination of rot, mixed with fermented food. This ungodly odor seems to linger around your frail form as you try to focus your breathing. Before the first one has cleared an even more intense odor assaults your tiny form. The new gas cloud is a biological weapon, the heat alone causing you to sweat profusely as you fight for consciousness. The skunky, musty odor burns your lungs and causes your eyes to water. Trying your best to focus you are glad that the atmosphere soon clears. Breathing quickly you body rejoices for the clean air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class continues you start to think that you can make it without a problem. That is until you hear a grumble from ahead. Bracing yourself as you see Dan lean forward slightly. The cloth underwear is caked in sweat and starting to become discolored from the man's ass. Your face only looks on in disgust. With your tiny body now in the direct path of this man's anus you watching on in fear. Soon a very wet sounding explosion exit's the man's vile ass. You see the cloth being soiled in front of your very eyes. Soon the creeping miasma is upon you. What was bad before was nothing compared to this. Even before taking a breath you can feel your eyes burn and your body tingle. You take a breath and all hell breaks loose, words can not describe how terrible this gas cloud is. Almost immediately you begin to gag, as you open your mouth the shitty odor attacks your tastebuds only amplifying your torment. The killer gas causing you to dry heave as your body spasms in the cushion. Even the other students can barely contain their focus as the fart slowly spreads throughout the room. Each breath becomes more torturous than the last. You begin to feel lightheaded and cry out for help. In anger your teacher turns around and picks you up in his calloused hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to stay quiet or face the consequences, since you clearly do not respect me I think we need to have an extended lesson. Class is dismissed.\" Dan says aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students quickly flee the gas chamber and gasp at the fresh air from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan holds you in front of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets see what we can do to instill a little bit of respect\" He says with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being only one inch tall, you had decided that it would be safer to stay away from some of the more interactive sports like wrestling and football. Just being in school is challenging enough, let alone having to \"wrestle\" someone 72 times your height. Football sounds like an even deadlier sport with tons of huge guys surrounding you on a massive field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thinking about all the options. You want to make friends and be active in school, so a sport might be fun. It also didn't help you that the new principal made a new rule to require everyone to join a sport. If you didn't know better, you would think he did it specifically to torture you. It was hard to tell if he didn't like you or if he just enjoyed torturing you and seeing you humiliated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time you had to meet him in person was horrible. You remember that day very clearly - the day your principal \"accidentally\" sat on you. You had never had a teacher or administrator do that to you. You had an appointment with him and were told by his secretary that he was running a few minutes late. She had roughly picked you off the floor by her desk and went into his office, sitting you in the chair across from his desk. It seemed like you were waiting for ages. When he finally showed up, he came and for some reason \"didn't see or hear you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly sat down in the chair you were in and his ass landed right on you. He slyly asked out to nobody in particular, \"Wonder where my little student Connor is. He must be late. I'll have to punish him for being late to our appointment.\" You were under his dress slack covered ass, struggling and screaming for him. He just sat on top of you farting for like 5 to 10 minutes. The smothering was bad, but the noxious fumes made it even more miserable. To you, it felt like hours of torture. Eventually he got up and fanned the air behind him. In a fake sounding apology, he addressed you with a huge smile on his face, \"Oh sorry Connor, I didn't see you back there. I feel bad that you had to sniff my bum that long - ha.\". After that meeting, you tried your best to keep clear of him. However, since you were so small and couldn't make it to class on time very often, you were sent to the principal's office a bunch. You swear he set up my classes far from each other just to screw with you. You were tortured by him numerous times a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk - well, enough about that - back to picking a sport. Well....you did swim well and figured that might be safe. The only time you even swim with team mates is for relay races and you are never really swimming at the same time. The only downside is that the pool is like an ocean to you and with the waves from the other swimmers, you might drown trying to get across the pool. Speaking of swimming - there was that water polo club. It was a club rather than a sport - that might be better than the more competitive swim team. Those guys on the polo club just split up and play each other weekly. There are no trips to other schools or mean teams coming to your school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of clubs, there was a \"Twister\" club. That is the club that kids that aren't good at sports sign up for - mixture of super smart kids and dropouts or totally non-athletic. You might enjoy that if the kids aren't mean. Of course, that might give kids opportunities to squash you or make you miserable - ughh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option would be track and field. For an inch tall, you have a ton of stamina and are used to running everywhere. People might get tired of waiting for you to finish, but it could still be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weighing all of the options, you decide to join the...</span></div></div>",

You finally make it to the pool for your first practice and hear loud slapping from the pool. Shit, the team is already swimming laps. A booming male voice calls over to you,\"Connor, you are five minutes late and you don't even have your suit on yet.\" Oh no, that isn't Miss Brady. You look over to the large man standing by the pool and realize it is Mr. Johnson, your principal. What the fuck? He's standing with nothing on but a form fitting white Speedo. That is not normal - since when do coaches wear swim suits? You never imagined how he would look outside of his suit and are strangely turned on by your evil principal. You don't want to like him, but he is so muscular and hairy like a bear. And in addition to a bit of a beer gut, his suit is bulging out cartoonishly like he hid a bowling ball in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs at the shocked look on your face, \"What? Were you expecting Miss Brady?\" You nodded yes and he chuckled as he explained, \"I'm coaching this season, she ended up having to coach the girls field hockey team. Get your suit on and give me 100 meter warm up!\" You can see that everyone continues working on their warm up laps totally ignoring you. \"But sir, I don't have a Speedo yet,\" you tell your beefy coach in a meek voice. \"Hell boy, we're all men here - well, all except you - ha.\" He walked over to you, picked you up and easily stripped off your tiny clothes. You were left in only your tighty whitey's and red blushing cheeks. \"I'll give you a head start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Johnson tossed you in the middle of the lane in the middle of the pool.

Mr. Johnson stood at roughly 6 feet and 4 inches and weighed probably just under 300 pounds. He sported a very short crew cut and clean beard that covered his strong jaw and had piercing ice blue eyes. His chest boasted some large pectorals covered in a forest of brown hair that also covered his small beer gut that obviously was a well defined six pack a few years ago. The white speedo he wore was still dripping wet and clung to his enormous package, and was slightly translucent from the water, letting you vaguely make out his uncut cock wrapped drooping over mammoth balls that were many times bigger than you. His monstrous thighs continued the theme of being covered in hair as did his well defined calves that ended at feet that were easily size 13 or more. You look back up at his eyes and gulped. He smiled with no kindness and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bet you're regretting your choice shrimp, as soon as I heard a micro joined the swim team I had to personally see to it that you didn't compete. This school ranks number one in the state in almost every sport, one of those being swimming, and I'll be damned if I let you ruin that streak. I can't just cut you without a sound reason, so instead I'll just never give you a chance and make you quit yourself. I'll personally exempt you from my own rule of everyone being on a team.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said as he bent down to grab you. You tried to dodge him but he twisted his wrist and caught between his thumb and index with a chuckle. He held you tightly but not as hard as you expected him to, as he lifted you skyward and placed you on the cheap desk in the corner of the pool office. You watched as Mr. Johnson walked over to a gym bag and grabbed a towel, as he went your eyes locked on his colossal ass, something you had already had an encounter with on your first day at this school. His cheeks were mountains of fat and muscle that shifted underneath the thin material of the speedo, which had been sucked into his deep crack and gave him a massive wedgie. This man was a god among the students and he was about to give you personal divine punishment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Johnson sighed after drying off and turned around, returning to you. He stopped when his mammoth bulge was mere inches from you, overhanging the desk.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not going to sugar coat it with you shrimp, I got paperwork out the ass and need to work on that and I can't baby sit you, so two options you got, go home now or end up in a dark place.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said that with a bit of aggression to imply a threat but you were never one to back down from bullies. You stuck out your chin and said defiantly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm GOING to be on this swim team Mr. Johnson, and if I have to endure a trial by fire from you I'll do just that.\" You say with your arms crossed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Johnson Made <i>tsk tsk</i> sound with his mouth before picking you up again and looking you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It takes guts to say that to me, especially at your size, but this isn't some movie where your metal strength is enough to get you on the team, oh well I gave you the chance, now you'll just suffer the consequences.\" With that he opened up the front of his speedo with his free hand and held you over it for dramatic effect, to possibly try to get you to change your mind, you tensed but didn't say nothing as he lowered you in carefully.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your descent passes you by a forest of damp pubic hair and down the length of a dick many times larger than you. He let the hand holding you keep the speedo open as he used his other hand to lift his dick up, exposing his large scrotum to you. You let out a slight whimper as he pushes you into the malleable flesh of his balls and leaves you just beneath the base of his cock. You turn around in time to see him lower his cock back into place, the hot throbbing flesh pressing into you and pulling you further into his scrotums folds. Extra weight was applied as the speedo fell back in place. Darkness enveloped you and the only thing you could hear was your own rapid breathing and the slight squelching of water and skin as Mr. Johnson walked somewhere. You tried to move but the skin around you clung heavily and kept you in place rather well. In the distance you could hear the chorus of Mr. Johnson's bowels at work and the slapping of feet against wet concrete. You hear Mr. Johnson shout something about running and then barks an order for their next workout. He began to walk again and after a bit his balls raised and shifted, pulling you down between them in a strange embrace as you assumed he had sat down to begin that paperwork he had mentioned. A vibration with a muffled sound reached you as did a chuckle from Mr. Johnson and only took you a second to realize he had just let one rip. Maybe you should've quit after all...</span></div></div>",

His junk wobbled in its speedo clad wrap as he walked up the brick stairs to his upper middle class abode. Upon walking in he made his way into the kitchen and poured himself a glass a milk, pausing and checking himself out in a mirror, letting his towel drop to the floor as he did so. He admired his large ass and well defined chest, his pecs creating a deep cleavage that was dense with hair. A hand rubbed his rather large gut and let out a disapproving sigh before it drifted and groped his large white bulge, its size leaving a good weight in his palm, though it seemed...heavier than usual. It took a second for it to register that he had a passenger still on board.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh shit!\". Mr.Johnson let out a curse as he dropped his speedo and lifted his heavy cock up, exposing a minute teen still stuck to his large balls.

He put down the milk glass and dropped the student in his upturned, chilled palm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kid, why didn't you notify me you were there? Shit now I gotta take you home before your parents think you're missing or dead.\" Mr. Johnson said, this kid was becoming an issue, he could get fired over this.

I see how swimming seemed a safe bet.\u201d You frown, \u201cYeah, until I found out Johnson is our new coach, I just know he took her place to make me wanna quit, whatever sport I choose he will be coaching it.

You glance around for a sink, but there's none. Which would explain why Butch carries you into the small shower, that he hardly seems to fit in. As you check around, you realise suddenly that Butch is actually still naked. As he turns on the water he lifts you to the showerhead and rinses you off, slowly rubbing your shoulders and back carefully before placing you on a corner shelf at shoulder height. \"There, hope that feels better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left there are a few bottles and Butch picks one that says shampoo and starts to wash his hair. Suddenly he yelps as he got some in his eyes. He stumbles slightly and gently bounces into the hanging shelf you are on and you lose your balance and fall. You scream, afraid to land on the floor, but your fall is pretty short as you land on something soft only a little lower on a second shelf. You sigh in relief and look down at te large yellow shelf which seems to have holes in it. You think it's a bit strange untill you suddenly notice it's getting dark and you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch's hand comes down right on top of you and squishes you into the yellow floor as he picks it up. Suddenly the light returns only for a few second as you're view is filled with the sight of Butch's hairy pit. Traveling towards you at high speed. Suddenly you realise what the yellow floor is. You let out a squeack as the sponge is pressed deep into the rank pit locking in as he starts scrubbing. Pressing you deep into the firm sponge. The smell of sweat and the rough hairs fill your face as he slowly cleans himself.After a while he removes the sponge, but you're locked into it as he moves it to the other pit. Once more Butch's stench fills your scences. From the pit he traces the skin to his pecs and next down his abs, all the way rubbing and scrubbing you over his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wrestle free, to no avail, as suddenly his belly button fills your view and you are slowly circled down Butch, treasure trail.</span></div></div>",

How did you end up there.\u201d He pulls you from the sponge and lifts you up so you can answer. \u201cWell when you got shampoo in your ees you knocked me from the shelf and I landed on the sponge, just before you picked it up.\u201d Butch is connecting some dots and suddenly he blushes, \u201cOh, so I rubbed you all over my...\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish, \u201cOh jeez, ans I was about to rub you\u201d You nod, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d He turns of the shower and steps out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDripping with water he walks into his room and places you on his dresser. \u201cI\u2019m just so clumsy al the time when I\u2019m not in the water you know.

And then we can do some studying together before I take you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around and grabs a towel from a chair and starts drying of, he moves the towel around forcefully and suddenly it sweeps over the cabinet and knocks you of. Right into the top drawer which was open and you land on something soft and red. Suddenly Butch\u2019s hand reaches in and grabs the thing you\u2019re standing on without looking, lowering it towards his feet as he folds is open and you are flipped around till you lay down on the fabric, facing up.

You however can not make a single move as you are plastered against his balls by the tight underwear, only swaying with every step. You really start to get annoyed by Butch\u2019s clumsiness. Although it is kinda sweet in a way and you do think he really doesn\u2019t mean you any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel Butch scratching your back through the fabric.

As he enters what you assume is the kitchen you feel him squating down and hear the muffled sound of pots and pans, he\u2019s gonna really prepare some food you realise. But you don\u2019t wanna be stuck here all that time, you try to struggle, but he\u2019s got you locked up tighter than in a straight-jacket.

You hear him putting down some stuff before his hand enters his briefs and you feel his hand scraping you of his balls and lifting you past his penis out of your prison. \u201cHow did you end up there, little dude, don\u2019t tell me you like being in there.\u201d he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in particular no.

The food is wonderful, crunchy steamed veggies and a perfect omelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch and you both clean your plates and he places them to the side. \u201cYou full?\u201d  He asks and you nod. \u201cGood, so, just wondering, Jason told me you were kinda good with Math, so since you\u2019re here, could you help me out with my homework.\u201d You shrug, \u201cSure, but I think we need to call my parents first, I\u2019m over an hour late by now.\u201d Butch reaches for the phone and asks your number, as he dials he asks, \u201cCan you use this phone?\u201d You shake your head and he says, \u201cno problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\u201cHi miss, this is Butch, I\u2019m on your sons swimteam.\u201d<br>\r\n-\u201cNo don\u2019t worry, he did great,I\u2019m just calling to tell you he came over after practice to help me study my Math.\u201d<br>\r\n-\u201cI can put you on speaker.\u201d<br>\r\nHe presses a button and moves you closer to the base unit.<br>\r\n\u2014\u201cHi mom\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014-\u201cHi son, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014\u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just gonna help Butch out a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n-\u201cDon\u2019t worry mam, I\u2019ll get him home safely later today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014-\u201cThank you Butch, just don\u2019t let him walk home alone at night, he\u2019s not build for the dark.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014\u201cMo-hom?!\u201d<br>\r\n-\u201cNot to worry mam, if it gets too late he\u2019s welcome to stay over, he doesn\u2019t take up that much room anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014-\u201cThank you Butch, just keep out of trouble you two and do your homework.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014\u201cThanks mom, talk to you later.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that your mom hangs up and so does Butch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets out his books and suddenly you realise something. \u201cOh crap, my books and clothes are still in my locker?\u201d Butch looks at the clock, \u201cHm, school closes in an hour, but I can be their and back in fifteen on my bike. I don\u2019t mind gettting them for you.

As he sits down to put on his socks and shoes he causes a small draft and the note floats up and lands on you. As you start to crawl under it suddenly it crumples in around you, oh no, Butch is picking it up, and you\u2019re going with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, no pockets in these shorts\u201d, you hear him mumble and suddenly he stick the note and you....</span></div></div>",

You try to grab on, but the yellow note is too slippery and you fall into the depths of his abyss-like crack. Waisting no time Butch starts to move. \"Be back in a few.\" You hear him say too you, even though you're not even there. Before you can send a signal you are jostled around as he runs down the stairs and out the door. You need a moment to realise which sides is up and down, but as you come to your senses you are squished against his cheek as he hops on his bike and starts pedalling. You're facing the fabric of his boxers, so you are pinned down and can't even try to bite him to give him a signal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he speeds up you feel yourself sinking into his flesh. Luckily the school is not far and he soon gets of, giving you a little bit of wiggle room. You gather your strength and pull free just enough to turn around. However right at that moment Butch has reached your locker and has to get on his knees to reach it. Which really puts a strain on his shorts and by that, on you.You feel like you can't even breath anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the ruslting of paper in the distance, hear him mumble something which might be your locker combination, your longes are on fire now. Finally a slight sound of success and then he gets up again. As he gets up you finally suck your longues full of oxygen and the burning sensation fades a little as you struggle free, with a, probably only to you, audible plop. Suddenly you slide down as Butch is on the move again, And as he gets back in the saddle you end up with a little more room, but it smells a lot more like Butch. Afraid of were you are now and a little worried of what might happen if you move right now, seeing as Butch started pedalling you decide to sit this out till he's back home. It's only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Butch slows down and gets off his bike you brace yourself, which is a good thing as he bounces up the stairs again. \"I'm back, with your books.\" He says and you sigh thinking to yourself, 'Yeah... I know.' This is the moment you decide to kick him as hard as you can. As you hit his flesh you realise you are indeed were you feared you were, right behind the sphincter. Butch reaction is a surprised 'Oof' a buttsqueeze and next a hand that reaches in to free you from your prison. As he places you on his desk you look up to see a concerned look on his face. \"Oh boy, did I do it again?\" You nod as you catch your breath. \"Sorry, about that,\" you say, why are you apologizing? \"the wind knocked the note over me just before you picked it up...\" Butch gasps a little and says, \"Just before I stuffed it down my pants.\" you only nod. \"Oh, I'm so clumsy, I'm sorry, I never allowed myself to have contact with tinies like you, because I'm to scared I might actually hurt or kill one by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"It's okay, most tinies either become sturdy pretty fast or they die before they know it. I think it's kind of like nature's way to compensate for our diminished stature. Kinda like how beetles have this exoskeleton thing.\" Butch gives a weak smile. \"Thanks for saying that, but I don't think it's okay. I made you spent too much time up close and personal with my body to say everything is good. I'm in your debt now.\" You laugh, \"Well you also safed me from the pool, and unintentionally from having to dodge the twins and the coach in the dressing room, so I guess I'd consider us even.\" Butch smile widens a little \u00c4n I've had a killer-omelet earlier, so I think it's time to actually do some math.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch sits down at hi desk and gets his books, while you unpack yours. You also finally have a shirt and some pants to pull over your swimsuit, which you were still wearing. The next hour or so, you help Butch with some of his math-problems. Which to your surprise goes pretty well, Butch is a lot smarter than you gave him credit for. He also confirms this is helping him by saying \"This is what I need, a bit of one-on-one teaching. It's just a bit of the jock-code not to ask too many questions in class.\"</span></div></div>",

The moment you turn around several things seem to happen all at once. You suddenly seen your standing against Jason's cheek, right at the edge of flesh and red speedo. The mountain of flesh also slightly comes in closer and you notice from above a shadowy hand comes down and hooks its thumb in at the top of the leghole. Sliding down quickly, while pulling the speedo out. Suddenly his fingers are behind you and push you against Jasons leg and the thumb pulling the speedo straight opens up a hole between the fabric and the flesh and you tumble in. The last thing you see is the thumb racing down besides you before it suddenly pulls out and the fabric snaps shut squeezing you tight against Jason's flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely unable to move a muscle as the tight speedo crushes you against the cheek. It gets even worse as you suddenly feel Jason leaning a little more forward which pulls the fabric even more taught. You hear the coach give one of his elongated speeches. And hope it'll end soon, because you figure the only way out is for Jason to find you. But you don't want to embarrass him by making your predicament known right in front of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So in conclusion, we have a pretty good team and we can win state, if we practice... practice... practice!\" After these words the group of swimmers sighs and Jason finally gets up. He wraps his towel around his waist and it gets dark in your prison. You hear him talk to Butch as they move into the locker room, \"What happened to the little guy?\" Jason asks an Butch answers, \"I think he stayed behind till after we are gone. Hiding from coach.\" Jason chuckles, \"I would have protected him if he asked.\" Butch laughs, \"After almost sitting on him, I don't know if he would trust you so soon.\" Jason chuckles again. \"True, I just hope he doesn't think of me like just 'that big ass'.\" You grumble, right now that's exactly how you think of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the towel is dropped, next will be the speedo's you realise.</span></div></div>",

A bit fazed you look up and see A massive shadow fall over you and you open your mouth and scream, but before a single sound comes out the flesh of Jason's cheek collides with your body and presses down on your body and face so fast, you can't even close your mouth before it is stretched open further and invaded by the skin on his cheek forcing you to taste the sweaty, still slightly chlorinated skin. Even more weight presses you down and locks you in place as Jason relaxes further. You hear him softly chuckle and groan at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason realises he feels the tiny body under his left cheek and really likes the feeling of power over his little swimbuddy. But not just the power. Sure sitting on someone's face every once in a while is really good, but sitting on someone's body like this is an even better experience. It's hard to describe the feeling exactly, it's both comfortable, makes him feel powerful, but also feels like a good way to keep the guy safe from worse faith, like what the twins would do to him. The thought of having someone rub his sensitive ass every once in a while seems like a gift of the gods themselves. Being attracted to smaller men has always been a thing for him, but how much smaller can they get than this. Imagine having a boyfriend who can live in your pocket like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking too much about it Jason leans to the right to lift the cheek that is keeping the little guy in place and uses his hand to scrape him off his cheek and press him in deeper, under his crack before sitting down again. Now he feels the little guy softly rub the skin on the inside of the cheeks, he must like it as much as me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jump for joy as the weight lessens and you feel a hand scrape you free from the fleshy cheek, but as you are loosened you shudder when you feel yourself being slid deeper under the ass instead of out. The moment the crack opens up and the ass comes down again you try to struggle as hard as you can, but the tight, hard ass makes it almost impossible to move and all your efforts only allow you to slowly rub your arms against his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason relaxes further as the inside of his crack gets a massage, slowly lowering deeper and deeper, thinking on how great it would be to have this feeling everyday, for the rest of his life. Slowly he feels himself relax even more. Suddenly he sits up realising he almost dozed off. He sticks his hand under his ass and pulls out the little swimmer. \"That felt so much better that I thought it would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get dragged out from under Jason's ass you gasp for fresh air as he lifts you and you hear him say how much he liked it. Before you can answer he continues, \"I would really like to feel that more often and maybe even longer. I can see us having a rather intimate relationship like that. Sort of like a live-in boyfriend.\" You gasp in surprise, but Jason continues. \"It would be beneficial for us both, I would protect you from others and you massage my ass as a thank you, or maybe some other parts too.\" He smiles at you in a sweet way, but all you can do is scream and shake your head. \"No, no, no,\" you answer, \"I don't want to massage your ass all the time.\" The smile on Jason's face disappears.</span></div></div>",

You feel Jason stepping out of the Speedo's and try to struggle. But it's in vain. Your muscles aren't strong enough to escape the sticky bond that has formed between your body and Jason's ass by the continuous pressure. Suddenly he moves and turns and you see the tiles of the shower as he moves into it. And suddenly you hear water and a second later it runs over your body too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, you think, this will get you free. The warm water feels good as it rinses over you and you try to struggle again. This time you can move a little. All of a sudden you feel yourself slowly peel off. But right before this happens. A large yellow wall slides over you and in a reflex you grab on and get pulled off and get dragged down the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you think, but next you feel yourself sliding up, back down and up. And all of a sudden you feel a hole right under your legs and as the yellow thing slides again, your body slides into a tight hole. All the way up to your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the yellow mass comes free of Jason's ass and you can see what happened. You got swept up by Jason's sponge as he was cleaning his ass. But as you see now he's about to scrub his second cheek, before you can scream you get rammed up against it, sliding you deeper into the poreus material. With now only your head sticking out you get scrubbed over Jason's second cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing lifter off again you get a view of his side as he moves the sponge around and suddenly you see his large, floppy member fill your view. Before being smacked against it and getting scrubbed around slowly and very thoroughly. The shaft, the head, the balls. His taste mixed with a hint of chlorine fills your mouth. Making you gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems an eternity the sponge finally pulls back and you feel yourself getting lifted. You look up and try to scream up at Jason, hoping he will notice you being stuck where you are.</span></div></div>",

It's one of the guys from the cycling team and even if you didn't know him, his clothes would give him away in an instant. Apparently he took a ride as he is dripping with sweat. As he strips down you notice his lithe body, slightly defined and and massive thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tossed his into the shower before grabbing a towel, he suddenly turns and walks straight at you. But it only takes you a second to realise he is just coming into the shower. As he closes in, you can smell the fresh sweat in him. He closes the curtain and turns in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stay as still as possible, not wanting to be found out right now. But you're in for another shock. Suddenly the man reaches out and grabs Jason's sponge. The moment it takes from the shelf to the first rank and sweaty pit is just enough to make you realise they apparently share the sponge. You involuntarily scream, which means your mouth is wide open as you are plunged into she soaked, sweaty skin and get a mouth full of pure sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly you're face is scrapes over the skin, as the man starts humming, completely oblivious to your predicament. When he moves you over to the other pit you are crying almost uncontrollably. Down the abs and over his cock. Under his balls. Around his thighs. You come along for the ride. But the worst is yet to come as he bends over slightly an scrubs you through his crack filled with pent up sweat and grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he is completely clean. But your torment isn't over. He bends down to pick up his shorts and uses the same sponge to clean out the inside of his padding. Squeezing you against the sweaty inside. Scrubbing and scrubbing.

He brings you a bit to the side so you can talk and he can hear you. \"Jason, thank god. Please get me out.\" Jason looks at you, \"how did you get in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and give him an abridged version. But he asks for a fe details and you give him almost the entire story. He grins a bit, \"oh crap, you were in the sponge? I feel for you. Mike really gets sweaty during his rides.\" You grunt an affirmation. \"Yeah, so please get me out of here, before I get the full experience.\" Jason doesn't seem to hear you, \"I think the only one who gets sweatier during a bike ride is me.\" He looks down at you again. \"By the way, you don't have to be scared, you're not in his pants, you're in mine. He borrowed then yesterday because his shorts were torn. But he ordered his new ones and they arrived yesterday. So he wanted to take a test drive and I was getting ready to join him.\" He gives you a strange look, \"okay,\" you say, can you get me out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait a sec,\" Jason pauses and you have a feeling of where this is going. \"So you actually survived being squashed under my ass? And taking a shower with both me and Mike as the sponge?\" You answer hesitantly, \"yeah?\" He looks at you with a twinkle in his eyes, \"So I guess it wouldn't kill you to leave you in for a while? I mean it's Saturday so you won't miss any school or practice.\" You start to plead. \"Please, no, I don't want to be stuck in here all alone.\" Jason gives a grin. \"Oh, okay, you don't want to be alone? I guess that means I have to take you with us. And seeing as you are already so comfortable in there. It just seems a shame to get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell if Jason is joking or not. Suddenly you hear a voice from the other room. \"Hey Jason, I can't get these over my thighs.\" The bathroom door opens and Jason quickly flips you back in. \"They sent me the wrong size.\" So we gotta stop on the way to get another pair at the normal store. But I think these might fit you perfectly.\" Suddenly something hanks the shorts you're in from Jason's grasp. \"You don't mind if I borrow these for another day.\" Before Jason can react Mike start moving again.</span></div></div>",

Great thinking there roomy.\" Suddenly he tossed the shorts you're in back to Jason. \"Hurry up and change, I wanna beat the crowd.\" Jason catches his shorts, but you don't hear Mike leave. \"A little privacy?\" Jason's asks. \"Come on,\" Mike sounds a bit agitated, \"I've seen your ass before and I need to brush my teeth.\" You are getting very scared. You now realise Jason was probably joking and he saved you from Mike, which he didn't have to do. But right now he doesn't have much choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you feel the shorts get lowered and suddenly Jason's right foot comes in. 'oh no' you think, 'please no'. But his left foot joins the party. Slowly the shorts are being raised. You look up and see Jason's skin come closer and closer. You didn't know in which part of the short you were, but now you see you're probably gonna be stuck right under Jason's ball. As the short are brought up over his thighs the dangling balls fill you view and suddenly you make contact. As the shorts are being pulled up the soft, silky skin fold all over your face. Only the magic of the breathable fabric allows you enough air to sustain yourself. Although maybe you wish it didn't because it is filtered through the dirty chamois and the fresh scent of male testicles. Suddenly you see one of Jason's fingers slide over you as he adjusts himself and tries to find you, but you are too small to notice. And with Mike there he can't fondle himself for an extended period. So he retreats to soon and with a loud snap your faith is sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should by a pair of new shorts at the store too.\" Jason says as you feel him starting to walk. The tight pants keep everything, including you, in place so there's not much movement you notice to you relief, you were scared his balls would have grinded you down even more.<br>\r\n\"Nah, for the amount of time you spent on a bike those are still fine.\" Mike answers with a mouth full of toothpaste, at least you think and you understand Jason was looking for a way to get you to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stops and you hear he starts brushing his teeth too. \"By the way,\" Mike asks, \"heared your team got themselves a tiny. How does that work. He can't outswim you, he can't carry the towels around. It seems useless to make him compete.\" Jason answers, \"actually he outswam coach, even though coach gave him a headstart of half a pool.\" Mike grunts, \"impressive, there was talk about him joining the cycling team, none of us looked forward to that. You know I'm far from a sizeist, but I believe that tinies should have their own teams, just like we have separate teams for men and women.\" Jason grunts an affirmation, \"I know, but he told me he's gonna get kicked out of school if he doesn't belong to a team.\" Mike snorts, \"stupid rules, I'll bet by being forced to play with the giants he will end up being scooped up and eaten, or crushed. Probably the whole point of the principal. He never hid the fact he hates tinies.\" Mike spits, \"I think they can be rather useful. There's a few of them working at that massage place and their tiny hands can really get to the core of the muscle with accupunctural precision. And some of them work in plumbing or do work with cables and guiding them through tight spaces. My dad worked with one for a while. Best colleague he ever had. Never complaining and just getting the job done. And they don't take up much space in a van. And most of them are pretty smart, you know from staying in and reading all the time, little poindexters\" Jason spits too, \"Yeah, I guess, but do you see yourself working with one?\" Mike laughs, \"Not really, you know I wanna work in sports, so unless he's gonna be either teamed up with a real masseur or something he would probably just get in the way and end up as part of the equipment.\" Mike chuckles, \"Although I imagine it would be kind of funny to have one stuck on your saddle or something, poor little thing scared to death as your ass comes down for a ride, what a way to go.\" Jason coughs, \"you want to sit on a tiny?\" Mike laughs, \"I thought about it. My dad says it happened occasionally to his buddy. And they always turn up fine. They don't squash as easily. And well the idea of tormenting someone a little with my ass, does sound kinda fun for a while. But it would have to be consensual, I'd probably offer him some compensation for his trouble. But that's never gonna happen anyway.\" Mike pauses, but if you like you can invite your friend over to watch a movie with us, maybe he'll get used to being around giants like us.\" Jason grunts, \"I could do that, I got his number so who knows, I'll send him a text.\" Mike laughs, tell him tonight is dinosaur night, maybe he'll enjoy seeing normal humans run from bigger predators for a change. And that other guy from your team was coming over too right?\" Jason grunts, \"Right, well I'll sent the text and then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason starts walking again and after moving around, probably procrastinating to find a way to save you, suddenly you hear Mike yell, \"come on, GO GO GO.\" You hear Jason mumble softly, \"Sorry little guy, I really was joking, but I can't get you out anymore. Please don't hate me for this.\"</span></div></div>",

The walk isn't so bad but after a bit of rummaging around you hear the familiar sound of bike wheels. And suddenly one of Jason's legs swings up and you get first contact with the nose of his sadde in your back pressing you up closer to the warm package above you. You manage to slightly turn your head to get your nose and mouth free to breathe. But this is just the beginning suddenly Jason pushes of and you feel his legs moving swaying his waist a little side to side. And he leans a bit more forward pressing you deeper down and flattening the padding around you. The fresh air current that rises as he speeds up, can't battle the body heat that is radiating from Jason himself. And soon a light moist begins to form and trickles down in droplets of sweat, slowly soaking the padding and your face. Building up to a small pool in front of your face which occasionally doesn't evaporate soon enough, forcing you to take a long sip of fresh sweat to be able to keep breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours Jason finally gets up, it's over you cheer to yourself. \"Watch the bikes, okay? Be right back.\" Wait, are we only now at the store, the real ride still has to start? No, you try to struggle, but in vain. There is no room. And before long Mike returns and the guys hop on their bikes again. This time they speed up even more, it's more movement, more heat and unfortunately far more sweat. No every other breath you take you must drink down his sweat to stay alive. You even go as far as trying to jus give up and die, but your body won't let you. You feel like you might die anyway by drinking too much. You live for the few moments Jason actually gets out of the saddle, swaying side to side relieving some of the pressure, before ultimately crashing down in the saddle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way of telling how long the ride takes. By the end you feel more like a robot. Breathe-sip-breathe-sip. You don't even feel human anymore. But you snap out of it as suddenly the movement stops and Jason gets of his bike. \"Hell of a ride.\" Jason pants. Mike laughs, \"yeah, a nice easy one.\" Jason laughs, \"maybe for you, guess the new shorts work-out fine.\" Mike grunts an affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear them enter their apartment. \"Shotgun on the shower.\" Mike yells and you cry a little. But sooner than you think Jason strips of his pants and you get pulled away from the tormenting balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lifts his shorts he pulls the open and looks down with a concerned look. But he lets out a relieved sigh as he sees you moving. \"I'm sorry about that little one. But I didn't want to let Mike know about your predicament, you heared him talk. He probably would have wanted to wear you like this too. So I figured I was the lesser of two evils.\" You gasp for breathe. \"It's... O... Kay.\" Slowly Jason places his thumb's on either side and softly pulls on the fabric opening the tiniest of crack that you've been stuck in and with his index finger on your back he pops you out. \"Wow, I never knew that was there. Must have been pretty snug in there.\" You nod as he picks you up and places you on his desk. \"I guess it's a good thing you're still in your swimming gear, cause that would have been far too hot. You look down and realise you clothes and bag are still at school. Jason grins and pulls open a drawer getting a few tiny sized clothes. \"These where in a box of clothes someone donated to the second-hand shop my mom volunteered at once. I kept them here to bring to the tiny shelter, but I guess you're lucky I never got around to it. So you can have them... After we take a shower. Because you look like you need one.\" You nod. \"So how about it, wanna spent the evening watching some Dino movies with Mike, Butch and me? I can make something up about having to pick you up at the tiny terminal. Or you could just go home if you prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder, going home and forgetting about this seems like the best course of action. But in the other hand, if you're gonna survive in school it wouldn't hurt to make some giant friends.</span></div></div>",

As he closes the shower curtain and turns on the water you feel the spray just reaching you. And some of the water splashing back of of Jason's body too. You sit down and close your eyes letting the water run over you. Suddenly you feel. As you relax you open your eyes and see Jason sponging himself with your previous prison. You close your eyes again and wait for him to finish. After a little while he softly pokes you and you look up. \"Want me to help you wash?\" You nod and he softly picks you up and uses the sponge to clean both your back and front before turning of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps out and dries of, before putting a towel around his waist, softly grabbing you and I'm walking out. \"Feeling fresh?\" You hear Mike say. Jason answers, \"Yeah, and by the way the little guy accopted our invite, I'm gonna pick him up later at the terminal.\" Mike laughs, \"Cool, I like his guts already. Better get dressed, it's close to movie time already, Butch will be here in half an hour or so.\" Jason grunts an affirmation and takes you into his room. He places you on the desk and you pick out some clothes that fit you and don't look silly. Ending up with a pair of jeans and a bright green long sleeve with a purple streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason also got dressed, again in skintight jeans and an alone equally skin tight tanktop. He comes over and looks down, \"you don't mind riding in my pocket for a while right? First I have to smuggle you out before smuggling you in.\" You nod, \"sure, no problem.\" Jason lifts you up and slowly slides you down his right pocket as he keeps it open with his other hand. Making sure you slide in completely before letting go and letting you drop to the deepest part where a familiar scent awaits you. His musky groin. At least this time there so some fabric between you and his skin. As he walks you feel his muscled legs press up against you, but it's still the most comfortable place on his body you've been on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walks out leaves the house, walks around, you hear a lot of noise, he enters a supermarket buys some stuff and after a while you hear him enter the house again. He dumps the groceries and finally fishes you out of his pocket. You blink at the light in your eyes and suddenly notice Mike looking down at you. \"Hey there little one, welcome to our house. I'm Mike, Jason's roommate.\" You nod, \"nice to meet you, and thanks for inviting me. I would have brought something, but well, you know.\" Mike grins and looks at Jason, \"He's kinda funny.\" Jason looks up from his phone, \"Butch is running late... As usual, but he said we should just start.\" Mike nods and reaches down to grab you, hesitating at the last second. \"Oh, sorry, is it okay for me to pick you up to take you to the couch?\" You nod, \"Sure, bit thanks for asking.\" With that Mike relaxes and walks over to the couch, you in hand.<br>\r\n\"So where to you wanna sit, corner, middle or maybe the armrest?\" You shrug, \"where do you guys usually sit?\" Mike points at the corners. \"Guess I'll just take the middle until Butch arrives.\" Mike nods and sets you down, you get a good look of him now he wears baggy shorts and the band of his underwear stick out of then. His loose shirt is a bit on the short side, but he\"s fairly tall so that might explain it. He sits down in his corner and stretches out his legs on the coffee table. Soon Jason join you on the other side, both guys seem miles away and you do feel safe for now. As the TV comes on and the first movie starts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes in the doorbell rings and Jason gets up. Mike also gets up and walks into the bathroom. Second later you see Butch come in, wearing sweatpants and a sweater and walk over to the couch, Jason doesn't follow. Butch looks around and sees noone suddenly he turns around and starts to sit down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up to see the material of Butch sweatpants strain as he bends over and before you can react he plummets down right on top of you, squashing you into the couch. Thankfully seconds later you hear Mike's voice. \"Dude, did you just sit down on the little guy.\" Butch quickly gets up and looks back. \"Oh, sorry, didn't see you there.\" Mike reaches out and snatches you up, \"you okay?\" You nod, \"just fine, don't worry, it happens.\" Slowly Mike lowers you to the small armrest on his side. \"Probably should have out you there before going to the bathroom.\" You grin. \"Please Butch don't worry about it. You saved me yesterday from being sat on, so I guess this was just karma coming back to bite me.. with your ass.\" Butch laughs and relaxes, \"Okay, so if there's no more tinies hidden in this coach can I sit down now?\" You see him sit and Mike sits down next to you closer to the armrest now because Burch takes up a lot of space. As you look over at Mike you notice his legs ar at equal height with your seat and so the band of his underwear now rises up next to you as his pants sagged down. You could probably walk right up on top of him. You also notice his bulge making a pretty high hill a bit further on and his shirt crawling up reveals the lower abs and the well-groomes treasure trail you already tasted earlier. You focus your glance at Jason as he comes back and sits down too. And the movie continues. The rest of the first movie is soon over, there re plenty of snacks and Jason took it upon himself to give you a small plate full of crumbs. As Jason gets up to stretch his legs and order some pizza and Butch walks over to the bathroom you and Mike are left alone. \"Enjoying yourself?\" You nod, \"yeah, I love the special effects in that movie, way ahead of their time.\" Mike nods, \"and enjoying the swim team?\" You shrug, \"honestly, I like Jason and Butch okay, but am terrified of some of the others and of coach.\" Mike chuckles, \"I can imagine, there was talk about you joining us at the cycling team too. Some of the guys made bets on who would accidently use you as a saddle first.\" You shudder, \"how do you do that accidently?\" Mike shrugs, \"probably by others secretly placing you on each others saddle as a joke.\" You cringe, \"you would think that funny?\" Mike chuckles, \"No not really, I mean I would wanna know when there's a tiny man in my saddle and want him to be there.\" You shrug, \"I can't imagine why someone like me would want that.\" Mike grins, \"Oh, well some might do it for cash or protection. Or there's probably some who would do it for fun or as a favour to a friend.\" You shake your head, \"why would a friend ask you this?\" Mike shrugs, \"because he might be curious to how it feels to have a human on his saddle.\" You shrug, \"but you wouldn't feel him through the padding, right. So it would make more sense to have them in your shorts.\" Did you just imagine this or did his junk just twitch? Mike grins, \"you might be right there, I never thought about it like that. But do you think a tiny could survive inside of the pants.\" You try to not answer to quickly. \"I think so, but to do something like that, you'd have to be close and to be honest, it would probably help if the tiny is acquainted with the giants body, taste and scent.\" Mike nods, \"sounds about right. But how do you acquaint yourself with someone's ass?\" You don't like where this is going and hope Jason or Burch will come back soon. \"Well, I don't know, probably by spending some time near it, and maybe under it. This time you know you saw a twitch. \"So let's hypothetically say, we wanted you to get used to my scent. For example when watching a movie like this, if you spent some time close behind my ass, you would learn my smell? And I could eventually slide back and out some weight on you.\" You nod slowly, \"in theory yes.\" Mike nods, \"and if we would do that often enough, you think you could survive in my pants as I take a ride?\" You nod and answer before thinking, \"if you did that tonight, I could probably survive your pants tomorrow.\" Mike smiles, \"okay, good to know.\" He pauses \"and if we weren't talking hypothetically?\" You blink, \"what do you mean?\" Mike grins again, \"what if I asked you, as a friend, to be allowed to ride with you in my pants, knowing that you can practice tonight?\" You blink, \"that's a pretty weird thing to ask of someone you just met?\" Mike grins, \"I don't like to waste time. You just think about it. If you feel like it you can slip back there during the movie. I just promise you I'll make it up to you somehow afterwards.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch and Jason join you soon enough and a little bit into the second movie the pizzas arrive and you all stuff yourself. After that you sit back and watch the second half of the movie. After the second movie Mike gets up to take a leak and after that Jason refills the drinks and the third movie comes on. An old classic movie of about 3,5 hours Jason explains. After the first five minutes you are already bored. But the guys seem to love it. You don't know why, but you figure a giant owing you a favour is a big deal. So slowly you get up and walk the few steps to the edge of the armrest. You observe the situation and figure you can grab on to Mike' underwear and use the saggy pants as footholds to climb down. You look up and see him staring at the screen intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the first few steps and it goes rather smoothly. But you didn't calculate the fact the curve of his ass , sticks out over his pants and it quickly gets harder to hold on, but you manage some more steps. Worst case you fall down and land on the couch right. On second thought you could have just jumped. This realisation makes you lose your concentration and suddenly you step int nothing. Trying to hold on to the slick underwear proves to hard and before you realise it you are tumbling down on the inside of Mike's shorts to the deepest point, right into the top of his crack, head first and the momentum slides you deep enough to get stuck between his undies and his shorts somewhere halfway down his ass is your guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now Mike doesn't seem to have noticed your presence. But you can't move enough to give him a signal, so you just have to hope he'll look down and figure it out. You breathe deeply and feel his musky smell fill your longs. It's really not so bad now that it's freshly washed. After a while something finally happens, unfortunately. Mike bends over forward to pick something from the table. First the tightness decreases and as he leans forward you slide down deeper untill suddenly you head and shoulders get stuck in a small strange ring? And you face hits something else than the fabric of his underwear. And as he leans back the ring closes tight around your arms and pulls you up against the new material, which also comes down hard on you steamrolling your body into the couch. And as he finally settles you face is wedged between to warm cheeks and you realise you are actually stuck in a hole in Mike's underwear under his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's cheeks twitch a little as he notices your form. But you don't think he knows it's you yet. Suddenly he leans to one side and you feel his hand enter his shorts and his fingers feel your form. Slowly they slide over you and suddenly push you in a little deeper, making you head pop through the wedge and slam into some silky soft pulsating thing. Before his hand goes back out and he sits down fully, clenching his ass a little to press you up against something you know is his anus.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while the slow-paced movie takes it's till on both Butch and Jason as you hear them snoring. Mike is wide away you feel due to his twitching. By now your face is covered is a slimy substance that also fills your mouth, slaty, bitter and faintly sweet when you slosh it around before swallowing. Finally Mike gets up and walks out of the room. Every step smears your face against the muscle in front of you, but finally he stops lower his pants and next his underwear before sitting down on the bed, as he sees your predicament he tries his best not to stretch the fabric to let you fall out. He gives you an amused look, \"I didn't know you had to be that close to get acquainted.\" You nod slowly, \"it helps, but you can get me out if you want.\" Mike grins, \"Yeah, you think after a little while you have enough of my ass to survive a ride. I'm afraid it will be a lot worse.\" You shake your head, \"I think I'll be fine.\" Mike grins, well thinking is not knowing. And I need to know you'll survive, so we'd better let you get to know me a bit better.\" Before you can react he stands up and pulls up his underwear carefully positioning you right under his hole again before pulling up his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks back over to the couch and you hear a sleepy Jason ask, \"where did you go?\"  Mike sits down, full-weight on you pressing you closer to kiss his sphincter. \"Oh, I out the little one to bed in my room. He was afraid to fall asleep on the couch with us. I promised to take him back to the terminal tomorrow morning before I go for my training.\" Jason grunts an affirmation, \"thanks I didn't think of that, just be scary around sleeping giants.\" Mike answers, \"he wanted me to thank you for the invitation and would like to come over again sometime. So how about it, one last movie?\" They wake up Burch and out on an action-packed movie to keep them awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or two later you are covered with sweat and grime as finally the movie ends. Butch gets up to leave and Mike and Jason get ready for bed. \"So, I'm probably off tomorrow when you wake up, so leave some cleaning for me.\" Mike says as he walks into his room and closes the door. Freedom is near you think as he drops his pants. But suddenly he bends over a bit and takes to small steps and you feel a second pair of underwear being put on over you. \"Don't want to risk you falling out. I know after a night of ass-sweat you're more than ready to deal wit the full cyclist experience.\" With that he crawls into bed and lies down on his side, the upper cheek presses down like a ton and pushes you deeper into the sphincter. Soon you hear Mike softly snore and realise this is gonna be a long night. Until suddenly his hole twitches an he lets loose a long fart. The hot air, combined with the long day and the temporary lack of oxygen is too much and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you need a second to remember where you are, everything is moist and smells like ass. You try to lick your lips and get the real taste. And you realise that right now your hole body will smell and taste like the inside of Mike's ass. Suddenly a loud beeping scares you and Mike groans and rolls on his back as you hear him slam the alarm. He stretches and clenches his ass for a second and chuckles softly. For a while Mike just lies there as far as you know, till suddenly his legs twitch a bit and you listen closely and suddenly you hear his breathing increase. No, you don't want to realise what's going on. But as his panting speeds up so does the movement in his legs and he softly clenches his ass a few times. The moment he climaxes, he suddenly clenches his ass so tight, your head is rammed deep into his hole, which makes him climax even harder. Finally Mike relaxes and just lies there for a while before getting up. He walks over to the bathroom, you hear him empty his bladder and finally he slides down his underwear and kicks it up to catch it in his hand. You act as if you just woke up and blink your eyes, \"Huh? Oh, I'm out... Thanks.\" Mike takes a whiff and grins, \"Oh, that's rank, I guess you're ready for the real thing. But I guess we must clean-up first and have some breakfast.\" He walks over to the shower and places you on the soap dish to undress out of your soaked clothes. Removing all the clothes, yours and the training gear, from the shower before turning on the water. The pure spray of H2O lightens your heart. Mike quickly picks you up and rinses you under the water and scrubs you with the sponge. \"There, all clean\" you give him a gratefull look, \"Thanks, wish I could do the same for you.\" Mike laughs, \"nah, I can wash myself, unless of course you want to help me clean my pits. They can always use some extra attention.\" You give him a confused look, \"I don't know how.\" Suddenly Mike pushes you into the sponge and rams it into his left pit. Slowly and deliberately he rubs you up and down, you tasted these before, but they wear a lot sweatier last time, so you don't even gag, after a while he transfers you to the other side. After washing his pits he cleans you up and places you back in the dish, before cleanin the rest of him. \"You're bad as a pit-scraper\" he jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his shower he steps out dries of and wraps a towel around his waist before picking you up and taking you to the kitchen. He prepares some kind of meal-shake and pours a little in a small bowl for you. You drink deeply and savour the taste, even though it tastes more like cardboard than actual fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gulping down his shake, Mike waits for you to finish. \"So... I guess it's time?\" You ask hesitantly after finishing your bowl. Mike grins and reaches for you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike grabs you and carries you back into the bathroom. \"You know,\" he says, \"I really want to thank you for doing this. I always wondered what it would be like to not just sit on a guy, but actually ride my bike with someone under my ass. Which as you may understand is probably only possible on a stationary bike with a normal sized human. So I guess that's why I'm probably a bit more pushy about this than usual. I'm really a nice guy and after today, I'll make it up to you somehow, that's a promise.\" As he was talking he took of his towel out on a shirt and pulled up his pants to just over his thighs. You see the rockhard ass flex as he turns partly to grab you without giving you a full monty. \"So please just say you're okay with this?\" His eyes seem a bit desperate. You shrug, \"how can I say no to someones dream.\" This gets you a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Mike lowers you around the back and places you on the padding of his new shorts they feel very stiff compared to the ones Jason was wearing. And second later you are pulled up agains the crack, gently at first you can feel Mike's fingers poke through the back to adjust your position to line up with the lower part of his ass. When he's satisfied he pulls firmly and you are smacked into the crevice. Mike grunts softly, \"oh yes, I can definitely feel you.\" You feel him adjust his front and tucking in his shirt. Then he starts walking with every step one of the glutes slide down on you, while the other slides up. Not too roughly, kind of like a massageroller. He fills a waterbottle and suddenly walks out the door. You hear the same rummaging as yesterday as he gets his bike. When he gets on you feel your lower body disappear in the crevice of the saddle but you upperbody remains mainly free. Jason pushes of and leans forward the shorts pull tight an press you closer to his skin. So far your current position is far more comfortable than yesterday's, but as Mike speeds up the movement of going right and left makes you slightly queasy, you close your eyes and try to find a rhythm, after a few minutes you got it and you just sway side to side even as Mike picks up the pace. You do notice though there's a lot less airflow around your face and it's hotter here than under Jason's balls. And then, the sweat begins to form, you realise every drop from his back will trickle down his crack right on your face before long. But before that happens the sweat of his ass alone is massive. You remember Jason saying Mike was a massive sweater and indeed he sweats so much it quickly stands to your lips and you start guzzling down the fresh sweat of Mike's ass and the flow only increases. Suddenly Mike gets out of the saddle and this position makes the pool of sweat cover you completely as you hold your breath soaking in a warm bath of sweat until he suddenly crashes down again and you can breathe again. The same routine keeps up for far longer than the day before. After a while you actually start to relax and get into the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems an eternity Mike slows down a little and finally stops and gets off, putting his bike away and entering the house. \"Wow,\" you hear Jason's voice, \"that was one hell of a training.\" I expected you back an hour ago. Mike chuckles, \"I was in a roll.\" Jason laughs, \"yeah, I can smell that.\" Mike laughs and walks into the bathroom. There he slowly strips down and you fall back on the moist padding. Slowly you are scooped up and placed on the now familiar soap dish. Soon Mike finishes undressing and picks you up to take you out of the shower turning it on. \"Just so Jason can't hear us.\" He whispers. \"You look fine, a bit moist but better than this morning.\" You nod, \"it wasn't all that bad. Hope I didn't throw you off.\" Mike chuckles \"not at all, it felt great. Better than I imagined, it felt so good I didn't want to stop.\"  He chuckles, \"maybe I could  get you to join me again sometime?\" You hesitate a second, \"well maybe, I guess I need to think about it.\" Mike grins, \"at least it's not a no.\"<br>\r\nHe takes you into the shower and cleans himself and you off. After toweling down he grabs you and takes you out into the common room in his fist, walking over to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike?\" Jason says and you hear him walk over. \"Care to show me what's in your hand?\" You gasp. \"Next time, be sure to hide his clothes.\" Mike lifts his hand and opens it. \"As I thought, so you did get him to join you for a ride.\" Jason and Mike walk over to the table and sit down. \"So, I guess there's a reason you kept this a secret?\" Jason asks \"I mean you did tell me yesterday you wondered how it would be and I didn't judge.\" Mike coughs, \"Yeah well, sorry, I kinda got embarrassed about it. But not anymore, I'm glad I did it. It felt good and the little one is fine.\" Jason nods, \"I wasn't worried about that. I mean I know he's quite resistant. I just wished you would feel confident enough around me to tell me about it and not lie to my face.\" You blink, \"So Jason, tell me... How did I really get here?\" Jason blushes but Mike looks intrigued. \"I accidently shoved you in my Speedo's and took you home Friday.\" Jason says, \"but how about you tell Mike how you met?\" Mike looks at you. \"I got stuck in the sponge Friday and you used me to clean you body when you got home.\" The three of you sit in silence for a while. Suddenly Mike starts laughing and soon enough you and Jason join in. Mike asks some questions and you and Jason tell the rest of the story over a few cups (and bowls) of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Mike says, \"it seems we have all done things that are pretty out there.\" You chuckle \"or in there in some cases.\" Mike shoots you a look. \"So where do we go from here?\" Jason shrugs, \"I'm not sure, I mean I guess I'd like if I said I wasn't wondering some things myself.\" You look up, \"like what?\" Jason blushes a bit, \"well seeing as you like \"helping\" out with sports, I wonder if you could help me with swimming or some other stuff, like working out at the gym.\" Mike chuckles, \"how would he breath in your Speedo's, but I can imagine the taking him to the gym part. I kinda feel cheated on the fact you scrubbed my entire body without me knowing. And I wouldn't mind your, support during next week's race. But I guess it's really up to you. I mean you currently live alone, so you might as well move in here. We can keep you safe and bring you to school and back. And spent some \"quality time\" when you feel like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second, if you say yes, you will get friends and safety, but must be willing to sacrifice you last shred of dignity and probably be a regular part of Jason and Mike's sporting endeavours. However if you say no, they will probably be disappointed and might not look so fondly on helping you out, even though at least Mike owes you one big favour. Carefully you think a bit longer before...</span></div></div>",

By then I think you might have rather been the ball.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looks at his watch, \"Guess we should get ready.\" He stands up and offers you his hand. You climb on and let you be carried into his bedroom where he takes out some clothes. When he turns around he holds op something black. \"These my good boy, are my trusty to layered compression shorts.\" He sits down next to you and folds them inside out \"but there's something special to these.\" He shows you a small loose seam, \"I almost wanted to fix this, but maybe now they can be usefull enough. Think you can fit in there.\" You nod \"sure, seems reasonably safe, a right fit to go in, but at least I won't fall out easily.\" You give it a look, \" but what part of the shorts is this?\" Jason grins, \"you'll find out after you crawl in.\" You shrug and climb onto the shorts the material is sleek, but you manage to get there, with a little help. You crawl in under the tight material, as soon as your head and shoulders are in the rest kinda follows, you feel around a bit and notice the inside is somewhat shaped like a triangle and you stretch your feet out towards the bottom and wiggle down a little deeper. \" Let me help you out,\" Jason says and you feel his fingers and thumbs near your shoulders softly jamming you down. \"Perfect.\" He says and suddenly the shorts fly up as he stand up. \" I was gonna out these on at the gym, but I guess I can see how it feels on the way there.\" Suddenly you see his toes pass in front of you through the slightly see through fabric, first the right foot, then the left. And next you're hoisted up before you know it you see his massive balls pass before your eyes and land on your feet and a second later the head of his massive cock lands on your stomach.and your face gets pressed against it a second later. \"Oh nice and warm. Don't wiggle too much or it might get even tighter in there.\" He chuckles. \"Oh and let's not forget about this part. Suddenly you feel something slide over your back before it passed down over your legs and suddenly snaps in place and a hard material slams against you back and pushes you even tighter agains Jason now you can taste his cock through the material. \"Trusty old cuo, wouldn't want a ball hit me there without is. And it also keeps little Jason in place even if he's not so little later on.\" With that he pulls up some other pants and soon enough start walking, nothing in the cup moves. \"So where did you out him?\" Mike asks, \"in between the two layers of my compression shorts under the cup.\" Mike laughs, \"oh that's gonna be awful when you play. Jason laughs too, \"probably no worse than in your bike shorts.\" And he leaves to get in his car. As he drives to the gym it already gets uncomfortably warm in you tiny prison. And this is just the start, you realise. Too soon Jason gets up and walks a bit before meeting up with Butch and they enter something that sounds like a dressing room. They talk a bit about everything and suddenly Butch says, \"it was cool of you to invite the squirt. Didn't think he would say yes after you almost sat on him.\" Jason laughs, \"at least I almost sat on him, you on the other hand...\" Butch grunts, \"Don't remind me, I still feel guilty. Poor guy, must have been terrifying to be sat on like that. Me and my big ass.\" Jason laughs, \"don't worry about it, he said he'd love to join us for another movie night, so he's probably forgotten all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men walk out and suddenly you hear the noise change again and realise they are actually in the game room or whatever it's called. And suddenly the game starts. First of you're glad not much can move. Because Jason runs around like crazy. Secondly the small confines and barely breathing cup make everything drip with sweat in the first few minutes turning into a steady trickle filling your mouth with the taste of pure dick. You have to smell it, taste it and feel it, because now the sweat makes things slide around just a little and his cock head teases your face the whole time. To your chagrin both of them are equally good, or bad, you don't know and the score keeps tying. Untill finally Jason scores the winning point. \"Wow, nice one, Burch says, first time you actually beat me.\" Don't you feel like a lucky charm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guys leave the room they take a break at the bar and order some juice. \"Okay,\" Burch says, \"I have to confess something. I did see him before I sat down. And I felt him under me, I wanted to ask him in practice, but it never came up and suddenly there was my chance. It made me feel really powerful to sit on something so small, knowing it had to wait for me to get up.\" Jason grunts, \"You know, I get it, bit maybe next time you should ask him, I mean you saved him in class, he might let you have a freebie.\" Butch grunts, \"yeah but how do you ask something like that. I mean, the guy probably feels threatened 24/7 and you just walk up and say, hey kind if I sit in you for a bit?\" Jason chuckles, \"be honest and tell him you want to feel what it's like and offer to keep others from doing so in class. He can weigh the ori's and con's himself.\" Butch snorts, \"almost sounds like blackmail. But I guess it couldn't hurt. Worst case scenario he says no.\" Jason chuckles, \"exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they talk about swimming and other stuff and you zone out until they get up and get back to the changing room. Slowly the cup is removed and Jason rolls down his pants. As he steps out of them he tossed them in this bag with his other sweaty clothes and zips it up. The smell is unbearable, but you manage, after a while the bag is lifted and suddenly placed in a car. When finally the bag opens.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly the shorts are lifted and rolled out Jason slowly folds then inside out, so you can slowly crawl towards the opening he holds up. As soon as your head and shoulders squeeze through you feel Jason grabbing you and pulling you out the rest of the way. \"So did you have a good time? I could get used to feeling you in there, if you like it, even close the seam up with you in it.\" You give him a grin. \"Thanks for the offer, but I must decline, I promised my help to Mike too. But if he gets tired of me, and I get tired of running my own life, I might accept that offer. Jonas laughs, well, \"first we need to get you cleaned up and clothed in more than your swim trunks.\" He picks you up and takes to to the bathroom to rinse you off in the sink. As he returns to the living room you see Mike sitting at the table bend over a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate math.\" He sighs as Jason walks over and places you down. You walk over and notice Mark is stuck on a problem of the math class you finished last year. Due to not playing sports you're ahead of most students in most subjects especially math and the other sciences. Mike sees you walking over and leans back as you climb his notebook and walk around his answer. \"Agmh, here you go, you forgot to carry the one, the rest however is actually pretty good.\" Mike leans down and you jump away as he scribbles a bit more. \"Hey, now it makes sense. Thanks could you help me.out with another problem I had earlier? For the next hour you work with Mike on his math, until you get a slight headache from readin the large numbers and letters. You walk back a little and Mike sees you struggle, \"Yeah, I need a break too.\" He shoves back and gets up and carries you to the couch. Jason is already sprawled on one side his legs stretched out over the middle. Mike places you on the middle cushion besides Jason's legs and sits in the other corner also lifting his legs to lie behind you. You realise these guys are pretty comfortable around each other. I guess that explains they don't mind sharing time with you. Mike grabs a controller from the table and jumps right in the game Jason is already playing. You see them shooting at some random guys, you never got the hole shoot-em-up genre. Although you know a lot of tinies who do, playing together in a fantasy world at regular size. It does have some appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut watching these guys slaughter others is kind of boring, you look back and forth between them, but their focus is on the game which essentially leaves you stuck in the middle. Slowly you get up and walk to the back of the couch ducking underneath the legs and at the back you lay down and close your eyes for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes again, you notice you've been moved. Even if you can't see a thing you know you're not on the couch anymore. Slowly your eyes adjust to the lack of light and you see a monstrous shadow to your left. It takes you a second to figure out where you are. One of the boys picked you up and put you on their bed, next to their pillow. And they are sleeping there themselves. They even covered you with something to keep you warm. But for some reason you still feel freezing cold. You wonder who is lying there and you try to listen. You think you recognise Jason\"s soft snore. But you wanna know for sure. So you get up and walk a bit closer to take a good sniff and you recognise Jason's scent. You shiver in the cold air. When you look back you can't make out your blanket anymore. So you figure the only thing to do know is get, dangerously, close to Jason's body.as you start your track, you slowly come closer and notice he's lying on his side, his back towards you for a moment you wonder what would be a good place to go to sleep. You look back from where you think you came but see only dark. The pale sliver of moonlight you had is suddenly gone, probably a cloud, but you feel completely disoriented you can't even make out Jason's form anymore. You decided to pick a direction and keep walking till you bump into something, or probably fall of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little hike later you suddenly realise there is no more draft. You wonder why until after a little while you bump your head on something soft. You feel around and realise you probably started walking into the cave that was made by the blankets and Jason's body. This means that you are should probably head back from where you came. But all of a sudden the world trembles. He must be rolling over. You can't keep your feet and fall flat on your back. When the trembling stops.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the trembling stops you notice the blankets are gone and you hear shuffling of feet. In the distance the door opens and closes again and you get a glimpse of Jonas leaving the room. You are left in the dark. Completely oblivious to were you are. But you get up and start walking in a random direction. Suddenly you trip on a fold in the sheets and you feel yourself roll down a small incline as the door opens and closes again. You sit up a bit dizzy from the fall and roll and just a second to late you realise you rolled down the indentation of Jason's body before he unaware of you sits down on top of you. You are squashed under his cheek almost instantly. But the worst part is yet to come. He lifts his legs and turns to lay down full weight on his ass and as he turns his cheek drags you along and you almost feel like he's stretching you out and flattening you into a pancake. And when he finally settles down you realise this is probably where you're gonna be all night and where you will die, because you can't breathe. You can barely feel your arms and legs let alone move them your face is up right against the slick material of his underwear. Seconds pass, minutes too. You should have died by now from lack of oxygen, bit for some reason you feel still pretty much alive and warm. Your heartbeat seems to have slowed considerably, but every once in a while you feel a familiar ba-dunk. You wonder what's happening, it kinda reminds you of outswimming coach last training, something like a survival instinct kicking in. You also feel strangely calm, suddenly quite certain you will survive the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time, you suddenly hear the alarm clock go off and Jason groans and slams it. A second later he again turns his ass to the side finding you under his full weight as he sits at the edge of his bed before getting up. You think you might be free now but as Jason's cheek rises, you remain stuck to his boxers like a human shaped stain. The blood flow hasn't returned to your limbs yet and Jason starts walking after a while you can pull your head free and take a few breaths. You look to the side and notice Jason is in the kitchenette making some breakfast. You hear another door open and after a few seconds you hear Mike's voice. \"Erm, Jase, what is that stain on your ass?\" You feel Jason twisting to look at his ass as he pulls on his shorts. \"Oh shit? No no no!\" He gasps and slowly uses his finger to peel you off, as soon as you get loose you feel as if your body inflates like a balloon and you can breathe freely. A mere second later you feel pins and needles of retuning blood all over your arms and legs and you yelp. \"Are you okay?\" Jason asks, voice full of worry, you stop slamming your arms, look up and nod. \"Yeah, I'm fine, don't worry, it was a bit of an accident and mostly my own fault. You give a short explanation on what happened as the three of you shove down some breakfast. \"I guess it wasn't the first time I sat on you full-weight without knowing.\" Jason says, Mike follows up, \"yeah, but you looked really, really flat.\" You shrug, \"I survived, so lets forget about it and get ready for school.\" The boys check the clock and suddenly everything is a hassle to get ready in time. You wash yourself wit a bowl of warm water as the guys take a shower and you out one some of the spare clothes from Jason and soon the three of you are of for school in Jason's car. At school Jason races to the locker room so you can get your bag and next he takes you to the entrance of the tiny tubes that are mandatory installed in most public buildings to help tinies around. And you hurry to your first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter classes you slowly drag yourself to the poolside locker room. But you see no one there. As you run to the door, you notice no one in the pool either. And, no water for that matter. Suddenly a giant foot stomps down in front of you and you look up at the giant coach. \"Didn't get the message squirt? Swimming class is canceled due to a defective pump.\" He grins widely, \"but since I got a stack of paperwork to do, I might just be able to use you for something else.\" Coach leans in to grab you, but suddenly you hear Jason say, \"see Butch, I told you no one would have told the tiny. But we didn't need to worry, coach was here all along.\" At this point coach can't do anything as Burth leans in to pick you up. The two of them talk as they leave and you hear coach mumble some kind of insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a million guys.\" You say out of earshot. \"That wasn't gonna end well.\" Butch laughs, \"we knew something was up when the twins told us, they told you about swim practice. I guess you're one day closer to graduation once more in good health. Or at least something like that.\" You blink, \"Jason told me about the rat in your neighborhood and how you're gonna spent a few days at their place, for safety. So we came to help you move some stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you go to the tiny district. You have a room at one of the flats that house over a thousand tinies at the edge of the district, so Jason and Butch can actually come up to your balcony to help you move your bed, entire closet and your couch all in one hand, all you have to to is tie a rope around it so they can pull it out. It takes no more than 15 minutes and you tell the manager you have a mandatory camp for a week or so when he asks what's going on. That settles that. About an hour later your stuff is arranged at Jonas's bedside table. And you officially moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason invites Burch for dinner after all the hard work and Burch accepts it. Making Jason realise there's no food in the house, so he goes for a grocery run. Leaving Butch and you alone. You're doing some homework laying on your stomach on the armrest of the couch when suddenly Butch sits down next to you. \"So, close call with coach today, right.\" You look up, \"Yeah, thanks again for that, and for helping me move. I never moved so quickly.\" You say it before you think about it, \"If there's anything I can do for you, just let me know.\" Butch blushes a bit for a second, \"well there's actually something I wanted to ask you.\" You close your book and sit up. \"Sure, anything.\" Even though you already know where this is heading. \"What did it feel like to get sat on, by me?\" You think for a second. \"Well I felt even smaller than right now, weak, and the fact I couldn't do a thing about it made me feel very powerless, like you could sit on me as long as you'd like.\" Butch nods. \"So you hate being sat on?\" You shrug, not as much as being stepped on, but less than not being sat on, I guess, at least your ass wasn't the worst one I've ever had on me.\" Butch laughs at that. \"I can imagine.\" He thinks for a second, \"so, did you ever get sat on or stepped on, on purpose.\" You laugh, \"more than you know. Most people do it as a prank, some to really hurt you. I don't think it's all that funny, but at least prankers are the preferred sitters.\" Butch nods, \"I can imagine. So did you ever let someone step or sit on you in a... Consensual way?\" You nod, \"Sure, sometimes we tinies have to swallow our dignity to get something in return.\" Butch remains quiet, and you follow-up, \"I'm not an idiot Butch, if you want to ask me if you can sit on me, I offered you anything. So you could ask and I would say yes.\"</span></div></div>",

Well... Because I want to?\" You keep grinning, \"just to know if I'll survive? Or to feel me under your ass?\" He answers ar once, \"the second one.\" You nod, \"then pull your pants down so you can sit on me in your underwear, otherwise you won't feel me.\" You get up and jump down to the seat cushion. Butch grins and gets up, unbuckling his belt and lowering his jeans just enough to make his ass pop-out as you walk to the middle of the cushion and lay down. \"I'll get you out when Jason comes home.\" And with that he lowers his ass. He comes down on you hard and as his weight increases you realise he's a lot heavier than Mike or Jason, you should have guessed because of his broad shoulders. You feel him slowly wiggle a bit. \"I can feel you under me.\" You hear his middle voice, \"feels a bit weird, but also pretty nice.\" He leans back steamrolling you under his butt as it rolls down. \"I hope you don't mind me saying, but I feel pretty manly right now.\" He relaxes a little more and slowly his cheeks open a little and his crack lowers down on you giving of a manly scent of day old ass. Even though Butch weighs more than the others the fact he just relaxes makes you feel more at ease. You wonder what would have happened if you picked his ass to dive under in practice. After a while Burch starts clenching and unclenching his cheeks, slowly your arms as legs are being pushed tightly together and a second later he spreads wide and this lowers him even deeper and as he clenches hard his ass scoops you up and lifts you along with his underwear deep into his crack giving himself a bit of a wedgy and as he unclenches you fall back on the couch. You hear him chuckle. Next he shoves back and suddenly you feel the skin under his underwear change and so does the scent. you figure you are now under his balls. \"This feels nice too.\" But he shoves back again to trap you under his ass, \"but this feels better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he gets up again and turns to look at you as he pulls up his pants. \"Thanks for that little one. But if I don't let you out now I would probably sit on you all day.\" You get up and shrug, \"well if you ever feel like it, I guess I wouldn't hate it.\" Butch laughs, \"you think you could last a whole day under this ass.\" He slaps himself on the cheek. You shrug, \"sure probably. But you should at least wear to layers of undies. Butch gives you a look, \"Why?\" You shrug again, \"to keep me in place and it'll be softer on my back when you move. This fabric is kinda rough.\" And you point at the couch. \"So if you can do that, I'd let you sit on me a little longer next time.\" Butch grins, \"you have yourself a deal little man, you can come over some day and I'll stuff you between two boxers and keep you there all day.\" You tilt your head, \"would you mind using to Speedo's instead? I think I would like the idea of being in your Speedo's like that. Seems more you.\" Butch grins, \"fine to Speedo's it is.\" Suddenly the door opens and Mike and Jason enter together, Jason carrying groceries and Mike sweating like crazy from his training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch rushes to the bathroom to take a leak before Mike takes a shower. As Jason in unpacking and getting ready to cook up something Mike wanders over to you and looks down at you. \"You know what I could really use?\" He whispers. And you already know the answer. \"You could really use a nice relaxing shower with your favourite pit-scraper?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You have to think quick and answer, \"hm, I thought we should save that for a special occasion. Like when you win a race and deserve a price?\" Mike laughs softly, \"very well, I can wait till Saturday.\" And he walks into the bathroom leaving you on the couch. You let out a relieved sigh but are in a bit of a pickle. Jason and Burch are in the kitchen making dinner and Mike is in the bathroom, essentially you are stuck. You look around and decide to walk back to the armrest and after a few tries manage to get up and return to your studies. After a while you see Mike come out of the bathroom wearing a towel and walking past to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike is also the first one to come back and sit next to you, his back against the armrest so you are in the shadow of his body. You can't really read like that so you pick up your book and move to the back. Still to much shadow. So you walk over to his shirt and start to climb around till you reach his chest. He looks down and blinks as you sit down and open your book. He resumes playing with his phone and his steady breaths make your warm floor rise and fall slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Jason calls out for dinner and Mike picks you up and carries you to the table. During dinner the conversations are lively. You get a few words in, but you're voice can't reach over those of the others most of the time. After dinner bit before dessert Jason gets up and returns with a tiny Bluetooth speaker and a headset. Suddenly you can actually be part of the conversation. \"We should get you one for tinies.\" Mike says and you agree. Dinner is a homemade tiramisu that is finger licking good. After dinner Mike does the dishes as Butch goes home. While Jason carries you over to the couch. Putting you on the middle cushion as he puts on the news. A lot of trouble once more, animal attacks on tinies is always an item it seems, so the excuse of a rat around the neighborhood was a good cover. You look over at Jason who is sitting there one bend leg, foot on the couch arms wrapped around it and chin resting on his knee. His jeans tight around his leg and ass. You remember being on the inside of those and shudder for a second. But you also remember how nice and warm it was under his ass last night. You wonder if you could actually hold your breath as long if he was swimming. He probably would need to hide you in the front. Because the back would be to obvious in those tight Speedo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is broken a you hear Mike approach and you look back at the TV. Mike crashes down on the other side of you and stretches his legs out on the couch behind you. His shorts show of his calves and open a little as if inviting you to walk right in, but you realise, if you do, you probably won't get out, for a while at least. So you remain seated for now. After the news the boys put on a show of some kind about drugs and stuff, but they are in a few seasons apparently and you have no clue what's going on and get kinda bored. So you get up and walk over to the edge of the couch and look down. This seems a big jump for you, too big? Probably, so you look back at Jason. He shifted in his seat and now both his legs reach the ground. You walk over to his leg quickly and start to climb down. The few folds in his pants make it easier than you imagined. And you crawl under the couch and walk back towards Jason's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short hike you are now standing at the bottom of his bedside table. You look around and notice the electric cord of the lamp they out in for you and you climb up. This takes a bit of time, but eventually you are \"home\". You turn on the light a bit and get some books and return to studying. After a while you see Jason peek in and walk over. \"Wow, how did you get here?\" You look up, \"I walked.\" He grins. \"Right, so just a heads-up, Mike is gonna have his roleplay group over in about half an hour. So I guess It might be best to keep you out of sight the rest of the evening.\" You look at the alarm clock on the other table. Barely half past seven. \"Sure,\" you say, \"are you joining them?\" Jason grins and shakes his head. \"Not really my thing, playing pretend.\" You nod and ask, \"so you just gonna hang-out on the couch?\" Jason shakes his head, \"nope, I'm gonna go for a swim at the pool. We just got a message training is canceled for the rest of the week, lucky you,\" he winks, \"but coach asked us to still keep up some training. So I'm gonna do some laps. You can come if you like.\" You think for a second. \"I think swimming in a public pool is even worse, than swimming at school.\" Jason nods. And pulls open the drawer of the table you are on and pulls out a pair of Speedo's. \"Jason?\" You ask and he looks at you. \"I was wondering something. You know those things are pretty tight. So I was wondering if everyone would be able to see my shape if you stuck me in there.\" Jason grins, \"I wondered the same thing actually. I think so. But this morning. You were pretty flat after I sat on you so I could try sitting on you like that to make you... Indistinguishable if I needed too.\" You nod and go back to your books. \"If you want to try it, I can snap a picture and show you how it looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Jason's face and you can tell he wants to try it, BAD. You shrug, \"sure why not.\" Jason runs out to grab some stuff. He returns with the Bluetooth headset and speaker. He quickly undresses and puts the Speedo on. He slowly grabs you and brings you about the back. \"When he reaches you can see he snapped the headset onto the waist of the Speedo so it dangles in front of his ass. You dess down to your underwear too. He slowly lowers you down his crack and presses you in a little. After his hand retreats you hear him snap a picture. \"Wow, that is quite obvious indeed.\" You try to speak and hear your voice softly from the speaker. \"Can you push me in a little deeper\". He bends a little forward to open his ass and pushes gently on the outside of the Speedo before standing up. As he stands his cheeks try to kiss, but you are keeping them apart. You hear a snap of the camera. \"Better, but it feels a bit off.\" You think, \"how about flipping me upside down.\" His hand comes in and plucks you out, turns you around and pushes you back in a little deeper. Suddenly you feel your lips touch his hole, which quivers slightly under the kiss. Another picture, \"better, but it looks like I have something stuck in my ass, which I guess I do.\" You take a deep ass-ridden breath. \"Can you clench a bit?\" You feel Jason clenching his cheeks, which pulls you in tight against the deepest skin of his crack. \"Can you handle more?\" You try to sound as confident as possible, \"sure give it your all.\" And he does, the pressure increases a thousandfold and suddenly the muscle slide together behind your body and you almost feel like your bones are rearranged in ways impossible in the human anatomy as your face is rammed deep into the softer more flexible skin. And suddenly even more force is out on you as he clenches tighter. And now you now your body is adjusting to his body. Suddenly the pressure fades and you hear Jason let our a sigh of relieve. \"How does that feel and look?\" You say into his anus. And you hear him snap a picture \"nothing to see and honestly, it feels good, I can feel you stuck in my ass, without it bothering me.\" You grin, \"can you walk and sit?\" First Jason walks a bit and the cheeks roll over you side to side, the only movement you can make seems to be your head and it rolls back and forth over his sphincter. \"Feels good, but not too good, if you catch my drift.\" Next he suddenly sits. This opens up his hole a little and you get your face rammed into a more slimy part of his hole. You get a mouth full and swallow it with a bit of difficulty. His weight is immense on your chest, but not so bad on your face. \"Guess I can do this too?\" He gets up again. \"I just don't think I can swim like this. So I should get you out.\" You chuckle a little.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last one just shows his ass without any sign of you in it. \"This looks pretty natural right?\" You say and Jason nods. you look up at the alarm-clock, this whole thing took less than 10 minutes. \"So, I guess I have to choose now between staying here with the ights off, coming with you in your bag, or asking for Mike's help?\" Jason nods, \"That's about it, yes.\" you shrug again, \"I should've just stayed in your ass and risk swimming, but okay.\" A sudden knock at the door startles you and it opens but it'ts just make and he walks in. \"So you're gonna take him swimming?\" Jason shakes his head. \"I don't think I feel comfortable leaving him in my bag at a public pool. You never know what happens. Mike nods. \"Well, I guess that's true, but I was thinking and I'm not really a fan of leaving him here unattended when there's five other guys in the house.\" Jason nods too, \"But I have a solution, Butch is on his way, he forgot his wallet. So we can let him take the squirt for tonight.\" The bell rings and Mike leaves to open the door and comes back with Butch in tow. Jason got dressed in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna train tonight Butch?\" Jason asks and he shakes his head. I can go for a few days without swimming. Besides I heard you guys needed a babysitter. \"He walks over and offers you his hand, \"Wanna come home with me for tonight?\" You shrug again, but climb up on his hand. \"See you guys tomorrow at school I guess.\" You say before Butch closes his hand and shoves it in his pocket, where he drops you. As his hand pulls back the tight jeans smash you against his thigh as he starts walking. Apparantly he doesn't live to far off, because he walks home and sooner than you think a door opens. As the door closes Butch grabs you from his pocket and puts you down on the table. \"Guess you staying over happened a lot quicker than we thought.\" you nod and look up at the massive man, smiling a bit sheepishly. \"Just go and put on your speedo's, already, on one condition. You're not allowed to get me out till morning.\" Butch grins. \"You're wanna spent all night in there?\" You shrug, \"I can't over you all day right now, so I guess an all-nighter is the best I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButch almost runs off into his bedroom and comes back sooner than you could imagine, Wearing a very tight green speedo. \"I put on the smallest ones I had, so I can really feel you, I hope that's okay?\" You nod and suddenly he grabs you and opens up the green speedo's back to show you the purple speedo underneath, barely covering his ass and already giving him a slight wedgy. Without further ado he drops you in and pushes you down deep under his massive ass before letting the outer speedo snap shut which rams you against the purple speedo full force and presses you right into his dank crack. the purple speedo is stretched thinner than you could imagine and you fear it might tear any second. From the outside you feel Butch rubbing his ass and grunting satisfactory. This feels good. I can't wait to sit down and play some games. The first step warns you just how tight your prison is. The speedo's don't seem to move, but the bulbous cheek on your right presses deep against you as if trying to push you out through the green fabric. But as it recedes, the left side tries the same thing. It is only a few steps, but by the time he turns to sit you alread feel as if you're run over by some cars. And then he sits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Butch bends over the fabric stretches on both sides and presses you in between, Even tighter, you feel like your body is about to pop, but when you hear something snap, it's not you, but you wish it was. Because as Butch sits the purple speedo in front pulls inwards deep into the crack but due to the sudden lack of force in front of you, you are launched up agains it and dragged in with it. Feeling Butch's cheek close around you as his ass comes in contact with the couch. \"Oh, that's good.\" Butch sighs and next you hear him boot up a game console as he ignores your plight and enjoys himself with your body. Occasinaly shifting or clenching a bit. Soon you are covered by his ass-sweat and some of the grime of the day as it trickles down past the speedo. Finally after what seems forever Butch shuts off the game and get's up. And he pulls the purple speedo out of his ass and you get grinded on by his cheeks once more. Suddenly the speedo's together are lowered and you wonder what's happening. But as you hear Butch grunt and fart from above you realise he's taking a dump. \"Oh man, you feel so good in my ass. Almost feels like a shame to keep you in between those two layers, but I guess It's safer to not risk having you get swallowed by my ass when I fall asleep.\"You hear him wipes his ass a few times before getting up and pulling up the speedo's again. \"I hope you don't mind the smell too much.\" And smell it does, the smell of shit fills your nose as he walks again and suddenly sit's down turns and stretches out. A few seconds later it get's dark and dank as he pulls the blankets up and rolls on his side. As he bends one of his legs the purple speedo's leghole crouches back and slides into his crack and you get dragged in with it. Now you are stuck on top of the purple fabric and under the bare skin on he inside of Butch's ass. You hear him grunt a bit and suddenly the fabric under you is pulled back, but you grab on and try to get pulled out with it, which is only partly succesfull, because yes, for now you exit the crack, but you end up on the inside of the purple speedo's tight against Butch's bare skin.</span></div></div>",

Then he begins biking home at top speed.<br>\r\n\"What's the rush?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"I'm just really excited that you said yes to this\" he says smiling <br>\r\n\"To coming over to your house?\" <br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd do me a favour\" Daniel says as he gets to his house and runs upstairs with you to his room.

The two of you get FaceTime setup and then he picks you up in his massive hand. He sits up on his bed and smiles as he brings you up to his massive beard and mouth. He opens wide and sticks his tongue out. You step on to the giant pink muscle and feel it squish under your bare feet. You film as you walk around the mouth and Daniel moans. You approach the massive hole that is his throatand start to have second thoughts as you stare down. But before you can decide what to do Daniel flicks his tongue sending you in to the dark slide.

Ryan places you on a bench and then turns around to take off his speedo. You look at his muscular ass and realize you are getting an erection.

You see him step over you and duck to the side to not get stepped on. You hear him mumble \"Stupid, forgetting your bag. those clothes dont magically get clean.\" You turn around and see him pick up his bag and come back towards you. As he does he loses his grip and the bag slips from his hand. As it falls to the ground you notice the bag wasn't zipped up either and some of his gear spills out. Suddenly something green comes right at you, a colour you rememer from earlier. You have no time to duck away as the moist pair of workout shorts falls over you. All you can do is scream and try to crawl out as quick as possible. You hear Rick utter a cuss-word that makes your ears cringe and suddenly the shorts around you get balled up and are lifted and thrown back in the bag. At least you figure that's what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to find an opening to get out of your predicament, but everytime you find one in your dark smelly confines, Rick's jostling step turns you around and you lose your way again. Finally you decide to just give up and waot for him to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seems like forever you suddenly stop and get dropped. You hear a zipper being opened and all of a sudden the shorts you're in get lifted and unfrurl. You try to keep a hold of the smooth material but fail and suddenly you fall down a leg hole. You fear for your life but the fall isn't even that high and you land on something soft. Looking straight up at a surpised Rick. \"Yo, Squirt, what the hell? Did I forget to remove you from my short after my squats, today?\" You can't help but laugh a iittle, before you explain to Rick what happened. He chuckles softly before apologising, \"I'm sorry about that squirt, I thought I was alone in there and was just so stoked to get home. Today I got a new videogame in the mail that I wanted to try.\" He walks around the bed and lowers himself lying down on his stomach crossing his arms to rest his head on, only a few inches away from you, you feel his warm breath roll over you as he talks. \"Unfortunately the mailman is running late, so I have some time to kill. Guess I'm the lucky one to have a friend around to talk to. You look up at this mountain of a man, his lower arms are wider than you are high. But Rick has alway been a pretty nice guy, so you relax a little. \"Well I don't have anything better to do. My parents are gone for the weekend, so I was looking forward to have the house to myself for a while, but I can hang out here for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick flashes you a killer smile. \"Great, because I've been meaning to ask you something for a long time. Why in Hell would a squirt like you chose to be part of the weightlifting club?\" You give him a shrug, \"Honestly, probably because it was one of the few sport people actually expect me to achieve something.\" This makes Rick laugh, \"Oh, so you're just lazy?\" you nod a little, \"Yeah, I guess so, but it's also one of the few clubs where most are old enough to not get too hormonely driven.\" Again Rick lets out a roaring laugh, \"I see, scared of all those freshman who will just rub up against just about anything to get their rocks off.\" Again you nod. Rick gives you a slight grin, \"So it doesn't actually have anything to do with hanging around with big, muscled man?\" You shake your head, \"It's not one of the top 5 reasons to join this club. Those are being forced to pick a sport, it not being a teamsport, having nothing to do with balls that are bigger than me and the other two I said.\" Rick grins again, \"Well against all odds, most guys don't mind having you around. You don't take up much space, don't get in the way, and you have an excellent sense of humour.\" You blush a little. \"Also,\" Rick adds, \"You are probably one of the preffered spotters as you never lose count.\" You shrug, \"It's the one thing to actually keep my mind of things when being shoved down someone's shorts.\" Rick's eyes widen just a little, \"Do you hate it? I mean you never said, so we thought it was okay.\" You give him a grin, \"Well, it's not the best, nor the worst and besides, it's a really small price to pay for all the good things you guys do for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gives you a wink, \"Yep, it's all in good fun and a bit quid pro quo, we pick on each other just as much, shoving our swety clothes in each others faces and stuff. we're just a bit rambunctious.\" you laugh, \"Yeah, I noticed, so I never took it too personal.\" Rick nods, \"Good to hear.\" You tilt your head, \"Can I ask something?\" RIck nods, which looks kind of awkward in his current position. \"Why do you do it? I mean, shoving me down your pants? What do you get out of it?\" Rick blinks a few times and seems to think, \"Well to be honest, you can tell me exactly how many times I squatted or whatever. And well, it's sort of a funny feeling to feel you get close to my ass like that and even tighter with every squat. But funny in a good way, I can kind of tell if I'm squatting deep enough by feeling how tight you are.\" You chuckle, \"Wow, I didn't expect that answer? I was ready to hear a lot of things, but actually being usefull for something, I guess now I should mind even less.\" Rick chuckles too, \"It is like that for most of the guys. It's the same with curls, pec squeezes, push ups and a lot more. So you are actually a pretty valueable asset to our team.\" You grin and say, \"Asset, or ass-hat?\" A roaring laughter explodes from Rick shaking the bed and you tumble down rolling up against his arms. A he quiets down you get up and take a few steps back. \"See,\" Rick says, \"That's how you get us every time.\" You grin at him, \"Well, I guess, but I wish there was a way I would not feel so selfconscious every time someone shoves me down theit pants. Those first few minutes always scare me a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gives you a bit of a quizzing look. \"Why? I mean, we got some pamphlets about your people when you joined, they said you guys were nearly indestructible. Some kind of defense mechanism against dealing with giants.\" You nod, \"Well that's true, you could probably step on me and I'd survive, but it's still scary. And well I guess getting used to being under someone's ass, jsut takes a little practice. There are complete summercamps devoted to tinies who need to overcome these fears. But I never visited one of those.\" Now Rick chuckles, \"So you go to camp to have some giant step or sit on you?\" You nod, \"That's the jist of it. But the idea of some strange giant sitting or stepping on me made me never want to go.\" Rick nods \"I get that. I can't imagine it the other way around either, sitting or stepping on tinies you don't know just because they are to scared to have that done to them. It sounds wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you nod. And all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

But if this is important to you, I don't mind changing my plans.\" You are stunned for a second, but when you think on it, it does actually make a lot of sense, you trust Rick and well, you have nothing better to do. \"Well, sure.\" you hear yourself say. \"I think that might be fun.\" Rick grins and you say, \"Besides, you might not have to change your plans completely. Because from what I've heared of those camps, the giant just sits around a lot anyways.\" Rick reaches one arm down and it comes back up with his phone, he types in a search for one of the camps you mentioned and finds one \"Oh, look this one has an opening for a giant.\" he clicks it and reads the profile. \"Okay, it says here a giant's job is to keep the tinies on their body's for a certain time. Starting with a few minutes to about a full-day by the end of the week. You will be adressing their major fears. Which can be categorized as picked up, sat on or stepped on. No oral training will be given.\" He blinks, \"what does that mean?\" You give him a smile, \"It's for those that are afraid of being eaten.\" Rick looks at you with disbelief, \"Eaten? They eat you guys?\" You shudder, \"Some do.\" Rick's eyes flash a bit f anger as he mutters, \"Cannibals\" before he starts reading again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little moment of outrage makes you actually feel so safe with Rick right now. But you have to pay attention again as he asks his next question. \"So it says here one of the days is called 'switch-day'?\" You nod, \"Well you get assigned to one giant to get comfortable wit, but in the middle of the week you get one day with another giant to get used to dealing with different people.\" Rick nods, \"Makes sense, I bet we could get one of the other guys to help out.\" You blink, \"We don't have to do everything?\" RIck gives you a grin, \"Well, it says so right here. And I bet the other guys will only get jealous if I didn't involve them. But we'll see.\" Suddenly he lowers his phone. \"I guess you're right about not cutting into too much of my gaming time. From what I read, seeing as you're biggest concern is ass-related, all I have to do is sit on you most of the time.\" He chuckles, \"I guess I can do that.\" You chuckle too, \"I know you can, but I guess you didn't read all of it.\" He gives you a wink, \"Oh you mean the different stages of structure, movement and smell?\" You swallow a lump as he continues, \"I will train you so good, Using different pairs of pants, sporting gears and everything, I will give you a few farts probably and will even work-out to get you a nice and sweaty ass. And as for movement. I guess I could roll around or walk around a bit with you on the inside of my shorts. By the end of this weekend you're either gonna be cured of your fear or just be plain terrified of my ass.\" You can't help but laugh at Rick's devotion to this idea. \"Fine, you win!\" you say caught up by his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gives you a slight grin, \"Okay, but I don't expect anything less than your all. No weaseling out. Deal?\" He offers you his finger and you grab it with bith hands and you shake on it. \"Deal.\" you say \"And thanks for doing this, I think it'll be good for me and I know I can trust you.\" Rick grins, \"Well, like we said, it won't be much of a hassle for me, but I just want to help you out. And the only way how to get ahead is to push past the breaking point to stretch your limits. But don't worry, if it is too much we are supposed to have a safety word. So if you ever really feel like you can't take it anymore, just say... Lampshade.\" You raise an eyebrow and he grins, \"It's the first word I thought of that you probably would never use in a normal sentence.\" You just shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear something rattle and fall down the hall. Rick come up on his kees and steps of the bed. He walks of the get his mail you realise and he comes back with a brown envelope containing the afformentioned game. As he opens it you see him unwrapping an RPG-game, recently released. You never figured Rick for a fan of those. He almost squeals a little. \"Finally, I've been waiting for this forever. It got a 9 out of 10 for being a perfect mix of puzzles, character building and a lot more things I can't remember.\" Suddenly he remembers what you were talking about. he holds the game in one hand as he picks you up with the other. \"But I guess it can wait for now.\" You hear a bit of dissapointment in his voice. And you can't help but laugh. \"Rick, why don't you just play for an hour or two, I know you really want to.\" His face opens in a warm smile \"you're the best squirt.\" He starts to lower you down to the bed but half way there he stops and raises you back up. \"Wait. I mean, if I'm gonna go sit down to play this anyway...\" You finish his sentence, \"You might as well start my training?\" Rick nods. \"Exactly what I was thinking.\" He starts moving towards another part of his one room studio. As you look around you see a very expansive looking desk chair in front of a large tv and a couch next to it. \"So squirt, I usually sit in my gaming chair, it's got good back and arm support and a comfy seat. But maybe the couch would be softer on you to start out with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at him, I guess the gaming seat is fine, it does look cool. Slowly Rick lowers you to the seat of the chair. As he turns around to start up his gaming console and bends over to insert the game you suddenly get a god look of the gigantic ass you've agreed to spent hours under. Rick's jeans almost burst to contain two enourmous spheres and even through them you can see the dimples on the side. His ass is almost pure muscle, but you remember the muscles being covered by just the thinnest layer of fat and skin that this afternoon for example allowed your body to sink in slightly as he squated. A bit scared and embarressed you turn around to look at the chair around you. the foam your standing on seems firm, it doesn't even sink in under your weight. The back is made up of a thick cushion with several bumps to support back and shoulders. you walk a few paces down the seating area. it looks really clean and well taken care off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the music of the game-console booting up and you turn around to see Rick straightening and walking away. You follow him your eyes glued to the movement his cheeks make with every step. Wait are those gonna grind you down later this weekend? You shudder slightly. You see Rick get something to drink and to eat from his kitchennete and he walks back over to you placing the items on a nearby sidetable. Finally he picks up the controller of the game console and hangs it on a hook of the armrest. before kneeling down in front of you. \"You ready squirt?\" he asks, you hear in his voice he is kind of nervous about this too, but also a little anxious, either to start his game or start your training, you don't know. Part of you wants to scream, so you just nod. \"Okay, so how do we begin? Maybe these jeans are not the best way to start?\" You can't help but chuckle and feel a little more at ease, he's really trying to think with you. \"No, those are too tight on you, let alone on me.\" Rick grins and nods, \"So I was thinking maybe starting out with just my underwear on, so you don't have to face my ass right away.\" You nod, \"Sounds good.\" Rick gets up and undoes his pants lowering only the back part to free his boxerclad ass. \"Oh wait,\" he says, \"I've been wearing these all day, do you prefer a fresh pair?\" Now you can't help yourself from laughing, the tension is flooding out in a laughing fit that takes a minuter or two, before you can clear the tears from your eyes and look up at a grinning Rick, \"Man, I've been in your sweaty workout shorts, I think I can handle a bit of worn boxers.\" Rick grins. \"If you say so. Now why don't we start out by moving you all te way to the back of the chair right up against the back rest. It'll be a really tight fit, but at least I won't be sitting on you completely right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the back of the chair as you reach the middle you turn around you lay down on your back and place your legs against the back rest and your head sticking out into the seating area. You look up at Rick's face. \"Not really what I ment, I though you would start out standing up, but if this is what you want. Fine with me.\" Before you can move again, RIck turns around, grabs the armrests and lowers himself down to the middle of the seat. \"Ready or not, here I come.\" As you tilt your head up a little you slowly see his boxer clad ass shove in your direction. You bite back a scream, but before you can move the gigantic cheeks have levelled with your head and suddenly it gets dark as his ass blocks the light and you, perfectly aligned dissappear into his crack.You feel the slightly moist fabric move over your face  and slowly getting tighter and pressing you down. You realise the pressure isn't all that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntill suddenly the movement stops as Rick has reached the back. Before you completely understand what is happening It suddenly feels like the whole world falls down on you. You understand while Rick was moving he wasn't actually sitting on you full weight. But as his weight suddenly plummets down on you you can't help but scream as the air exits your longues. It increases even more as Rick sits up and leans back in his seat. You try to catch a breath, but suck in a nose full of his musky sweaty aroma and almost have a coughing fit. As his cheeks probably sink away deeper into the foam the place that has the least pressure is his crack, right where you are and it doens't sink down, but actually feels like it's trying to push you through his boxer even deeper in his ass. All you can move are your legs and only a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel you Squirt.\" You hear his muffled voice, \"I guess if you can kick your legs, you're still alive. I was actually scared it might have been too much for you. Just guve me a real hard kick if you need me to get off.\" You realise you can't even give him a hard kick, since your legs can't move enough. And still he seems to sink deeper.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the weight of the world crushes down on you all you can do is try to keep breathing. You realise you're close to hyperventilating and force yourself to slow your breaths, focus. what do you feel. Too much weight, soft fabric, leathery seat, too much weight, warm cheeks on either side, a soft spot of skin just at the top of my head. Wait soft, more room. You know what to do. With all your strength you manage to bend your legs to push agains the backrest and take one deep breath before releasing it all and pushing off as har as you can, the fabric actually help a little and you move just the slightest bit forward and suddenly the hard pressure on your face is lessened immensely as this softer patch of skin takes it's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, oh god no, a softer patch of skin right under someone's ass? Don't think it, don't. ass-hole. You quiver in fear, if Rick blast-off, he might actuakky kill you. But you also realise you're trick worked, you are breathing more steady and suddenly the pressure seems high, but bearable. You remember ho Rick's ass smelled this afternoon after his squats and notice, when it's not that sweaty it's not really that bad. Of course it's no walk in the park, but you don't hate his natural musk that much. Suddenly you notice the sounds from the game, music and sound effects, all extremely muffled, but at least it's something, if you can notice things beside the weight pressing down on you, the time might pass quicker. You wonder if Rick will actually keep track of the time. You also wonder if dinosaurs actually evolved into birds as some scientist said in that dinosaur movie. And you wonder why they call these things boxershort, instead of undershorts.  You try to remember who Rick's closest friend on the team is, because if he invites someone it would be him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese things and thousands more slowly weave a thought pattern as unfocused on the weight as you can muster. Like a tapestry of thoughts woven into an armor against the pain and somewhat humiliation.Untill all of a sudden the pressure lifts and You are blinded by the light. You blink your eyes as they adjust and suck in a few breaths of fresh air. You feel yourself being lifted and suddenly stare in the smiling face of Rick, \"I'm sorry I lost track of time, So how where those almost three hours from your perspective? Wait, three hoursm but you here yourself say, \"It could've been worse actually.\" Rick gives you a grin. \"Wow, I guess you really are sturdy.\" You grin back. \"Was it okay with you?\" Why are you asking this. \"Well, did feel you when I got distracted from the game. But not in a bad way. Kinda nice to have you there to spread my crack a little.\" You chuckle, \"You were more comfortable because I was in your crack?\" He laughs softly, \"Different comfortable, the seat is always comfy with or without you. He moves a few steps and puts you down on the table before taking a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think this might help?\" You think on it, \"I don't know, I mean I now know I can actually take a lot more weight than I ever felt before.\" Rick grins, \"I can attest to that.\" you grin back, \"But I don't think I'm less scared of being sat on. because seeing your ass slide over me was like watching a steamroller roll towards you when your feet are stuck in the wet cement.\" Rick chuckles, \"You watch too much cartoons Squirt E. Coyotiny.\" you laugh at that joke. \"Well he is the master of being flattened, dropped, squished and what-not. He's like a tiny-idol, for he survives it all and still keeps his eyes on the prize.\" Rick grins, oh please, the coyote is probably just pliable, just like some tinies say they are. But I've yet to see you flattened and right there on that seat, if you could be flattened, you would have been.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, \"I thought pliability was just a legend amongst the tinies, I didn't know you giants new about it?\" Rick laughs, \"Oh believe me, there's a lot of people that wonder about it, also there are websites full about it. Some people even claim they found pliable tinies. There was this interview with one where he said something like 'pliability is possible for all tinies, it is just a state of mind and the willingness to give in to it.' before they flattened him by stepping on him.\" A total hoax of course. I'll send you the link later.\" You never heared of this before, you're actually really curious, you have heared similar stories about it. But in the tiny community you live in no-one ever believed it. Rick let's you finish your train of tought for a while untill you look up, \"Sorry, I was a bit distracted.\" He smiles, \"Don't worry about it. But well, I guess since it's close to five now. I need to run to the store to get some groceries. he grabs a notepad and writes some things down. \"So,\" he asks without looking up, \"Wanna come with me? Or would you rather wait it out for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a second to figure out what he meant, but seeing him writing full vigour and his cheeks a bit reddish you realise he's asking you to ride in the back of his pants. You shrug, \"Might as well get it over with.\" Rick stops writing and gets up. as he slowly undoes his pants again  he turns around lettling you see him almost scrape his jeans down over his ass from very close-up, before he drops them to his anckles. He slowly lowers his baxers a bit before reaching around and soflty pressing you into the top of his crack. \"Sorry to put you in my undies this time, but it's the only way I can make sure you don't fall down my pants.\" He pulls up his shorts and you hear the elastic snap shut. Both of you probably didn't anticipate what would happen as he bends over to reach for his pants. The cheeks spreading just enough for you to sink in a lot deeper. When he straightens again and the cheeks close around you you realise just your head is poking you, Suddenly it gets dark. With a frightening jangle you hear him close his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could have prepared you for the first few steps.As his first leg stretches out the cheeks close down hard before rubbing agains you, opening just a little as his next step makes his foot pass the first before slamming tight again.after a few steps you hear him say, \"I can feel your pretty good and you feel firm and not squished, so I think you'll manage.\" You hear him open the door the next part is the worst so far as he starts to walk down some stairs. You almost scream again, but  instead try to think of other things. However all that goes through your mind is the same sentence over and over again: \"it is just a state of mind and the willingness to give in to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rick starts walking down the street you keep thinking about giving in. You allow his muscles to guide your body, instead of resisting to them. You hear him enter a store, \"Keep giving in\". He starts to shop reaching, bending, squatting down, \"Give in to it.\" Walking back. \"Keep giving in.\" Ascending the stairs again, \"Just give in to it.\" Opening the door and walking into his apartment. \"Just give in.\" Finally he undoes his belt and you see the shorts  lower again. His fingers reaches down his crack to lift you up and he returns you to the table, where you just collapse. \"Are you okay?\" Rick's voice sounds really worried, so you get up and give him a thumbs-up. \"Yeah, sorry, just a little case of a sleeping arm.\" You shake your arm  to make it convincing. It wouldn't support my weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick doesn;t look totally convinced but starts to put away the groceries, Before turning on the oven and slicing up an apple, mincing part of it just for you.You graciously accept and say, \"Thank you counselor Rick, you're the best.\" This nets you a laugh and seems to put Rick's mind at ease. After finishing his part of the apple he shoves some dish in the oven. before sitting down again. \"So on my way to the store some of the guys sent me an app to see if I wanted to hang out tonight and watch a movie or two.\" You munch on your apple and waith for him to go on, \"So I told them I was hanging out with you tonight at my place. They asked if they could join us.\" You take your time to chew and swallow, \"Which guys?\" you ask. \"Rowell and Michael.\" is the prompt answer. You think on those names, Rowell was the first guy to actually sit and fart on you, pretty normal guy, a bit smaller than the others, black bushy hair and a bit misschievous. Michael was a tall, broad and silent type, shaved head and more lean than bulky, but still amazingly strong. He did give you a slight smile every now and then, but he is actually one of the few you can't remember ever touching you. \"Sure, just tell Rowell to leave his farts at home.\" Rick shoots you a grin and gets out his phone, After sending a message it almost instantly beeps. \"I think Rowell is gonna apologise for that again tonight.\" You grin wickedly, \"I'll make him grovel.\" Rick laughs out loud. After his laugh dies down you tilt your head. \"Are you sure Michael wants to hang out with me? I thought he didn't like me very much, he never comes close to me or anything.\" Rick chuckles, \"Michael is way too scared to hurt you, He is pretty clumsy at times. But maybe tonight you can get to know him. He's a pretty cool guy.\" You think on it for a minute, \"So is this gonna be the part of camp were you encourage me to switch?\" Rick chuckles, \"It could be. Or you could just hide down my pants and I'll tell the guys you cancelled last minute.\" you shake your head, \"I don't want to make them think I cancelled because of them.\" Rick nods, \"They probably would think that.\" You give him a smirk. \"And you're not gonna let me get off without me saying a certain word and ending camp completely.\" Rick just grins. \"Where is Sofie, when you have to make a choice.\" Rick grins some more before saying, \"Well I guess now all you have to do is pick your doom.\" You shrug, \"Michael first.\" Rick looks at you quizically, \"That easy?\" You nod, \"He probably won't do it, so than I don't have to get under Rowell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved by the kitchen timer.* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You barely managed to finish your meal before the doorbell rings, \"Doomed by the bell.\" Rick says with a grin as he gets up to let the others in. \"You're early.\" Rick says as a second later the three guys explode from the hall into the small studio. Rick guides them to the small table and they sit down as he finishes his meal. You wipe your face clean and turn to the others, \"Hey guys.\" Rowell and Michael look down and give you a smile. \"Wow, I never knew tinies actually hung-out with giants out of school and other forced situations.\" Rowell says with a grin. You shrug, \"Well I'm not sure what other tinies do, but I'm here.\" Michael chuckles at your matter-of-fact manner of talking. Rowell stammers a bit, \"I didn't.. I mean.. I'm not a sizeist or anything.\" You give him a stern look, \"That's why you were the first to sit and fart on me I suppose.\" Now Michael really lets out a laugh as Rowell's face turns beet-red. You can't hold a straight face and crack a smile. \"Don't worry about it Rowell, we're okay. You carried me to class in exchange remember.\" Rowell shakes his head. \"Yeah, I remember, And I'm sorry if I made you feel, well, small.\" You chuckle, \"It's okay, It was just pretty scary to see someone's ass suddenly come down on me like that. I didn't have much experience with giants like that.\" Rowell nods, \"Yeah I get that now, but we got these pamphlet thingies that said you could take it.\" You shrug, \"Can and want to, are actually two different things.\" Rowell nods in consent and you look back at Rick who is giving you a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm actually glad you guys came over.\" Michael and Rowell look at you questioningly as you continue. \"Well earlier today I was talking with Rick about how I, like many other tinies have a form of fear. My biggest fear, which you couldn't have known Rowell, is being sat on.\" Rowell has to swallow a lump, but you continue before he can say anything, \"So, Rick has offered to help me get over this fear at least somewhat.\" You pauze for effect. \"And we think the best way to do this is actually facing those fears head-on.\" Michael clears his throat, \"You mean face your fears of being sat on, by being sat on?\" You nod and Michael whistles softly, before saying, \"There are camps for that, right?\" You nod a bit impressed, \"Yeah, but only during the summer and quite expensive. And you might end up with a giant you don't like at all.\" Michael nods. \"So instead you figured you could probably get the same therapy at home with the giants you are familiar with, that makes sense.\" You realise Michael used the plural form in that sentence, as you nod. \"Pretty much yeah. So this afternoon Rick offered his... help. that is actually why I'm here. And well, since now the two of you are here too. I was wondering if you might be willing to assist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell's eyes were growing with every word. Michael remained pretty stoic as always and was the first to react. \"So Rick has been sitting on you with his full weight?\" Both you and Rick nod. \"That's pretty impressive. So now you know you can handle it, why do you think you need more time?\" You answer, \"Because it's still scary. Maybe a little less now, but knowing one person can sit on me for a little while is not enough to erase all that fear.\" Michael nods, \"I have one condition. I brought this 2 hour movie to watch it. And I don't intend to get up from the first screen to the last line of the credits.\" You take a big gulp. \"I agree to that.\" Michael shoots you one of his rare smiles. \"Good. I might also like to learn that you can handle yourself, because I've been way to scared to hurt you. But if this experiment is succesfull, we might both benefit.\" Rowell pouts, \"So wait, Rick gets to sit on you and now Michael. I feel left out.\" You grin, \"You already had your turn, it's not my fault you were so quick to get up.\" Both Michael and Rick laugh, as you continue, \"Well, I guess you can get your turn the next movie we end up watching together.\" Suddenly Rowell grins misschievously and places two discs on the table. \"Then maybe I should have mentioned earlier, we also brought the sequel.\" This gets a roaring laugh from both Rick and Michael again as you mouth just drops open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gets up and quickly clears the dishes. Next he picks you up the four of you move to the couch. Standing in front of it a bit sheepishly. \"So,\"\" Michael says, \"How do we do this?\" You look down and see he's wearing a pair of loose cargo shorts, at the same time you notice Rowell is wearing sweatpants, good to know for later. \"Well, you say\"I guess you can either pull up those pants or let them sag a little more.\" Michael decide to pull them up and offers his flat hand for you to step on. You expect him to reach around but he starts to sit down. He moves around a bit to get in a comfortable position before looking at you. Rick and Rowell suddenly seem busy getting the snacks \"So I'm gonna lower you so you can crawl in through the leghole and when you're deep enough I'll lift the left cheek one so you can crawl under and lay down at the right place.\" Wait... in his pants, but you just nod and suddenly you see Michael lift his leg up a little and you slide in the pantsleg all the way down before you bump into something soft and musky. Don't think it. Suddenly you feel the left leg and the pillowy thing in front of you lift up and you get down on all fours and crawl under the massive man. You try to find your way as quick as possible and after mere seconds you find the seam of the back of the pants. You reach up to notice you're just a bit to the side of the crack and scoot over. As you reach up again you don't feel anything, so you quickly get up on your knees to help you get higher. But as you straighten to quick you feel your head bump into something your small hand missed. And your head punches straight to a very small hole in Michael's underwear he probably never new was there. his leg twitches a little from the strain and lower. making the hole close around your neck as the strain lessens \"I'm gonna sit down in five.\" You hear Michael say and you try to pull your head out as hard as you can. \"Here I come.\" All you can do is stretch out your lowerbody , but this still leaves you in a seated position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Michael crashes down the small hole is pulled down over your shoulder, till about the height of your wrists, Your face comes in full contact with the deepest part of his crack and is scraped down along it as your upper body is forced into a flat position. In a reflex you opened your mouth to scream and it is now filled with sweat and grime from Michaels crack. You feel him sitting deeper and deeper and wiggling just a little and than it's over. \"See you in two hours.\" You hear him say and suddenly the couch trembles once... twice as the others sit down. You feel Michael adjust his seat, opening his legs a little as the cheeks close in on you. And then... silence as all you can her is the start of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the next two hourse you suddenly realise how much sweat a regular pair of underwear soaks up. Because locked in side of it you are that barrier between sweaty skin and absorbing fabric. Also the fact there's skin to skin contact makes the pore in his ass seem even more convinced they have to produce as much sweat as possible. After a mere minuters you are soaked, sweat filling your eyes, your nose and your mouth. You almost feel like you have to guzzle down gallons of it just to breath. Michael seems so invested in this movie you know you're only way out is for it to end or a total black-out to turn of the tv. The fact it's a horror movie doesn't increase your happiness as apparantly Michael is a clencher when something scary happens. You guess the movie is about halfway through when suddenly you feen Michael lifting on of his legs and seconds later he tugs a bit on his boxers. the final tug pulls it down just a bit more, you coming with it and when he crashes down again you're faced with a face full of quivering sphincter. Almost immediatly you get a full taste of it and feel like gagging. But even if you could move you'd be to scared, what would happen if you irritated this part of him. Horrorstories on the internet about being sucked in fill your mind. So all you do is lay back, pray for daylight and guzzle down his assjuices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems an eternity you hear the end credits roll. You can't wait to be freed. But Michael tells the guys to let the credits roll. After that he leans forward making you kiss his hole one last time as you feel him reaching in and grabbing your legs. Softly tugging on them as he stands up. the strain on the short of him standing up is enough combined with the tuck to slip you out of the hole in his boxers and out of the back. Michael brings you around and sees you gasping for air. \"Wow, I guess I can sit on you wothout actually hurting you too much, that's really good to know. Thanks.\" Still trying to catch your breath you just give him a thumbs-up. Slowly Michael sits down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment...</span></div></div>",

You thankfully down it, still not getting the tast of Michaels ass out of your mouth completely. But the refill makes it a little better. Michael chuckles a bit. \"So are you a little bit less afraid now?\" You clear your throat. \"It helped a little, thank you. Having to crawl under there myself was pretty scary, but since I did it anyway I guess i'm at least not frozen by fear to be sat on.\" Michael nods, \"Well that's good to hear.\" You tilt your head, \"I just hope I didn't cause you any discomfort.\" Michael grins. \"Don't worry about it, It was a bit weird to feel you under there, it almost felt like you were actually in my underwear, but I guess I can see why some of the guys like it. It's not really my thing I think, but if you ever need some more training, I guess I don't mind helping you out.\" He finishes with one of his smiles and you smile back. \"Thanks, I might take you up on that one day. So how was the movie.\" Michael blinks at your change of subject but goes along with it, \"Actually pretty damn scary, If I didn't have to keep it in on your behalf I might have soiled myself.\" You laugh at his return. \"Well thanks for keeping it tight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick passes you some crushed chips which you eat and another glass of water. You stand up and look over at Rowell. \"I guess it's time to keep up my end of the bargain with you too.\" Rowell grins, \"Really, you don't have to right now, I can wait a little longer. Maybe you've had enough training for one day.\" You shake your head, \"Right now, I think it's best to keep going one more time, just to keep momentum. But if you don't feel like it, maybe one of the others will.\" Rowells grin turns into a smile, \"Well if you're sure you can handle it. There's enough room for two in these pants.\" Michael passes you to Rowell and he and Rick get up to give the two of you a private moment. Rowell leans in close and whispers. \"Just one problem.\" You look up at him. \"I'm wearing a jockstrap. so my ass isn't covered.\" you did not see that one coming. \"So maybe I can place you a bit more to the front so my covered balls are on top of you instead?\" You think on that for a sec. \"Sounds good to me, so feel free to put me in.\" Rowell looks at you with a strange look, \"Are you sure, I mean I guess it's a different way of training.\" You laugh at the sudden insecurity, \"I'm sure it's not just an ass that can land on me.\" Rowell grins, \"Oh, I think I'm gonna like this even better.\" Suddenly he lowers you down and you see him open his sweatpants AND pull back the elastic of his jockstrap. Oh no, he misunderstood the 'just put me inside'-remark. But before you can act his hand reaches down and you get a glimps of his cock as he pushes you down head first past his balls to the bottom of the jockstrap. Your head ends up at the lowest part right near the place where the fabric stops and the elastic is attached. the rest of your body is spread accros the fabric. As soon as Rowell's hand pulls back. His monstrous ball tumble down on top of you one on each side. And mere seconds later the fabric pulls tight and presses you up between then in the folds of his sack. You face feels almost glued to Rowell's taints and as he sits back all his weight seems to rest on that small part of him. Slowly he moves his legs a bit and this make your face scrape over his skin. apparantly he doesn not hate it, because he does it a few more times before the others join him and he sits still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie starts up you soon learn that Rowell really is a bit of a twitch. He keeps leaning to one side or the other, jostling his leg a bit. Which continuously scraps your face across his taint, by the fourth time you can't help but wonder and open your mouth and stick out your tongue. To your surprise the taste is actually quite nice. You can't describe it. Just plain manly, a bit of sweat, musky, but also a little sweet. You can't help yourself and press your tongue against his taint, waiting for another move, which soon comes and you actually start to enjoy yourself. Even though you realise your lower body is now completely drenched in ball-sweat. Even though your head feels like it might burst if he put just a little more weight on it. Even though Rowell probably doesn't even notice how uncomfortable you should be. Even though time just doesn't seem to pass here and all you do is wait and lick and lick and wait. You wonder why. Are you maybe getting high on his taint-sweat? Does every man taste as good down there? Would the tast be even better after working out and a bit more sweaty? All these thought race through your head as you let yourself be dragged across this mans taint. Giving into it. feeling like just a piece of his jockstrap. Giving in sounds so good right no. And slowly you almost feel your body melting against the fabric. Wait what? You snap out if it and your body feels reformed and normal again. Wait reformed? Did I actually flatten? No it's just my imagination and these fumes. And all of a sudden you hear the credits roll. Wait has it been two hours already? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Rowell's hand reaches in and scrapes you up, pulling you back up again giving you a glimpse of his rod of wonder. Before getting out in the fresh air. \"Wow, and he's still alive.\" Rowell grins. \"Hope it wasn't too bad for you.\" You shrug \"no worse than the others\" Rowell grins, \"Good to hear it. I actually barely felt you down there, just one little part rubbing up against me.\" Oh god, he knows. \"Yeah, that was my face, you kept scraping it along. I guess it was a bit itchy.\" Rowell gives you a grin, \"Yeah, just an itch. Guess you are better trained at this than me. He reaches forward and places you on the table before getting up. \"But I guess it's about time I went home. Will you walk me Michael, after those movies I'm too scared to walk alone.\" Michael chuckles and gets up, I guess I can do that, you know, as we live in the same building.\" They say goodbye to you and tell you they hope to see you soon again. And Rick leads them to the door. When he retunrs he lays down on the couch on his side and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the first day of camp, aye.\" you nod, \"I'm completely wasted.\" Rick grins, \"I can imagine, but I guess the guys had fun.\" You shrug, \"Good for them, to me it wasn't all that great. But at least I think I'm already a lot less scared of being sat on.\" Rick chuckles, \"Good, I guess tomorrow your training will intensify. Cause I was planning to go to the gym to work up a sweat. I thought you could join me and find out I've been holding back all this time.\" You wave away his comment. \"I don't buy it. You always sweat a lot.\" Rick just grins. \"Well, I guess tomorrow you'll understand why I usually wear to layers before going to the gym. If you don't believe me I can put you right up into my ass and drown you.\" You can't figure out if the guy is serious or not, but you're not about to back down. \"Pft, I think your bluffing, and if you're not I'll gladly eat my words and wash them down with your sweat.\" Rick chuckles. \"It's a bet mister. too bad you're gonna lose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gets up and picks you up to move you to the bed. He places you down next to the pillow and grabs a pair of fresh underwear from a drawer. \"I'm sorry I don't have a tiny sized blanket, but this might do the trick, unless you'd prefer a sock?\"<br>\r\nYou shrug and he tosses the pair next to you as he undresses giving you a very close look of his bulging muscles. Trunklike thighs, eight-pack abs and pecs for days. And his arms, like steal cables. You quickly return to folding your bed. And are ready just as Rick lays down. The bed creaks a bit under his wait and he turns on his side to look down at you. \"Okay, it's pretty weird to see someone snuggling up in my undies. Even if they are clean.\" you give him the finger, \"It was your own idea, so turn of the light and go to bed. Rick pulls a cord above the bed and the lights go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there in the dark for a while thinking.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few minutes you just try to get comfortable, but you just can't. There's this gnawing feeling in the back of your mind and you keep tossing and turning. \"You sure make a lot of fuss for such a squirt.\" Rick chuckles. \"I'm sorry,\" you answer. \"Something on your mind?\" Rick asks. You think for a second. \"Yeah, I was wondering, could you show me that video of that pliable guy.\" Rick yawns, \"Right now?\" You grunt, \"Yes please, It's been on my mind all day.\" Suddenly Rick's face is lit up by his phone and he searches around a bit. rolling over and placing the screen against the headboard. You see it's playing a video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the video you see a tiny man sitting on a desk, being interviewed by a giant. They talk about life as a tiny and fears of being squished. It's pretty boring stuff, until after a while the interview adresses the ability of tiny bodies to withstand a lot of pressure. It's starts to get pretty technical and deals with comparing tinies to actuall bugs and lobsters, who also have immense durability due to a form of exo-skeleton. apparantly some research shows that tinies have a higher skin cell count in comparison than most giants. Also their physique is sligtly different in make up, being more flexible and aimed for survival of the most harshes of circumstances. For example tinies are better suited to extreme temperatures bith hot and cold than giants due to their builds. They tend to sweat less as their bodies internal workings are more efficient in certain ways. They do not burn as much calories and for some reason they tend to build up muscle tissue more easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are compared to ants that learn to carry several times their own wait. Which apparantly is something some tinies learn to do. But it also states that in contrast to ants, most tinies also differ slightly from eacht other, which has to do with cross-breeding like most mammals do, instead of being offspring of a single queen. There is some talk about how breeding programs might be used to evolve tinies to extreme levels, but of course this is just speculative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother example given is some tinies resistance to different chemicals and reactions like acid or fire. Suddenly the questions get more personal as the tiny in question is asked if he has some special tiny powers. At first the man hesitates and avoids the question, but after a while he gives in and tells the interviewer a bit about himself and also ensures the audience that even if there are certain things he can do, not all tinies are capable of doing so. And after a long lecture about it he finally admits he is somehwat pliable. The interviewer laughs at that and waves it away. which the tiny accepts and goes on. But a minute later the interviewer returns to the subject and asks for an example. Again the tiny man tries to change the sibject, but due to the harsh questions he finally agrees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see him ask to be put on the ground and how he will allow the interviewer to flatten him underfoot. Now it's the interviewer that seems taken a back. But finally it does happen. The tiny is put down and the interviewes slowly lwers his foot on top of the tiny, placing his weight on him. The camera zooms in and as the foot is removed the tiny man seems like a steamrolled cartoon character but is already puffing out again to return to his normal form and gets up unhurt. After being returned to the desk the interviewer asks about it, how it feels and how he does it. Here finally the sentence is uttered: 'It is just a state of mind and the willingness to give in to it'' afterwards he explains it does not hurt as much as you might think, but he does feel something when it happens. But his body will enter a sort of survial mode and. heartbeat and breathing slowing down and stuff like that. Once again adressing the audience that it is a very rare condition and when tried at home it could turn you into an actual murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the interview is wrapped up and suddenly the screen turns dark. \"So, what do you think, total hoax right?\" Rick asks from behind. His voice coming from the dark but close enough to feel his breath run over you. \"I'd like to think so yes.\" You say but you don't sound certain at all. \"A lot of what he said did seem legit, about how some tinies are actually capable of 'miraculous' feats. But this just seems... fantastical.\" Rick grunts in affirmation. \"I agree, I think they are just trying to make this an urban legend by adding actual facts.\" you nod your head, realising Rick can't see you, \"Maybe so. But then again?\" You stop. \"But then what?\" Rick pries. \"Well?\" you add, \"Earlier today I did feel a little weird, and for some reason his mantra did help me endure.\" Rick chuckles, \"Starting to get all spiritual on me?\" you laugh, \"I don't intend to. But maybe just a little.\" You hear Rick roll over on his back again. \"Well, I guess as far as all of those superpowers go, being pliable sounds pretty bad.\" You chuckle, \"Why?\" RIck laughs, \"Well, super strength, acid resistance, or the ability to be smooshed and to not die. What use can you get out of that?\" You think and admit, \"Not that much I guess.\" Rick chuckles again. \"The only thing I can imagine it get yourself stepped on and stick to someone's shoe like a piece of gum to make travel easier. Like public transportation.\" You laugh at that. \"I guess it could be usefull for that. But it might be a usefull job skill. LIke with you guys you could use me as a personal trainer by just smooshing me on like a personal counter.\" Rick chuckles, \"Haha, or like a dietary coach. Don't eat that donut. Like having a Jiminy Cricket on your shoulder.\" You grin, \"And charge them and arm and a leg, as I have no use of my own.\" Rick chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent for a while, until you get stuck with one final question. \"So what would you use a pliable tiny for?\" It's out before you know it, and Rick answers with a chuckle, \"Nothing, I don't see any use of one.\" You chuckle too, \"Wow, harsh, hurting my feelings here, we tinies have our uses.\" Rick laughs out loud. \"You know I didn't mean it like that. I mean you're okay squirt, but first of you're not pliable. But even if you were, I don't think I could see any use for that ability. I never needed anything I didn't have or could just buy. But I guess if I had to answer something. I'd say emergency usage.\" You make a questioning sound. \"Well,\" Rick says, \"you know, like an emergency where you need something strong and I guess pliable.\" You try to think of anything. \"Sorry,\" you say, \"I'm drawing a blank.\" Rick chuckles, \"Well, not like anything horrible like emergency tissue or toiletpaper, but maybe for an emergency patch when you ripped your pants, or maybe a quick scrub in the showers when you forgot you sponge.\" You swallow hard at the mention of toiletpaper, but other examples don't sound to bad. \"A quick scrub? Dude, you're massive, it would be like a marathon to clean all of that.\" Another long silence falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's Rick's turn to return the question, \"So, if you were pliable, would you like it?\" You wonder, \"I think I'd feel a little safer, knowing I can't be crushed that easily, but the thought of being used as emergency toiletpaper isn't that tempting.\" Rick laughs, \"So you'd rather be a sponge instead.\" You chuckle, \"That would be a lot less horrible unless someone didn't wipe their ass before showering, than it would be the same thing, just a lot wetter.\" Rick laughs again, \"Well I don't know, I can tell you that my pits might smell worse than my ass at times.\" you're turn to laugh \"I don't buy it, remember I've been under your ass and it isn't exactly a rose garden.\" Rick answers, \"Yeah but you haven't smelled my pits they don't air out as easily. If you don't believe me walk over to them and take a whiff. or are you too scared.\" You get up at the challenge. \"Fine, you just promise to stay perfectly still. You more hear than see him raise an arm overhead to open his pit. \"I hope you're bluffing, cause I didn't shower for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you walk towards the pillow and edge around. You feel the matress sloping down towards the hulking dark shadow you see before you. \"I'm moving in.\" You say to alert Rick and suddenly you slip and land on your back, sliding down. You try to slow down but can't and end up slamming right into the bushy armpit hair getting a good whiff of salty and sour, somewhat stale sweat. \"You  actually did it?\" RIck chuckles softly shaking his body just a bit. \"You're one brave little toaster, squirt.\" You take another deep sniff and lean in a bit more feeling your face become a bit moist from the sweaty hairs. \"It's not as bad as you're ass.\" You say and lick your lips getting a taste of the bulky man once more. Somehow you realise the taste is very similar but yet slightly different from Rowell. As you lean in to get another taste you get a familiar feeling. \"Guess you were right and I was wrong.\" Rick says, \"But then again, I'm just not flexible enoug to kiss my own ass.\" As he laughs soflty at his own joke he shakes his body and you lose your balance and fall forward deep between the hairs until you feel skin contact. You try to back out, but realise some of the hairs have looped around you somehow and you're stuck. Slowly you try to untangle as you keep smelling and tasting Rick's pit all around you, only making matters worse. untill you're forced to admit it and give in to your predicament. \"Rick,\" you yell, \"I'm stuck!\" This send Rick into a roaring laugh that sends tremor through his entire body jostling you around and tangling you in the hairs even more. When the laughter dies down Rick takes a deep breath and says...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, you got yourself into that, work your own way out.\" Rick says a bit too gleefully. You hold still and think about biting him for a second. But you realise he might slam his arm on you in return, so you forget about it. You slowly think about how to get out. And realise, right now, you would give anything for that superpower of pliability. So the only thing you can do is try to recapture the earlier feeling. You slow your breaths and focus on the one constant, Rick's smell. Slowly but steadily you feel your muscles relax.'Just give in' You keep telling yourself, and all of a sudden you feel like your mind is in control of your body. slowly you pull your arm loose from the tangles of pit hair, it slips out pretty easy, although it feels longer than your arm should be. But you can't see a thing. so you try the same thing with your other arm succesfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try ton untangle yout first leg, you put your hand on it and now you feel the flesh ripple in ways it shouldn't be able to do. It only takes another few minutes to completely free your body and suddenly you slip out and land softly on the mattress once more. Your body feels a bit weird and you just feel like one of your legs is twisted in a weird way, untill it suddenly snaps into place again. Now you're free to get up on all fours and start climbing the slope back to your bed. \"Thanks for nothing.\" You mumble softly, but Rick hears you and answer, \"Well, I can't be there for you all the time, so this was just good practice.\" You wanna mutter something back, but realise you're to angry. So you just retunr to your sleeping boxers and curl up. \"Good night.\" you manage and Rick answers the same before rolling over. As you try to process things you are suddenly overcome by exhaustion,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to the sound of a lud beeping just above your head and notice it's Rick's phone. The earth shakes as he rolls over and grabs it to shut it off. You look up at his face, red, baggy eyes, tossled hair a little bit of drool comin from his mouth and you grin. \"Goodmorning Sunshine.\" Rick shoots you a look \"No talk, coffee.\" He gets up and takes you with him to his kitchenette. He has an expensive looking coffeemaker he turns on and soon the make a cup of coffee an pours a bit of it in a bowl, that might just be the cap of something larger, but you just sip as he downs his cup and makes another. After the second cup his eyes seem to pop open a little more, but he still looks sleepy. By this time you finished your cup and he picks you up and takes you into the smallest bathroom you ever saw. Shower on one side, toliet on the other, no sink. In the corner of the shower you see one of those three-shelf thingies, small shelf at the top and larger at the bottom.He puts you on the middle one and he turns around to strip down. You do the same and place your clothes at the back. As you turn around you see Rick still stumbling with his underwear and you just sit down at the edge of the shelf letting your feet dangle as you look around. The shelf you're on is mainly empty just some shaving gear. the shelf on top is reserved for toothpaste and brush and under you, you see showergels, shampoos and stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally untangled Rick comes into the small cubicle and closes the curtain. As he turns he softly bumps into the shelf, but nothing happens. He turns on the water and you realise you can actually feel some of the spray on you, so you get up and starts showering, to get more water you have to move a bit closer to the edge as you would've likedm but okay.. You see Rick just stand under the stream for a while, looking blissfull as he faces towards the nozzle and lets his body soak. By the time you're done he suddenly moves out his arm reaching for something. But accidently knocking you over and as slippery as the shelf is you tumble over the edge and fall to the shelf below, you land on something soft and see the floor is white and fuzzy. you try to get up, but notice your leg is caught in one of the loops. And before you can untuck it the thing you're on is lifted and shoved over Rick's other hand. You realise you're on his washcloth and what's even worse, you're in his palm. You try to scream but are drowned out by the falling water and with a sudden rush, you are smashed up against Rick's hard left pectoral muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body ended up betweek his fingers so your sinking into the washcloth deep enough to not be an obvious lump apparantly. In slow circles you are rubbed over his chest as it vibrates when RIck starts to hum. Down to his stomac, where the hills and vales of his abs rock your worlds up and down as you slide over and through them. Suddenly his hand twist sideways and the fingers open up more as your face suddenly races down a stretch of hairs, you only realise to late is a well groomed treasure trail. Mere seconds later you are cupped around his cock and balls as he fondles them slightly running them all over you. You try to scream, but can do nothing but wait untll he suddenly pulls back his hand and starts to reach around. That's it, you think and you force your leg to bend and pull it loose, tumbling down and down, but saved from having to clean Rick's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're luck seems to turn as you land in a pool of water, the drain doesn't seem to work as well as it should. And you quickly start swimming to the furthert corner untill the water shallows and you can run up and hide.You shake off the horrid experience you just had and wait for Rick to finish his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the water is turned off Rick suddenly notices you're not on the shelf. \"Squirt?\" he asks and looks between the bottles, only to look down a second later and you stand up and wave. He picks you up and you quickly say, \"I slipped and fell. But I'm okay.\" Rick laughs, \"You should be more careful.\" You agree and he takes you out of the shower and hands you a tissue to dry up. As he picks up your clothes he notices they are damp and takes you to the main room. He rinses your clothes in the sink  and hangs them to dry, as he hands you a makeshift robe of a strip of cloth with a hole for your head and a smaller piece to to tie it around your waist. He puts on some briefs and a bathrobe which he doesn't tie shut and grabs some breakfast stuff. As he sits down he apologises, \"Sorry, I'm really not a morning person.\" you wave it away, \"Don't worry, I'm used to my mom. Or as we like to call her, the phantom of the up-start-day.\" Rick chuckles. \"Well, I just hate to be rude. It's why I make sure to get up this early to acclimate before starting the day.\" You look at the clock on the wall, only seven. \"Well at least you get the best out of the day like this.\" the rest of breakfast is passed in silence. As Rick cleans up and makes another batch of coffee he sits down. \"Did you sleep well after all that happened yesterday, no nightmares about giant asses, or getting sat on by giant ass-holes.\" You sip and shake. \"Unfortunately I have to admit your boxers made a pretty comfy bed. I'm just glad I didn't have to share them with you as you shared your bed with me.\" Rick laughs, \"Well for a second I thought you were gonna have to spent the night in my pit, So I guess my underwear would be an improvement.\" You just nod. \"So what's on the agenda for today?\" Rick leans back and shrugs, \"Well like I said earlier, I was planning on going to the gym in an hour or so. The rest of the day is wide-open.\" At that moment Rick's phone rings and he picks up. After a quick hello he puts it on speaker and you hear Rowell's voice on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell: \"Morning squirt, how are you doing.\"<br>\r\nYou: \"I'm good\"<br>\r\nRowell: \"Great, so no hard feelings right.\"<br>\r\nYou: \"None whatsoever.\"<br>\r\nRowell: \"Good. So listen, I was wondering if Rick wanted to join me for Micheal's lunch concert this around noon. His stringquartet is playing in this little bistro down-town. But I know you had plans, so I just wanted to check with you first, if you could spent an hour or two without him. It would really mean a lot to Michael, you know. So I'm drumming up all of the guys even coach is coming.\"<br>\r\nYou: \"Oh sure, I don't mind spending some time alone.<br>\r\nRowell: Great, I would've invited you too if I thought you would, But I think being around giants and food might be a bit too much.<br>\r\nYou make a sad noise: \"Ah, so I'm gonna be the only one to not hear him play.\"<br>\r\nRowell stays quiet for a second: \"Well I guess we could take you along, I have some shorts that have pockets that I can zipper up so you don't fall out.\"<br>\r\nYou think on it for a few seconds: \"Sounds good enough for me, so if Rick is okay, you can come pick us up at 11:30?\"<br>\r\nRick chimes in, \"Sure sounds good to me, I mean I have to eat so why not enjoy some music at the same time.\"<br>\r\nRowell: \"Great, than I see you guys then, gotta make some breakfast before heading over to the gym.\"<br>\r\nRick: Oh, you're going to the gym too? I was going in about an hour, maybe meet up and spot each other?\"<br>\r\nRowell: \"Sure sounds good, guess I can come over right after so we can freshen up, change and go for lunch.\" <br>\r\nRick: \"Sounds like a plan, see you there.\"<br>\r\nRowell: \"Great and see you after working out, squirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rick hangs up you look up at him. \"So you guys hang out a lot, outside of school?\" He nods, \"Remember most of us are in the same class too, all seniors and stuff. You're probably the first freshman to ever join the team. And also the smallest. We figured hanging out with us outside of the safety of school would be too much for you.\" You laugh at that. \"Safe... school... Where the headmaster forces me to paly sports with the giants hoping for me to fail so I can get kicked out and have to work a deli-counter for the rest of my life?\" Rick's eyes grow a bit. \"Wait, you get kicked out if you quit the team?\" you nod. \"Kinda makes me worry what will happen to the team when all of you graduate next year. Because I might have to pick a different team or drop out.\"</span></div></div>",

He wouldn't ever let anything happen to you. He told us he actually has a few tiny friends.\" You blink, \"Really, coach? Wow, I knew he looked after me, but this is surprising.\" Rick gets up, \"You should ask him about it someday, but right now, I need to get dressed for the gym. He walks off to his dresser and comes back with one pair of white briefs, a compression short boxer, a shiny pair of work-out shorts and a shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still think I'm bluffing about needing multiple layers to hold in my sweat.\" You gulp, but nod. as Rick sits down. \"So just wondering, I'm gonna do a lot more than just squats, I'm also gonna sit on machines lay down and well, probably make your life a bit of a hell down their, especially if you're actually right under my ass.\" You look up, \"So what do you propose?\" Rick shrugs and grins sheepishly, \"Well to be honest, I was hoping you had a suggestion.\" You think on it for a second. \"Well there are only three places I can imagine that could work-out, two of them are out of the question.\" Rick grins, \"Which are?\" You chuckle, \"Well the first one would actually be IN your ass and the second would be sharing the space with.. Little Rick.\" Rick laughs too. \"Well, I agree those two are both very last resorts. So your third option.\" You nod. \"Well not so much under your ass as partly under your balls and close to your taint. When you sit those are tilted slightly up so it wouldn't put the full weight on me, but you'd still sit on me.\" Rick nods. \"It sounds nutty enough to work.\" You chuckle and answer, \"Unless you feel it's not a proper training, then I don't mind sitting this one out.\" Rick wags his finger at you. \"You know the word.\" As you keep quiet he stands up and turns away to change his boxers for the briefs before turning around and giving you a full view of his large bulge. He gently picks you up and says: \"Close your eyes, cause here you go.\" You don't close your eyes though as you are plummeted down into his briefs and pass the monster cock you've seen, and washed earlier before sliding down under his balls and getting a your face shoved against Ricks taint. he let's go and you fall on the material of the briefs, where he uses a finger to align you before letting the material lift you in place. As his hand retreats you feel him sitting down. The hard unforgiving wood of the chair presses you close to his skin, but at least his full weight isn't on you, like with Rowell on the softer material of the couch and his more slouching position. \"Yep, this'll work\" Rick says and gets up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he steps into his next layer, the compression shorts your face gets rubbed sideways a little over his taint ans you sneak a taste. Once again you are amazed at how, not-bad, it tastes down here. As Rick wiggles in his compression short suddenly you feel your little prison tighten and you face roughly pressed against the skin. It has it's advantages, because as he steps in his last layer you don't move an inch. After getting dressed you notice he walks around a bit to gather his things before moving out. As he walks your position does not even seem to shift as you ar pressed so close to him you just follow alon with every move he makes. Slowly you  try to get into the meditve state you had earlier enjoying the warmth and the slight build up of taste and smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rick reaches the gym you hear him great Rowell and they enter together. After a short walk Rick stops and stands a while as you hear beeping. All of as sudden he starts to walk again, speeding up into a jog and even a run. You figure he's warming up at the threadmill. It also feels like he opened up the sluices, because before long it starts to get moist, than wet and soon a small puddle seems to form around you. sloshing around filling your ears and washing over your face, into your nose and even your mouth. the level rising dangerously high as the material just can't seem to absorb it all. Soon you are forced to guzzle down gulp after gulp of sweat from his taint, his balls an his ass just to catch a few breaths in between. This is pure horror, he warned you, but nothing could have prepared you for this. The salty taste makes you even more thirsty, but you can't seem to still it. And he just keeps running. You squeeze your eyes shut and wonder if this is where you'll die. Until a small voice in the back of our head answer once again. 'give in' and you do just that. You stop breathing for a second. and let your body free. Slowly you feel your body stretch to the sides just a little at first. And as Rick finally stops running and moves on to the next piece of equipment and sits down you give in even more and just let your body form to his every nook and cranny. slowly allowing you to become as flexible as the fabric beneath you. And all of a sudden you are at peace. You can't open your eyes, but you feel you can open your mouth and just let the taste of his taint fill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly fainlty do you register him moving from one excercise to the other untill after a while he starts walking again, you register his voice and  Rowell's as they walk back to Rick's apartment. They enter and you hear Rick tell Rowell you are probably sleeping, so he should freshen up. You faintly feel Rick taking of the first to layers and finally the briefs and you feel yourself come down. Opening your eyes you look up at Rick looking at you with eyes the size of saucers as he softly says, \"Tha fuck?\" You take in a deep breath and almost instantly you feel your body shrink in on it self and blow up until you suddenly shake your head and are you again. Rick picks you up and places you on the table. \"So.\" he says. \"Definitely NOT a hoax.\" You nod \"I guess so.\"  Rick gives you a stare, \"You scared the hell out of me, I thought I just killed you.\" You give him a sorry face, \"I'm sorry it just... happened.\" He nods, \"But you were stretched out so far. You covered almost the entire front of my briefs. That can't have been comfortable.\" You shrug, \"I didn't really feel that much, it actually felt a little less painfull than when I was trying to keep my own shape.\" Rick looks at you with wonder in his eyes. \"Wait, so you didn't mind the feeling.\" You shrug again. \"I don't know, at the time I just did, now seeing you look at me like that I think it's weird, but I guess when I'm in that state. It just doesn't seem to big of a deal.\" Rick nods, \"I don't get it, but I'll take your word for it.\" So I guess we can stop training you now. Because I think you don't ever have to be afraid of getting stepped or sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give it a little thought. \"Well I guess not, but since we're busy, I guess I need to work on controlling it, becuase it kind of happened by accident, because you were right.\" Rick looks at you quizically. You add with a grin, \"I was almost drowning in your sweat.\" Rick laughs out loud at that and you laugh with him. \"I warned you.\" Rick finally gets out and you nod. \"I'll trust you next time. But a few seconds later Rick turns serious again. \"So you said you had to feel like you were in danger to do it? Like a kind of defence mechanism?\" You nod and slowly see his hand grab and squeeze you a bit. \"Can you do it now?\" You try as he squeezes a bit more, but you can't seem to find it again. Rick notices and releases you. \"I guess you are not scared enough, because you know I wouldn't really try to hurt you on purpose like that.\" You shrug, \"Or maybe I can't do it all the time.\" Rick leans back, \"Oh well guess Camp Rick still has a reason to remain open. Besides I guess I would lie if I said I wasn't interested in this. Maybe one of these days I might actually need an emergency washcloth.\" He says with a wink, but you wonder. \"Rick, you can tell me honestly, would that be something you wanted to try for real?\" Rick shakes his head, \"You'd be crazy to do that for me.\" You catch his lie, \"But you do wonder how it would be?\" Rick blushes. \"Well, yeah, you caught me. After saying it out loud yesterday I did wonder a few times how it would be.\" You think and wonder out loud by accident, \"Well maybe it would make me feel 'threatened' enough to find that place again.\" Rick chuckles, \"I would feel threatened in your place.\" and he flexes his muscles for effect. You shoot him a mocking grin. \"Yeah and if that doesn't work, your face will do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Rowell exits the shower wearing nothing but a pair of board shorts. Giving you a good look of his body. Toned and muscled, sinewy, but a bit too broad for his height. It makes him look a bit mishapen, but in a cute adoring way. \"Hey there squirt\", he's still rubbing his blond hair dry and a few drops of water sparkle on his different muscles like tiny gemstones. You give him a wave as he is too far away to hear you. \"You should take a shower to Rick. I can keep the squirt company.\" Rick gets up and says....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think Squirt needs a shower too.\" Rick says and he picks you up. \"He's still a bit smelly from yesterday.\" Rowell chuckles, \"Right, I guess that makes sense. Don't worry about me, I'll just make something to eat to keep us happy till lunch.\" Rick carries you into the bathroom and places you on the lowes shelf this time, right on top of the washcloth you encountered earlier. As he quickly undresses you see his body glinstening with sweat. \"Maybe we should try this when I'm  a bit more fresh?\" It's not really a question how he says it, so you shake your head. \"Best to get it over with.\" Rick grins a bit evil. \"Well I do feel really dirty so need to take my time.\" He steps in the shower and grabs you a bit roughly before turning on the water just a little. \"Don't want to be clean all too soon.\" And before you can answer he holds you unde what seems a mere trickle of water and almost rams you into his first pit. Roughly scraping your body up and down the hairs. His sweat filling your nose and mouth as you scream only to get his grime scooped in your mouth. You try to think of a happy place, but it's just too much. And still he keeps rubbing you up and down, down and up. Finally you are pulled out and rinsed off as he moves you to his other hand. \"Still not scary enough? Don't worry, I don't mind feeling your hard body in my pits any less.\"And you are slammed into his second pit. As you were scrubbed in the first the taste lessened over time and here you are back to square one. You feel yourself starting to cry and suddenly want to kick yourself. 'You can do this, you can give in.' And all of a sudden your body gives a little, just a little but it's enough to ease some of the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when you're removed from the pit Rick nods a bit in agreement. \"Getting scared, well, you'd better be, cause you're in for the grand tour.\" next he slaps you onto his bicep as he curls it, like fallin on concrete. The taste isn't as bad as the pits, but the hard muscles feel less forgiving. you give in a little more. as your rubbed down his first arm only to end up in his other hand and without pause get slapped on the second bicep. Slowly but steadily you try to stay conscious and at the same time letting your body flow as free as earlier. It doesn't seem to work as well as the first time. You're more like a squeezy ball than full out pliable. As rick removes you from his arm he aslo notices and brings you to his face. \"I need more surface or I'll never get clean.\" He whispers and you almost feel like you are melting under his breath as he slaps you on his massive trunk-like thigh and slides you along all the way down to his feet. This time you demand your body to do as you please and flatten. It doesn't seem to work untill he suddenly moves you to his other thigh and all of a sudden you feel your body, for lack of a better word, explode. You stretch in all directions covering the space between his hand and his thigh and you hear a grunt of affirmation as Rick massages you down his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reaches his second foot he rinses you and looks at you, you can open your eyes and mouth just fine for some reason and see him grin before you meet his left pec and his right and especially the little crevace between them before rolling down the hills of abs and his sides. Again you get rinsed of and raised to Rick's face. \"I would ask you if you've had enough, but I guess you can't answer.\" And he lowers you again this time to his privates as  he rubs you all over them, squeezing you around his flacid cock fondling his balls and down his loins. You manage to hold out your tongue the entire time and love te taste of his wiener. Without bringing you back-up he moves you around and slams you against his firm cheek, rubbing you in circles all over it. Another one follows. And finally he moves his hand to the top of his crack, which so far he has kept clear from the water and as he shoves you in you taste his sweat and almost feel like you're drinking the nectar of the gods. The deeper you go, the stronger the taste and more viscous. Untill you reach the eye of trutc and are slowly but certainly massaged around his sphincter. As if Rick knows exactly where your tongue is hanging out he rubs it all over and even presses it in a bit deeper. You get the feeling he takes as much time washing his ass as he did on the entire rest of his body, but at long last you get pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Rick turn up the water completely and he turns under the stream around using you to wash a few places he missed before lifting you up to his face. You see his face is blustering red and he is panting slightly. \"That felt soo good, I just hope you didn't feel too much of it. You allow your body to slowly reform and can finally answer. \"I hardly felt a thing, after the first part, so we're good.\" Rick grins, \"Really now? cause if you don't mind, I would love to do it again. sometime.\" You shrug, \"Just call me your emergency-washcloth from now on.\" Rick gives you a wink, \"Don't say that if you don't mean it. cause I might just misplace my washcloth a lot if you do.\" You shrug again and repeat, \"Just call me your emergency-washcloth from now on.\" Rick grins as he rinses you off and the two of you dry off. You put on your makeshift robe again as Rick puts on a pair of boxers before walking out to join Rowell at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the two of you look pretty clean, now.\" he says with a grin. \"So I guess you can get dirty again later on.\" He grins at you with a wink.\" he pours the three of you some juice and slides you a saucer filled with crumbs and shreds. The three of you dig in. After the midmorning snack you still have about an hour to kill before you have to leave. Rick gets out a boardgame of sorts that the three of you play, you decided to be your own game piece make the guys laugh. throwing the dice isn't that easy, but you can read the cards you get as one of the guys places it in a card holder, without looking. By the end of the game you're in second place, right after Rowell. \"Guess I win, what's my price?\" You give him a grin, \"You get a pocket-pal for an hour or two.\" He bumps his fist. \"Yes, just what I've always wanted. Rick puts away the game and Rowell gets up. \"So ready to go?\" You nod. But you are shocked when you see Rowell open his shorts. \"Wait? You said pocket?\" He blinks, \"Yeah, there is this pocket that zips up in here?\" You did not see that coming, but shrug as Rowell picks you up and slides you into the inside pocket, located at the front of the left leg. It's made of a thin fabric and pretty deep. As you tumble down you see that it also hangs dangerously close to Rowells massive bulge and he wears it to the left... Your side. bove you you hear the zipper shut and as the elastic slams close you softly collide with his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rowell sits down again the pocket slides down a bit in between his legs and you soon bump agains the thin material of his boxers. Rowell doesn't seem to notice as he sitw and waits for Rick to get ready. Too scared to move you hold still and wait for him to get up again. It gets worse when he starts to jostle his leg a bit, which softly scrapes you over the outside of his underwear. How does he not notice this. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes Rowell gets up and you drop down to the front of his leg to your relief. But there seems to be another part wrong with this plan, because as soon as Rowell starts walking the pocket youa re in starts swinging, slowly at first but as they keep walking momentum builds up and soon you get smacked against his groin at least every thrird step. After a while you hear te wordl become more echoing as you notice Rowell walking down some steps. You guess it's the subway or something. And indeed soon enough you hear the clatter of the carts. As Rowell moves through the masses. A few people bump into you you full force, before he finally takes a seat. Again you slowly sag down towards his groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next stop you hear someone ask \"if the seat is free and with that Rowell slams his massive thighs together, with you caught right in the middle and by the movement pressed up tight against his shaft. Only two layers of far to thin fabric away. He most be joking me. You think. But the boys just talk like nothing is wrong. After a few more stops Rowell gets up and again they start walking. The motion itself is actually kind of pleasant, it feels a bit like sleeping in a hammock, if the hammock smelled like someone's crotch. No, try move beyond the negative. It's okay, you;ve had worse from Rick. And Rowell isn't doing it on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they enter their, as you figure, destination and you hear a few cheers from familiar voices. Most of your teammates are apparantly already here. Rowell sits down on something and slides over. So it's probably a bench of some sorts. Then he leans back and places his left foot, the foot your leg is attached to on something a little elevated. Probably the support from the table. But to you this means gravity swings you down and you are now completely lying on top of Rowell's bulge. Apparantly this time he felt something, because from the outside you feel his hand cup himself and roughly adsjust his crotch, As his hand loosens you want to scream, as you have ended op squashed between the side of his crotch and his leg and you're up so close and personal you can see the outline of his cockhead, right in front of your head. From above you hear a lot of loud voices shouting to each other, ordering drinks and food,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the food arrives it gets worse for you as Rowell lowers his leg, sits straight with tight legs and makes you kiss his cock in the worst way you can imagine. But all of that is suddenly forgotten as a silence falls and some girl introduces the 'string-theorists', followed by a loud clapping and suddenly it becomes silent as the first note of a cello, a viola and two violins fills the room. rising and falling though a piece you faintly recall, but you can't remember. Classical music can be so soothing. After the first piece which must have at least been 15 minutes another piece follows even longer. After that you're surprised as they play three variations of certain pop-songs and they close with 'pump and circumstance.' Rowell Finally stands up to give a standing ovation allowing you to slip from his genital's grasp. They sit down again and after a while the place clears out. Some of the guys already left as you suddenly hear Michael's voice from right across the table. \"So did you guys enjoy the show.\" You hear only three voices answer, Rick, Rowell and coach M\u00fcller. recognisable for his slight german acccent. \"It is nize to zee ze young people still enjoy listening to theez old music, I think Beethoven would have been prrroud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know why but you feel like you should so you grab one of the hairs on Rowell's leg and give it a firm tug. it makes him yelp softly before he catches the drift. \"I think squirt is trying to tell m he liked it too.\" You hear Michael's voice, \"You brought him here?\" Followed by coach's voice, \"Ah, so ze squirt also likes ze classical music. It is good to hear he also haz come to ze concert. I hope you are trrreating him well.\" Rick's voice answers, \"Yeah, I accidently ended up hanging out with him after school yesterday. His parents were out of town for the weekend so invited him to stay over. So far it's going great, we played some games, watched some movies and had some food. Rowell and Michael hang out with us yesterday too, and when he heared about the concert he didn't want to be left out.\" Coach drop his voice as he says, \"That is good, ja, aber I guess he is in ze pocket? Be careful never to take him out in public plazes like theez. A lot of people, like our headmaster think that ze tinies do not belong in ze outside world.\" Rowell answers, \"Don't worry coach I have him in my pocket with a zipper so he can't fall out by accident.\" You hear the coach clack his tongue a sound he makes if he approves of something. \"Zat is good thinking, I'm happy to hear you Jungens are being smart about this. And tell ze tiny I approve of his courage of making friends with you giants. I zink it must take a lot of courage. But also zink that tinies and giant can be great life-long friends, I alzo haben a few tiny friends myself. And it is good to help each other out. Zey helped me rewire my house for example, as I helped then out with moving their house to a different neighbourhood. You Junge should not underestimate ze tinies, they can also be very scary when angry.\" This last part makes you chuckle. You can't imagine how you could hurt any of these guys. But coach already starts explaining. \"It iz believed many assasinations by poison are actually carried out by ze tinies, a few drops in your soup, a stab with a poisoned needle. It doez not take much. And you never zee them coming.\" As the coach silences for effect he let's out a roaring laugh after a few seconds and you hear him get up. \"But don't worry, ze squirt is a good-hearted kid. He will need a lot of training before he can kill any of you. But still be nice to him. He iz team-mate first and tiny second. And if he hangs out with you he is not Weichei.. erm scaredy-cat either.\" Leaving you with those praising word, coach takes off, leaving only the three counselors. \"So wanna share a cab back to our place?\" Michael asks and Rick confirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three get up and walk out. One wild cab-ride later where you get pretty close with Rowell's junk again, the guys get out and start up some stairs. After a while you hear a door open and the guys stream in. Finally Rowell opens the top of his shorts and unzips to fish you out. You look around and see a nice room with a large couch and a full dining set. Two doors two one side and on the other you see a kitchen behind a large pass-through window and another door marked as 'The bad room' \"Welcome to our place\" Rowell says with an inviting gesture and a large smile. \"Wait?\" You ask, \"You guys live together?\" Michael walks into view and sighs, \"Yeah unfortunately we do. It kind of happened because my parents had to move away for work for about a year and left me behind to finish college.\" Rowell chirps in, \"And my parents didn't have room for me and my three sisters. So since our parents are good friends they decided to rent us a place in the city. about 3 minutes from where my folks live.\" Michael shrugs, \"His sisters are over here all the time. Thank god they don't have their own keys.\" Rowell grins, \"If they had you might walk around a lot less naked.\" Michael grins back, \"Oh come of it, we all know you don't mind.\" Rowell blushes a bit. But you are totally confused and look from one to the other. Rowell grins at you and says, \"Oh, I guess you didn't know. I like boys. It's why I was happy to move out of a house filled with girls.\" You yelp unintentionally, \"Wait you're ga... a homosexual?\" The other guys chuckle at your shocked reaction. And Rowell places you on the table as the three others take a chair. \"Well, yeah. It's no big deal really, apparantly nowadays one out of ten people is gay, which by the way is a word I don't find offensive.\" You shrug, \"Sorry, I'm not that acquinted with the big world these days. But apparantly there are some things you can and can't say.\" The guys nod. Rowell leans a bit forward, \"I hope this doesn't mean we can't hang-out?\" You tilt your head, \"Why would it, what you do on your own time to some of these,\" You gesture at Michael and Rick, \"boys, is none of my business.\" Both Micheal and Rick let out a big \"Hey!\" and you quickly turn, \"Hush, don't make the gay-man think you think there's something wrong with being gay, he might sit on you... or wait... maybe that's just me... and we've already been there.\" This makes the guys laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Michael asks, \"Did you like the show?\" You shrug, \"I liked the music, didn't see much of the show. So what instrument did you play?\" Michael shares one of his warm smiles, \"The viola, a bit of an unappreciated instrument.\" You nod, \"Yeah, but you know what they say, You don't hear it most of the time, but you hear it when it's absent.\" Michael nods, \"True, I never knew you liked music.\" You shrug, not much to do as a tiny but read books, and listen to music. There's very few bars and clubs for people like us. Mainly because we are too few and spread to thinly.\" Rowell gasps, \"No clubs, how do you live?\" You turn and grin, \"we just watch club-going people like you make fools of themselves on television.\" Rowell gives you a smirk. \"You can't say stuff like that without having visited a club at least once.\" He snaps his finger, \"How about we take you to one tonight, so you can watch me spark and sizzle.\"</span></div></div>",

Why not.\" Rowell pumps his fist in the air, but you add. \"Just don't take us to a gay club or anything.\" From behind you two voices chime in, \"Agreed!\" Rowell just gives you a wide grin. \"Hey, I wouldn't dream of it. Or I wouldn't get those guys to come. They never go clubbing. Besides I know the perfect place.\" Suddenly he looks lost in thought. \"But I don't know how we can get you in safely and still have you see what's going on. For a moment none of the guys say anything, and suddenly Michael chuckles. \"I have a crazy idea.\" You turn and look at him. \"Well, I think if we used a little bit of thread we can probably sew you onto the inside of the elastic band of one of our boxers. So your head can stick out just above the rim. And with the proper shirt you can probably be hidden from a casual glance and still see most of what's going on.\" you tilt your head and give Michael an estranged look. \"That doesn't sound like the worst idea, but if anyone has something better?\" Unfortunately no one answers and you sigh. \"I guess that's gonna be the plan.\" Rick snickers, \"I guess you get to wear one of those too tight, just too short shirts you love Rowell.\" You give him a look, \"Wait, why do I have to go with him?\" You hear Rowell mumble an \"ouch\". But Rick already continues, \"Because if we go to a 'straight club' he has the least change at striking up a date.\" Rowell mutters another \"ouch.\" but Rick continues again, \"Besides only he has the wardrobe to pull it off.\" Michael nods and says, \"Yup, for once his slutty dress-code has some use.\" This time Rowell speaks up, \"Okay, enough you guys. He clearly doesn't want me to carry him, so one of you guys has to step up.\" You hear a bit of hurt in his voice and turn around. \"I'm sorry Rowell, I just thought you might feel limited to shake your groove-thing with me along for the ride. And you've been carrying me around all day already. So I thought to put the burden on one of them.\" Rowell looks at you unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply and make a scene, you walk over to his hand kneel down and grab his pinky finger in both hands. \"Dear Rowell, will you please do me the honour of being my pack-mule tonight.\" Rowell breaks a smile, \"How can I refuse such an honest proposal. But as a retribution I'm gonna wear my tighest pair of boxers.\" You grin, \"Good, that will make me feel safer than ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is still early in the afternoon so there will be some time to kill. Rick leaves to get some clothes for tonight and promises to bring something to eat when he gets back. Michael gets up to go and change out of the suit he wore to perform in. Leaving you with just Rowell for a while. As soon as Michael closes his door you look up at him. \"I'm sorry for earlier Rowell, if I hurt your feelings I didn't mean to, it's just...\" Rowell leans in and looks you over, \"It's what?\" You slump, \"It's just a bit scary. Going to a club with all those giants and well, I know you kept me safe today, but I guess for some reason Rick and Michael seem a bit more, safe.\" Rowell grins, \"You mean, boring and less likely to bust-a-move.\" You chuckle, \"Well, almost exactly like that.\" Rowell crosses his arms and leans forward resting his head only a few inches away. \"I get it, don't worry, I guess I might seem a bit... flaky at times, but I'm gonna make sure to get you in and out of that club safe and sound.\" He grins, \"And of course impress you with my dance moves while doing it.\" You grin back. \"Just don't over do it, if you snap your undies, You'll send me flying.\" He gives you a sad look, \"Fine, I'll play by the rules of common decency, besides, I'm already gonne be more decent than I normally do.\" You shoot him a questioning look and he whispers \"I normally don't wear underwear when I go clubbing.\" For some reason this sends you into a laughing fit and it takes a while to compose yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Rowell still looking at you with a kind of cute half-smile. And you suddenly feel the need to look down and straighten your makeshift robe thing. \"Wait a sec.\" Rowell says and suddenly gets up and takes you into his room. You're a bit shocked at how clean and neat everything is. Even though it's not much more than a bed, an old arm-chair, a closet for clothes and a wall full of IKEA-like closet's from floor to sealing filled with square boxes. Even the bed is made. As he passes it, he quickly drops you on the bed and start to pull out a few boxes untill he found the right one. He takes it over to the bed and dumps the contents on it. You see a couple of barbie and ken dolls fall down and give Rowell a look, \"My sister asked me to keep them for her.\" He quickly explains as he tosses the barbies and the dresses back in the box and leaves the ken dolls and their clothes out. \"We can get you a cool new outfit for tonight. You might not be seen, but you should always dress to impress. The first thing you notice is how the ken-dolls are actually almost twice your size. \"Erm Rowell, I don't think those will fit me.\" He just shrugs and picks out a few pants that look like they would only be long shorts on the dolls. \"Try these.\" You look at them and shrug. You decide to pick out one of the black ones with a white stripe on the side and start to pull it up. The length is actually not bed, but they are a bit wide around the hips. Rowell who was busy picking out some shirts turns and sees it. \"Not bad, but maybe you need to try this one. \"He hands you a pair with an elastic waistband. dark blue shorts with a light-blue floral pattern, clearly ment as a swimsuit. You slip it on and the elastic actually keeps the pants pleasantly tight. \"Those look great, wish they made stuff like that in my size, \"But with pants like that, you should wear a simple top. He holds up  two shirts one black and one dark green. Both close with velcro. but they are still pretty wide. \"Got it\" Rowell says and he walks out for a second coming back with a pair of scissors. He holds the dark-green shirt up to you, nods and pulls it back. He uses the scissors to cut the shiirt diagonally and cuts another thin strip off  the part he cut off. first he hands you the shirt and you put it on the length is great. On one side just above the hip on the other just halfway to your thigh. Next he takes the strip and raises it over you and gently places the middle under the collar of the shirt, Pulls the strip over your shoulders crosses it on your chest back under your arms around the back to the front accross your waste and ties it loosely on the side with the longer part of the shirt. He used the scissors to carefully cut the lef over strip a bit shorter. \"Now that's a look.\" He lifts you up and takes you to the bathroom to hold you up to the mirror. and you have to admit. \"This looks pretty good.\" You look up in the mirror and see Rowell smile as broad as you've never seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could totally be a stylist for the tiny, If I say so myself.\" You grin, \"I guess if you're not to busy sometime I should totally take you shopping.\" Rowell gives you a wink in the mirror \"anytime little squirt. Who knows maybe we could make a home-ec, project out of it. Styling for Tiny, or we could call it... Styning.\" You chuckle at that. \"Too bad I can't return the favour.\" You say and Rowell just smiles as he carries you back to the couch, where Michael is already sitting  in his sweatpants without a shirt, showing of his long lean upper body, reading a book science book. He looks up and sees you in your new clothes. \"Oh god, is he playing dress-ups again.\" But you can see he means it as a joke. You nod \"Please Michael save me, this man is going crazy. It's feel like I'm in an episode of 'Queer eye, for the straight guy.' Hide me before e puts make-up on me and wants to do my hair.\" Michael grins, \"Sure thing.\" He suddenly reaches out and grabs you from Rowell's hand leans over, lift his leg and shoves you under his ass. before sitting down on you full weight. You hear Rowell heaving with laughter at what just happened right in front of him as Micheal settles down even better locking you in his crack as he continues reading. You actually feel yourself cracking a smile to and for once really feel like the butt of the joke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You expect Michael to get up soon. But when you feel the couch quake and the tv turned on, you realise Rowell isn't expecting Michael to move anytime soon. You suspect Michael did it on purpose, because he wanted to read in peace. And you and Rowell, rough-housing would be a bit of a distraction. This thought is confirmed as you hear Michael say. \"Ro, would you mind using the headphones?\" And a few seconds later it goes quiet again. Michael leans back and shoves his ass around to get more comfortable, which only means more weight for you. But by now you're so used to it, that you don't mind too much. Slowly you close your eyes and wait it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up as suddenly he world seems to fall apart. For a moment completely disoriented, you can't move, you think of sleep paralysis, Only to see a large grey mass retract from your view and you get your memory back. Michael. And soon enough he turns and picks you up from the couch, carrying you to the table. You see Rick and Rowell sitting down already, hovering over two large home-made pizzas. \"Ah,\" Rowell exclaims, \"There you were hiding. But don't worry, I put away my make-up kit and hairgels for another day.\" You give him a grin and look up at Michael. \"Thanks for that.\" Rick looks confused \"Am I missing something... and where did you get those clothes? You almost look human in those.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael puts you down and Rick presents a saucer with a tiny pizza on it, just for you. \"Wow!\" you say, \"that looks amazing.\" RIck grins, \"Don't thank me, thank Rowell's mom for giving him a cookie tray, we figured it could make a perfect size pizza for you. Although mincing the veggies small enough for us to snort, wasn't easy\" You look at the pizza, a large circle of dough covered in red sauze and tiny shreds of.. well undistinguishable vegetables on top covered with a thick layer of cheese. If you look at the large pizza you see mushrooms, zucchini, onion and bell peppers. so you figure that's what's on your pizza too. The guys start to dig in and you too carefully pick up the first slice. The taste is like a little peace of heave in your mouth. Tomato-sauce, vegetables a warm melty cheese and a tick but crunchy crust. Nothing like the pizza's you are used too.\"Oh my god, so this is what fresh vegetables taste like.\" It's out before you know it and you get a few stares. Rick is first to find the words, \"Wait, you never had fresh vegetables?\" You swallow your bite and shrug. \"Well, can you imagine wasting most part of a zucchini on the tinies? We mostly get the spoiled or dented vegetables not good enough for giant consumption. The only fresh things we get are small things, mostly stuff like berries and seeds. we grow those in our communal gardens.\" This gets another few strange looks. \"Wait so we feed you our garbage?\" Rowell asks with disbelieve in his voice. You take another bite and nod your head. \"Except on holidays, then we get a load of fresh vegetables and some volunteers help us prepare certain meals. Like with thanksgiving we get turky and butternut squash. We get to prepare so much food we have to fill our freezers and can eat of those meals for over a month.\" Michael clears his throat. \"That's just... awful.\" You give him a look. \"I never knew we treated you like second-rate citizens like that. Why don't you complain?\" You laugh at that, \"Be honest, what difference would it make. Can you see us now,\" And you sing a few bar from a well known song with different lyrics, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tinies march to court today, hurrah, hurrah, <br>\r\nThe tinies march to court today, hurrah hurrah.<br>\r\nThey march to court to have their say,<br>\r\nbut giants laugh and just say nay.<br>\r\nAnd the tinies march back home,<br>\r\nto their camps<br>\r\nto hide out<br>\r\nfrom the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom.\" the Rowell and RIck sing the Chorus. Michael just ponders and says, \"I guess I get your point But I still don't think it's right.\" You give him a smile, \"Don't worry we get enough to eat. I mean a lot of things we eat are free, it just takes a while to find them. For exemple, in spring we go hunting for butterfly eggs and in automn we collect beech nuts and small mushrooms. It's like a day out for the whole village, so we also get to do a lot of bonding. It's why the tiny communities are often pretty close.\" Rowell laughs, \"Well I couldn't wait to get away from my family, so it's a mystery to me why you'd like living like that.\" You give him a wink, \"Because we tinies are a team, just like you have your team.\" He shrugs with a grin, well that makes sense.\" Michael nods too, \"I guess it's just a different way of life, But I never thought you tinies could be so... inventive\" he smiles a bit apologetic, \"I mean, we don't see much of you in school or college.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on that for a second and nod, \"Well most communities have their own pre-schools and several larger ones have grade-schools or even some form of college, but most tinies just don't feel like going out to the real world to learn. Mostly just one or two a decade get picked to go to real colleges to bring back the knowledge. They are excused from most chores around, untill they graduate and they are expected to return and teach, unless they find another job and can support their community financially, thank god for banks and we don't have to carry around our money anymore.\" Michael nods, \"So you got the honours?\" You shake your head, \"More like, I was the only option in my generation. Our community is relatively new, so my parents are somewhat of the elders and I'm their only son. And in being so, I was the only one of age to go to college. And would have been for another 6 years. We have an older woman, Miss Leena, who is teaching classes now, but she will have to take a step back in a few years. So we needed to either get someone new, or send one of us to college. It was a public vote and so since I didn't have the proper arguements to convince them otherwise, they voted for me to go.\" Rick gasps, \"Wait you were forced to go to college?\" You give him a look, \"I don't think of it like being forced, it's more like accepting my part in the community. My parents were against it but even his status does not overrule a community vote.\" Rick shakes his head, \"It still sounds completely bizar. I can't imagine our team for example taking a vote on who should be transferred to another team to make the contest more fair.\" You laugh at that, \"It's because school spirit and community spirit are different things. If you must now, I cried the night I heared I was gonna be enrolled in college. But I must grin and bear it now. And well some parts aren't as bad as I thought, I like most of the classes and how we can choose our own curriculums. Most of the classes are fine. I Just wished they didn't make me play sports to stay in school.\" You grin, \"But then again, so far it hasn't been the worst experience. You should hear some of the horrorstories we tell our kids around the campfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice with all this talkin the pizza's are all gone. And Rowell gets up to clean-up.Michael leans back in his chair and says\"I guess we should clean up before heading out. Why don't you go first Rowell. When you're done Rick can take a shower and we can get the two of you ready for tonight. I'll go last.\" The boys agree on the plan and Rowell goes into his room to pick up a few things. Coming back with a towel a shirt and a pair of briefs he places on the table. As he turns to go to the bathroom he looks over his shoulder. \"Wait? Did you want to freshen up too squirt?\" You look around, so now you have three choices, you can either take a shower with Rowell, stay here with the others, or screw up the plan and tell them you're only showering with Rick.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A predicament, a conundrum, a puzzle. You do feel like you should freshen up, but you don't know if you want to shower with Rowell. He's nice enough, but so far you've only showered with Rick. And actually that felt like a little too much. You see Rowell still looking and you can't think it over too much, so are you gonna take the gamble, or are you, oh crap, he's gonna turn. \"Sure, if you don't mind sharing a shower?\" It's out before you know it. Rowell grins, \"I've been sharing my showers with those guys, at least you don't take up as much room. He comes over and picks you up. \"Have some coffee ready for us.\" You shout at RIck and Michael and get a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rowell enters the bathroom he places you on the shelf near the mirror and you undress yourself. You turn around as Rowell does the same, but the large mirror just reflects the image and you look down as you neatly start to fold your clothes. As Rowell comes up he offers you his palm to step on and he transfers you to the baththub \"We have to shower in the tub. No seperate shower.\" Rowell explains and places you on the edge nearest to the wall, theres a small flat surface sticking out like a molded soapdish. jus \"Are you gonna be okay down there?\" You nod, \"Yeah I think so.\" Rowell walks back to the mirror and fusses around with his face. \"Damn contacts\" You didn't realise he wore contacts. After a while he comes back and step into the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a prefect view of his massive thigh as it comes close enough for you to almost touch it. You look up and see every inch of his body covered in muscle and creamy skin. You notice from this angle his pits are hairless and so is his chest. But the legs and arms are still covered with a nice blond fuzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turns on the water he adjust the temperature a bit till it's nice and warm. And you just stand next to him and look up. \"Suddenly you see him looking down. \"Wow, you're just a blur down there, but at least I can still see your safe on the edge.\" Wow his eyes must suck! \" You see him reaching out and he grabs a bar of soap. which he rinses under the streaming water. But suddenly he squeezes too hard and it slips. From that point on suddenly everything seems to happen in slow motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Rowell fumble to get a grip on the soap, but it shoots away from him. It ricochets of the wall under the nozzle and bounces back as gravity takes a hold of it. As you just stand there you see the soap heading right at you. You try to duck but it bumps into you knocking you back. You and the soap slide over the small platform and it slows down just in time to keep lying on the edge. But you're not so lucky as the slippery soap offers no real grip and you can't hold on. Tumbling down towards the bottom of the tub. As you land on the bottom of the tub you feel a bit dazed from the fall and are still covered by a few suds. You suddenly see you're only inches away from Rowell's large foot and you crinch as it moves over you toward the back of the tub. you hear Rowell chuckle. \"There you are you little bastard.\" You don't know why you would be a bastard, but realise he is talking about the soap he dropped. As you try to catch your breath suddenly Rowell's hand grabs you a bit too tightly and lifts you. \"You're not getting away this time.\" He grins and suddenly you're catching on. Rowell thinks you are the bar of soap he dropped. You try to scream, but before you can Rowell slams you in his pit and starts rubbing you all over it. The few suds with lavender scent had already washed off of you so you have no buffer to protect you from the sweaty scent. Because his pits are shaved it's not so much stale sweat, but still a lot of fresh sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get rubbed up and down and next down over his pecs as he swithces hands and gives you a look, feel and taste of the second pit. You hear Rowell softly hum some tune as he slowly cleans himself up. Suddenly you get removed from the pit and moved down, you know what's coming and are soon level with the giants groin and a second later get smooshed against it. Along the shaft you allready got quite familiar with earlier today. Next his sweaty ball, over, under and sideways as he humms a little louder. He takes his time. And as you are taken off you know the worst is yet to come. Moved around to the back you see him bend over just a little to open up his ass and stuffing you deep inside. Pressing hard down on you with two fingers as he roughly scrapes you down the dank space. Mouthfull off ass-sweat flow down your throat. And as you reach the pucker he let's out a massive fart. \"Oh, excuse me.\" He says, probably to the soap that is now in your place. In the meanwhile you breath in the ful blow of it and the lack of oxygen makes you dizzy, if not for the scent of fermented veggies and protein. Finally he removes you from his ass, rinses you of and places you on one of the shelfs against the back wall. You fall down and crawl up in a foetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell turns of the water and steps out of the shower, he dries off and wraps the towel around his waist. You see him back at the mirror putting on his contacts first. And after fumbling a bit he turns around and walk back over he reaches to the place he left you but stops mid-air. \"Wait... what the?\" Slowly he reaches and picks up the soap. He turns it over in his hand and looks at it. Next he looks at the shelf where he put you down and sees you lying there. He uses his free hand to point to the soap and then to you and suddenly his brain starts up and he gasps. \"Oh god, please don't tell me I just did to you what I think I did.\" His free hand snatches you off the shelve and he puts down the soap in your place. Using both his hands to cradle you he lifts you up so you can answer him. \"Okay, I won't tell you. But only because you know already.\" Rowell shakes his head. \"But how?\" You were on the platformover there, I saw you.\" You give him a smirk. \"You're little bastard knocked me off and took my spot.\" Rowell cringes, \"And I picked you up from the bottom of the tub, thinking you were the bastard?\" You nod, \"I guess the soap really is the bastard in this scenario.\" Rowell gives an unconvincing grin, \"I'm so sorry, I'm just blind without my lenses. But I should've known. Oh gods, you're gonna hate me for this forever.\" You give him a grin, \"No, not forever, just the rest of my natural life.\" This makes Rowell chuckle even in this situation. \"Okay, so you're not really gonna be angry about this?\" You shake your head, \"Terrified, scarred for life, yes. Angry, not so much. I know it was just a freaky accident. I wish I just would've known earlier, that without your lenses you couldn't discern me fro a bar of soap. I would not have chose to shower with you.\" Rowell grins, \"Understandable, and completely my bad.\" You wink, \"Well, I'll forgive you. So how about we get on with our lives and get ready to party.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell nods and lets you get dressed, helping you a bit with tying the string right. Before he puts on his shirt and walks out to the main room to the table. Rick gets up and grabs his stuff to take his shower and pours you and Rowell some coffee before he goes. You see Michael has gotten out a sewing kit and folded the boxers inside out stretching the material with a clothing hanger ment to keep dress pants nice and tout and a book under them so the elastic is free from the table. He waits for you to finish your coffee, before asking you to lay down right in the middle of the frontsection. He uses slowly slide you down just a little deeper so your chin is only just above the edge. \"You ready?\" He asks and you confirm. \"Spread out your arm and legs please.\" As you do so, you suddenly see a large shiny curved, needle slide through the elastic to your right, tracking a not too thin piece of thread. It curves around and goes back in very close to your left side. Now you feel the thread place over your back up to your shoulder and the needle pops into view again. This goes on for a while. Three stitches crossing over your back and shoulders and the next thee over your hips, between your legs and back up across your waist. the thread is tight enough to keep you in place, but not so tight it hurts. It takes Michael no more than five minutes before you hear him cut the thread and slowly take out the hanger. the elastic pulls backin and you feel the threads coming looser, but the way they are sewn, you would have to try your best to actually get out of your tiny harness. To prove this suddenly Michael holds the boxers upside down to see if you'll fall out. which you don't. \"I guess that settles it. You're good to go.\"Michael says and suddenly tosses the boxers across the table and you feel Rowell catching them. \"Now go get dressed.\" Michael says with a chuckle and Rowell gets up and walks into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops the towel and suddenly lowers you down and you see his two feet enter from the corner of your eyes. And suddenly you race up and feel his penis bump into your back for a second before you reach your destination and Rowell slowly lets the elastic fall to his skin. You notice your head is surrounded by this well-groomed treasure trail and lying comfortable in the crevice between his lowest abs. only about an inch above you, you can see the edge of his shirt. And he bends over to pull up a pair of pants. Carefully he closes the button on top of you and you feel the cold metal press against your stomach as the edge of his underwear peak out from above the rim of the pants. As he sits down to put on his shoes the pants press aginst you but not to uncomfortably tight. But you're glad he soon gets up again. He walks over to a standing mirror in the corner and you can see him standing there, Tight blue jeans, comfy sneakers, a tight orange shirt, the elastic of his boxers peeping out from the pants and just a tiny sliver of skin. But no matter how close you look, you can't see yourself untill Rowell almost steps inside the mirror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gaze up in the mirror to see a large grin on Rowell's face. Slowly he lowers his hand to touch the band of elastic right under your face. \"This is so gonna work.\" He whispers and you can only agree. \"Too bad I can't hear you down there. but well, when the music plays you'd be drown out anyways. He pulls his shirt straight applies a bit of mousse to his hair and tossles it. Then he turns and walks back into the room. You see everything from a whole new perspective. You can see Michael isn't there, but Rick is all dressed up sitting on the couch. He looks up and says to your surprise, \"So, Michael told me it didn't work out?\" Rowell almost falters, but gets Michael's idea a little sooner than you. \"Yeah, no. The string was either not tight enough or it cut too deep. So we decided to let it go. He takes a seat to the side and leans back exposing you as best as he can. And you see everything. You also see Rick looking straight at you, \"So where is he now?\" Wait Rick really doesn't see you.\" Rowell scratches his stomach just above you pulling up his shirt a little more. \"Oh he wanted to lie down for a bit. We decided he should just ride in Michael's shirt pocket instead. cause I'm not gonna wear a blouse.\" Rick nods and you see him look, \"Just pull down your shirt. It looks weird if you sit like that.\" Rowell chuckles and you can feel his muscles ripple against your back. But he does as Rick asks, straightening his shirt and waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Michael comes out of the bathroom fully dressed. \"Right, I'm ready to go.\" he says. Rick looks confused? \"Shouldn't you be wearing a blouse?\" Michael shakes his head. \"Why?\" Rick stammers a bit, \"Well... I thought you were gonna let the squirt ride in it?\" He looks back and forth between Michael and Rowell. You can see Michael starting to grin. Suddenly Rick leans forward and grabs the bottom of Rowell's shirts to lift it up. And suddenly he laughs. \"Oh my god,\" I totally didn't see him until now.\" Michael chuckles. \"So as long as Rowell can keep his dick from being sucked, we might pull it of.\" Rowell laughs at that and says, \"Great, now I have a tiny chastity belt?\" Oh well, I guess I can skip a night.\" And he gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all put on their jackets and walk out the door. As they walk out on the street you get a first good look at the city around you. For years you just scurried around in the tiny tubes like a mouse or in the small vehicles that get you around. But now for the first time you can actually enjoy a stroll down the street, Or at least Rowell's stroll. You see all these people around dressed in ways you couldn't imagine, no sensible clothing like you're used to wear, no school uniforms, but just all these colours and shapes. You can see cars, busses and bikes go by and suddenly you see your first motorcycle roar by. You have so much to take in, it makes you feel dizzy. When the guys wal down into the subway you see the turn-pikes and after passing those you hear the clattering train and the boys get in. It's a bit crowded so they stand pretty close together and you are faced with Michael's bulge for a while. You can't look away even if you wanted to. Finally they get out and walk back to street level. After a while they stop moving as they join a line. In front of you there are a couple of girls in flowery dresses giggling and looking back at your three counselors, of course they would. Because you realise they are probably considered very 'hot' guys.The line moces slowly, but after a while you see a rope and a bouncer as the girls are allowed in. A few minutes later the bouncer almost as big and wide as Rick asks \"How many.\" And Rick answers, \"Four... no wait, three.\" The bouncer shoots a curious look but shrugs and let's the three in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall you enter is spacious light, a red carpety floor, white walls and high ceilings and arches. A lot of pillars everywhwere in greek style and some statues that resemble a disc-thrower and a thinker. \"Welcome to 'The Bacchanale\" a female voice says, \"Can I take your coats?\" Rowell takes off his coat and hands it to the woman, getting a chip in return he shoves down his pocket. As he guys move down a few flight of stairs you hear the music swell to massive proportions as they enter a room as big as you;ve never seen. At least 5 times the size of the school gym. Dark with beams of light and smoke coming from all angles. You can't see over people's heads so all you see are hips and asses bouncing around, both male and female as Rowell weaves through the crowd. You get bumped up against some dancing bodies a few times, but nothing really that bad. Rowell walks up a few steps and turns. He leans out on a railing just a bit above the floor and you get a good view of the massive amount of people bouncing around, cheering, just having fun. Nothing like the parties you're used too. After a little while he turns and you see Michael and Rick coming back with some beers and Rowell takes one. He leans against the railing and now in the distance you can see the bar. Lit up, the barmen and woman wearing toga's and fake grapes hang just about everywhere. The walls are covered by images of a jolly, fat man drinking wine and dancing woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear the guys above you talk, but can't understand a word they're saying. Suddenly Rowell's hand comes down and holds out his hand first making a thumbs up, followed by a thumbs down. You guess he's asking you if you're okay. You wonder how to answer and by lack of better ideas you turn your head and dig your teeth in his flesh a bit one, giving him a soft nibble, once. He holds up his thumb again. He understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guys finish their beer Rowell suddenly starts moving and walks down to the dance-floor. When he reaches a tiny clear space he turns and you see the others have followed him. And then he starts to move. His hips start to shake in all directions along with the beat and he waves his arms around. You never expected a guy of his size to be so light on his feet as he twists and turn with the grace of a swan. As he dances on you see him getting a lot of approving looks. But you also notice something dripping on your head. Slowly a trickle of sweat runs down between his abs and over you, making you shiver. But soon the flowing blood from Rowell's moves makes his skin warm up to a very comfortable temperature. Suddenly a girl steps up and you see her grasping around Rowell's waist and they sway together for a few moments. You hear Rowell's voice from above and you can make out the word 'gay'. the girl sways a little longer, but finally steps away. As Rowell turns again, you see Rick having somewhat similar luck with the ladies. As two of them are dancing around him, one on each side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see Michael anywhere anymore, but figure he's probably curled up in a corner with a book. This does not seem like something he'd enjoy. When the song changes to a slower song Rowell starts to make a break for the bar but suddenly is blocked by a slim, tall man who pulls in Rowell and presses his junk roughly in your face and softly rubs it around in what you guess is some sort of dance. Rowell allows it for a while and you feel the man get harder in his pants. But Rowell backs away. Suddenly the man hooks his finger into the waist of Rowells pants right in front of you and pulls.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly Rowell jerks the hand away and even though it does scrape over you, the makeshift thread harness holds and you remain firmly in place. After pushing the guy away Rowell storms off to the bar and orders another drink. He downs it quickly and you still feel him quivering with anger. Suddenly Michael and Rick arrive and you hear part of the conversation in between the beats. \".. Pissed off... leaving... you stay... take care... Later.\" And suddenly Rowell starts moving again. After weaving through the crowd he finds the exit and you see him fish the token from his pocket and get his Jacket back. Outside he hails a cab and sulks all the way home next to the cabby that tried a few times to strike up a conversation. But Rowell obviously is still pissed about the guy. As he gets home he apologises to the cabby for being rude and you see him tip the guy enough to make him happy again. And he storms up the stairs and into his apartment. He collapses on his bed and you hear him scream in a pillow. Finally you feel a bit of the tension in his muscles behind you eb away. as he lays motionless for a while. \"I'm sorry, buddy, I didn't mean to end your night out so abruptly.\" You don't know if he can hear you but you talk as loud as you can. \"That's okay, I think I had enough excitement for one day anyhow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly he can hear you as he laughs softly. \"I can imagine.\" You wonder, \"You didn't like that guy?\" Rowell sighs, \"That guy has been trying to get in my pants for a while now. It's not that I didn't like him, but he's just too agressive and that makes me want to hurt him.\" You chuckle, \"You should tell him all he needs to do to get in your pants is to just shrink down to my size.\" This nets you a roaring laugh and suddenly Rowell undoes his pants and kicks them off before places his hand on top of your body. \"You're a good kid squirt.\" You bask in his warmth and say, \"You too Rowell. And thanks for letting me see the world of giants today. It was miraculous.\" Rowell softly rubs his hand up and down a bit. \"Really? What did you like best.\" And you start telling him how amazing everything was, the size, the lights and just all of it. As you keep talking about the most menial thing like turnpikes and motorcycles Rowell's breath slows down. Until suddenly you hear him snore. \"Wait, Rowell? don't fall asleep\" you yell. But it's too late. His hand still rests on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, you don't want to be stuck here all night. But there's not much you can do. Unless. You slowly wiggle yourself a little deeper forcing you head under the elastic band untill you can use your shoulder to push up the thread and find a way to get them in your mouth. As you put them in you notice they are moist from Rowell's sweat, but you chew on them as hard as you can. After a while, first one of them snaps, soon followed by the two others. With your hands you manage to pull the stitches back out, first around your chest and next the ones around your waste and legs. slowly balling it up you manage to work it out of the elastic and see them roll of the side of Rowell's body. You also managed to get one of your arms free from the elastic now. so you're as good as out, you figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you did not factor in the fact that Rowell still had his hand on top of you and your struggling must have made him itchy. Because suddenly it moves and his thumb slides over your face. Landing on his stomach right above your head. And only moments later starts to come down. Slowly pressing you down with it until your head dissapears completely under the elastic and even deeper into the actual briefs all you can do is look up as his thumb scratches the bit you were just laying before suddenly moving back up. You try to grab it, but there's nothing to hold on to and all of a sudden the elastic snaps back in place with a bang. locking you up inside his underwear. You want to scream at yourself for not just staying put. This is even worse. Because now all you can breathin is the musky scent of Rowells genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the material is pretty tight, you find you can still movea little if you try. But there is no way you can get this elastic to budge. So that leaces you with two options. Either stay here or try to crawl down his briefs and exit through one of the legs. You don't have to decide right away so you go over the options again. Finally coming to the conclusion that yes, you might have to crawl passed Rowell's dick, it's still the best way to act. Because is he rolls over. You're gonna end up smooshed again. Ever so slowly you start to crawl down, feet first. When you touch something soft with one of your legs you move away a bit and slde further into a tiny little pocket. You can actually turn around here. The ground is soft and flexible. On one side there's fabric and on the other a mound of skin. You know exactly where you are now. But don't want to think about being right next to Rowell's shaft and sitting on the op of his sack.  Of course you think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned around you can now crawl a little easier. Especially since the bulge of his shaft makes a small tunnel for you to crawl through but the soft skin of his balls doens't give you the most support, so the going is still a bit slow. By the time you reach the end of the tunnel you notice the smooth silky skin of his cockhead against your cheek and you realise you are now in for another hard part of crawling between fabric and leg. And already your muscles are burning up. You decide to rest for a few minutes before the next stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you regret that decision. Because suddenly Rowell does the thing you hope he wouldn't He rolls over on his side. And not the good on. He rolls the way that makes his penis hang above you and you caught between it and fabric. You try to push away, but suddenly you feel gravity not working in your favour as the shaft all lube up from his sweat slides over your legs, rising up over your chest, pinning your arms down and rolling you on your back as finally the head slides over yours. Untill it suddenly gets stuck in the very worst way. The slit of his dick is now stuck right on top of your face. You can smell and taste the inside of his ureathra. Something you never hoped you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to add insult to injury. Again Rowell tips over onto his stomach Which puts his bodies weight behind you and make your whole head slip into his slit. You just lay there unable to move, to scared to try and free your body by 'oozing out' as you might actually 'ooze in' deeper. And scared to move at all, what if you arouse him and the blood flows to his cock and it grows, will it crush your head? All you can do is close your eyes and pray for Rowell to wake up and find a way to get you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it through the night by reciting poetry to yourself. Limericks, children's songs, and even one of the caterbury tales you learned by heart. Untill finally Rowell rolls back on his stomach. He's starting to wake up you realise. But you also realise something else. Slowly but certainly the space around your head is getting tighter. Crap, you think. Morning wood! And as sure as the sun rises in the east, Rowell a healthy young boy rises in the south. You find his rising cock frees your body at least and ou try to struggle, placing your hands near your head and pushing off, but your head is in to deep and there's not enough room. Suddenly you hear Rowell stir and he moves around. \"What the fuck?\" You can make out and suddenly you feel his hand on your body supporting it. \"Oh my god, how did this happen. Did I do this?\" Rowell softly tugs on your legs, but this doesn't seem to get you loose. It feels like an actual vacuum has formed in his penis that keps you locked in. \"Okay buddy, I don't think you're gonna like it, but I think the only way to get you out squirt... is to well... squirt you out. Unless you have a better idea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You shudder at the thought, but you realise you can't stay like this forever. So you just let your body go limp. You hope it'ss send the message to Rowell that you have no better idea. You realise that simple physics dictate that as the size of his ureathra lenghtened without any access to outside air, It actually made you somewhat of a cork in a bottle of champagne. The only way for you to get out is form him to turn flacid, which you don't see happening any time soon with your body attached. Or to have a build-up of pressure big enough to pop you out. \"Okay than.\" You hear and you can feel Rowell grab hold of his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell slowly starts massaging his member, you wonder if it is because he wants to savour the moment or that he's scared to hurt you, but slowly he grows even harder and your head gets even more cramped. You also forgot about one aspect of this. Slowly the tube is you are in is filling up with pre-cum. This won't give you the pressure you need you realise, but it does rise to meet your face soon enough. With no place to go you feel there's only one logical thing to do and you open your mouth. Sucking in the salty-sweet liquid to catch your breath in between gulps. But it just keeps coming. You wonder if Rowell thought of this as he keeps going slow. As far as you can tell he isn't speeding up in the slightest. You have a certain experience with telling time without a watch, seeing as there are no watches in the size of a tiny. So you know he's at it at least fo about half an hour untill suddenly his cock gives a rough twince and a stream of more viscous material rams your face. You know it's just your imagination, but you can almost feel the tails of his spermcells lash against your face. You wait for another twitch, but it doesn't come soon enough. You have to down a mouthfull or two of the stuff. And realise it taste faintly like pineapple juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a few minutes later his cock twitches again. and again. You feel the pressure build up against your face as his cock keeps twitching and suddenly you feel yourself pop out and fly through the air covered in gunk that flows all around you untill suddenly you land on a concrete floor. You struggle up from the pool of cum and take a deep breath. Rubbing the stuff from your eyes and blowing it from your nose. Untill you can open one of your eyes and look right up at the face of a concerned, but also very blissfull Rowell. The concrete you landed on is actually his left pectoral muscle and Rowell's hand fishes you from your goopy prison. Slowly raising you to his bedside table and dunking you in the glass of water he left there. You gladly rinse of the stuff and almost rip off your clothes to get free from every bit of it. Slowly you get pulled out and Rowell wraps you softl in a tissue. After drying you off he places you on the bed next to his pillow, cleans of the rest of himself with another tissue and lays back down, rolling on his side to look at you. \"Wanna tell me what happened?\" he says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and explain about how he fell asleep and you tried to free yourself only to end up in that very awkward position. During your story Rowell can't help but grin. You finish your story with \"I should've just stayed put and have a little faith in you. I'm sorry I made it all so weird.\" Rowell chuckles. \"Oh please, don't worry about it. I'm just glad I didn't hurt you too much, did I?\" You shake your head. \"Nah, I'm fine, just a bit weirded out. Besides it was my own fault. I just never thought my first sexual experience would be with a giant, let alone a giant man.\" Rowell grins, \"Ah, I was your first.\" You shrug, \"Only tiny my age in our community, remember.\" Rowell grins again, \"Well, tell you what, how about I tell you my secret. You are actually the first man to touch my dick.\" You're mouth drops open, \"You're kidding.\" Rowell shakes his head. \"Nope, I sucked a few guys off before, but never had the courage to let them suck me, or give me a handjob. Let alone fuck someone. I was too scared I might... climax too soon.\" You shake your head. \"Well I can tell you from personal experienc you can actually postpone climaxing pretty good.\" Rowell gives you a wink. \"So how did I taste?\" You blink, \"What?\" He grins, \"Well I guess you must have gotten at least a taste. I'm just wondering.\" You can't belive what you're hearing, but you also can't believe what you're saying. \"Pineapple.\" Rowell chuckles. \"That's what I thought most guys taste like. By the way, I thought you going limp ment you didn't have a better plan, was I right.\" You nod, \"Yeah it was either this or waiting for you to go soft.\" Rowell grins, \"I don't think that was gonna happen with you stuck in there.\" You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell reaches over you to grab his phone. \"Oh my, guess I'm not the only one who scored. Both Michael and Rick did not go home alone. I just read this app that Michael won't be joining us for breakfast. And Rick might not be here before noon to pick you up.\" You're not quite sure how you feel about spending even more time with Rowell right now. \"I guess I can change my plans a bit. I was planning on taking a martial arts class this morning.\" You feel like this is your change. \"You don't have to skip that on my account.\" Rowell looks from his phone to you. \"I don't think you'd enjoy that.\" he says. You're not quite sure what he means but you say, \"No go ahead, I'll be fine.\" Rowell looks at you and shrugs, \"Okay, if you say so.\" He opens an app and clicks on a button you see says 'sign up'. \"It starts at 8:30, so we have some time to kill. you look at the clockradio and see it's only just past 6:00. Rowell grins, \"Sorry, morning person here, it drives Michael and Rick crazy.\" You chuckle, \"Rick is really NOT a morning person, I know.\" Rowell chuckles too. \"So how are we gonna do it with that class? You gonna ride in the back?\" Wait, what, oh god no. Rowell thinks you ment you wanna come with him to class? Maybe appeal to his conscience isntead of flat-out refusal, \"If you think it's safe enough, or you could just leave me here so I can catch some Z's.\" Rowell shakes his head, \"I'd rather not leave you behind, but it'll be safe enough, we just do a few poses, punches and kicks, we don't spar or roll around on the mat. The only safer place I can imagine is the front.\" You shake your head, \"I'm not going back there for a long time.\" Rowell grins, \"Ah, so one day you might?\" You give him an angry look, \"Not before the guy you cock-blocked.\" Rowell gives you a smirk, \"Ouch. Just remember you were being the cock-tease tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"can we change the subject please.\" Rowell sticks out his tongue, \"Sure, what do you want to talk about?\" Put on the spot you suddenly draw a blank. Trying to think about anything else only makes you think of Rowell's groin even more. \"Okay,\" he says, \"I'll start. If you could do anything after finishing school, what would it be.\" You think on it for a second. \"Get a good job at some place fun, make new friends, join a community of tinies my own age and enjoy my life.\" Rowell nods, \"So not interested in a job teaching the young-uns?\" You shake your head, \"Not in the slightest, but it's my role I have to play.\" Rowell blinks, \"You're a real bumpkin sometimes squirt.\" You tilt your head, \"Why?\" Rowell smiles softly, \"I think your community spirit is actually crueshing the hopes and dreams of many tinies and forcing them into a self-sustaining sub-par living environment which will always keep the tinies in a status of second-rate citizenship.\" Your mouth drops open. \"Wait? You are smart?\" Rowell gives you a wink. \"Surprised you didn't I. But yes, I'm not the idiot most people think I am. I actually get good grades, I only suck at math, but a B- is still good enough. I intend to graduate and study at the university, probably on a sport-scholarship. It's why I chose this school it is known to get you in a lot of the great uni's. I wanna study biology or medicine and become a physical therapist and personal trainer.\" You can't believe what you're hearing. \"But you're the goofball?\" Rowell laughs, \"And that's coming from the kid who has the highest grades in physics, chemistry and English, but will settle for being a teacher.\" You gasp, \"Wait, you know?\" Rowell nods, \"We all know, we've been looking out for you remember. So we check up on your grades and keep you around, sometimes we do stuff to you the principal expects to make it seem we're making your life a living hell. He has some spies lurking around. So we stuff you down our shorts or fart on you.\" You shake your head, \"I had no idea.\" Rowell grins, \"And guess what some of the teachers are actually quite taken with you and have petitioned for you to skip at least one grade since you're prior, tiny education apparantly is far more advanced than that of most freshman. So you might graduate a bit sooner than you think. Who knows maybe next year we'll be in the same class.\" You give him a look, wait aren't you a senior?\" Rowell grins, nope sophomore, the only one on the team. Like you're our only freshman.\" Rowell winks, \"And if you ever call me a goofball again, I'm gonna sit on you so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still can't believe what you're hearing and learning today. And all you can think off is what he told you not to. \"Goofball.\" It's out before you know it.</span></div></div>",

You try to dive away, but he's quicker and grabs you in an instant. Unceremoniously dropping you behind him and soving his rump right on to you. Wiggling a bit to get comfy and suddenly he sighs and sinks deep down into the mattress, taking you with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to slap your face, but of course you can't so you just wait it out. Fortunately Rowell get up only a few minutes later. \"Too bad I don't have any more time to spare, but I am hungry. And should eat at least a while before training. You see him put on some sweats before he grabs you from the mattress and takes you to the table. He fixes some breakfast and coffee and makes a nice spread for you too. As you start to eat Rowell stares at you intently, you try to ignore it but after a while get really uncomfortable, \"What?\" you snip at him. Rowell swallows his bite of cereal and grins, \"Nothing, it just amazes me how much you can stow away, I mean, you probably eat multiple times your body weight a day.\" You take another bite. \"Really? I never thought it weird?\" Rowell grins, \"I guess it's just one of those things. But I mean I kinda... well... force-fed you some stuff this morning and still you can hunker down on that food right there. I'd thought you'd be too stuffed.\" You give him a look, \"Please don't bring that up again... like ever.\" As he just taken another spoon full he sprays a bit of milk over the table as he holds back his laugh. Thankfully you're out of the splash zone. \"Ah, sorry about that. I don't want to make you too uncomfortable about it. But dude, I can't help but think it was f-ing hilarious.\" You shrug, \"Let me remind you of these words when you get caught in some humiliating position.\" Rowell shakes his head, \"I promise if something that humiliating happens I'll send you a picture.\" You shake your head, \"Ew, please don't.\" And the both of you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Rowell cleans up and stretches.\"You know what I need? A nice hot bad.\" He grins, \"If you want you can join me. I'll even wear some speedo's if that will make you feel better. \"You shrug, \"Fine with me. I still feel sticky... No comment... so I guess a soak would do me good.\" You give him a look. \"And yes on the speedo's\" Rowell laughs and goes to turn on the water to fill the bathtub before going in his room and coming out in a pair of black speedo's. As he comes to pick you up, you can't help but notice that he is actually barely contained by them. But at least it's better than nothing. You let yourself be carried to the tub and placed on one of the corners. As Rowell steps into the water it rises tremendously and soon the tub is full. As his feet are pointed at you, you see his upper body slump down in the water and his eyes closed. \"Jump in when you feel like it.\" he says and you don't need a second invite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dive in and swim a few strokes under water diving under his bended knees and up the other side. You've always loved water for some reason, it makes you feel free and you make a few turns and rolls before rising to the surface. Rowell applauds you by clapping his flat hand on the side of the tub. \"Wow, you make it look so easy, you should've joined the swimteam.\" You shake the water from your hair and grin. \"Oh please. I couldn't beat any of the giants. And the diving team only has the high-dive. I'd be squashed against the surface if I tried that. And well, we don't have a synchronized swim-team. So water sports... not my thing.\" Rowell grins, \"you should petition for one, who knows maybe some guys would like it. I could be convinced, I mean cute guys in speedo's? If I could swim fast I'd be on the team for sure.\" You swim over to the upper part of his stomach, right below hisp pecs, as this is wear his body starts to come out of the water and you lay on your back on top of him. \"What? I'm good enough to be your beached whale?\" Rowell jokes, but you hear he doesn't mind. \"Yeah, you say, \"Cause I'm gonna need you to actually get out of this tub later on.\" Rowell chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay back, you slowly feel the hot water relaxing your muscles. Muscles you didn't even know were soar. As you just lay there and let yourself rise and fall with Rowell's breathing you get a faint familiar feeling. Slowly you relax even more untill suddenly you hear Rowell gasp. \"Squirt, what the hell.\"You feel yourself be scooped up by his hand, but notice you feel somewhat floppy. You open your eyes and stare at Rowell who looks positively freaked. Only to realise you allowed your body to become pliable and with a thought you suddenly snap back into your own form. \"Oh, sorry about that.\" you mumble but Rowell just looks stunned. \"How?\" He lowers you to the edge of the tub where you take a seat. \"I'm not sure,\" you say, \"I kinda found out I can turn myself pliable. But up untill now I only did it in self-defence.\" Rowell blinks, \"Pliable as in, like silly putty?\" you nod. \"I found out yesterday with Rick. But I can't really control it... apparantly. It happens when I just relax and let things happen.\" Rowell just looks at you, \"That is so weird,\" he waits a second before adding, \"but also really cool. How far do you stretch?\" You shrug, \"I don't know. Rick kinda found me that way in his underwear and said I covered a lot of it. But I guess it felt to me like I could've stretched more.\" Rowell chuckles, \"Like if you wanted to you could actually cover it all?\" You think on it. \"Maybe? I don't know. I think I could've yes.\" Rowell grins. \"That would be so weird. Having a living piece of underwear.\" He pauzes for a second, \"But besides that, if you could control it you would be able to go out into the city, hide anywhere you'd like. Or fight crime, the amazing tiny-ooze.\" You grin at that thought. \"I think I'd almost rather be skin-tight underwear than be seen in some skin tight lycra suit.\" Rowell grins, \"Well if you ever feel like trying, I'd wear you.\" You know he tries to make it sound like a joke, but there's also a hint of curiousity or desire in there somewhere. \"But why didn't you use your powers to get out of my cock?\" You grin sheepishly, \"I was scared I would actually end up being sucked in sooner than oozed out.\" Rowell chuckles. \"I guess that could've happened, so you did the smart thing.\" So can you do it on command now? \"I can try.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you try to remember the feeling from earlier and as you do you know it's just a little bit beyond your grasp. The more you try to reach it the farther it seems. And then you remember the mantra, 'give in' And suddenly you feel like you fall apart and feel yourself slowly oozing down into the water. you allow yourself to stretch even further and you hear Rowell say, \"Wow\" As he slowly holds you up you feel really big. Before suddenly you let your body slowly reform. \"Dude, you were like half the size of my towel.\" Rowell grins. \"I almost felt like drying off with you, but realised you wouldn't be very absorbent.\" You grin at the joke. \"True, guess that's one thing that would make me a horrible choice to be underwear.\" Rowell chuckles, I've worn leather before.\" you chuckle too, \"I bet you have.\" Rowell lowers you to his stomach again and you soak a little longer. after a while he suddenly takes a deep breath, \"Okay, I can't let this go. Mainly because you never said a flat out no. So please just say no when I ask you if you'd consider letting me wear you as underwear for a while.\" You close your eyes and don't respond immediatly. You know it is just to weird and too gross to even consider, but Rowell seems like such a nice guy and well, you also think it wouldn't make much of a difference between riding around in his undies or being them. You notice Rowell's breath racing as he waits for your answer. \"Fine we can try it,, but only if you promise to NEVER tell anyone about it, or about me being pliable.\" Rowell immediatly answer, \"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply and suddenly say. \"Okay, Just get up and stuff me down the back of your speedo's so I can take their shape. Rowell almost jumps out of the tub. And before he shoves you down you say. \"And make a picture for me, so I can see it alter. Cause I don't know if I can see myself after. The next moment you are face to ass in his speedo's. Slowly you relax, this time the feeling comes easier and you feel your body creeping out along the lycra. Slowly filling it. Your body covering his ass down to his taint and over his balls and cock, up to the wiast and around his legs. You feel like you can adjust the position of your facial features and suddenly feel the need to place your mouth and tongue right under his taint as you remember his tast was best down there. After you feel like you're covering all the inside you slowly pull your body closer to make a tight fit and You feel Rowell remove the speedo's. \"Wicked!\" he says and you feel him turning around to look at himself. \"You're actually like a pair of very vomfy skin coloured briefs. You think you can stay like this for a while.\" You can't even answer, but you do feel Rowell starting to move. After a while he stops and suddenly you feel him bend over and feel something being pulled up over you on the outside.\"Great, he moves around a bit and suddenly you hear him open the door and run down the stairs. \"I'll let you change back when I get home. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just relax and take in his warmth and the tast of his taint. Untill it hits you. He's going to wear you during his Martial arts training.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rowell bounces down the steps, with a spring in his step from his 'new underwear' you realise two things:<br>\r\n1. If you let go now, you will probably fall out of his pants in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n2. You have nothing better to do.<br>\r\nThe first one scares you almost to death, while the second one just makes you a bit sad. But you know it's true. Most weekends you just hang around the house, studying because you're bored. Playing some games with your parents, or helping out in the community garden. This weekend even though it has been really weird at times, the guys actually showed you some things you never imagined you would see. Sure, this is not the highlight of the weekend. Even though Rowell's body feels nice and warm and his movements are almost similiar to heing massaged with hot stones. And the taste you get from his taint isn't bad at all. The fact he is actually wearing you like nothing more than a pair of briefs and enjoying himself. It makes you wonder if this guy is as friendly as he appears. What if he ends up abusing the knowledge, blackmailing you and making you do things like this all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for you to notice Rowell had left the streets and suddenly is standing still and straight as you hear a voice welcome them to class. Apparantly today would be focused on legs, with kicks splits and all that stuff. But first a warm-up, Rowell starts jogging around the room and suddenly starts to get sweaty. slowly but surely you get covered by his sweat and realise you have to try something. You wonder if you could actually change the structure of your body. Becoming more breathing. But as you try you fail. Maybe you can absorb some of his sweat into your body? You think about that, imagining yourself become covered with tiny ripples guiding th sweat into your open mouth. Slowly your body ripples a little and suddenly a massive collection of droplets of sweat streams down to the deepest part of you where your mouth and waiting tongue are suddenly torrented by a taste so strong, so salty, so sour, so sweet, just so Rowell. You forget everything as this explosion of taste makes you feel like you are on a high. It just is so bad it is good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the warm-up Rowell starts some stretches, sitting down, spreading his legs and bending forward and back. You do your best to follow his lead, letting yourself be scraped along his skin, stretched out, contracted again. Just like a piece of elastic fabric. Slowly Rowell widens his legs giving himself a slight wedgie pushing you into his crack. Finally he gets up again and the real training starts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turns out to be a more active part for you to, as he practices explosive high kicks and jump kicks, it take all your focus to just keep up adjusting yourself. But after a while you get in a rythm and start to do it less consciously. Still enjoying his taste you just let yourself be stretched, twisted and turned. Keeping Rowell as dry as you can. The class goes on for about 90 minutes and by that time you almost feel at ease with the part you had in Rowell's excersize program. You enjoy the fact this strong, muscled and agile man calls you his friend. And knowing that you have just about taken the worst the world could have ever offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class Rowell hangs around a bit to thank the teacher and have something to drink with the other students. After a while he gets up and you hear him walk into an echoing room and suddenly you feel his and grab the part of your body to the front of his body to below his balls and you hear a stream of water hitting porcelain. I he actually peeing? After the stream dies down you feel yourself being tucked up again and suddenly a few remaing drops of piss trickle down into your mouth. The salty taste would've made your mouth close if it could. But the taste is soon replaced again with that of his sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a leadk, Rowell says goodbye to the rest and starts walking home. As he enters his apartment again he sits down on the couch and suddenly you feel him sticking his hand down his pants and slowly he starts stroking you. \"Damn dude, you are definately the most comfortable piece of underwear I've ever worn. I could wear you all day and not feel compromised like normal shorts make me feel.\" For a while he just sits there. \"But I guess a promise is a promise. you can change back now, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou indeed agree that for now it has been enough, slowly but steady you start to focus on your own normal shape again.</span></div></div>",

The soft ripples must be tickling Rowell a bit as he moves his legs just a bit. Which makes your body stretch and adjust and you lose your focus. You try it again but with the same result. Suddenly you realise the problem. You can't change back as long as your body is not completely motionless. You wonder it Rowell is gonna understand this, but you fear for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not changing back?\" You hear Rowell say, \"Well, that's fine with me, I won't mind wearing you for the rest of the day... you just turn back when you feel like it.\" Suddenly Rowell gets up and walks into his room, your still open mouth scraping along his unwashed skin. Suddenly Rowell bends over a little and as he straightens you realise he's pulled up one of his tighter jeans squashing you up against him. \"This way if you decide to change back, you won't fall out immediatly.\" He explains, still not getting the fact you can't change back until he decides to take you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that it probably is only close to noon by now, so if Rowell decides to keep you on all day, it will be a very long day for you. \"I guess, it's a good thing Michael isn't around to ask questions about your where-abouts, he won't be home till late, he's visiting his family today. so I guess it's just me and my swanky new shorts. But how are we gonna pass the time? I mean I could just sit and play videogames or something, but that would seem like a waste of this experience? I feel this calls for something more... festive?\" Suddenly Rowell sits down and you hear him start typing, After a while he laughs, \"Great, there's a festival in the park, with music and dancing. I guess I could go there.\" You feel a lump in your (phantom) throat, a whole day of being walked around and dancing sounds like a bad and sweaty day to you. but already Rowell is getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it he is out the door and a short subway ride later you hear him emerge into a crowd and a lot of music. The following hours you realise, this is probably the worst day of your life. As Rowell runs around, dances, twist, swings and occasionaly sits, all you can do is feel him move around, adjust yourself and let his sweat trickle down your mouth. Finally after enduring it all you notice the music fading as he walks and soon enough you are back on the subway. When he enters his hime again you feel him walking around and finally a bit of light shines through as he takes of his pants and suddenly lets himself fall forward on the bed. \"Oh, am I tired.\" I guess you were to scared to change back out there, not like I would've lost you or anything. But by now my smell and taste must be killing you.\" You couldn't agree more. Rowell just lays there for a while and suddenly chuckles. \"Still not changing back? Don't tell me you like a life as my underwear\" How stupid is this guy? \"Or are you trying to convince me you have more stamina than me? You think I'm the kinda guy that changes needs to change his undies on a daily base? is that it?\" He rolls over and pulls up a part of you in the front. \"You seem pretty self-cleaning, I don't feel sweaty down there at all, at least no more than usual. so if you wanna play a test of will, be my guest. I'll just sleep you off and figure I'm gonna be naked when I wake up. Good thing tomorrow is a holiday so you won't have to go to school smelling like my undies.\" Oh, crap, you forgot, no school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell rolls over again and stretches himself out, covers himself with a blanket and falls a sleep pretty soon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the night you keep trying to focus on escaping, but every time you try even the slightest movement of Rowell's body stops you in your tracks, finally you just give up. You're not gonna get out of this without his help. Patiently you wait for him to wake up. And finally it happens. As soon as the buzzer goes of Rowell stretches and reaches down, slowly rubbing the outside of your body. \"Wow, still there for the wear, aye?\" Rowell chuckles softly. \"Well, I guess you win, because even though there's no school, I still need to get my miles in on the bike and you don't wear undies in your racing short, unless you wanna get burned. Unless...\" Suddenly Rowell sits up a bit and starts pulling on the part of you that is covering his legs. And you can't help but let yourself be stretched out even further and thinner untill you notice he let's go as soon as your body is covering his entire thigh. A second later he pulls by the other leg and again you stretch. You have a very bad feeling about what he's about to say. But he says nothing yet as he gets up and walks a few paces. He turns a bit and you hear him grin. \"You look just like a pair of skin coloured lycra's now. But you're skin tone is pale enough compared to my legs that people will see soon enough that I'm wearing pants all the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he starts working on the part covering his waist and private tugging and pressing. Slowly his pulling pulls your mouth forward past his taint and wide enough for one of his balls to slide in. Probably completely unaware to what happened he stuffs his hand down the front and wiggles his fingers in your mouth to widen it enough so his second ball slips in as well and suddenly you can't hold back and swallow, creating somewhat of a vacuum which draws in his balls deeper and makes your mouth an almost irresistable pouch and the grunt Rowell lets out makes you realise he thinks it's quite comfy. He stretches the back front and sides up too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a perfect fit and I don't think you'd chafe me, would be like riding naked , right?  And I guess I could wear my water belt to cover most of my ass when standing and a longer top. So no one would notice the lack of seems.\" Focus... you think.. you need to focus. \"So what do you think, think you can play the part of my shorts or are you gonna drop out?\" You still have no luck whatsoever in turning back and now that you're stretched even thinner and held in place by the enourmous thighs too, you know that you thinking yesterday was the worst, is coming back to haunt you. \"You do realise, you can't change back during the ride, right? So if you agree to this we both can't back out.\" Rowell's considerate question drives you crazy. \"Not that I would want to back out. I guess I'm really curious to having a chance at wearing a pair of living shorts. But don't just do it for me, only do it if you feel secure enough you'll make it, you're already down there longer than I would've dreamed of.\" He waits a few second before grinning. \"Okay, just don't expect me to go easy on you.\" He starts to move and his balls rub softly against the inside of your mouth and over your tongue as you hear him put on a shirt and zipper up. You notice the back falls a good way over his ass, or the back of you and he clicks a belt in place to keep his shirt close. As he sits down you feel yourself stretching more as he bends down to put on his shoes,  and as soon as he gets up you snap back. You feel Rowell running his hand over his ass. \"Nice stuff, normally bending over this far makes my shorts wrinkle a bit when getting up, but you just stretch and return. I can't wait to see if you are as helpfull when riding.\" As he walks around a bit he suddenly stops. \"One thing I didn't think off. You have no padding to keep me comfortable? do you?\" Slowly you feel his hand enter the front and feel around. suddenly the tip of his finger enters your mouth and touched your already flattened tongue. Suddenly a second finger follows and as the two fingers press down they also pull up and all you can do is give in as he slowly massages your tongue out of your mouth and up. His other  hand starts squeezing the outside. Does he understand what he's doing, you really don't think he is. But when he finally seems concent he pulls back his hand from the inside and you snap back your tongue against his flacid penis. \"I guess this will work, I don't know how you do it, but you somewhow gave me a nice extra layer of you in the front, so I won't be so exposed and it feels padding enough to ride with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow not only do his balls fill your mouth, but a he moves his dick rubs up against your tongue already overloading your tastebuds. But as he clickity-clack down the stairs, you realise it's only gonna get worse. Soon enough he gets his bike out and as his left leg sweeps up he gets on and lowers himself on the saddle. He shoves around a bit and pushes off. As he slowly starts pedalling you feel like you are being pulled apart, but as soon as you're stretched out the furthest on one leg, it comes back and you feel relief on that side, only to feel the stretch on the other side. It's not all that painfull you realise, but far from a comfortable feeling. In the meanwhile as he slowly starts to build up speed, it does not take much time for him to build up a sweat. Seeing as he didn't shower after waking up he was already a bit sweaty and stale, but as he keeps moving his balls soon give off a stable trickle of sweat which flows down your somewhat existant throat apparantly. Also the fact that you are not made of a breathable material also make sure none of the moist evaporates due to the speed and all of his sweat has only one way to go, into you. By now also his dick has started to give of sweat and the musky taste is rubbed off on your helpless tongue. If you could open your eyes you would've cried. But all you can do is wait and suffer as all Rowell does is speed up and enjoys his ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no clue how long it takes for Rowell to finally slow down a little. but finally he stops. As he gets of his bike he walks a bit. Soon he must shower you think. \"A coffee and a curler please.\" Wait, he's only taking a break? Rowell sits down on a hard bench for a few minutes as he drinks his coffee and eats his breakfast. And next he gets up and steps on his bike again. And once more you are tormented by Rowell's movements and sweat. At least as long as the first run you stay trapped in a way you couldn't have imagined in your worst nightmares. And Rowell just doesn't seem to tire out at all. You wish you dared faint, but you wouldn't know how that would end up for you. You almost feel like reaching a breaking point as Rowell slows down again and gets of his bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he is home as he puts his bike away and clickity-clack up the stairs. Finally he enters the apartment and walks to the sink to drink some water. \"Michael's out with Rick, they'll be home later. Guess they figured you went with me.\" He starts to do some stretches. \"You make one decent pair of biking shorts, you know? No chafing, no lack of padding, if you breathed a bit more you'd be perfect, I felt a lot sweatier than normal, but I can live with that. I guess you actually made that worse for yourself, because I can think of only one place that sweat could have disappeared into.\" He walks a few paces and finally you hear him enter the bathroom. \"So, you can snap out of it now.\" Rowell waits for a few seconds. \"Still stubborn. Fine, I'll give.\" After what seems a lifetime he finally starts to pull you down his body. His balls fly out of your mouth with an audible pop. And next he steps out of you and you feel yourself crumpled up on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you get to focus long enough to pull your body back in shape and the first thing you do is draw in a breath of air, bad move as Rowell's sweaty feet are still close enough for you to get a blast of them, but still, it feels good to breathe. You feel yourself being lifted and look up at a smiling Rowell. \"There we go, you look good as new. Although I liked your other look. He holds up his phone and shows you a picture of himself wearing you earlier. \"Wow... I really did look like a pair of bikeshorts.\" Rowell chuckles. \"Yeah, no one would ever imagine that those shorts were actually made of an actual human. So are you sorry you didn't change back this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what to say...</span></div></div>",

You mean you couldn't change back at all, when did you find that out?\" You can't be totally honest right? \"Tonight, when I tried to free myself, you were right, I kinda was done with it by the time you fell asleep.\" Rowell looks slighty relieved, \"Oh good, so I didn't force too much on you. You didn't want to turn back yeterday morning, that would've been horrible.\" You nod slightly but don't dare to say anything. Rowell grins, \"So at least you did enjoy being my underwear for a while, didn't you.\" You nod again and this time you can answer honestly, \"Yeah for a while it was kinda cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowell turns serious again, \"But I did force you to be my biking shorts without your consent whatsoever. Did you... hate it.\" You grin convincingly, you hope. \"Well, at least this morning when you 'adjusted' me to be a good fit, I learned a lot about how far I can actually stretch, so that's good.\" Rowell gives you a half-smile as you go on, \"And I guess if you had asked me straight-up I would have declined, but now we both learned it can be done. But it's not somethin I look forward to doing again soon. So next time I just hope you stick to weightlifting and martial arts.\" Rowell grins, \"So you're saying if I promise to just keep it easy on you, you'd let me wear you as my underwear again someday?\" You shrug. \"Well you told me I was comfortable, so I don't see why I can't help you out every once in a while.\" Rowell grins, \"That would be so awesome, I would love to wear you as a thong someday during a show. or maybe just as a comfy pair of short when I'm lazy and hang out around the house.\" you can't stop yourself from asking, \"Was I really that comfortable?\" Rowell nods without thinking twice. \"Like a second skin. which isn't quite as surprising I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you notice Rowell is still standing there dripping with sweat from his ride and you feel your mouth water a bit as you look at his glistening chest. \"How about we hold this convo for now and get you... and me... cleaned up first?\" Rowell grins and steps into the bathtub, before turning on the shower. As soon as he is in, he also steps out leaving you on the soapdish, before removing his contacts. As he steps in again, he reaches down to grab you. You let yourself be brought up to his face and he grins, \"Am I holding the soap, or the little bastard. \"You chuckle softly and drop down on his open palm, which gives him the hint to start scrubbing. Starting with his pits you taste his sweat again, but here the sweat is a bit sweater than where you were before. But after the pit he starts rubbing you on his massive chest and down his abs. Which you really enjoy. Of course the worst parts are up next, starting with a quick wash of his groin and ending up in his ass-crack, but after spending more than 24 hours as this guys underwear, you don't mind it all that much. at least you are human shaped right now. Before ending his shower Rowell takes his time to rinse you off too and by then you almost feel up to anything again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rowell has towelled dry and put in his contacts you notice Michael's watch, 10 am. Which means if your guess is correct and Rowell got up around 6, you must have spent more than three hours as his bike-shorts. And well over 24 hours as his underwear all together, as you expected. \u00c4s Rowell towells his hair dry he sees you looking at the watch. \"Quite the 24 hours for you right?\" You nod. \"Guess you deserve a bit of a rest. I was just gonna do some studying anyway.\" You look up at Rowell, \"anything you need help with?\" Rowell shakes his head, \"Nah, I'm good with Spanish actually. So you can just relax.\" you shrug, \"So I just get to wait till you're done studying or one of the others comes to pick me up. Sounds kinda boring, but okay.\" Rowell grins, well, \"I'll only be studying till lunch, so you could take a nap or something and we can do something else this afternoon. I was planning on going to the gym, but I can skip that.\" you shake your head, \"You probably shouldn't.\" Rowell nods, \"So what else is there you can do, I guess you can't play videogames, but I could put on a movie for you, not too loud though, Because that might distract me.\" He picks you up and moves to his room and puts you on the bed, before rummaging through some drawers, \"Crap.\" he mutters and suddenly turns to a basket in the corner and looks in. \"I totally forgot to do my laundry this weekend with all the excitement. Be right back.\" He carries out the basket and comes back a few minutes later scratching his head. \"stupid, now I don't have any underwear to wear today.\"</span></div></div>",

It's weird for a second I didn't even think about our size difference there. Probably because you're the only tiny I actually had a conversation with.\" You smile, this guy has no bad bone in his body, just a few stupid ones. Rowell leans forward resting his arms on his knees and grabbing the back of his head. He shakes his head and suddenly looks up and back at you. \"No.\" you say before he can even ask. Rowell grins, \"That obvious?\" you nod. \"I think I've had my share for today.\" Rowell grins, \"Well I won't argue with you there, but still... It's the only way I can go to the gym.\" He suddenly kneels down in front of the bed. \"I know it's a lot to ask, but please, won't you think about it? I promise I'll make it up to you one way or the other.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are competely flabberghasted, a guy who could threaten you, or probably make you do anything he wants one way or the other is begging you a tiny for something. You don't have the heart to tell him no, now. \"Fine...\" You mutter, \"Just get up and stop embarrassing yourself.\" Rowell grins and sits back up on the bed. \"Thanks man, I really owe you one, but can you do it without a proper example?\" You shrug, \"I don't know. I guess I can try. just remember to take me off after getting out of the gym. I don't wanna be stuck on you all night again.\" Rowell sticks out his tongue, \"That's your own fault for being so comfy.\" You grin and flip him off, \"Not helping your case.\" But you let yourself fall on your back and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely you get that familiar feeling again and you allow your body to stretch, this time you try to stretch in a way that leaves you face mostly intact. You try to remember the shape of the underwear you know you're not big enough and stretch even furthert and further, curling in on yourself and suddenly your own body is covering your face. And still you stretch. All of a sudden you realise you're ready and you stop. You feel Rowell picking you up gently and as he looks inside you see him grin. \"Neat, you managed to keep you head in shape. Can you talk?\" You try it out, \"I think so.\"you look around yourself and wonder in what part you are. \"You didn't chose the best spot though.\" Rowell grins. \"And you realise he's right as soon as he says, \"I think you're gonna end up right u my hole. But you probably did that on purpose.\" Without giving you time to answer he lowers you down and steps into the legholes you managed to form, right foot, then left. Slowly he raises you up gently tugging you past his humoungous thighs and he wasn't lying, you can't help but look up as deep between the glutes his pucker, comes closer and closer, You try to focus to let your face move, but as you are already being stretched you realise you can't. You take one last deep breath and in a sudden darkness as the light is blocked you feel your lips kissing him right where you don't want to be. A few last adjustments and your body slips in place as Rowell's underwear. From the outside his hand slides over his ass and down, from behind you feel his finger softly press against your head, rubbing your face over his entire hole. \"That feels good, I think this is perfect for when I get itchy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he takes a few steps you notice you're close enough that you're practically held in place, which is a good thing. But as he bends over to put on some pants the hole slightly opens over your face, before it slides back as he stands up. leaving your face uncovered again. You realise the face he just showered will not save you later on. From his movements you notice Rowell is getting dressed further and suddenly he walks out. Guess he's heading for the gym. But all of a sudden you hear a chair scrape and he sits down which presses his hole down deep on top of you. \"all right, you hear him say, two hours of cramming and than we can go work-out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've facepalmed if you could. He told you he was gonna study his Spanish first, you could have waited till he was done before letting him put you on. After only a few minutes you notice the fact you kept your face in shape also means your nose is wokring. Which also increases your sense of taste and before long your mouth is filled with the taste of Rowell's still fresh, but slowly getting rankier hole.It doesn't help the guy keeps moving back to front or twitching his leg. But after what seems an eternity you hear him slam his books and get up. \"All right, on to the main event.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moves around a bit packing his bag, and you figure he's probably already dressed for the gym, because the shorts he wears feels loose and smooth. Soon enough he is out the door and a short walk later he enters a place with music playing and you hear him greet some people he probably knows. After dropping his bag in the locker room he comes back and meets up with to people who'se voices sound familiar. \"So legday today?\" both of the grunt and so do you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe next two hours or so Rowell does thousands of reps on leg-presses, abduction machines, he does dips and lunges and you are along for the ride. Soon enough you feel yourself get stretched out and get sweated on. And the hole in front of you gets more moist and starts to taste pretty bad. But it gets worse when he is on another set of deep squats as a few reps in his hole suddenly slides all the way over your head and suddenly locks behind it and as he gets up your head bets pulled in deep into his slimy, sweaty hole. You hope you will slide out again soon, but this is idle hope and you know it. You can't hear anything but the blood pumping through his veins and with every twist and turn you get scraped against the slimy walls forced to guzzle down ass gunk. You wonder why Rowell doesn't get you out, but realise he probably doesn't even know what happened, because he is busy and you move around easily, lubricated by his sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the work-out you stay stuck like this and you only realise the work-out is over because the intervals between the movements have ceased and now he's just walking. You hope it's home.</span></div></div>",

However, it soon turned into hell for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bullying wasn\u2019t spared on this team, in fact many of the cyclists smiled evilly upon seeing you walk in on the first day. While you were picked on by many if not all the team, your four main tormentors boiled down to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth<br>\r\n- A blond senior with a lean muscled body. The boy would always smuggle you away from the equipment to take rides with him. These rides were unpleasant as they had you acting as his seat cushion. Having a firm ass and being squashed against the seat wasn\u2019t a good place to be when Seth drops a fart on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac<br>\r\n- This brunet was already a giant, reaching heights of 6\u20198. He lived up to his appearance as his favorite method of torture was stomping you and placing your body in his sneaker. He was rather dimwitted though, and simply said that he wanted to crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalter<br>\r\n- The couch of the team. Although he cycled for years, the thirty year old made a career in body building. This left him with his massive muscles that always looked reading to burst from his clothes. Usually cold and expressionless, the brunt man took delight in you sitting between his thighs and occasionally under his firm glutes as well. He always gained a cocky smirk when he sat near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew<br>\r\n- The dirty blond boy was a gentle giant, standing at 6\u20196 with a impressive set of muscles. He actually seem to be afraid of you, feeling that being even remotely close would hurt you somehow. Still, he was your tormenter unintentionally. A common joke was to place you on his seat just as he sat down. You then were stuck under his huge bubble butt and had to see his horrified face when he found out what the \u201citch\u201d between his cheeks was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill walking in today you wondered what torment you would face. Yesterday, Matthew looked like he was about to burst into tears after finding you under his butt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in you saw that.....</span></div></div>",

I joined the cycling team, because I need to have one sportsteam to be part of and I thought being a singles sport I would just help out with the equipment and stuff. Instead I feel like part of the equipment most of the time. Being shoved under one ass or another. But still if I quit, I get expelled, because no other sport will be different. You could probably joiin the wrestling team or whatever. And that would leave me with the real assholes that do it on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew leans down a little, \"Wait, so you're also being bullied.\" You feel like you wanna smack this guys face. \"Well, yeah, They think they torture me as much as they do you by puting me on your saddle.\" Matthew blinks. \"Oh, so you're not in on the joke?\" You shake your head, \"I'm actually as much the, pardon the expression, butt of the joke as you.\" Matthew smiles weakly at your choice of words. You quickly add, \"Still it's better than being under Seth's farty ass or Seth trying to stomp on me. At least you're not actively trying to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens and the coach walks in. \"Matthew, time for you to get on your bike and catch up with the rest.\" As the coach notices him looking at you he asks. \"Are you gonna take the tiny out with you, or should I babySIT him.\" The emphasis on the sit in babysit didn't go unnoticed by both you and Matthew.</span></div></div>",

He sees your look and gets it. \"If you don't mind, I think I'll take him coach.\" The coach grunts a little dissapointed but answers, \"Good, just make sure that since he can't sweat like a man, at least he can be covered by a real man's sweat.\" Gently Matthew folds his hand around you and walks out of the changing room towards his bike. He opens his hand and looks down at you, \"Coach is looking,\" he whispers, \"So I'm afraid I have to take you with me.\" You nod, \"That's okay, thanks for the save.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew scratches his head, \"Don't thank me just yet, cause I have no idea were to put you.\" You shrug. \"Just put me on the saddle like the others. You're by far the best person to be under anyway\" Matthew shakes his head, \"We're riding city today, wwith a lot of climbs, so I have to get out of the saddle a lot, I might lose you amongst the streets, not the smartest thing I guess.\" You nod, \"So what's the plan?\" Matthew looks a bit uncomfortable. \"I don't have any pockets, but I could put you in my sock?\" You shake your head, \"I think I'd get sick real fast from the rapid motions.\" Matthew nods once, \"Yeah I can imagine. Maybe under my shirt?\" You shake again, \"if you get sweaty I'm afraid I might slide out from under there too.\" Matthew nods again, \"So that doesn't leave a lot of options.\" You shrug again, \"I guess not, if you don't mind shoving me down your pants.\" Did you just see a hint of a lusty grin on Matthews face, before he looks a bit bashfull again. \"Well, knowing you're not trying to torment me and it probably saves you som torment I guess I can deal with it for once.\" he hesitates for a second, I'm not ready to have you down the front, so it's the back for today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? not ready for the front? The back today? This is not very convincing, but you lose your train of thought as he continues. So I can slip you just under the waist, but I think you might be more comforatble a little deeper on the rear-end of the padding.\" Comfortable for who you wonder, but you realise you fear being left with the coach more than being down Matthew's shorts. \"If you think so?\" you answer with a small voice, \"Then I guess the padding is the way to go.\" This time you really see the grin. \"Don't worry, I'll take care of you and keep the bullies away.\"With that he brings his hand around to the back and you see his muscled lower back come dangerously close. And suddenly you make contact as he softly presses you against his flesh. Next you feel yourself being scraped accross his skin and the musky scent of his ass fills your nostrils as he slides you down over his cheek. The light being filtered by the lycra seems almost green as he moves you a little to the right and you slip into his crack slightly before he quickly removes his hand and you drop a little onto the soft padding right behind his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a quick view of the bulbous but as you see his hand retract and suddenly the shorts snap shut and you are launched face first into the already slightly damp flesh. You feel his fingers through the fabric against your back as he adjusts you and his shorts. Your arms and legs are locked in place. You feel really uncomfortable as Matthew starts stretching, every movement of his legs and ass is compensated by his tight shorts, they fit like a second skin, which means that you start to feel like you're under his skin, nothing more than a tiny pimple on his ass. And you realise the worst is yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause now he gets on his bike and starts to move his legs as he begins his ride.

Your mouth soon fills up with his ass-sweat which makes you wanna hurl, but you also notice he is still speeding up. Every movement is grinding you deeper into his padding and against his rockhard flesh. Suddenly you feel him getting out of the saddle and standing up, the shock gives just enough room for you to slide down a little deeper, before he sits down, bringing you dangerously close to being between him and the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Matthew speeds up and you feel him breathing and notice your own breaths start to match his, like the two of you ar syncing up. Again he gets out of the saddle and you fall a little deeper before he sits again. You realise that Matthew is going much stronger than last time when you were under him. You know have to gulp up sweat every few breaths just to be able to get enough air and the taste is as bad as you imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Matthew starts a climb and this time you slip down right under his taint. You scream as load as you can, but realise Matthew will never hear you and suddenly he comes down, smashin your body between his flesh and the unforgiving saddle, you close your eyes as you realise this is it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing happens? You pry open your eyes and still look up into the bottom of his crack blinking against the salty sweat you lift your head a little to look down and all you can see is your body dissappearing under Maathew's flesh, you can't move any part of your body and you feel more than you see it, that it has been completely steamrolled flat. But you're still alive, even if you can barely breath, you heartbeat still matches Matthew's and the man is still going strong without slowing down even a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever he finally slows down a little and you hear him yell a quick \"Hello.\" being answered by Seth and Isaac, before he speeds up again, leaving them to eat his dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a little bit later he slows down again and stops. \"Matthew?\" coach's voice, \"This must be a record. Good job.\" Matthew gets of his bike and stretches. \"Thanks coach.\" A few minutes later you hear Isaac and Seth roll up. \"You two are pathetic.\" Coach screams, \"You actually got passed by Matthew, that's it. get back on tose bikes and do another run, and be quicker about it.\"You hear the two groan but no one says no to coach. \"Matthew, you can hit the showers or take another run and shows these guys how it's done</span></div></div>",

You hear him open and close one of the stalls, and suddenly he bends over and you see the light as he rolls his shorts down. To your horror you realise as he rolls the fabric down his legs you're not coming down with them. You are still stuck to Matthew's flesh. \"Where have you gone?\" you hear Matthew ask and you scream as loud as you can\"Here.\" Suddenly Matthews fingers scrape against your back and he actually seems to have a little trouble getting a hold on you, but suddenly with an audible sucking sound you peel of and land in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lifts you up tho his face you look down at your body and see it's been completely flattened. Matthew sees it to and gasps. \"Oh god, I'm sorry.\" He begins, but as he speaks slowly your body reforms in his hand. Matthew and you let out a sigh of relieve at the same time, notice this and start laughing at the same time too. \"I didn't know you could do that.\" Matthew says. you grin slightly, \"Me neither, but I'm glad I could.\" Matthew grins back, \"Figures though, if you tinies didn't have any defence at all you'd probably be extinct.\" you nod and think on how to change the subject, \"You were on a roll today, though.\" Matthew grins, \"You noticed, I figured you did.\" You blink and look questioningly, he answers, \"dude, that was all you, I could feel your energy pulsing through me.\" You blink again, \"Really?\" Matthew nods, \"yeah really, it was like... \" You finish the sentence, \"Like we were syncing up.\" Matthew nods, \"Exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation comes to a running halt at that point. Matthew seems afraid to continue, so you take a deep breath and are suprised to hea yourself say, \"We should test this again to make sure.\" For the first time since you met him you see Matthew's face break open into the warmest smile you've ever seen. \"I would've never dared to ask, but if you're offering?\" You just can't say no now, \"Consider it offered, it was still way better than being under Seth's farty ass.\" Matthew grins and shakes his head, \"Now that's a lie, I just know it. Because I don't think I've ever sweated that much and you can't have liked that.\" You shrug and add a little white lie. \"It wasn't that bad, really.\" Matthew winks, \"Oh really, so if I shoved you in my sweaty pit right now you wouldn't gag. He lifts his other arm and you see the hairs glistening with sweat as he moves you a little closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about calling his bluff, and realise that you could probably raise the stakes to make him back off.</span></div></div>",

He closes his hand and steps into the shower and turns it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you realise what's happening you are smashed face first into the sweaty pit and Matthew starts scraping you around, his sweat covering every inch of you, filling your mouth, your nose, stinging your eyes and he justs keeps scrubbing you over and over again. When he finally pulls you back he switches you to his other hand and without a second glance shoves you into his other pit. again he scrubs you around full vigour. Finally he lifts you to his face as you fall back on his hand gasping for fresh air. \"Had enough?\" he says with a grin. You take a deep breath, \"You clean yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins even wider, \"Fine, with me.\" With that he suddenlyy lowers you to his feet and starts scrubbing the left first, the top, between the toes and last the rough sole. Without pause he moves on the the right one, and goes through the same routine. After that he lifts you again. \"Still not satisfied? It's gonna get worse from here.\" You give him a smirk. \"Just keep going, I've had worse.\" Matthew only grins as he lowers you and moves you around back, rubbing you over his bulbous cheeks and suddenly driving you down the top of his crack, slowly scrubbing you deeper and deeper down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel his skin on your face, and suddenly the texture changes as the smell intensifies. one of his fingers lays on the back of your head and now pushes your face deep into the folds of what you realise can only be his asshole. slowly his finger circles your face around, making sure every nook, fold and cranny is scraped clean. the worst part you realise, is that the taste isn't actually that bad, but rather a little sweet. After what seems forever he plucks you from his ass and lift you back up holding you upside down, your legs between his thumb and index finger. You look at his face as he has a slightly extatic look. \"If you look down, you see what you caused.\" You tilt your head up to look down and see matthew's cock standing at full salute, even from this distance you realise it's bigger than you are. \"Think you're brave enough to go all the way?\" You hesitate only a second, \"I'm probably gonna meet him sooner or later, so if you're brave enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely uttered the words or Matthew starts to lower you again, but he first moves you passed his engorged member and uses you to scrap his sweaty sack clean. Finally he lays you flat on his hand and pushes you up against his dick. he closes his fist around you and himself and slowly starts to move you up and down the shaft. gradually he squeezes even tighter and his speed increases until after a while you hear him gasps and he slides you up all the way till you are facing the slit right as he explodes his warm cum all over your face. You get a few mouths full of the salty goo which you can barely swallow in time to take a breath before the next wave rolls over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more waves he finally stops cumming. he uses you to clean himself under the running water as his dick becomes flacid again. Finally he turns of the water and steps out of the shower part. \"That was great for me, so was it better or worse than you imagined?\" You answer honestly, \"Worse, but still better than Seth's ass.\" Matthew laughs as he towels you dry and places you on the bench before drying of himself. As he rinses out his cycling clothes you look to your left and notice matthew's regular clothes lying there. you get up and walk over to them. As Matthew turns back he sees you walking to his clothes and waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even realise your speaking out loud, \"I wonder if I could use some training on being under you for the rest of the day?\"</span></div></div>",

You realise these are the stretchy kind that will probably pull really tight around matthews ass. \"I think if I don't do it right now, I might be too scared to do it again later.\" You slowly climb onto the fabric. \" and turn to Matthew. \"Will you please wear me today?\" Matthew slowly picks up the briefs with you in them and places then on the floor. As he steps into them, he looks down and asks \"Which side do you prefer?\" You wal over towards the back and lay down. You grab onto the fabric as Matthew bends over and slowly lifts the briefs up past his legs. He has to squeeze a little to get the fabric over his large thighs and you feel yourself shaking. \"I warn you,\" He says, \"It's gonna be a tight fit.\" You answer, \"At least I won't fall out.\" With that he suddenly jerks the briefs up and you are smashed into his crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise he's pulling a little harder than necessary to give him a slight wedgy, adding to that he traces your body from the outside and pushes you a little deeper as he bends over. As he straightens he suddenly squeezes his ass really tight and you feel your body   getting a little flattened.  You  hear Matthew giggle  a little, \"Feels a bit like I've got a glob of silly putty between my cheeks. But than again it feels really good too. I just hope I can get you lose after the rest of my day. He squeezes again and you feel your body mashing against his left cheek more than his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bends over to pick up his other clothes, you feel yourself unsticking, there's not enough moist to remain stuck yet and you slowly tumble forward. Sliding facefirst even deeper into the crack due to your already flattened body. You feel him lifting his left leg and his right next. Suddenly you're face touches the deepest part of the crack and as Matthew jumps a little to pull up his pants you slide down and in the last filtered light you see yourself kissing his pucker as it goes dark when Matthew straightens and closes down his pants, which you guess are far too tight as his cheeks squeeze together without his muscles doing any work. Practically locking you in place as your body smears out in his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou're predicament only becomes more clear as Matthew turns and sits down to put on his shoes. His full weight presses his hole so close up against your face you can barely breath. Only now you realise this means you will be probably kissing his ass for several hours, of which a large part will be spent sitting down. You slowly stick out your tongue to touch his flesh and the familiair slightly sweet taste almost feels welcoming. You also realise Matthew probably has no idea that your face is at this exact position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is made clear as he suddenly gets up and starts walking briskly scraping his hole all over your face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get what you bargained for, Matthew promised you a proper training by spending the rest of his day in his pants and he's true to his word. He goes about his classes, his travels and his hanging out with friends. occasionally you take a lick of his semi-sweet ass-sweat and feel it really feels nourishing. You realises it's actually not that bad, nice and comfy and warm and well, his smell isn't that off-putting. Also as he moves it almost starts to feel like a soft massage. Finally after a long dinner in which you've almost felt like you were pushed in his hole by the end, he ends up in his dormroom and you hear him unbuckling his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lowers his pants a little light comes in and a little while later the light intensifies as he lowers his briefs. Finally you feel his fingers softly plucking at your lower body and suddenly he pulls you free. As he lowers himself on the bed he lets you slowly reform in his hand as he lays on his stomach and places you on his pillow. You see one of the largest grins ever. After he has given you a few minutes to catch your breath he says, \"that was the best... at least from my perspective.\" You grin back, \"It wasn't the worst for me either.\" Matthew shakes his head, \"You've got to be lying. I mean it took me a few hours beofre realising you were actually face first against my hole.\" You're mouth drops, \"You knew?\" He grins weakly, \"Only after a few hours and I figured if you really hated it, you would've let me know, but instead I felt you licking it, so I figured you were okay.\" You feel yourself blushing. \"you felt that.\" Matthew grins, \"Well yeah, how was it?\" You grin weakly, \"Better than I expected, a bit sweet and better than your sweaty pits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew laughs, \"Well, if you ever want to lick it again, don't let me stop you.\" You grin, \"Thanks, I'll remember that for next time.\" Matthew laughs harder, \"Oh, so there's gonna be a next time?\" Suddenly you realise you actually had fun and felt safe for the first time in a long while. \"Only if you let me.\" You answer. Matthew answers with a grin, \"Oh little one, you could live in my ass anyday if the week, that mushy feeling was a real treat.\" You grin back. \"Guess I'd have to drop out of school and give the headmaster his wish if I wanted to do that. But maybe we should restrict it to weekends and  other free time.\" Matthew grins even wider, \"Well, it's fridaynight now, so we have till mondaymorning if you're willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give it a little thought, \"Igt would be good practice right?\" Matthew nods, \"I think we both could use it.\" You nod back, \"But if it's practice we need to be serious about it.\" Matthew blinks, \"What do you propose?\" You grin widely, \"Well, since the main goal is for me to be able to survive being in your shorts as you ride we need to figure out the most comfortable place for me to be, so you have to switch it up.\" Matthew grins, \"How about I'll let you sleep under my dick tonight to find out if you fit there, though be warned, I sleep on my stomach a lot.\" You nod, \"That would be a good start.\" Matthew blinks, \"There 's more?\" You nod. \"I also need to get used to your different smells and tastes.\" Matthew nods again, \"which means?\" you grin, I expect at least two more showers like today over the course of the weekend.\" matthew laughs again, \"I can live with that. Do I need to be as sweaty?\" You nod, \"Or sweatier!\" Matthew grins, \"Good thing I've got my spinning bike set-up.\" You grin back, \"Good, then you can also try me out with padding. while riding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew grins, \"Any more rules?\" You think for a second, \"Do you have any request?\" Matthew nods, \"I want you to lick my hole every morning before I get up, really thoroughly.\" you nod, \"I can live with that.\" Matthew nods again. \"Next I want you just as deep in my ass as today whenever I leave this room.\" You grin, \"I expected no less.\" matthew grins back. \"I want you to be honest when it's getting to be too much, so I can stop in time, before you don't ever want to come back again.\" You blink, \"I can do that.\" Matthew thinks. \"And finally we pick out my clothes together.\" You give him a slight smile. \"Fine, so how about you pick out your favourite sleeping briefs and get me ready for bed with little Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughs and reaches over to the left and pulls up a pair of briefs he's probably owned for a long time as the yellow has faded over time. He sits up and shoves of his pants and briefs and pulls up the new pair. even though they are clearly bigger than the old pair, they still seem pretty tight. Matthew takes of his shirt and reaches for you as he picks you up he rolls himself down and lays on his back, placing you just below his bellybutton looking at the waist of his shorts. Slowly he hooks his thumbs under and pulls them up, making a gateway for you and you see his monstrous cock looming lazily in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back towards Matthew's face and say, \"Night\" And you slowly walk into the briefs. after a few steps you reach the base of his cock and walk towards the right side, slowly you climb onto the folds of his sack and you realise Matthew is tll watching you as you lay down on his flesh, with your back against his member. Suddenly the fabric comes crushing down as Matthew releases the waistband with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the warmth of his hand as he slowly traces himself and you from the outside. Next in a fluent motion he pushes you down into his sack and slides his cock almost completely over you. And to add to that the world shakes as he flips himself over to lay on his stomach. Locking you into your prison of cock and sack, which smell pretty musky from a long day. A muffled giggle and \"Night-night\" is all you hear before suddenly everything gets really quiet, except for the thumping of Matthews heartbeat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't imagine how, but somehow you must have fallen asleep because you wake up in the morning as Matthew;s large hand is plucking you from your musky prison before raising you towards his face. \"Goodmorning.\" He yawns as he stretches his free arm and slowly rolls over. \"I hope you have a strong stomach this morning.\" for a second you don't know what he means, But you remember soon enough as he lowers you around his back and slowly hovers you over his ass which seems slick from his sweat. He suddenly drops you and you fall on his crack and his hand comes down on you from above. finding your head and pushing it past the globes right into the heart of his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell is both horrifying and intoxicating as the finger taps against the ack of your head expectantly. So without thinking too much you bend forward and stick out your tongue and take the biggest lick you can muster. A lot of things happen at once, Matthew's taste explodes in your mouth and you don't gag, but want more. his holw twitches invitingly, almost like kissing you, while his finger pushes down a little harder and his cheeks clench. And from far up above you hear a loud moan escape Matthew's lips. Before you realise, you take another long, deep lick, and another. Suddenly Matthew's hand pulls back, but his ass starts to move around, his cheeks clenching you tight against his flesh, almost enoughto smash you, but just not there yet. His pucker is vibrating aginast your face with every lick as you slowly make your way around the edges and the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while his taste seems to diminish as you probably licked up most of the sweat and next you feel yourself being pulled out. You are lifted towards the pillow and dropped next t Matthew's face. A very blissfull smile on his face. \"Now that's one perfect way to wake up, can't wait till tomorrow.\" You slowly and teasingly lick your lips. \"I don't think I wanna wait till then, and you promised I could lick it whenever I wanted, so you be sure to built up a good taste again.\" Matthew grins, \"You like my taste that much.\" You can only nod and Matthew laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls away and sits up. \"I guess I could use a shower, but do you think I'm sweaty enough?\" You shake your head, \"It won't count towards one of the two showers you owe me, so you have to decide if it's worth it to take an extra shower this weekend.\" Without blinking Matthew grabs you and gets up. \"I guess I'm gonna have to deal with a lot of showering this weekend to keep you satisfied.\" He gets up and walks into his small en-suite bathroom already butt-naked and steps into the shower. Turning on the water he lets it wahs over him before he slowly starts to rub you over his hard pecs, slow circles increasing in size and next he slides you onto his pits to scrub. After that down the rocky road of his six-pack abs, past the pole and under the sack, scraping through his loins and along the semi-hard cock. Suddenly he squeezes you against it and you feel him relieving himself with a soft sigh. Finally he reaches around back, but before scrubbing he stops and turns of the water. \"I don't think you want me to clean that to thoroughly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps out of the shower and towels the both of you drie before putting on a bathrobe and moving towards the small livingroom with kitchen. He puts you on the table and gets a selection of fruit and breakfast cereals, placing a few pieces on a plate for you while eating a large quantity himself. You feel quite stuffed with Matthew's sweat, but do eat a little. After a while Matthewe looks at you and grins, \"You should tell coach that you're gonna quit the team if he lets me put you down my shorts again.\" you look up and Matthew grins, \"Tell him you rather e under Seth's ass or with coach's thighs, anything but down my pants.\" Suddenly you catch on. \"Then coach will order you to put me down there every day, till I quit.\" Matthew nods, \"And I'm gonna tell coach that I wanna try my best to get you to quit, so he'll tell me all I have to do is shove you down my pants as much as I can. And if the others see you cry that loud, they will figure there's nothing they could do to you that is worse.\" You grin, \"Never knew, you had it in you.\" Matthew tips his head, \"With the right incentive.\" You both finish your breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmatthew gets up and cleans up, \"So any special wishes for today? I'm gonna take a ride later on of course, but I need to get some groceries first, which means going out.\" He turns around and picks you up to carry you into the bedroom. He picks up his clothes from yesterday, \"Want me to wear something fresh.\" You shrug, \"It's fine with me if it smells a bit more like you.\" Matthew grins. \"Very good.\" He picks you up and lowers you down on the slightly dirty briefs. \"Wait.\" You say matthew raises his eyebrow. \"Can we try something a little different?\" He shrugs \"Sure.\" You take a deep breath, \"can you slowly try to squeeze my lower body into a ball, but not my head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Matthew's second hand takes hold of your neck and head and his first hand closes from beneath around you shoulders as he squeezes you legs and hips upward into each other. when he opens his hand a little you notice you kind of resemble a snowman now, a round body and a head. Matthe grins and says it. \"I made a snowman.\" You grin up at him. \"Now can you put the snowmans head against your hole, if possible a little deeper than yesterday, and then squeeze your ass really tight around his lower body to lock me in place? Matthew's face breaks open in a misschievous grin. \"How much deeper?\" You grin back, just up to the point of sliding in?\" Matthew nods and lowers you around back, \"You're gonna regret this later on.\" But his voice tells you he's one happy customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bends over to open his ass and uses his free hand to widen his crack as he shoves you in face first. Right up against his unwashed, but cleanly licked hole. A little deeper, you can really feel the pressure of his sphincter against your face. And just a little deeper. then he suddenly stands straight and squeezes his cheeks as hard as he can, thrusting his hips forward, which really scrapes your face against and into his hole. The muscles of his hole ripple against you face almost invitingly, but not to greedy, and you feel safe from being plled in as your whole body is now spread between Matthew's mighty cheeks. You plant a really deep and loving kiss against is hole and this makes Matthew groan deeply. Suddenly you feel him sitting and next laying down and you feel like he's starting to jerk himself off, which gives you the clear to kiss, lick and scrape around. Every movement answered by one of Matthew's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he squeezes his ass so tight your face actually pops in a little between the tight muscle for a second and you feel his whole body shock as he loses his load. You hear him sigh deeply and he says, \"That was the best orgasm I ever had. Too bad you can't see it, but it's too much hassle right now to get you out.\" You pull back your head from the hole and give it a big kiss.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes Matthew gets up and by his moving around and the fact it get's a lot darker you figure he's getting dressed. Every movement feels like it's glueing you tighter to this mans amazing ass. After a while Matthew start walking at a regular pase and you hear a door close. He walk for a while and suddenly you hear a lot of rustling and Matthew's movement become a little more random. he's probably shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later you hear a steady beeping noise with intervals, check-out time. Finally Matthew has checked out and starts walking again. But sddenly you hear a familiair voice. \"Matt.\" it's the coach you realise. \"Morning coach.\" Matthew answers. \"Matt, I need to discuss something with you, wanna get a cup of coffee?\" Matt walks with the coach and after a while sits down.<br>\r\nYou hear the two man ordering coffee and after that it's the coach who goes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Matt,\" the coach starts of, \"There's two things I wanna discuss.\" a slight pause, \"First thing, I don't care about your... preferences. you're hardly the first cyclist as you might have guessed. And I told Isaac and Seth that if they tell anyone or use it against you I'm gonna make them ride their assess till they are so soar they wished they just had let someone butt-fuck them. Okay?\" Matthew snickers a little, \"Clear coach, and well thanks.\" Coach answers, \"No problem, now for the next not-so-tiny problem. As you might have guessed I want him gone, but most of the things Seth, Isaac or me tried had no effect. he's always hanging around and actually trying to be usefull.\" Coach stops for a second, \"and to be honest, sometimes he is, but I can't stand the fact that I've finally got a proper team and I get stuck with a tiny. It's just the headmaster's doing. So far the first time he ever ran from a training wihout signing out was yesterday.\" You feel Matthew shift in his seat, \"I didn't do anything, I don't even like him.\" Coach laughs, \"I know, we tried a lot, but yesterday was the first time you got involved and I saw what you did, where you put him. And I can only imagine that when you let him out he ran off crying.\" Matthew scrapes his throat, \"So what if he did?\" Coach laughs again, \"It would be great, because that would actually be the first time we broke him. I mean if even Seth's farts didn't make him cry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remain quiet, finally Matthew says, \"So you're asking me to stuff him down my pants till he quits?\" Coach clucks his tongue, \"I think that's what it's gonna take, and well, apparantly your the least shy of us about it.\" You feel Matthew lean back. \"Sure coach no problem. My ass can always use a little extra padding.\" Coach laughs again, \"That's good, extra padding, I think I'll tell him monday he's been demoted from equipment manager to equipment.\" Matthew laughs too, \"So how long will he last?\" Coach answers, \"Hard to say the kids got some stamina, So it might be a few weeks.\" Matthew laughs, \"If he survives that long, I think he'll quit before my first ride monday, when he hears it.\" Coach laughs, \"We won't give him time to quit at least not before next weekend, the big race, he's already on the list as a replacement. My intention is to have you ride him during the big one so he will run home to mommy covered in grime and sweat.\" Matthew chuckles, \"He's on the list as a replacement, but will be nothing more than a replacement part. But how do we get him to stay for a week of torture, shouldn't we start later on?\" Coach answers softly, \"I know the kid and he won't quit easy, and if worse comes to worse I'm gonna tellt he headmaster I need his help prepping, so he might miss a few classes and I'll personally glue him into your shorts till after the race. If he even comes off after that.\" Matthew laughs, \"And if not I'll just ride him till he does, it's not like he's in the way or anything.\" Coach laughs, \"That's the spirit. I hope you'll feel that way after a few days with him.\" Matthew scoffs, \"He should feel lucky to actually be part of a race, one way or another.\" After that the conversation goes back to nothing really, some famous cyclists etc. untill they finish their coffee and Matthew excuses himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he hurries home there's a little jaunt in his step. As soon as he's home he drops his pants and plucks you out. Before you can even reform he says, \"Did you hear.\" You nod, \"Guess all this practice really is good for something.\" Matthew grins, \"The moment he threatened to glue you to my shorts was almost too much.\" Matthew al but dances around and you grin up at him. \"You were great, hopefully I can match your acting on monday. When I get told I'm just gonne be equipment.\" Matthew turns to you and grins, \"You're a lot more than 'just' equipment to me, don't worry.\" He starts to put away the groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this means next weekend I'll be in your cycling short for a very long and hot day?\" You can't hide the fact you're intrigued. Matthew glances back at you. \"I guess, but there's no breaks for us then. You'll be in my ass from daybreak till my evening shower.\" You grin, \"guess that's one shower I'm not looking forward too.\" Matthew finishes putting the stuff away and waks over to his bedroom and comes back with a pair of cycling shorts. He lays them flat revealing the pad. \"What I'm just trying to figure out is what the best place for you would be. Because I know you would probably be fine in my ass, but I don't think it would be bearable for me during an entire race. You walk over to the shorts and climb up on them. \"Well between the pad and your body is a given, that way no one will suspect me of being there.\" Matthew grins, \"That's probably best\" You grin back \"I don't think too much to the front would be wise, I might accidently arouse you.\" Matthew nods. \"So I guess that kinda leave the place you spent yesterday, straight down the middle.\" you shrug, \"gulping down ass-sweat like there's no tomorrow.\" matthew grins again, \"You can have a taste of ballsweat instead if you prefer.\" you nod, \"well, no time like the present to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout blinking you Lay down towards the front end of the pad, feling for some grip and estimating where the incline would be. In the mean while you notice Matthew stripping down. When he's ready he picks up the shorts and steps in them raising them quickly over his thighs till you can almost touch his balls. You notice you have to slide a little more to the front till you can look up at Matthew's face. You nod and in one fluent motion he pulls you up right into his balls. If it wasn't for the massive weight and the flesh pushing up against you, you would think you were in a hammock. As Matthew starts moving another problem becomes known, even though he is held down tight, his balls slowly roll up and over you with ever step, slightly grinding down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew lifts one leg and then the other and next you hear the clickity clack of cycling shoes. Suddenly Matthew swings one leg up and you feel him getting ready to sit down. Suddenly somethin hard pushes up from behind and you realise that you made a small miscalculation in the incline, because as Matthew is sitting down he leans a little forward, making you actually the lowest point. You try to move to make this known, but it's too late Matthew starts his ride.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're firstsign of impending doom is the music, technological crap with a strong beat. And next Matthew's legs come in motion, every legmovement slowly twist you side to side in this position, whie those massive balls steamroll over you, almost instantly flattening your body against the pad. The location of your head is saved from being flattened bt even smaller than when you were in the back and the musky scent is already growing strong soon it gets moist and you get your first mouthfull of ballsweat. But as soon as you tasste it you get the familiair feeling of syncing up. Matthew also reacts, by doubling his speed to remain in the beat, but to get rid of this extra energy. Suddenly he gets up in a climbing position which gives you a litte more air, but almost as soon he sits down again which smashes his flesh against your face. You feel like you can hardly breath, but also notice that your body doesn't beg for oxygen, it just seems to gains energy back from Matthew and all you need is an occasional moutfull of sweat. It takes a while for you to give in, but fincally you get into a rhytm and time seems to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like forever Matthew finally slows down and gets off, but you realise he's not even panting too hard as he lowers his pants just enough to pluck you out and allow you to reform. \"I'm not even tired yet,\" He says, \"so I wanna keep going, but I think it would be good to try the other way so we can compare and contrast.\" fully reformed you nod and he lowers you down the back. You quickly place youself on the pad, body up till your chest under his taint and the rest gazin up into his crack. After a few more seconnd Matthew must think you're ready and he pulls you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets on his bike again and slowly grinds down a little to make your body flatten against him before he starts up again. Your first mouthfull makes you giggle, you imagine there's very few people in this world that can tell the distinct differences between ass and ball-sweat as clearly as you can. where his ball-sweat was salty and felt a bit more viscous, his ass sweat flows freely and has that hint of something sweet. This time you immediatly fall into the state of sync as you now think of it. Matching heartrates, matching breaths. And everything really just flows. You feel like you were almost made to be the padding to this gourgeous man, and you realise he will probably feel the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes you think of those old stories about wizards and their familiairs, granting each other strength and abilities beyond compare. Matthew's sweat keeps you from dying while your energy surges through him to bring him to greater heights. It's a really pleasant thought and you think about all the different places of his body that he could carry you around on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the music stops and Matthew slows down and does his cooling off before getting up and stretching a bit before he rolls down his shorts. Once again you remain stuck to him and you almost wish he wouldn't pull you off right away. For some reason he doens't. But he moves around slowly and you hear him pour a glass of water and drinking it. Next he wals into the bathroom and as he turns on the shower he finally peels you off. Without allowing you time to proper reform he steps under the stream of water and starts to wash his entire body, starting again with the sweatiest pits you've ever seen, smelt or tasted. Down his chest and stomach under his balls over the shaft, down his legs and over his feet, back up his legs and towards his ass, this time he takes his time to scrub his crack and for the first time he farts right in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the best smell, but so much more pleasant than that of Seth. Even so he pulls you out a bit shocked and raises you to his face. \"Sorry ab out that.\" You slowly reform and grin, \"It was bound to happen one of these days.\" Matthew grins, \"Well, that's true. Hope it wasn't that bad.\" You shrug, \"I've smelt worse, just now for example, those pits of yours....\" Matthew bursts out in laughter, \"So this counts as a shower. \"You nod, I'd say it almost counts as two.\" Matthew grins, \"I disagree, you still owe me a second one.\" You grin back, \"If you insist.\" Matthew turns of the shower and start towelling you dry before putting you to the side and drying of himself. \"So what's the verdict, front or back?\" You tilt your head, \"both are fine really, but I think in the back was more comfortable for you.\" Matthew nods, \"Just a little yeah. But we can switch it up a little every now and then. Because It did feel nice to feel you under my balls. After putting on his pair of worn briefs he lifts you up and takes you to the dining table and fixes some lunch,  a sliver of egg, a crumble of toast and a whole bean for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch is done Matthew leans back and puts his feet on the table...</span></div></div>",

Matthew looks up at the ceiling and suddenly glances over at you. \"How come you picked the cycling team?\" You're a bit taken aback by this sudden question. \"Well, it seemed like an easy solution, team sports aren't my main forte. And well individual sports included horsebackriding, swimming, wrestling and so eventually cycling seemed the least dangerous.\" Matthew nods, \"Oh, okay, so it had nothing to do with men in tight clothes?\" You grin, \"Well not really no, if I went for that and physical contact I would've picked wrestling I suppose.\" Matthew laughs, \"Yeah, then you'd be trampled and sat on for sure. But why would you have minded?\" You shrug \"I don't know, I guess it just feels different with you. Not at all forced...\" Matthew finishes your sentence, \"but almost natural?\" You nod. He continues, \"Yeah, I wonder why that is, 'cause I feel it too, almost like... \" This time you finish his sentence, \"Like we were destined to meet?\" matthew nods, \"Which is strange because I don't really believe in destiny. heh, des-Tiny.\" You laugh at his word play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since we're asking blunt questions,\" you start, \"Have you ever been buttfucked?\" Matthew laughs and shakes his head, \"Nope, not yet, well not by anyone else at least, mostly just sucking and jerking.\" You smile back at him, \"Whyd you wanna know?\" he asks. You shrug, \"Just wondering.\" Matthew grins, \"If you were a little bigger I might've let you have a go.\" He suddenly gets up and walks to his bedroom coming back with a dildo almost as large as his own cock, meaning nearly twice your size. \"This is my man.\" You gasp, \"This has been inside of you?\" Matthew nods, \"I bought it, because I wanted to be sure it was my thing before having someone else back there. For some reason it's glow in the dark too. guess it makes it easier to find. you walk over to it and lean in close cupping your hands and you see it light up a little. \"Weird.\" Is all you can say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you get a weird idea, \"Do you have any clear condoms?\" Matthew looks at you questioningly but walks away and comes back again with a box of condoms. \"Do they fit him?\" you ask and Matthew nods. \"And do you have a ballpoint?\"He picks one from the other end of the table. \"So if I was placed on the dildo, sith the hollow tube of the pen next to me and covered by a clear condom, smeared with lubricant... I could actually see what you look like on the inside.\"Suddenly Matthew bursts out in laughter, \"you could if you wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"I want to. If you'll let me\" Suddenly matthew lunches forward and grabs the pen to pull out the filling he places t against the dildo and next grabs you and places you at the tip next to the pen. His grip is tight as he uses his teeth to rip open the condom package and starts rolling it over you and the dildo. You feel you get enough air thankfully as he almost runs to the bathroom and picks up a tube of lube, slowly smearing the entire thing before dropping his briefs and jumping on the bed. Without much ceremony he lowers you tho his ass and slowly moves the tip wit you on it towards his ass, first he draws a few small circles spreading the lube and slowly he starts pushing. the first few seconds nothing happens, but suddenly his hole opens up inviting you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slowly presses you inwards the dildo ights up with an eery green light and you can see the muscles around you moving around, trying to push you out as well as trying to lay low as you are pushed in and all of a sudden you push through and you realise one thing, Matthew should have emptied his bowels first, because now you see into his colon which are quite full and you are pushed agains a warm gooey substance, which you can almost smell even through the condom. Suddenly you are pulled back a little and pushed in again, slowly and a little deeper, back out, back in, and slowly the pace and depth increase. You feel the dildo is pointed downwards a little and suddenly you are pressed very deep through the goo and bump into something round and hard. A load moan echoes all around you as you are bumped into the wall a few more times all of a sudden the world shifts as you figure Matthew has rolled on his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few bumps later everything around you seems to twitch and shake and then all is silent after a few moments you  feel yourself being pulled out and you see daylight again as Matthew hets up and walks into his bathroom. he rinses the condom in the sink before pulling it off slowly so he won't drop you. \"Guess I had a man inside of me today.\" he grins blissfully. You grin back, yeah, but next time take a dump first.</span></div></div>",

Cynically you say, \u201cThanks for sharing this.\u201d And Matthew just grins and continues. Afterwards he starts wiping himself clean thoroughly before getting up. He walks over to you and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna meet a few friends in a few, we\u2019re gonna catch the schoolgame. He hesitates a second, \u201cShould I wash before we go on?\u201d You really, really, really wanna say yes. \u201cYou think you should?\u201d You see him running his fingers through his crack. \u201cI wiped pretty good, so it\u2019s maybe a little smelly, but that\u2019ll pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll take you dirty than.\u201d Matthew grins as he picks you up. \u201cI could let you ride in the front for a little while before I crack you.\u201d You shake your head.\u201d Nah, I\u2019d rather not risk it in case I squirm too much. Besides our deal was out of the apartment into your ass.\u201d Matthew nods as he slowly squeezes your body in on itself, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d He slowly squeezes you as a stressball as he walks into his bedroom and opens a drawer, plucking out a few items, before moving to the closet, picking out a few pants and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what to wear? It\u2019s gonna be a warm day so I wanna go with these shorts\u201d, he lifts a pair of yellow, shiny shorts. \u201cAnd a nice tanktop\u201d he sows you a dark blue, oversized tanktop. \u201c But that leaves me with the question on what to wear under them.\u201d He spreads out a few items, \u201cbriefs, boxer-briefs, lycra shorts without padding or my personal favourite with this outfit... Compression shorts.\u201d You look down and realise it\u2019s really not much of a decision at all. \u201cCompression all the way baby, I\u2019m not gonna risk falling out.\u201d  Matthew grins. \u201cLike I\u2019d let that happen\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further hesitation he lowers you towards his ass, you do feel like you can still smell the shit on his ass, but tell yourself it\u2019s just your imagination as he almost systematically shoves you face first against his hole before giving you a thorough squeeze. You feel him sitting down as he starts to pull up his compression shorts. Suddenly you feel like his ass is not just flattening you, but rather imploding into you as he starts the final inching over the cheeks. He lays down on his back and lifts and squeezes his ass until it almost seems to pop in. You figure he\u2019ll relaxe a little now, only to find out as he\u2019s getting up, that he already is. It just leaves no room for him to do so and slowly you feel your body being spread even thinner through his crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you thought that was bad you were wrong, because after getting fully dressed, he starts walking, you now know how it must feel if you were a grain and being mashed between two millstone. Every step seems to crush you and flatten you more and more, It\u2019s not as if it hurts you, you realise for the first time, but feeling our body being stretched and squeezed out like this is very disconcerning. The first sweatdrops start to form and they do taste different, a little staler, so there might be some shitresidue, but it really isn\u2019t that bad. And as he sweats more the taste slowly returns to the sweeter side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew doesn\u2019t seem to worry too much as he walks of to who knows where. After a while you hear him greeting some people and they move as a group. After a while he climbs a few steps and sits down. After a while you hear whistling, shouting, cheering and booing. this must be the big game. You\u2019re slightly annoyed at Matthew as he keeps twidling his legs and occasionaly jumps up. But you realise it could\u2019ve been worse. You really enjoy the warmth and the taste of his ass, and the smell you are getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the game ends and the guys leave, so what\u2019s next?</span></div></div>",

After a while they enter a room with loud music and suddenly you feel Matthew sitting down as he is changing his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you thought biking was intense on the ass, you realise you were wrong. Bowling is explosive and with every ball Matthew rolls he squeezes his ass against you. By now you feel like you are so flat you should be pouring out of his ass on all sides. And every time he stops to roll your face remains in motion just a second longer smashing you against his by now sweatsoaked hole. And every time you almost feel like you slide in just a little deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your idea is proven as you head suddenly slips straight through the outer sphincter and doens\u2019t slip back out. Right now your head is literally stuck in his anus. You try to pull back but you have no available muscles to do so. Now every move not only smashes you against him, or squeezes you even flatter. Now your head is actually scraping and brushin the inside of Matthew\u2019s hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the outside of his hole was sweet, moist and liquid, the inside is just a little more bitter and slimy, swallowing every mouthfull is a bit of a challenge. You wonder if Matthew know what\u2019s happening. But you can\u2019t hear anything over the scraping and the rushing of blood. After a while you just relaxed and o with the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in there but suddenly you feel Matthew\u2019s cheeks spread a little and you feel him scraping on your body, softly pulling and all of a sudden you pull free with an awfull sucking sound and suddenly dangle from his hand as he lifts you up. Your whole body is spread so thin you are almost four times as tall and wide as usual. Matthew uses two hand now to keep you spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he says a little to gleefully. \u201cJust wow, I didn\u2019t think you could stretch this much.\u201d You can\u2019t help but grin at his twinkling eyes, \u201cWell you certainly did your best getting me this far.\u201d  He grins back. \u201cAnd yet it can still talk and joke around.\u201d You laugh, \u201cOf course I can.\u201d You notice Matthew is slihtly pulling you out, to keep you from reforming. \u201cYou\u2019re bigger than my padding, right now. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much fun to spread you out over it so thinly. But I just know there is a better use for you like this.\u201d You give him a sly smile. \u201cWell, I guess with the proper underlay I could probably make an excellent Jockstrap.\u201d Matthew smiles, that\u2019s what I was thinking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he reaches in his underwear drawer and pulls out one of those jockstraps. Slowly he lowers your body onto the fabri, your head in the point that will go under his taint. He gently pushes you down against the folds and due to the fact you\u2019re still  a little moist you almost immediately stick to it. After a few moments  he seems satisfied and you look up at nothing more that a regular jockstrap, but realise it\u2019s your skin that makes up the fabric. \u201cI wonder if I still fit this one.\u201d But without a second though he pulls it on and slide your entire body over his enourmous package. As the strap pulls thight you are now trapped with your head right in the musky place where the balls go over into the taint. And you feel your body covering Matthew\u2019s entire front. You also realise Matthew is still pretty sweaty from the bowling. But he doesn\u2019t seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew climbs into bed without a second thought and rolls on his stomach locking the jockstrap, you, under his full weight and in this position the elastic pull your face tight against his skin.</span></div></div>",

But as you lay there a strange sensation flows through your body and you realise you're body is trying to reform as much as it can. slowly your body squeezes in around Matthew's crotch, pulling tight, but not squeezing him too much. Your head also jerks closer to his flesh a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slight squeezing and rippling body has an effect though. You feel his dick twitching and growing a little bigger. Pressing down. This leads to a slight chainreaction though. As hi dick grows, your body stretches, the rippling of your body makes his dick grow. This keeps going for some time untill you realise he's fully erect and still twitching and snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bodies keep adjusting and finally Matthew groans in his sleep and suddenly you feel him cumming in the tiny jockstrap-like pocket that is your body. The jizz oozing all over your body and his groin, the excess finding one of the only ways out, right over your face. Your mouth is filled and the scent isn't too good. All the while Matthew remains fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though his dick is now shrinking again and your body with it, this only means more of the slowly drying jizz is pressed past your face. Finally it seems done. But know you notice you can't move your face anymore as it's plastered agains Matthew's balls with his own sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide there's nothing to do about it and close your eyes before you finally fall asleep. You are awoken by Matthew's Laugh. \"Oh no, this is too good.\" You're actually glued to my dick and balls by my own load?\" You cringe at his joy over your predicament. Slowly he pulls you loose and places you on his stomach. Slowly you feel your body return to it's original shape as the dried cum flakes off. You stand up and brush of the last dried stuff and look up at a grinning Matthew. \"Ready for morning cleaning sir.\" You say with a wink. Without a word Matthew picks you up rolls over and lowers you into his ass, which you start to lick clean as quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After eating a while in silence you notice Matthew looking at you. \"What's up?\" He takes a sip of juice and says, \"I was just wondering how we're gonna handle coach? I mean, of course I can't let him glue you in my shorts. But I don't know how we can convince him you're gonna come back every day for more of my ass, without him getting suspicious.\" You think for a second. \"Probably not, a day or two might work, but five days. That's stretching the gullibleness of even coach.\" Matthew nods. You look at him. \"So any bright ideas?\" Matthew thinks for a while before answering. \"How about I convince coach to talk to the headmaster to excuse you from class and tell coach I'm gonna keep you down my pants for the entire week.\" You shake your head. \"I think coach would be too scared I escaped.\" Matthew nods. Suddenly he snaps his fingers and gets up. He comes back with a pair of shorts, turning them inside out he shows the padding which is torn down the middle. \"These are my old racing shorts which are kinda worn out a you can see. What if I suffed you in there in front of coach and sewed you in. That would convince him I'm not even considering of letting you go or give you any chance of escape.\" You let out a soft laugh. \"That would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew nods, \"Shall I call coach to ask if he thinks it's a good idea?\" You grin, \"You have coach's number?\" Matthew nods. And picks up his phone. Putting it on speaker you hear the phone ring once... twice...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Walter (coach picks up).<br>\r\n--Coach it's me Matthew.<br>\r\n-What's up Matt?<br>\r\n--Coach I've been thinking about your proposal.<br>\r\n-You're not backing out are you?<br>\r\n--Nope, not at all, but I'm afraid the little guy will quit to early.<br>\r\n-Yeah, I thought about it too and figure the same. He might run off and we'd be a man short. So I guess we should kinda kidnap him anyway, but I don't know about keeping him in school. But taking him home would be tricky too.<br>\r\n--Agreed, so I got a proposal.<br>\r\n-I'm all ears.<br>\r\n-- remember my old racing gear, the one with the torn padding?<br>\r\n-Yeah, your lucky shorts.<br>\r\n--Yeah those, how about we just sew him there for a week. It'll keep him safe and out of the way.<br>\r\n-... (suddenly coach laughs)... That's horrible. I'd almost feel sorry for the kid.<br>\r\n--Almost?<br>\r\n-Yeah, almost. Cause I think it's a great idea.<br>\r\n--If he doesn't quit after a week like that, I don't know what it takes.<br>\r\n-If he doesn't quit voluntarily, I have no problem with leaving him in there and telling the headmaster we lost him at the game.<br>\r\n--Thank you very much, I can't have him stuck in my pants for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n-... (coach laughs again)... Why not, it's not like you will notice him anyway, as just a part of your padding, and I'll tell you what, I'll bring a repairkit, so we can cover him up with the expensive rubbery stuff and really lock him in there for a week. And it'll fix up your lucky shorts too. If by the end of the week you don't feel him anymore we can just leave it at that. See how long he survives on ass sweat and shitstains.<br>\r\n--... (Matthew laughs too)... And if he doesn't, who cares. I just hope I don't kill him before the week is up.<br>\r\n-I like you Matt. Let's take care of it first thing in the morning. Don't forget the shorts.<br>\r\n--Kay... see you tomorrow coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Matthew hangs up. \"Guess that settles it.\" he says, \"You're gonna be part of my padding for a while.\" You chuckle. \"Right, just make sure coach doesn't stuff me in to deep, but with my body on the surface, that way I can spread out nicely under you and  with a little help even clean your hole.\" Matthew grins. \"And be a nice showercloth after I rinse you out\" You grin. \"Multipurpose man.\" </span></div></div>",

There's a spring in his step and he doesn't even take the proper time to enjoy the last day of your freedom. But you can hardly blame him. He also goes to bed early saying \"Then morning comes sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he gets dressed quickly, packs his bags and runs off with you in his pocket. You figured he should let you out near school and you would go in about 15 minutes before him. Part of your job as equipment manager is comin in early to check everything is ready for the afternoon trainings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the school he drops you off and you walk into the tiny entrance and run over to the cycling team equipment room. As you enter you see coach sitting at his desk and you ring the bell next to your entrance to notify him of your arrival. He looks back grinning, \"Go ahead and do your work, shrimp. I'll let you know if I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go about checking the bikes for flat tires and stuff suddenly the door opens and Matthew comes in and walks over to the coach. They talk softly and after a while coach gets up. \"Come here shrimp, we need your help.\" You walk over and coach grabsyou and places you on the work bench. \"Today we're gonna repair Matthew's lucky short.\" Matthew pulls the shorts from his bag and coach takes them and turns them inside out. stretching them out over a block. \"You see this. There's a large tear in the padding right under his ass.\" you nod. Coach picks you up and places you on the shorts. He turns and grabs a mixing bottle and thee small vials. \"We're gonna mix two components to fil the tear, and add a drop of colouring to match the colour of the pad, which is basic black. Then we fill it up under stretch and let it harden out under UV-Light. I'm gonna fill the gash and need you to check for air bubbles and if it fills up everything as it should. Before we harden it and it will attain the firm, but flexible qualities of rubber. It'll keep in place and won't tear easily without the proper dissolvent.\"You nod again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach adds a bit of both vials to the mixing bottle and shakes vigourously. Next he carefully and slowly squeezes the viscous fluid into the tear. the colour matches it's surroundings, when it's filled up to the level of the stretched material the coach stops. \"So shrimp how does it look.\" You take a good look and walk aound. \"Evenly levelled and I don't see any bubbles.\" You hear coach take a deep breath as you stand up and turn around. you see coach's finger right in front of you as he quickly tips you over so you land right on top of the mixture and sink in just a little but most of your body is still floating on top of the stuff. bt you feel it's more sticky than gum and you can't pull loose by yourself. \"Hey, help, I'm stuck.\" You yell. But you see coach picking up the UV-light and turning it on. You squeeze your eyes shut as he moves it on top of you and you feel a bit of warmth coming from it and the gooey mixture slowly hardenind out a little. \"Stop, I'm stuck. Get me out.\" You scream at the top of your lungs again and again till the light is pulled away and you open your eyes. Looking up at Coaches grinning face. \"What's  going on?\" Coach chuckles. \"Nothing much, we repaired Matthew's pants together.\" You blink, \"But I'm stuck.\" Coach nods. \"Yes you are, mainly because I decided to demote you... from equipment manager, to equipment.\" You give him your most shocked look. \"What do you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach steps back and Matthew steps forward. \"He means that you're gonna be part of my pants for a while. You're stuck in my padding for as long as I want. And seeing as I probably won't notice you there, I won't care about you and maybe even forget you're there after a few days.... It could be a very long time.\" Coach laughs. \"That's what you get for not quitting, You get a fitting job.\" You struggle in vain andd scream, \"No please, I'll quit the team, even if it means quitting school. Please let me out of here. I'm... I'm scared.\" Suddenly Matthew picks up the shorts and they retract a little around you. \"He's barely noticeable\" Matthew says. I don't even think I'll feel him when I wear these shorts. Coach laughs. \"Maybe you should try them on.\"</span></div></div>",

Well at least no sooner than the normal pad, so eventually you mighttear it again.\" As Mattthew walks over to the locker room, you scream and cry as hard as you can. Coach's chuckle confirms he heard you. Matthew lays you down on the bench and starts stripping. \"Very convincing acting.\" he whispers, \"It was still acting right?\" You nod, \"Mostly yes, although it was a bit scary how convincing you were.\" Matthew winks \"Thanks for the compliment.\" before picking up the shorts and pulling them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulls them up the rubbery repair stuff slowly stretches and By doing so, your body sticks out of the padding a little more than before. and suddenly his ass is on either side of you and you're being hosted up into his crack. If you're calculations are correct you're right under the heaviest part of his ass, the part that will carry all his weight during the ride and very close to his anus. It would make sense the padding ripped at this exact place. You feel his hand tracing you from the outside and he grunts softly. \"I kno exactly where you are and am gonna enjoy having you in there, all day, every day.\" You can't help but feel a little frightenend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he starts walking his asscheeks move against and a little over you, one by one. \"So?\" You hear coach ask. \"So, nothing much, I like having my lucky shorts back still a perfect fit.\" Coach replies, \"And the tiny?\" You feel Matthew turning around and bending over a little making you kiss his crack deeply. \"You tell me coach, can you see him?\" Coach answers, \"Nope, not at all.\" Matthew stands up again. \"Well, guess the fact you can't see him and I can't feel him makes this a perfect solution. I guess now we'll have to wait and see if he can survive in there. And if not, well, I got my shorts fixed.\" Coach laughs, \"Remember we need to keep him alive till saturday at least. So maybe you shouldn't wear these shorts for now?\" Matthew answer, \"Tell you what, how about I wear them this morning under my clothes during class. That won't be too much for him, he had worse. Than we can check on him how he's doing and I can maybe switch out for my other shorts during training.\" Coach laughs again, \"good idea, I like the idea of keeping him out of side, and the smallest risk of him being found is actually being worn.\" Matthew laughs too, \"I guess it is, so guess I'll just have to keep my pants on till I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Matthew starts moving again and a minute later you feel him putting on his jeans over his shorts and after that he walks of to class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Matthew walks to his class, the tight pants he's wearing press the padded shorts upagainst him. Which also presses you dangerously close to to the cheeks and crack. With ever step he takes either his left cheek or his right rolls over your body. Under the constant shifting pressure and the heat, you get the familiar feeling of getting flattened. By the time he reaches his first class you feel like your lower body is completely smeared out. Now you really feel like you're part of his padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he sits down and with that simple move all of his weight rests on your lower body. But Matthew either can't react to it, or he has no clue. Or, you realise in fear, he doesn't care. Every sound from the outside is muffled by the enourmous amount of flesh keeping you in. You try to listen, but hear almost nothing. And you realise it's math class, an there was a big test today. Matthew didn't study at all this weekend. You notice he's getting nervous as he starts to sweat a little and clenches his buttocks every few minutes. You think about it and wonder if you can help him. You are good at math, most subjects actually, it's just sports you suck at. Slowly you breath in and out trying to find the feeling of syncing up and suddenly you can almost see the math problems, or at least an image of them in Matthews eyes, It's an easy one and you give him the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rights it down and moves on to the next. He slowly wiggles his ass a bit. He realises it's you helping him and you feel him reaching out to and suddenly you can almost read every single thought in his head. Most of them are focused on math and cycling. and suddenly you hear one thought quite clear, 'Maybe having him permanently under my ass wouldn't be such a bad thing' the thought is gone again, but if you could you'd shudder in fear. You accept the fact you're having fun up till now, but you can't imagine spending the rest of your life as nothing more than ass-padding for Matthew. You wonder if you made a big mistake, because you have to stay here at least the rest of the week, otherwise coach might do something even worse. But will Matthew actually let you out after that or will he have gotten so used to your body he wants to keep you in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo clear your head you focus on the math problems and before you know it he's done with the test. With the test done he rolls back in his seat, slowly putting more weight on your head too. Finally the bell rings and he gets up. As he moves to his next class he talks with some of his friends you don't know. And next he sits down for an hour of English. During the class not much happens, so your mind drifts off again. How to tell Matthew it's only for a week, that I really want out again after the race. What's the worst that can happen. Well he could say no and keep me in against my will. Or he could get mad and hand me over to coach or one of the others on the team. Or share the secret about pliable tinies. Non of these options are really somthing to look forward too. So the only way is probably to remind him about all the things you can't do if you're stuck in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what can't you do? He can just fold the shorts insides our and use your body and face to scrape himself clean. or just push you in his ass to lick it. Jerk of on you, cause the fabric will make it easy to wash out. You realise you're in the perfect position to be used in any way Matthew thinks you're usefull. And when he's not in the mood he can just squash you like right now and go on with his life. You realise you're in big trouble, because you're completely at his mercy and by spending an enitre week down here he WILL get used to your services. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rings Matthew walks to the third an last class of the day. But you hear him enter the bathroom as suddenly everything echoes. You hear him unzip and feel him taking a piss, suddenly his hand comes in the back from above and you see a little bit of light. His fingers find your head and slowly close around it. He starts to softly pull and you slowly feel your neck elongating. Matthew feels it too and pulls a bit more. when your head is pulled out far enough he suddenly pushes your head right into his crack, past the hard muscles before lowering it down till your head is positioned right in front of his hole. more out of reflex than anything else you give it a quick lick. Matthew shudders for a second and pulls back his hand leaving your head stuck in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear him zipper up and as he starts moving his cheeks slowly push against the back of your head one by one, rubbing your face all over his hole almost as if you're giving him a massage. every time you open your mouth even a little, it's filled with the taste of his hole. But it get's worse. When he sits down for his class the cheeks close in and push your face so close you can feel it quiver with anticipation as it slowly opens just a little to fold over your head to keep it nice and close. You just know that this will be it for you. Your body squashed under his flesh and your head as a pleasurepearl squashed against his hole. Every movement you make gets a reaction, you wonder if Matthew thinks you're enjoying yourself. But you don't want to embarrass him by arousing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has no problem however with occasionaly clenching his cheeks to push you in deeper for a few second. Finally the final bell rings and Matthew get up. After a short walk you hear him...</span></div></div>",

Matthew lifts you and grins. \"You look pretty comfy in there, I know I was.\" You take a few breaths and your body rapidly reforms, while Matthew puts a towel around his waist. You reform just in time as coach walks in. \"How is the shrimp doing, still breathing.\" You see Matthew nod and he holds you up to coach's grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me out.\" You plead weakly, \"I'll do anything, just don't let me in here, I'll quit the team.\" Coach smirks, \"Nope, we can't have you quit right now or having you get lost, maybe after the big race, besides it's up to Matthew after that if he wants to let you out.\" You start to cry, you don't even have to fake it, \"Fine, if that's what it takes, I'll stay till after the weekend. Just don't let him wear these pants.\" Coach grins, \"But they're his lucky pants, don't you want him to have the best of luck during his race.\" You shake your head, but he doesn't have to wear these short till the big race.\" All coach does is grin again and say, \"True, but that's up to him. And well, if he's not gonna wear them, I'll have to find someone else who knows about this and let them wear the pants to keep your state a little secret. So if you want to come home with me, I'll ask Matthew if I can borrow the shorts.\" You gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Matthew pipes in, \"Coach, don't talk to him like he matters, by the end of the week my ass will have grinded him so deep in my padding we can't even get him out anymore. He's gonna learn how to survive on ass sweat and will learn what it means to be part of the cycling team.\" He lowers his short with you in them. \"And no one wears my lucky shorts but me, if you wanted a chance, you should've glued him into one of the share-shorts.\" You hear coach chuckle. \"Very well, just remember to keep your shorts on or hidden.\" You hear Matthew sigh, \"Yeah, yeah. Suddenly he lowers you again and you see him stepping in his shorts. \"Right, just wanted to check up on the guy without the others around, I'm gonna grab a quick bite and be back in time for training.\"</span></div></div>",

The facility was the newest addition to the school thanks to the funding it gained from the government after the last Olympics when athletes from the school alone took a total of 26 medals. Saying goodbye to your family wasn't hard since they never truly did more than they had to for your survival seeing you as an Embarrassment and were more than happy to ship you off and make you someone else's problem. They dropped you off at the main school campus where you were put on a bus with the other 120 boys who would be boarding out at the facility in hopes of becoming the best in a range of Equestrian sports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you got off the busy out started to rethink your decision. They called people off the bus in groups based on what they were there for. The stern looking headmaster called out<br>\r\n\"Show jumping!\" Then<br>\r\n\"Racing\" followed by<br>\r\n\"Polo team\" Finally there was about 25 guys left on the bus and that's when you really started to regret your choice. As you looked around at your company you realized they were the manliest guys you had ever seen. They were real cowboys. With mud on their cowboy boots and jeans, huge belt buckles that screamed of their achievement, and of course their cowboy hats that had probably been passed down from father to son for generations. The headmaster shook you out of your daze when his voice said'<br>\r\n\"Rodeo sports... ah yes..... you will be staying on floor 2 of dormmitory 3. Now if the list is correct then we have a tiny in this group. Am I correct?\"<br>\r\nYou nervously speak up \"um yes sir, that would be me\"<br>\r\n\"How interesting that a tiny such as yourself should choose a sport that not only involves being around giants but also being around animals, nevertheless you boy must be getting to your dorms now. Will someone help our little friend get to his room?\" The headmaster asks. Nobody steps foreword to help you and says,<br>\r\n\"Very well, would his roommate Johnathan Daniel help him to his room\". A bunch of the boys push around one of the guys who is clearly your roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant walks back towards you and you get a good look at him. Johnathan was 18 years old and had beautiful tan skin. He was perfectly muscular and had a clean shaven face. He picked you up into his strong hand that smelled like leather and started to walk off towards your room. The two of you got to your room and he.... </span></div></div>",

You stand on the edge of a large platform replacing one of the beds in this double room. It is completely equipped for someone of your size. A private bedroom, a living room, kitchen and a large balcony leaning out into the room towards the larger couch that's there for Jonathan to enjoy. \"Wow.\" Is all you can say, noticing movement behind you, you turn and look into your roommates face who has lowered himself to your level. \"Pretty nice setup you got here.\" He says in a hushed tone. \"We had something similar back home for my sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp? \"You're sister is a tiny?\" He smiles, \"Adopted\" You nod, \"Makes sense.\" He grins, \"Well, guess I'm lucky too, since you don't take p a lot of space I have the rest of the room all to myself.\" You look around and see the room look pretty spacious for two people, and now that you only take up the amount of space normally reserved for a bed, Jonathan has a pretty sweet set-up too. \"I guess I lucked out getting a roommate that knows how to live with a tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan smiles again, \"Why do you think they put you with me.\" You smile a bit relieved, \"\"Well still, it's good to know. Not all people are equally... friendly.., towards us.\" Jonathan laughs softly, \"Don't worry about that with me.\" He picks something from his pocket, it's a small box. as he opens it he reveals a simple tiny choker which he hands to you and an a small earring. You only now notice one of his ears is pierced with several rings as he replaces one of them with the one from the box. He waits for you, but you don't know what he wants to do. \"Put on the choker, it has a transmittor paired with the receicer in my earring, it makes it a little easier to communicate with each other.\" You pick up the choker and put it on, it fit's snuggly around your neck. \"Can you hear me now?\" You ask a bit too loud. Jonathan cringes a little, \"You don't have to shout\" he laughs. It's ment to work for your normal voice, something with vibrations and stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you say in your normal voice, \"This is just new to me. So this means you're gonna hear me in your ears all the time?\" Jonathan shakes his head, \"Thankfully no. It's ment to work through our entire room and when we're outside only within 50 ft or so. He suddenly sits down and leans back against your platform as he fishes his phone from his pocket and opens up his facetime app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a young blond girl answers \"Johnny!\" She squeals, \"How are you, have you gotten to the new school?\" Jonathan smiles. \"Hey big sis. Yeah I'm good, and look I have a new roommate.\" He slowly leans in towards you and you notice him pointing the camera a bit your way.\" The girl waves at you and you wave back. \"Hi,\" she says, \"I'm Molly, Johnny's little big sister.\" You walk closer towards the phone hoping she can hear you, this also means you come really close to Jonathans cheek and yo fel the warmth eminatinig from it and you can smell a slight hint of aftershave. \"Hi Molly, I'm Peter, your brothers new roommate. Nice to meet you.\" Molly smiles, \"Good, take good care of my brother for me, he needs someone to watch over him, so he won't do anything stupid. I'm just happy he has his own new shoulder angel to do that, now that I'm not around.\" She looks at Jonathan, \"Moms sending you some of the stuff you used to carry me around. You might find some use for it, just remember to be gentle with your roomy. Or I'm gonna come over and kick your ass for him.\" Jonathan laughs, which shakes your world, almost making you trip. \"Don't worry sis, I'll behave.\" She nods, \"Just remember he's not Tommy.\" Jonathan cringes, \"Yeah okay Mollers... How about we talk later? See ya.\" She waves a last time and he cuts the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that was my tiny sister.\" He says as he gets up. As he stands and stretches you notice your platform reaches just up to his nice bubble butt, squeezed in a pair of thight jeans. You quickly walk away and pick up your bag. \"She seems really nice.\" You say as you walk over to the sleeping part and find a few tiny closets and you start to hang out your clothes. From the other half of the room you hear Jonathan doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though the thought of being around giant humans scares you a little you always liked horses and yo never met an unfriendly horse either. So you're not that worried about them. Suddenly a large shadow looms over you and you see Jonathan crashing down on the couch beside you. His head is now level with your balcony and you look right into his smiling face. \"And that's it, we're moved in.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put down the booklet and walk over to the edge of the balcony and look Jonathan up and down as he sits back. \"You know this is the first time I'm rooming with a giant?\" Jonathan looks at you, \"Does it scare you?\" You shrug, \"Just a little.\" He laughs, \"It should you know, I mean, not that I would intentionally do anything to harm you, but I don't want any accidents, so it might be best for you to be carefull around me.\" You nod and he continues, \"Allthough You probably know by now that tinies are actually extremely durable. My sis and I had a few accidents too and well then there was Tommy.\" There's that name again, dare you ask? \"Who'se this Tommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan sighs, \"Tommy was a friend of my sis, and well, he kinda had a crush on me.\" Jonathan grins a bit embarrased. \"And I kinda liked him too.\" You remain silent for him to continue. \"So one day I found him sneaking around my stuff and climbing into one of my shoes, so I decided to give the guy a bit of a scare by picking it up and pretending to put it on.\" You swallow a lump in you throat and Jonathan notices this, \"Don't worry I pulled back in time and looked at him with a stern face and told him to be more carefull. But then he asked me why I stopped? And asked me to put the shoe on for real for a few minutes. And well, I did.\" He looks at you and sees you shaking a little, \"I let him out soon enough and he really thanked me and asked me if we could do it again sometime.\" Jonathan smiles warmly, \"So yeah, I actally did it to please him, because I don't really liked the feeling, so please don't worry about being put in my shoe.\" You exhale a bit more easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear, cause I really don't enjoy being smothered or stomped by feet all that much.\" You say. \"Even though it happened quite often.\" Jonathan grins, \"You've been smothered a lot?\" You nod a bit embarrased, \"Too much to count.\" He nods, \"Was it always the feet?\" You shake, \"Actually most accidents happened by people sitting on me, so butt, legs and genitals.\" Jonathan grins, \"That doesn't sound too good.\" You shrug and before you know it you blurt out, \"It's always better to be under ass, than underfoot.\" Jason laughs softly, \"I agree, having a tiny underfoot is too ticklish for me, at least when you accidently sit on one you don't feel so much, unless your nude of course.\" You realise Jonathan is just trying to assure you, \"Well my one experience with a naked ass taught me that some people don't even notice you squirming than. The guy who ever invented jockstraps should be hanged.\" Jonathan laughs again, \"Oh, ouch, when did that happen?\" You grin, \"When I was told to look into teamsports and I though about the baseball team, the coach accidently put me down on the bench right as the team was coming in to change for a game. Luckily coach noticed before the game started and had every guy drop trousers until he found me stuck to the captains rump. dangling from the elastic band.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan grins, \"Maybe the guy did notice you, but liked the feeling.\" You shudder, \"That's a terrible thought, thanks, that's gonna give me nightmares.\" Jonathan shrugs, \"Why, he wouldn't be the first guy to actually enjoy a tiny in his pants and well, if a tiny sits on a human bench or coach he might actually want to be sat on.\" You give jonathon a weird look? \"There are tinies how enjoy it?\" Jonathan nods, \"Sure, it's just like a leather, drag or whatever fetish, called macrophelia. Tinies enjoy being sat on, stomped or even eaten by giants. And some if not most giants have a microphelia fetish and enjoy playing with tinies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away fo a second to let this sink in. \"Wait, what do you mean by most giants? Does that include you?\"</span></div></div>",

I guess that's Tommy's fault, I didn't really enjoy feeling him in my shoe, but I didn't mind the whole power over him principle.\" You brace yourself and surpress the urge to run as he continuous, \"And well I did accidently sit on a tiny once or twice, really it just happens sometime, and although I didn't always notice at once, when I did I admit I might have kept sitting a little longer than necessary.\" He gives you a smile. \"But don't worry, I wouldn't do it on purpose,\" a small pause before he adds, \"without consent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot to take in.\" Is all you can say. Jonathan smiles, \"Well, just tell me, what do you do when someone sits on you.\" You give him a weak smile. \"Focus on trying to stay alive.\" Jonathan snaps his fingers, \"Exactly, that's why some people enjoy it, they return to their more primal insticts of survival, drowning out the stress from everyday life.\" You think on that for a second. \"I guess that would be one way of looking at it.\" Jonathan grins, \"And some tinies do it just to learn how to deal with it.\" You smirk, \"Like training yourself to deal with the humiliation?\" Jonathan nods. \"The same way some giants train to recognise the small signs a tiny is under them.\" You laugh a little, \"Sounds like you're an expert.\" Jonathan laughs too and suddenly leans over to pick up his wallet from the side-table and picks out a Laminated card. \"My folks and me had to go through the trainig course before we were allowed to adopt my sister. He holds up the card for you to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                 <i>Centre of TCI</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Card holder</b><br>\r\nMr. J.

And Jonathans smiles, \"It's the same centre that forces tinies into sporting activities with us giants.\" You look at him, \"And you and you're parents are now T-trainers, where I suppose the T stands for Tiny?\" Jonathan nods. And \"Molly is a certified G-trainer too and so was Tommy.\" You ponder, \"So not only did they put me here with you because you have a tiny sibling, but they put you here to train me?\" Jonathan laughs out loud, \"Nope, that's where you're wrong. I'm just another collegekid here, my training days are on hold for now.\" He catches his breath, \"So I can't officially train you, but if you like I wouldn't mind sharing some lessons over the coming months.\" You Flinch, \"Why would I do that?\" Jonathan gives you a friendly smile, \"Because over the summer I could take you with me to the center and you might take an exam. If you pass you might get a certificate that allows you to forfeit all sportrelated activities or it might even get you a job at the center after you graduate. And well, those are some of the best paying jobs for tinies in the world. And with some of the best benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that actually does sound pretty good you think, \"What's the exam all about.\" Jonathan counts on his fingers:<br>\r\n\"1. you will have to show a couple of people you know how to announce yourself when accidently stepped or sat on.<br>\r\n2. you will have a written exam on how to deal with a runaway microphile.<br>\r\n3. The final test will be having to spend two days on the body of a trainer of your choice, day and night.\"<br>\r\nYou throw your hands up in the air. \"Oh, that's all?\" Jonathan smiles disarmingly. \"Well, yeah, but it's just a few days and it'll get you far. Besides you could always pick me as your trainer for the last part, if you let me train you the coming months it might be a lost easier than you think.\" You sigh. \"Sorry it's just a bit much to take in all of a sudden, this morning all I could thin about was how I would survive the busride out here and wondering if I actually would have a roommate. I was worried about being not good enough with the horses and how I would ever get to move around in my dorm room. I was worried about being kicked out of school, not being accepted as a rodeo tiny and then some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan gives you a wry smile, \"Want to stop worrying for a while?\" You realise what he's offering as you blurt out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then everything goes dark and suddenly his weight on you presses you down into the couch, deeper and deeper until suddenly you feel yourself no longer sinking but locked tight between the couch and your new roommates warm posterior. At that moment your brain just ssems to stop and you focus on your breathing like you always do when someone sits on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly ever so slowly you feel his weight shift a little and you realise he is rolling back towards the back of the seat. When he rests again you can hear him say, \"You okay under there?\" You completely forgot about the choker, meaning you can talk to him. \"Yes, I am, thank you.\" You hear him chuckle. \"Good, now I'm gonna put my feet up, which will increase the pressure, let me no if it's too much. Suddenly you feel the muscle in his right cheek tense, roll back and lower again, this puts indeed mor pressure on that side. Still not uncomfortable really. The right cheek follows the same motion and suddenly you feel even more immobilsed. which also feel kind of relieving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still good?\" He asks from above. \"Yeah, are you okay too?\" This makes Jonathan laugh out, shaking his body in an almost massaging way. \"I'm good thanks, mind if I roll around a bit to give myself a good feel off you?\" You answer, \"Go ahead.\" And suddenly Jonathan starts moving slightly, left to right and front to back. You can't describe the feeling, but it reminds you most about going through a carwash, if you were the car. rubbed from the front, the top and the sides, back and forth. Are you imagining things or did you just hear Jonathan actually grnt a little in satisfaction? And is he actually speeding up? You just relax and lean into it, letting his as toss you around for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while his movements slow down and you can hear him breathe a little heavier. \"I think I'm ready to come out now.\" You say, at first there's not really a reaction, and suddenly you hear Jonathan's voice say softly, \"Can you give me a few minutes?\" It's out before you know it, \"Having a little trouble in the front?\" Again a long pause and this time you can hear the embarrasment in his voice. \"Yeah.\" You can't hold your laugh, \"Fine just make it quick, I'm good for another few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this the silence returns until suddenly</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you wait for Jonathan to \"calm down\". You suddenly feel him shifting a little in his seat and his legs open a little squeezing you tighther. Suddenly you feel him slowly rocking a bit back and forth and you hear a soft sound of... someone jerking off. This was not what you ment at all, and yet, if you call out now, you'll make it even more awkward. So all you can do is just grin and bear it. Slowly you hear Jonathan's breathing speed up and his thrusting motion as you now know for what it is increases. Alls of a sudden a shuddering sensation flows through his body and you hear him sigh deeply. His cheeks clench anc unclench, clench and unclench and suddenly Jonathan is as motionless as before. You can smell the musky scent he just released even over his ass-smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jonathan heavily leans right and returns. You hear him wiping himself off and suddenly the snap of his boxers. You expect him to get up any second, however he just sits there. Next he starts speaking, \"This wasn't supposed to happen, I'm really sorry, this was completely unproffesional.\" You chuckle a little, \"Well, this wasn't an official training, remember.\" Jonathan chuckles too, \"True, but still, it's been a while and I kinda forgot how feeling someone under me like that can sometimes turn me on. Most of the time we prepare by...\" You finish his sentence, \"taking care of business before a session.\" Jonathan laughs softly, sending a pleasant vibration through your body. \"That's a good way to put it but yes. And normally we start out a little slower by actually wearing a thicker layer of fabric, like some shorts or sweatpants, still as accomadating, but less close-up to the action.\" You wonder how a pair of shiny shorts would have felt against your body. \"Still don't worry, it helped a little, my brain isn't in overdrive anymore.\" You feel Jonathan put up his feet again for some reason and rela a little more as if he's not even thinking of getting up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. But I wonder, you never even seemed to struggle, which is usually a sign of a tiny being sat on a lot.\" You don't know how to respond, but he continues, \"I even suspected a few gagging sounds, seeing as well, I'm not all that clean right now. You've apparantly had worse than this?\" Wait, are you actually talking about this now? with you still under his ass? \"Well, yeah I had.\" Jonathan remains quiet. \"To be honest, when I told you the baseball story, Coach didn't find me before the game.\" You hear Jonathan whistle slightly in disbelief as you go on. \"I spent almost the entire day under the captains ass. It was an out game, so it included a three hour busdrive both ways. And it was a very hot day. Finally on the way back after losing the game I managed to pass out as it got to be too much.\"You swallow a big lump remembering that day. \"I woke up in the team hamper covered in jockstraps and had to climb out and find my own way back out of the locker room.\" You fall silent for a little while and finally Jonathan says, \"I'm really amazed that after that you agreed to let me sit on you. I think most tinies would feel trauatized and panic everytime someone sat on them.\" You choke back a sob, \"I was, I mad sure I was always late to class so I could pick a free seat. I made sure I didn't get included in group assignments with giants, I ate hidden away in corners and estranged myself from erveryone. And well that's when the headmaster took a direct interest and forced me to pick a sport and here I am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why rodeo?\" You smile, \"because horses are so much easier than Giants.\" Jonathan doesn't sound convinced, \"And?\" You add, \"And there's a lot less people here than in the main building, I only had to survive one roommate and for some reason I thought people that like to time large beasts like horses might be bored by a little like me.\" Jonathan chuckles, \"Sounds like you thought on it a lot... But what made you agree on this?\" You blink in surprise, \"I'm not scared of you.\" It's just such a raw and honest answer it kinda scares you. Jonathan laughs again, sending that pleasurefull tingle through your body. \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" Suddenly you feel yourself enjoying his warmth and his weight. You realise you do feel safe with Jonathan, a little weird, but still safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Jonathan suddenly asks, \"Should I get off?\"</span></div></div>",

You should at least let me take it to the bed so I can lie down too.\" Without even thinking you answer, \"Okay.\" Slowly you feel Jonathan roll foward and his muscles tense as he suddenly gets up, a sudden chill rolls over your body as his bodyheat is suddenly missing. Dressed in nothing but his red boxerbriefs and a nice flanel shirt you see him walkin away and rummaging in one of his drawers. \"Aha, I knew I saw one of these earlier.\" He plucks out something that looks like a black pai of boxerbriefs and walks back over plummeting down on the seat cushion next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at these, these are somewhat tailor made for processes as this. He lower the briefs a litle and you notice something a little off, on the backside right in the middle there seems to be an extra pouch. You don't have to think twice what its use is. \"Okay, being under your underwear is one thing, but being a part of it is just too much.\" Jonathan laughs, \"It's for your own safety, you see. This way if I fall asleep and roll over I don't accidently roll back on top of you with the brunt of my weight.\" You look up at him and shake your head, \"Don't go making sense all of a sudden. It's just weird.\" Jonathan grins and lowers the underwear. \"The weird part is that it's double sided so you can wear it with the pouch on the inside and on the outside.\" you cringe. \"Who comes up with this stuff?\" Jonathan keeps grinning, \"This was actually designed by one of the Tinies at the CTCI, as a proper training tool.\" He shows you the letterts CTCI embossed in the elastic band. \"They made a whole range of training gear and handed them out to trainers. I never got to use these though. Since I decided to go to college.\" You nod, \"Okay, but why would you want to wear it inside out?\" Jonathan shrugs, \"I guess it's safety again, for when you're travelling? Or maybe some tinies just prefer it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look once more at the black piece of cloth. \"Okay, I'm willing to try it, but...\" Jonathan raises a hand, \"If you don't like it, it's gonna come off immediatly.\" You nod, \"So how does this work? Do I get in first or do you?\" Jonathan lowers it to the couch and spreads it out. In this one movement you notice something else, before he lays it flat you notice a similar pouch on the front side. No way you're ever gonna be put in there. You walk onto the fabric and move to where the opening of he pouch is. I looks like a rather small sleeping bag. You sit down in front of the hole and slide your legs in, next you wiggle the rest dow, till just your shoulders and head are stcking out. \"Actually,\"Jonathan says, \"You're supposed to slip in all the way, cause when I put it on, the fabric will pull taught and the opening will be pulled close pretty tight.\" You give a sigh and slide a little deeper, \"Don't say anything.\" You tell Jonathan and he laughs, \"I won't, hope you're ready.\" You feel the fabric being lifted and suddenly lowered. You can ake out some shapes through the fabric noticing you're litte pouch has an open weave, on both sides. You twist yourself around looking into the inside remembering that otherwise you will be facedown into the mattress in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the mesh you can see the boxer travel up past Jonathans muscular calves and next his thighs. Slowly Jonathan pulls them up further and further, his tight round buttocks now fill your view and slowly come closer. You want to close your eyes but keep them open anyway. The fabric around you stretches and your pouch closes in around you as he pulls the pants up the final part. And that's that, you're now snuggly pushed against he outside of Jonathan's crack, actually part of his underwear. And he could probably keep you in here forever if he wanted too. You feel him tracing your body from the outside and aligns you a little more proper by pulling the top of the undies. \"Are you okay?\" All your doubt from a moment earlier melts away as you hear true concern in his voice. \"A bit weirded out right now, but still alive\" Jonathan laughs, \"Okay, hold on, I'm gonna try to walk over to the bed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slowly lifts his right leg, the briefs pull tight to that side pulling you against the flesh. Lowering it releases the grip and brings you back to the middle, the same happens with the left cheek, and right again. \"I hope I don't chave you.\" You say. \"Nope, just feels like you're kissing my asscheeks one by one.\" He says with a giggle. After a few more steps he suddenly turns around. and slowly lowers his ass down into a sitting position, which pulls you up a little into his crack. And then it's touchdown on the mattress, Apparantly the mattress is a lt softer than the couch as you feel like you're sinking deeper and deeper. Finally it stops. Due to the fact you are now in a pouch in the underwear instead of lying flat under it. You feel like you're actually bulging inwards even more than before. \"Okay, I don't know it it's a good thing I can feel you better than before?\" You hear Jonathan ask.\" You don't know either but say, \"It's still good. Maybe if you lie down it'll be less.\" Jonathan pulling in his legs pulls the pants awfully tight and you awfully deep. And the fact he makes a twisting movement also slams his cheeks somewhat into you. But then he stretches again and his weight is now lessened as it is divided over his entire body. He lifts up his ass and slides to the middle of the bed before laying still. \"You still sure you want to risk taking a nap?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it and realise that you're really tired, and actually really warm and comfy right now. \"Just set the alarm for in an hour or so.\" And suddenly you feel yourself fall into a blissfull dreamless state. </span></div></div>",

Coming.\" You hear Jonathan say clearly just waking up too. As he slides to the edge of the bed you are squished into his ass for a second before he gets up and slowly moves to the door. As he opens it you hear an excited voice, you faintly recall from the busdrive. \"Dude, how can you be asleep, there's so much to discover around here. Come on, put on some pants and a shirt and we'll show you the horses.\" You feel Jonathan tense for a second, \"Erm... sure, but I think I should take a shower first, I'm kind of smelly.\" The excited voice reacts, \"No time dude, the stables are gonna be closed in an hour. Now hurry.\" You feel Jonathan stumbling back as if he's being pushed. The voice is now in the room, \"Here's your shirt, and you're pants are over there by the couch, come on.\" Suddenly the voice falls silent, before it asks a little inquisitive, \"Is that where your tiny roommate lives? Is he napping too? Can I meet him, does he wants to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get him out of here.\" You whisper to Jonathan who can hear you, \"I don't want to have to explain this right now.\" Jonathan reacts immediatly, \"I think he's napping, he had a BIG day, maybe we should let him sleep, you can meet him tommorow.\" He starts moving around at an increased pace, which rubs you against his ass sideways and up and down.He bends down and puts on his pants and sddenly it gets really dark again. The pants press you deeper into his crack. Apparantly they are pretty tight. \"I never met a tiny before.\" You here the voice say and suddenlt a name pops in your mind, Trevor. \"I think it's cool we have one on or team, not many teams will have a tiny. The others think its gonna be fun to see what he can do.\" Fully dressed Jonathan moves quickly to push Trevor out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the door close and Trevor keeps asking questions as they start moving. \"So did you meet him yet? Did you talk to him?\" jonathan answer, \"Yeah we talked a little, his name is Peter and he joined the rodeo mainly because he feels more comfortable around horses than around humans.\" Trecor grunts in affirmation, \"Yeah I get that, I expect living around people like us, can't seem to safe to him. It's why coach talked to the guys to take it easy on him and make sure he doesn't feel threatened more than he already is. That's why I'd like to meet him without everyone around, maybe tonight after dinner or something, do you think he'd want to?\" Jonathan interrupts the stream of words, \"I'll ask him when we get back. I think it's good for him to meet the rest of the team one-on-one. But if he's scared of Giants already, your size might seem even more terrifying. You're jst about the biggest guy I've ever met.\" You hear Trevor laugh heartily. \"Yeah true, but still, I'm just your regular BFG.\" Both men laugh, you realise you're so caught up in their conversation you hardly notice the fact you're still being scraped around Jonathan's ass. \"Ask him if that's why he wants to meet a tiny, if it's the size difference?\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan takes it over, \"So you just like meeting him so yo can actually be that BFG?\" Trevor chuckles, \"Well it's intruiging sure, comparing his size to mine, but I would only do so if he let me. I don't like people taking advantage of smaller things. I needed to learn how to control myself when I got my growthspurt, so I think everyone should respect all living things. And I also want to reassure him that not all giants are evil or stupid. That he can have giant friends. And since most of the rodeo team are pretty decent and strong guys, I think it's good for him to know we can protect him from the pricks around here. Especially those cocky polo-jerks. But some of the jockeys where talking on the bus about the little guy in ways that probably would scare him too death.\" You take a big gulp, he just described almost half the guys in this boarding school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the two men reach the stables and they start talking about the horses. This really pisses you off, you can hear them talking about those beautifull beasts and you can't even see them. Suddenly a voice rings up from behind. \"So taking a quick peek at the horses?\" It's a gentle voice with a bit of a Spanish accent, \"I'm Manuel, master of the stables. And you two look like real rodeo riders.\" The boys answer sffirmingly. \"Good, we've got some nice bucks to train this year.\" Manuel leads the boys a bit deeper into the stables. Finaly stopping, loud hoofbeats and snorting sounds can be heared close-by. \"This one is called Monster, nobody has ever been able to come close enough without being bitten. The one that tames this one will go down in school history I suppose.\" Suddenly you hear the horse sniff and instead of a snort you hear a soft inquisitive whiney. But then its back to aggresion, \"Well, well, I never made him hear making a sound like that.\" Manuel says before leading the boys away and introducing them to some more horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So since I'm about to close the stables I thought I'd take out some of the more eager horses for a short ride.

But good on Jonathan as he says, \"I don't know, I mean, are we allowed to do that?\" You hear Manuel chuckle. \"Sure you are, I'm the master here, so I can take along whoever I want.\" Jonathan clenches his ass a bit, you realise he wants you to tell him. \"Well, you can't say no now.\" You say, \"That would be rude and stupid.\" Jonathan speaks up, \"Very well, let's ride.\" Suddenly his whole body start moving as he is lead to a horse and told to get it ready. He puts on the saddle which involves heavy squatting and leaning and putting on the headgear. After a while you hear Manuel come by as he tells the guys to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is just beginning you think as suddenly Jonathan lifts his leg, pushes up onto it in the stirrups and swings his other leg over the horse. As he lowers himself the wide seat crushes his ass closed on you even before he sits down into the saddle. But then the moving and swaying beings as the guys take their ride. Slowly but surely you feel yourself being crunched and grinded into Jonathans rump. Probably the worst part is the activity is getting Jonathan quite moist. The air around you becomes humid and you can taste his salty sweat in your mouth. Suprisingly enough, you don't hate it. Like is too strong a word, but so is hate. After a while you do get into the rhytm with him as he rides the horse. Suddenlt Manuel urges them to speed up and so they do, You feel Jonathan leaning forward a little, which pts even more strain on his undies pressing you further in. But as he speeds up the fresh air flowing around him does feel refreshing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when they slow down for a walk and Jonathan eases down you're not sorry. A little while later the horse stops and Jonathan gets off, leading it back in side and he starts brushing the horse down after removing the saddle and the headgear. After a while you hear Manuels voice close-by. \"Did you enjoy the ride Jonathan?\" Jonathan stands up, \"Yeah I did, thank you, this is a really great mare.\" Manuel chuckles, \"Yes she is, there's just one trick on being able to ride her.\" silence before manuel continous, \"You have to carry around a tiny person.\" You gasp and so does Jonathan. Manuel laughs softly. \"Don't worry, I know you're the person who's roommate with our new tiny rodeo rider. So I figured you might have been carrying him around, I suppose he's in your pocket?\" Jonathan grunts neither an affrimation or denial. \"Please don't worry about it, I'm not gonna snoop on you just yet, but I want you to come over tomorrowmorning before classes so we can talk to the two of you.\" Jonathan agrees and quickly moves away, meeting up with Trevor as they walk back to the dorms. Suddenly it hits you, \"Did Manuel just say WE?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long walk, listening to Trevor going crazye over the horses, you finally hear Jonathan open a door just as his phone rings. \"Yes this is Jonathan, Peter's roommate.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, I think he;s taking a nap, that's why he isn;t answering, I just got in, I can check.\"<br>\r\n\"No I think he'll want his dinner in our room if that's okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, If I want to join him in our room or eat in the messhall? I didn't know that was an option.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I think I'll join him tonight, seeing as it's his first night here. And I will install the app and tell him to do so too.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly you pipe in. \"Ask if you can invite others too and if Trevor wants to eat with us.\"<br>\r\n\"So is this just for roommates or can we invite others?\"<br>\r\n\"With a max of three, can you please hold on a second?\"<br>\r\nYou hear Jonathan whisper to Trevor, \"Care to join us for dinner tonight? So you can meet Peter without the others around?\"<br>\r\nJonathan answers with his catchphrase, \"Hell yeah!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay yes we will have someone joining us.\"<br>\r\n\"Trevor Parrel.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'll be ready in an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Jonathan hang up, \"Okay, so dinner in an hour?\" he asks Trevor. \"Sure thing that will give me some time to freshen up. any dresscode?\" he adds with a hint of amusement. \"Just cover up enough not to scare him into thinking you got BIG plans.\" Trevor and Jonathan chuckle as Jonathan enters his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you see a shiver of light as Jonathan pulls down his pants. And soon enough the undies come off. Jonathan places them on the bed and as you squirm out you notice he took the decency to put on a bathrobe. And have a concerned and bashfull look on his face. \"I'm really... really sorry about all of this.\" You wave his excuses away, \"It's okay, I've had worse remember, at least you knew I was down there. Even though You didn't keep up your end of the deal.\" Jonathan looks at you questioningly as you continue, \"You promised not to make me a part of your underwear. And well, let's just say I feel very sorry for the rest of them knowing what they have to go through on a daily base.\" Jonathan grins and picks you up moving you to your own little apartment.  \"Well, at least you now know you can survive as part of someone's underwear, so if the job at the centre falls through you can always use it as a back-up.\" You stomp on his finger which makes him grin, which makes you even angrier, \"Maybe... I guess I could do worse... than Trevor.\" This makes Jonathan blink in surprise and you quickly turn to hide your own grin, \"Better clean up, cause I can honestly tell you need it.\" And you walk of into your own private bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long shower you finally feel clean again, rubbing on enough deodorant, hoping this hides the smell you dress yourself in sweats and walk out onto the balcony. You're a bit surprised to see Jonathan already sitting on the couch reading a book, hair still wet. \"Guess it seemed worse from where I was stuck.\" you mumble, forgetting the fact he can hear you quite clearly as he turns his head. with a smile. \"I guess so.\" His smile vanishes for a second, \"We still cool?\" You give him a nod, \"Yeah it's okay. I guess if today didn;t make me freak out like before at least part of my trauma is gone.\" The smile comes back slowly as he says, \"Well, that's a good thing at least. But it's so fra from everything I've been taught, that it kinda scares me how well you adjust to it.\" Most of the time it takes months to prepare a tiny for something like this. And we skipped like at least three steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and lean back, \"What steps.\" Jonathan answers, \"Well first it is building up in just sitting with you on or under parts of a human body. Next we bring in a second trainer so you can learn how different people have different bodies, then you pick the trainer to continue the process with and we build up towards something like today, but probably without a horseride. There are some ways to learn how to cope that I won't share the details of just yet.\" Suddenly a thought hits you. \"Manuel has his own tiny?\" Jonathan chuckles, \"That was my thought too. I guess he wants us to meet him or her.\" you nod. \"So maybe Manuel could be the second trainer you need?\" You wonder. Jonathan chuckles, \"Probaly not, if he has his own tiny. Besides sometimes it's easier to have someone who doesn't know all to much about tinies to begin with, it's quick schooling for both of you.\" you blink and weigh his words. \"You're thinking about Trevor aren't you?\" you see Jonathan nod. \"You'll meet him soon enough and I think you'll like him.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud knock on the door startles you, \"It's open.\" Jonathan yells. And as the door opens your mouth drops open. A man standing about 7 foot bends down to move into the room. A tight shirt spans over his broad chest and doesn't hide some pretty chisseled abs over slim hips and long legs. His arms are huge and so are his legs. You can't even see his feet but figure they might be just as imposing. The room just looks incredible small with this man in it. But his movements are very precise and maybe even can be considered delicate. As he slowly closes in on the couch. You notice he's wearing sweatpants too and this shows off a bulge that must be at least three times your size even right now. Instead yo look up into his face and see a square jaw, a bit scruffy a thin nose and two bright grey eyes that sparkle with friendliness. It's his eyes that finally put you at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening you two.\" He says jolly. \"Man, could I eat a horse or two right now.\" You see Jonathan lean over and handing Trevor a clip on earpiece not to much unlike a blue-tooth headset. \"Here, put this one so you can hear him speak. And try to lower your voice a little so you don't deafen him or blow him away.\" he adds with a grin. Next he shoves over on the couch and motions Trevor to take the seat next to your balcony. Trevor puts on the ear piece and moves over to the couch, as he turns and sits down, you notice his enourmous ass that looks as hard as a rock. As Trevor sits down you notice his size makes your balcony only reach up to just below his shoulder, about the heigt of his pits and a strong musky smell comes from them, Trevor apparantly did not put on any deodorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifts just a bit and looks down on the balcony and you, \"Wow, he really is tiny.\" You hear him say, And you answer, \"And it is in the room with you and it can hear you talk about him... oh and it talks too.\" This makes Jonathan laugh out loud and Trevor look a bit surprised, \"Oh, I'm sorry, I meant no offence, I just...\" You shake your head, \"Don't worry, it's okay. I shouldn't have snapped, but it's always so annoying when you giants think we can't understand you.\" You walk to the edge of the balcony and stretch out your hand, \"Nice to meet you, I'm peter.\" Slowly Trevor raises his indexfinger and touches your hand. \"Hi Peter, I'm Trevor, one of your new teammates.\" He retracts just as quickly and keeps staring at you as you lean down on the edge of the balcony, \"I guess that means we now have both the largest and the smallest teammember in one room?\" He nods and slowly thaws a bit as you talk to him. \"I hope you don't mind having a tiny on the team, I don't know how much good I can be, but I'll try my best.\" Trevor smiles,  \"Well that's the spirit, right? I mean being big an tall isn't always a good thing in rodeo, sometimes its better to be small and quick.\" You shrug, \"I can do the small part, but I won't be outrunning a horse anytime soon.\" Trevor laughs boomingly. \"I guess not, but than again, you're also a pretty small target. I Just didn't realise how small. I mean how the hell are we supposed to keep an eye on you out there. Or even in here? It's a good thing you have this elevation, I'd be worried I'd accidently crush you with my body if yo were running around\" You shrug again, \"Oh we don't crush that easily. So don't worry about it too much, I'm more scared of getting lost.\" Trevor Smirks, \"Sorry to break it to you little one, but I don't think you would survive it if I accidently stepped or sat on you.\" You fold your arms, \"Believe me, I've had worse than someone sitting or stepping on me. Not that I enjoy it that much, but I'll survive.\" At this point Jonathan breaks in, \"It's true you know, tinies are pretty sturdy, I guess they evolved that way to keep alive, Very dense molecular structures or something.\" Trevor shakes his head, \"Still I can't imagine a tiny being able to survive being sat on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look past Trevor and are a bit too annoyed to think clearly, \"Jonathan, why don't we show him.\" Jonathan grins at you, \"Oly if you're sure.\" But he gets up and picks you from the balcony placing you down on the couch. \"You're kidding?\" Trevor says, but without a second though you see Jonathan turning around and lowering his shorts-clad ass down on you. Before you know it the familiar warmth and scent press down on you against the couch. \"Dude, you're crushing him?!\" You smile at the panick in Trevors voice. \"I'm fine, Trevor.\" you say, \"A bit cramped and hot, but mostly just fine.\" You hear Jonathan say, \"Don't worry Trevor, a tiny can handle more than this.\" You wonder why Jonathan isn't getting up now that you porved your point. But he goes on, \"Remember I told you about my tiny sis, she had worse than this happen to her too and she's still alive and kicking.\"Trevor answer, \"Yeah, okay, I kinda want to believe you, but this just seems impossible.\" Jonathan laughs, \"Well as you can clearly see it's not. he's perfectly fine aren't you?\" You answer, \"Yeah, it's fine.\" Suddenly you hear Trevor's voice, \"Shouldn't you get up, I can't imagine he likes it under there.\" You hold your tongue, as you try to figure out what Jonathan is trying to do. \"Well like is probably a strong word, but I don't think he minds it that much, most tinies get sat and stomped on so often they just take it in stride and sometimes just grin and bear it for a while.\" You get what he's aiming at and pipe in, \"No grin, just bearing.\" Trevor remains silent for a while before saying, \"So you don't hate being sat on?\" You answer after a few moments. \"To be honest, it's not the greatest feeling, but it's better to be sat on, than to be stepped on. And well right now it's assuring enough you guys realise I'm down here, so nothing really alarming, I can manage for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain a long pause, \"So you can feel him under you? How does that feel?\"<br>\r\nJonathan laughs softly shaking you a bit and answer:</span></div></div>",

Next to you you see Trevor looking down on you wit a slight look of concern, \"You sure you're okay?\" You nod, \"Yep as fine as ever. so you just wanna scoot over here or are you comfortable over there?\" Trevor blinks but lifts himself up, slowly he moves his ass over the couch till he hovers over you. \"Does this look okay?\" he asks and you say, \"Sure, just lower yourself all the way, but a little slowly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to be all the encouragement Trevor needs to start lowering his enourmous ass down on you. As the strained sweatpants touch you, you ready yourself. The flesh follows only a heartbeat later and as you expected, there's hardly any give with this ass. Slowly but surely his ass lowers more and more flattening you into the seatcushion and it jst keeps coming, you feel the immense weight and you almost start to regret this, especially since the weight keeps increasing and you keep sinking deeper and deeper. Untill after what seems forever the movement stops and you're packed in so tight you can barely even open your mind to speak. \"Alive and sticking nder here, how about you.\" You hear a surprised grunt from above, \"Weirded out a little, I mean, I can actually feel you under my ass.\" You can't make out his tone, \"Not in a bad way I hope?\" He chuckles, \"Nope, to be honest I thought it would be like sitting on a pebble, you know, one that you move out of the way immediatly.\" You laugh softly, \"Wow, at least I'm more comfortable than a pebble.\" He laughs a little which makes him quake all-over steamrolling you a bit more. \"I meant it as a sort of compliment, I mean it's strangely, comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knock at the door saves you from answering and you hear Jonathan say, \"Don't get up!\" and hear him walk over to the door. \"Dinner for two and a tiny.\" you hear and the rattling of a cart, \"Just leave it out in the hall when you're done.\" WIth that the voice dissappears and the door closes. Suddenly you get a weird idea. \"I'm not really that hungry yet, so if you want you can just leave me under here while you eat.\" You hear Trevor Gasp, \"What? but you can't be comfortable down there.\" You grin, \"No, not really, but it feels like good practice to have you sit on me, if I can deal with this, I can probably deal with anything.\" Trevor laghs again, \"Well there's not many people around here as big and heavy as me, so you've got a point.\" You wait a second before adding, \"But only if you don't mind Trevor.\" His answer comes a little too quick, you realise. \"Not at all.\" You hear Jonathan chuckle and add, \"Maybe you should try moving around a bit Trevor, a bit back and forth to see what is most comfortable for you.\" You don't even get time to react as you feel the bulbous but start wiggling side to side and back and forth untill suddenly you hear Trevor sigh and sit back down fullweight. You realise you're now a little deeper under his ass, actually more under his taint. The musky smell is a little stronger. \"Wow, that does hit the spot you know.\" You hear him say. \"You still okay down there Peter?\" You answer at once. \"Still going strong and nice and warm. Just have your dinner and don't worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly the last part wasn't really needed as before long you hear the two of them eating, you also hear some noise in the background, apparantly Jonathan put on the TV. \"Is it okay for me to put up my feet?\" You hear Trevor ask. \"Sure go ahead.\" With that you feel his right cheek pull tight and suddenly bear down on you as he lifts his foot. Followed by his left cheek and suddenly the weight has intensified to almost unbearable. But you focus on your breathing and remember you asked for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you realise the boys are done with dinner and you hear Jonathan clean up and roll the cart back in the hallway, so you figure soon Trevor will get up. </span></div></div>",

Care to join me?\"  You feel Trevor laughing more than you can hear him as his whole body quakes over you. \"I rarely run, I didn't learn how to ride just to start running. So I'll just head home and finish watching the movie.\" yes, you think YES. \"Oh, you can hang-out here if you want and finish watching it. I don't mind. I'll just be gone about an hour.\" Trevor's body quakes, \"Sure if you and Peter are okay with that.\" You realise this is your chance, but if you deny him now, how will he react later? Dare you risk it? \"It's cool with me.\" you hear yourself say. \"Cool.\" is all Trevor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance you hear Jonathan rummaging about and after a while he say, \"Okay, have fun you two, I'm off.\" And witht that the door opens and closes again. For a few minutes you hear nothing but the TV, but suddenly you hear Trevor taking a deep breath. \"I can't imagine you're still alive under there, I mean, most of my life I've been carefull not to break stuff with my body, it's why I like being around horses, they don't break easily. And you just come along and let me sit on you like it's nothing.\" You can't help but laugh a little, \"Oh, it's definatly not nothing, You're the most intense weight I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.\" This makes Trevor chuckle a little, \"Would you mind if I moved a little? There's an itch just a little below your body I want to scratch.\" You think nothing of it and say, \"Scratch away.\" You were not ready for this instead of moving up to put his fingers under he actually slides heavily over your body using it to scratch himself. Finally after scraping over you about 20 times he plainly sits down again with a sigh. \"Thanks, that was driving me crazy.\" You need a few seconds to catch your breath before you can mutter, \"No problem, happy to help.\" You hear Trevor chuckle, \"Wow, you're really dedicated to your training aren't you.\" You chuckle too, \"Yeah, it's always good to train hard, and often.\" You hear Trevor chuckle again, \"Well if you want me to sit on you again, I'd be more than happy to.\" You can hardly bring yourself to saying it, but you manage, \"Sure, I'd love your help with that.\" You hear a delighted sigh from above. \"Oh any time, cause I would never do this with someone who wouldn't let me, but i feels damn good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin softly at his statement and blurt out. \"It would probably feel even better if you lowered your sweats.\" You slam your mouth closed, but realise it's too late. \"Hm, you mean just with my underwear between us?\" Without asking he sddenly pushes himself up and you feel yourself travelling towards the sky as he lits his ass, just enough to pull down his grey sweats and reveiling a pair of dark green boxerbriefs. Almost immediately the briefs touch your skin as he lowers himself again. \"Oh wow, he says as he's still lowering himself, \"You're right, now I can really feel you.\" Suddenly he clenches his cheeks a bit which pulls the fabric and you a bit deeper into his crack. Then he unclenches and you drop down, but he clenches again. \"This feels really good like an ass massage. Do you mind?\" He doesn'wait for an answer but keeps clenching and unclenching as you stammer, \"Go ahead, it feels like a full body massage for me too.\" Apparantly Trevor thinks you like it a lot as he increases his pace and power clenching and unclenching. Untill suddenly a massive fart escapes his ass, right above you covering you in a raunchy stench. \"Oops, sorry.\" You hear Trevor say, even though he doesn't stop his massage. \"Is that a bit too much?\" You catch your breath even though there's a lot of methane around you. \"It's fine, just don't do that too much.\" After a while he slows down with the clenching, but never really stopping. By then you're getting used to it and strange enough start to enjoy it a little, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seems forever you hear the door open and hear Jonathan's voice, \"Honey, I'm home!\" Slowly Trevor gets up and pulls his pants back up in a swift motion. You take a large gulp of fresh air and couldn't even move if you wanted too. \"Well that's my cue to leave.\" Trevor says, \"Thanks for dinner and saving me a seat.\" He gives you a wink and you wave goodbye. \"No sweats.\" You say before he takes of the receiver, walks over to Jonathan to give him a handshake and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the couch, panting heavily as you see Jonathan closing in, drenched in sweat from his hair to his legs. He looks down on you and grins. \"Someone has been enjoying himself.\" You grin back, \"Yep, Trevor sure did.\" Both of you laugh. Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

You're not sure if he's kidding or not, but before you can figure it out he's turned around and is walking away to his bathroom. You see a small plate of food on your table and hunker it down. Afterwards you return to your bed, you see on your phone you missed some calls from school and have a voicemail. It's the reception about eating in or not and telling you about the app. You install it at once and put the setting on 'eating in unless notified'. After that you fall on your bed and are asleep a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are woken up by your phone as its alarm chimes up. Slowly you get up, take a showe and get dressed. You walk over to the small fridge and open it, seeing it fully stocked with tiny sized products, and you make yourself a breakfast of very fine shredded wheat and milk and a cup of insta-coffee. WIth breakfast in hand you walk out to the balcony and see Jonathan sitting at his table eating too, not in the mood to talk right now, you just sit down and start eating. After your coffee is done you relax a little till Jonathan comes over. \"Ready to go and meet Manuel?\" You give him a nod and he picks you up gently and places you in his chest pocket. You fall in pretty deep and as he starts walking you're bounced again his massive hard pec over and over again. Not uncomfortably hard, just a bit annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk you hear the horses whiney as Jonathan enters the stables. \"Come on over in the back, there's my office.\" Manuel shouts from the other side and Jonathan walks over. Suddenly you hear a familiar whiney. You realise you're passing by Monster. \"Hey, you say, can you show me that horse please.\" You feel Jonathan stoppng and he suddenly reaches in to pick you from his pocket. He places you on the pal of his other hand and shows you the real Monster. All you can see is a large black stallion with bright yellow eyes and a small white mark on his forehead, shaped a little like the M-logo of a brand of energydrink. That would explain the name you guess. As you look into his eyes, you see him looking back and once again he let's out a  \"Wow, he's gourgeous.\" You realise you said it out loud only when Manuel's voice answers, \"Yes he is, but he's broken more bones than there are fish in the sea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shaken aback as you turn to look in manuels face, and it takes you a minute before you notice a small woman sitting on his shoulder. She waves at you and appears to say something, but you can't make it out. \"Bella says high.\" Manuel translates and slowly picks up the little woman and placing her into Jonathans hand next to you. With his other hand he exchanges receivers with Jonathan so you can all talk. \"Hi there.\" Bella says, \"nice to meet another tiny around here. The name's Bella and I've been working with Manny for over ten years now.\" You don't really now what to say, so you just say, \"Nice to meet you Bella, I'm Peter.\" you fall silent for a second before hastily adding, \"Nice to meet you too Manny, erm. I mean Manuel.\" Manuel grins, \"Manny is okay with me, as long as we're in private.\" He walks over to his office and Jonathan follows him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door Manuel gestures to the table where you see to tiny chairs standing prepared. As Jonathan places you and Bella down, you pick one and take a seat. Manuel and Jonathan take the big seats of course. \"So,\" Manuel says, \"you two seem quite relaxed around each other in such a short time.\" Jonathan smiles, \"My adopted sister was a tiny.\" manuel nods and says, \"And you've been working for the CTCI?\" Jonathan gasps and Bella laughs, \"Don't worry, we know because it's where Manny and I met. We've both been with the CTCI for years. Untill we decided to come out here and raise horses that is.\" You shake your head in surprise, \"But aren't you scared being out here?\" She smiles, \"Manny takes good care of me and we've been a little more than good friends for a while now.\" she wiggles her finger and you see a small ring around her finger. Looking up at Manuel you see him showing you an identical one on his. He says, \"That's why we wanted to meet you really, no offence Jonathan, but we wanted to make you see that sometimes tinies and giants can get along just fine.\" Bella nods and adds, \"And to tell you the horses here are pretty much used to having me, a tiny around, and for some reason most of them react very favourable, or even protective to me.\" You nod, \"I always liked horses and they alwa seemed pretty easy going towards me too.\" Bella smiles a warm smile, \"They are really smart and caring, if you know how to handle them. I never had any problems around here, well, except for Monster, he's the only one that tried to trample me.\" She says it so matter-of-factly you can't help but smile.Manuel says, \"It's actually how the horses reacted on Jonathan that told me you were with him yesterday. And well him being able to ride Manella was the dead give-away. She was named after us both as we were the only ones that could ride her together. Man- and -Ella\" You smile at this revelation. Bella turns to Jonathan, you should count yourself lucky he trst you enough for you to carry him around. Don't make him regret it, or I will personally make you regret it.\" It comes out so forcefully that you know you shouldn't laugh, especially when she adds, \"You of all people should know what we're capable of.\" You look p at Jonathan and e looks a little pale. \"Yes Ma-am.\" He stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look back at Bella she's all smiles again. \"you just tell Bella when you feel taken advantage of okay?\" She hands you a cup of tea. \"Oh and many why don't you give Jonathan that old pad we don't use anymore.\" Manuel reaches behind him and hands Jonathan a leather shoulder pad. The top is equiped with some buckles and other grips. \"If Peter feels like riding outside of your chest pocket you can strap this to your shoulder and  he can strap himself to it or just hold on tight. Now off ith you two, you have your first introductionary classes in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan gets up and thanks Manuel and Bella and you do the same, they exchange their receivers and you and Bella exchange a hug.</span></div></div>",

Just as you hear the first bell tolling he runs up the steps and enters a hallway you can hear from the tapping of his boots. A little later just as the second bell tolls he enters a room and you hear a female voice say, \"Cutting it close on your first day Mister...\" Jonathan pants a little and says, \"Daniels miss.\" He picks you from his pocket and. \"Ah,\" the woman says and mister Fernsworth I suppose.\" you nod. \"Speak up boy, these classrooms are designed to link up with your choker so you can take part of the classes.\" You quickly add, \"Yes Miss.\" You hear your voice echo softly in the quiet room. \"Take your seats the woman points to one of the seats near the windo wich has a desk on the desk for you. And an empty desk with a reserved sign next to it it. As Jonathan moves to the desk you see the boy sitting behind your desk is Trevor who gives you a wink. The rest of the boys strain a bit too look at your desk as Jonathan puts you down and you take your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a good looka t the woman in front of the class and she's dressed like a miling maid, right out of the books, she has a firm body and a long flowing skirt. A stern look on her face and greying hair pulled back in a tight bun. However her eyes show a good sense of humour for some reason. \"Good, welcome class, My name is Miss Tucker. Today will be the first day of your education here. I will be teaching you everything you need to know about English, Math and biology, especially that concerning horses. I will not allow chicanary in any form and I will not stand for any bullying of any of your classmates, no matter their size. So no-one is gonna pick on mister Pullocks for being a giant of a man or on mister Gripli for his already greying hair. Understood.\" This speech leads to a soft laughter. And you notice the woman giving you a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now as you are all aware, for some reason this school has decided that the small amount of tiny citizens we harbour do not justify a special sports team, yet. We have the pleasure of adding one of these to our team. Mister Fernsworth if you would please stand up.\" You do as you're being told and turn to face the rest of the class. \"Anything you want to say?\" Miss Tucker asks. You take a deep breath and here your voice over the speakers in the classroom. \"I want to thank you for having me on your team and will try my best to... well... actually to not embarrash you is probably my safest bet.\" This nets you a soft laughter and you look around, noticing the 25 people in the class that are all about as cowboy like as you can imagine, strong rugged, manly boys, suntanned and most a bit scruffy. \"That will be all for now Mister Fernsworth, please take your seat so we can begin. Open up your mathbooks to chapter three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours are spent on mathematical problems, which you ease right through, you do realise some of your classmates have a little trouble. Especially Trevor seems completely lost when it comes to some of the more intricate problems. After a while miss Tucker passes by and hands Trevor an earpiece. She pushes a button on a remote. And holds her hand in front of you. As you climb on she passes you to Trevor's table. \"Maybe mister Fernsworth can help you out. I put you off speaker for now, so please explain to him how you solved the problem.\" Without a second thought you move closer to Trevor into the shadow of his massive chest and follow the notes he took. After a few seconds you walk over to the part he made a mistake and explain it to him. Trevor actually listens really well and after just a few more tries solves the problem and smiles. \"Wow, thanks a lot Peter, now I get it.\" He says it loud enough for the class to hear it. And you get a few more interested glances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Tucker comes back and looks over Trevor's notes, \"Very good, now mister Pullocks I imagine you'll know who to ask for help tutoring if you get stuck on one of those problems again.\" You take a quick look at Miss Tucker as she really gives you a wink before placing you back on your own desk. \"Thank you, you mouth to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bell rings again, you expect most of the team to rush out, but most of them just stand up and some move in closer to your desk. One by one your teammates come to sort of shake your hand and introduce themselves, but you get lost after a few names, Mark, Matt, Tom, Jason. It's a bit too much. But all of them appear friendly although some are a litle more rough than others. ntil after a while all 23 have passed and moved outside, Leaving only you, Trevor, Jonathan and Miss Tucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" miss Tucker says, \"That seems to have gone quite well, don't you agree?\" You nod and say, 'Yes thank you miss, and thanks Trevor for your acting in not getting the problem.\" Trevor grins at you, \"Don't mention it Peter, although I must admit, I wasn't acting. I really suck at math.\" Miss tucker makes a clucking sound, \"Yes you do mister Pullocks, I saw your grades and you barely passed. I expect you to do a lot better this year and if mister Fernsworth is willing to help you out, I would be very gratefull.\" You nod, \"I don't mind, you know where my room is and well, I'm not the guy you will see out partying late with the guys anyway.\" Miss Tucker nods, \"Good, maybe we can see two miracles this year, getting you through alive and having Mister Pullocks get a B- at least.\" You feel a lump in your throat after hearing the first part of that sentence. But before you can react Jonathan scoop you up and moves you to his pocket, as he walks out he takes you to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a little walk you smell wax, tanning fluids and a lot of different nose-assailing smells, as Jonathan enters the workshop where they make the gear and saddles. He pulls you out and places you on one of the tables, there's no seat here and you stand on a table surrounded by eight of your classmates, who glance at you and look away when they think you notice. A large bearded man enters and tosses some gear on each table, you duck out of the way just in time. \"Oops Sorry there little man, I didn't see you there, It will take some getting used to for me.\" next he addresses the Class, \"The name's Peter.\" You can't hide a slight grin. \"And today you'll be checking these britles and straps for faults. If I did my work right there aren't any, the one that finds one will get the entire class an automatic A and you can leave early. Now get to it. Suddenly the boys all maniacally reach for the pile of stuff. \"one of the guys, Matt, gives you a wink and places one of the gears a bit to the side for you to look over. It takes you a long time to walk from one end to the other and you can't notice a flaw. You see most of the boys pull on the straps and realise you could never do that. You notice Matt has done the pulling test and is starting to look over the metal pieces. You wave at him, \"Wanna trade.\" Matt gets your  trouble and switches, as you look over his bridle he pulls on the straps of yours as hard as he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour you're on your third piece of gear and suddenly you notice something in the bridle. A very, very tiny chip seems to be missing and you move in closer. You're sure of it. You wave at Matt and ask him to call big Peter. As the bearded man stomps over, \"Oh so the little man thinks he's a master metal worker now.\" You wave at the receiver Jonathan placed at the end of the table and Peter puts it on. \"Mister Peter sir, my name is Peter Fernsworthm not little man. And there's a chip in this brittle, very tiny, but it has a few hairline fractures. If a horse bites down on it to hard and often, it might crack and injure the poor animals mouth. That's what you asked us to point out.\" Big Peter picks up the bridle and looks at it very closely. After a intense look he takes a looking glass from his belt and uses it to look again, \"Well, I'll be damned.\" He puts away the looking glass and holds up the bridle. \"Guess what, Mister Peter Fernsworth has won you the rest of the day off and your first A.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected this nets you a large cheer and most of the guys high-five each other as they walk out of the damp room. Matt gives you a wink and says, \"Nice working with you, Peter and great job.\" before turning and leaving. Big Peter leans down and says, \"Well I guess it can be quite usefull to have a Tiny Citizen around, cause you're right, this could have ended up a disaster for a horse one day. Next time I'll make sure to keep some of the smaller stuff seperate for you to check over, while the boys work on the straps. Now go celebrate.\" You look back and notice Trevor waiting for you, Jonathan nowhere in side. You walk over to the the big guy and he gently picks you up, \"Matt had to run an errand, he asked me to take you back to your room, if you wanted too. Or we could grab some lunch with the rest of the team?</span></div></div>",

After a little walk you suddenly hear someone shouting Trevor's name and you hear someone running up. \"Hey Trevor.\"You recongise Matt's voice. \"Hey Matt\" trevor answers, affirming your thought. \"So, I just ran into Jonathan and he told me to tell the rest you'd probably take Peter back to his room for lunch. That he probably wasn't feeling up to meeting the whole school.\" You blink, \"Trevor give Matt the receiver will you?\" Trevor opens his palm and you see him handing Matt the receiver, \"Sorry Matt, it's not you or the rest of the guys, but a big room with over 200 students just doesn't feel like the safest place for me.\" Matt grins, and this time you take a good look at him. Just a boy next door type, slender hips, not overly muscled, but still pretty toned, a bit of a swimmers body you think. But with bright blue eyes and a tossled dirty blond hair from wearing his hat. \"I completely understand, so do the others,\"bhe holds up a bag of food, \"So we decided we should join you for lunch one or two at the time and today I volunteered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're flabbergasted at this. Your teammates are actually trying to make you feel welcome. \"Sure, that would be nice, Tell trevor you're coming with us and that there's another reciever in our room.\" You hear Matt repeat your words and the fingers close around you as Trevor and Matt finish the homestretch. Suddenly you hear a door open and a few moments later You are put down on the large dining table. Matt starts unpacking all of the food and Trevor finds the second receiver. \"Wow, it all looks great Matt.\" say. Mat gets two plates and a saucer and sts down, \"Just point at which ings you want a piece off.\" You point at a cherry pastry a piece of bread, some soft cheese and a strawberry. Matt carefully breaks of some pieces and places them on the saucer. He slides it over and says, \"Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few minutes you are all just busy stuffing your face. You notice Matt glancing down at you a few times, but decide to ignore it for now. Finally after a while he suddenly asks, \"I don't think it's fair they make you tinies play sports with us. Just so you know. And most of our guys think about it the same way. But after today we realised one thing.\" He remains silent for dramatic effect, \"We might actually have an edge against the other teams.\" You can't help but blush at this. \"Dont be shy,\" Matt continues, \"You did some amazing work today. There are more than a few of us that lack in some form of education and we figure you might actually be more brains than brawns, no offence.\" You smirk, \"Some taken...\" which makes Trevor laugh softly, \"And that thing with the bridle, Do you know what could have happened to a rider when that thing cracked in a horses mouth. None of us would have been able to spot that. And Manuel told us yesterday in the stables we should feel lucky with a tiny on our team as horses apparantly like your kind.\" You cringe a little, \"You make me sound more like a mascot than anything else.\" Matt clses his mouth with an audible clack. \"That's not how I ment it. I'm sorry, I'm not the best with words. Jason would have explained it so much better.\" He sighs, \"It's just that we want you to feel part of the team and wanna insure you that you can always come to us for help too.\" You notice he's plucking his hand with his fingers a lot while he's talking. \"Need some help?\" You ask? \"Nah,\" he says, \"Just a little splinter, but it's to deep to get my nails under.\"You get up and walk closer to Matt, \"Don't be a wuss and let me help.\" Matt places his hand on the table and you climb up. You see the splinter immediatly and bend down grasping it with both hands easily and with a hard pull it comes out easily. \"There we go.\" you say. And you see Matt grinning down at you. \"See another point for you.\" You climb down and say, \"you would;ve gotten it eventually.\" Matt chuckles. \"Still, we're just so amazed how brave you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, \"Brave?\" Matt nods, \"Sure, like just now, almost ordering me to let you look at my hand, or earlier with big Pete. And this morning when Miss Tucker put you near him,\" he points at Trevor, \"You didn't even flinch.\" You grin, \"We met yesterday already, so I wasn't that scary.\" Matt shakes his head, \"Stop talking yourself down, it's annoying. Even the fact you didn't just quit school but joined the rodeo-team, off all teams. That's brave too.\" You shake your head, \"Please stop, fine I'm a little brave.\" Trevor chimes in, \"I agree with the rest, you've got some major cajones.\" You give him a stare, \"You just stay out of this...\" Trevor just grins. \"Still, thank you Matt, I really appreciate everything you and the team are doing for me. I was really worried about coming here, bt it's good to know I've got a team of bodyguards ready to pounce any jocky or poloplayer that might think of pulling something.\" Matt smiles, \"Pleasure will be all ours, besides, it was nice working with you in class today, I much rather test the leather than look at the metal, so we made a good team.\" He starts to clean up and makes some coffee. Apparantly the central cupboard also has some cups in your size and the three of you enjoy a nice cup of coffee, before Matt gets up. \"Thanks for having me guys, now I think I'm gonna go and see the horses for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Matt leaves the room and suddenly it's just you and Trevor.</span></div></div>",

I guess that's a good thing.\" Trevor nods, \"Yep and I think it's great they want to meet you in private like this.\" You nod too, \"I agree, so just a quick question, where did Jonathan run of too?\" Trevor shrugs, \"He had to get soemthing in town, so he's probably not back till late, he got special permission to leave the grounds, but it's at least a three hour drive, one way.\" You grin, \"Guess I've got the whole place to myself for a while, nice. Now I can walk around naked.\" you both laugh at that. \"Well if you want me to keep you company.\" Trevor says with a grin. You get an eerie feeling, \"You're welcome to hang out. with me.\" Trevor gives you a wink, \"With you? or on you?\" There it is, you think. \"Do you have a preference?\" He only nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can hang-out on me. Just be sure to get up in time, before Jonathan gets back. I don't know if he would approve of you sitting on me so soon again.\" Trevor grins, \"Will do, but can I ask you something a bit weird?\" You shrug, \"Can it get weirder?\" He nods, \"I'm going commandoes today. My underwear is still in the mail, I forgot to pack it.\" You Shake your head. \"I don't get it.\" He grins a bit ashamed, \"Well I don't wanna sit on you in jeans, but I don't wanna sit on Jonathan's couch naked.\" You feel that he's trying to tell you something, but you just don't get it. \"Please Trevor, just say it, cause I really don't get it.\" Suddenly Trevor looks away as he says, I wanna put you in between my jeans and my ass.\" Your mouth drops, slowly Trevor turns back to look at you and you get a hold of yourself. you remember Jonathan saying something about getting used to scents and stuff, and then again, it's Trevor, he's a good guy... right. His eyes almost pleadingly await your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not, just be sure to massage me a little when I'm down there.\" Trevor wastes very little time in getting up, almost knoking over his chair. As he unbuckles his pants, loosens the button and unzips. Before you can even catch a glimpse of his front, he already lifts you up and lowers you down the now somewhat loose back of the pants. Slowly he positions you near the bottom of his crack. With his free hand he hoists up his pants to keep you in place as he pulls his hand back. Quickly he pulls up his zipper and you hear him redo his belt. You feel his hand on your back and you say. \"Can you push me in a little deeper before you start moving, I don't wanna slip out before you take a seat.\" At once a powerfull push smacks you into his crack wiggling you in deep enough so you are indeed pretty much stuck. \"That'll do.\" You say, but as you open your mouth you feel a bit of sweat drip on your tongue and almost gag. Five steps are all Trevor needs to get to the couch, four steps is all it take for his mighty but to actually squeeze around you and lock you so tightly into place you wish you were just in the pouched underwear. Why didn;t you let Trevor put on one of Jonathans boxer-briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar more quickly than yesterday Trevor sits down on the couch squeezing you in even tighter and he puts his feet up and the TV on.As the promised massage he slowly clenches and unclenches his ass, but in your current position this is a bit more hazardous as you get pulled in deeper, but there's no fabric pushing you back out. Untill after a few minutes your head suddenly pops into a somehwat larger area, And you realise you're now so deep in his crack you actually passed the spheric muscles. Looking forward you smell a strong musky odour stronger than sweat and realise you're actually staring through the dark at Trevor's asshole. \"mmm,\" You hear Trevor say, \"you feel pretty good wedged in there, is it still fine for you?\" I'm not gonna back down you think, \"Sure, no worse than yesterday, maybe even a little more room to breath.\" Yeah, Breath in your rank hole, you think. \"Okay,\" Trevor says \"just tell me when it gets to be too much,\" You wanna scream that it's too much, but you Keep your mouth clenched shut. \"Will do, you just sit back and relax.\" You hear Trevor chuckle, \"Oh the relaxing part will be no problem at all.\" He stays silent for a few minutes before he adds, \"Just to be sure, you're really okay with this?\" You sigh, \"I could stay here all day, we don't have any homework yet, so there's really nothing better to do.\" You feel Trevor laugh, his cheeks clenching against you and you slip just a little deeper. \"okay, than don't be mad if I keep you there for a little while.\" You wonder, \"You enjoy feeling me in here?\" Trevor thinks about it, \"Yeah, it feels good keeping you safe with my body,\" He adds with a chuckle, \"even if it is just my ass. And well, It also doesn't bite feeling something warm and squishy between my cheeks.\" You think, \"So it's not just a power-trip?\" Trevor laughs again softly, \"Just a little bit I suppose. Does that bother you?\" You think on it and take a deep breath, Trevor's smell isn't actually all that bad. \"No, not really, I know you wouldn't hurt me on purpose. So giving you a little power, for a lot of protection is a fair deal.\" Trevor laughs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happens, that fatal clench that shoves your face against Trevor's warm and somewhat quivering hole. You feel a soft mucus coating your face and as you open your mouth the bitter taste finds its way to your tongue. It tastes like nothing you ever tasted before, the texture is awfull, the bitterness all empowering and after a few more mouthfulls you realise...</span></div></div>",

Although you shouldn't worry too much as he is currently enjoying the tv. It takes you several more slow licks to clean away most of it in front of your face. And you realise that it's strangely filling stuff, you feel like you just had a six course meal. Although the fact your stomach is squished up by his cheeks probably doesn't leave enough room for much food. Wait, did you just think of the slime as food? Suddenly you hear Trevor say, \"Hold on, I'm gonna shift a little.\" And he suddenly slides forward, stretching his muscles and scqueezing you tighter in the proces, Also his hole is coming down rapidly till it smashes right in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now way to scared to move a muscle, you figure even the smallest movement will give your delicate position away and you are not completely sure how Trevor would react. You'd think he would probably pull you out a little more, but then again, he hasn't been that considerate today, so he might just shove you in even further. And if you're sure of one thing at least, you're not interested in investigating someone's colon. From above you hear Trevor stiffling a yawn and you mumble through your clenched teeth, \"Yeah I figure sitting like this, really takes it out of you.\" Trevor chuckles, \"Sorry, it's just that I'm so nice and comfortable.\" For a while the two of you just sit there. Slowly the strong musky scent is making you feel a little light-headed, not in a bad way, just a little high. The both of you are startled by a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Trevor gets up, this thankfully puls you back from his hole a little. As he starts walking you feel his ass grind on our body. But he soon stops and opens the door. \"Jason?\" you hear Trevor ask? \"Oh good,\" Jason answers, \"You're here.\" You hear him pant a little, As Trevor steps aside, you hear Jason entering the room. \"Is Peter here?\" Trevor closes the door, \"Yeah, he's taking a nap. He said running around with the big guys is really tiring.\" You hear Jason laugh, \"Yeah, he must have had a 10 mile hike in class checking out those equipments while we just stood and pulled.\" Trevor hesitates, \"Should we wake him, is it important?\" Jason remains quiet for awhile, Trevor takes to steps and sits down again, On Jonathans bed you notice as you get the familiar sensation of sinking into the mattress. Jason speaks up, \"No, maybe it's best he doesn't know just yet.\" Trevor leans forward, making you barely kiss his hole again \"Knows what?\" Jason sighs, \"During lunch some of the Jockey's were talking about him.\" Jason makes a strangled sound. \"They were making a bet on who would be the first to be able to ride the 'special saddle'\" Trevor asks, \"Special saddle?\" Jason sighs, \"Well apparantly it's a saddle that has some 'added padding' for the groin, a 'tiny' bit of padding they called it.\" Trevor gasps, \"They wouldn't dare.\" You feel yourself getting really scared and on the other hand, you start to feel really safe down here in Trevor's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It get's worse.\" Jason says, \"Matt overheared the polo players talking about how nothing fills up your jockstrap as a tiny woman, but if there's no woman available a tiny man could suffice.\" Jason grunts in anger. \"Great, so those guys really do wanna torture Peter.\" Jason answers \"I'm afraid so. That's why I decided to come over here till Jonathan returned, I think it's best for Peter not to be alone for extended periods of time.\" You hear Jason sigh, \"At least not for the time being, maybe this all proves to be nothing but big talk and all, but still.\" Jason suddenly stands up. \"I agree, we shouldn't let him be taken by one of those assholes.\" You think to yourself, hear who's talking. But keep quiet. Jason says, \"True that, we decided we should make up a kind of a schedule, some of the guys volunteered to look after Peter a few times a week.\" Trevor asks, \"Some?\" Jason laughs, \"Yeah, some of us really want to help him, but are way to scared to actually hurt the little guy. So they asked not to be included for now. They'll help out if necessary, but don't want to take responsibility on keeping him safe.\" Trevor laughs too, \"Okay, I get that. So how do we do this?\" Jason answers, \"Tonight after dinner we thought the volunteers could meet here and discuss the situation with Jonathan, and I guess you're gonna volunteer too?\" You feel revor quaking with anger as he utters his catchphrase: \"Hell yeah!\" You can't help but grin. \"So why don't you let me take over watching him, till Jonathan comes home?\" Jason asks, and you flinch. \"Just let me get some books from my room and I'll be back in a minute.\" This seems to good an oppurtunity and you whisper....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You should say yes, or it might look suspicious.\" you whisper in your most innocent tone. Trevor clenches softly as a sign of understanding. \"Sure thing\" he says, \"I was hoping to get some time to work-out this afternoon.\" Jason grunts, \"Just gimme 5 minutes. And you hear him walking, and a door opening and closing. Almost immediatly you hear Trevor ndoing his belt and pants. and soon enough you feel a finger scraping you out of his ass. \"Oy, you were pretty deep in there.\" he chuckles as he moves you over to your little apartment.\" You shrug, \"I don't know, it really feels all the same to me.\" Trevor gives you a slight wink, \"Well I can tell you that it did make a difference for me, so thanks little buddy. Now quickly go freshen up and pretend to be napping, or just waking up or something.\" You nod and run into the sleeping part of your house, you quikly change out of your dirty clothes, hop in the shower just a second to get your skin wet, run out, pet yourself dry, put on a pair of sweats and a shirt and jump into bed. Just as a knock on the door announces Jason's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Trevor opening the door and saying, \"Receivers are on the table by the coach, you can put one on now, or when he wakes up. Thanks for this, I owe you one.\" And with that the door closes, leaving you alone with Jason. You hear him walking over to the couch and sitting down. As you look on your phone you realise you've been under Trevor for over 2 hours, so if you pretended to take a nap, you might as well wake up. You tossle your hair a little more, rub your eyes a bit till you feel them puffing p a little and get up. Trying to move slowly you walk over to the balcony and you see Jason sprawling on the couch reading a book. His back towards you. You do notice he put on a receiver, So you stretch out as you walk onto the balcony, \"that was a good nap, Trevor?\" You stop as you see Jason sitting up, \"Wait... Jason?\" Jason gives you a crooked smile. \"Not who you were expecting Peter?\" You blink and hold your hand up to the light as if it bothers you. \"Not really no? When I went for my nap Trevor was here and well, you're not him.\" Jason laughs a little, \"I knew you were a smart one.\" You stiffle a mock yawn. \"So what's this, everyone gets to hang out in my room now?\" Jason laughs, \"Well, at least we get to meet less officially now.\" He slowly pulls his legs up on the couch in some makeshift lotus position as he sits sideways looking at you, \"So, hi again, I'm Jason, I like horses, Books and Yoga, I'm a vegetarian and I come from a long line of proud cattledrivers.\" He waits for you, \"Yeah, this isn't awkward,\" you mumble, \"I'm Peter, I like horses too, I read everything worth reading that comes in my size, which isn't a lot actually, I'm not really into sports as you might have guessed, although living around giants means running a marathon on a daily base anyway. My main goal in life is to survive and I come from a proud family of Tiny Citizens, the first kid to get into college.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grins at you, \"Well, all awkwardness aside, that was a nice introduction. Guess your parents are really proud of you?\" You blink, \"They're actually scared to death I won't get back alive.\" You and Jason both laugh, \"Well,\" he says, \"My pa is just sad his only son decided he needed an education, leaving my sisters to take over the family business. I think I never saw him that mad, or see my mom cry before.\" He suddenly looks a little gloomy, \"Still my sisters approved, they always said I was too smart to hang around. And well reading is just not something we cattle-people do.\" You nod, \"Yeah, you should have heared my folks when I told them I was gonna join the rodea-team and moving out to this place. They threatened to pull me out of school, just to make me stay in the city. And well, in the city it's not much better for us, at least here you kind of know who your friends and enemies are. And you can get to know everyone pretty quick.\" Jason nods, \"Yeah, I like how it feels like a small commune, it's so much better than the clutter of the city. And I kind of like being able to just walk out and be, you know outside.\" You give him a smirk, \"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that. I could get lost in a patch of high-grass let alone between the trees.\" Jason sighs and leans back rolling down in a fluid motion laying his head on the armrest furthest from you. Bending one leg at the knee and crossing the other over it giving you a close look at his long and toned legs and his round and firm buttocks. \"Being outside is one of the best things, maybe if you want I could take you into the forest sometime to show you how marvelous everything is when you're not scared of getting hopelessly lost.\" You sigh, \"I think I would enjoy that, someday.\" </span></div></div>",

But it's more of a pressing matter.\" You shrug, \"What else is new, what's going on.\" Jason stays silent for a while and takes a deep breath, \"Well, you know how some people feel about tiny citizens like you?\" You nod, \"That we don't belong, that we're a pest or even worse, that we're only there for their pleasures.\" Jason blinks in surprise, \"I guess that kinda sums it up.\" He glances at the ceiling looking for the right words, \"So there are a few groups of people here that, kinda have a contest going on who can use you first.\" You blink in mock-surprise. \"Use me?\" Jason nods, \"As a saddle or in a jockstrap to be precise.\" You can't help it you burst out in laughter. \"And here we go again,\" you can finally say. Jason looks a bit baffled. \"You're not scared shit-less?\" You shrug, \"This kinda stuff happens to us all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leans a bit forward, \"You realise you could die?\" You give him a grin, \"Nah, we don't die that easily. I guess that's the fun part for some of those people.\" Jason blinks, \"What do you mean, you'd die if someone sat on you right?\" You shake your head, \"Nope, it won't be fun, or pleasant most of the time, but it won't kill me, probably.\" Jason leans back a little, \"You're kidding? You've been sat on before?\" You nod, \"Sat on, Stepped on, you name it.\" Jason blinks again, \"You're kidding me, you're actually kidding with me?\" You just shake your head. Jason seems astounded, \"Wait, you're telling me that if you fell down from that balcony on the couch and I wouldn't notice and sit down you would actually survive?\" You nod, \"Without a doubt.\" Jason shakes his head, \"That's impossible.\" You sigh, \"Why is it so hard to believe, you think I turned 18 under a rock or something? I walked around giants before and well, accidents happen.\" You see Jason shaking his head still and suddenly it annoys you. Without thinking twice you climb over the edge of the balcony and jump, the fall is a litte farther than you expected, but you land safely on the couch. Jason squeals a little as he sees you drop, but you get up again soon enough before he can reach for you. \"Just do it if you don't believe me. You might as well figure out a little more about me if you wanna keep me safe. I trust you not to hurt me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Jason looking down on you with a mix of confusion and curiousity. \"How does this work?\" You throw your hands in the air, \"Do I need to tell you how to sit?\" Jason laughs at that, \"Not that, but do I keep my pants on or do I lower them so I'm just wearing my undies.\" You shrug, \"Both are fine, although for me just undies is a little less uncomfortable.\" Jason nods and stands up to undo his pants. \"And what part of me should be on you?\" You blink, \"Whatever you want.\" Suddenly Jason turns around. \"Okay, Guess I'm gonna place my root chackra over you.\" You wonder for a second? \"Your what now.\" But you see the small piece of skin between his ass and sack coming down rapidly. As is makes contact you are squished deep against the couch and his flesh as he sinks down on you. The musky sweaty smell of his taint fills your lungs. \"Right, that part.\" You mumble. \"Oh wow,\" Jason says, \"you can still talk?\" You smirk, \"Yeah, just don't ask me to a little dance, cause I'm down tonight.\" You feel Jason pulling up his legs again. \"I can actually feel your energy under me.\" You smirk again, \"As I can feel your weight on top of me.\" Jason sits still for a few seconds, \"Is it okay for me to meditate like this for a while? I mean it feels strange, so I wanna get a good sense of the vibrations.\" What the hell is this guy on? you wonder. \"Oh sure, don't mind me.\" You feel your sarcastic tone didn't connect. as Jason suddenly slows and deepens his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact his muscles relax isn't so bad, the fact this means he's sinking down into the couch more and more, with you under him, that's bad. Also you feel a strange tucking sensation in your stomach, like someone is sucking on your bellybutton. the weirdes part of it, is that it's mostly negative feelings that seem to be drawn up into Jason's taint. You never believed all that meditation, chakra or aura business, but for some reason you realise this might actually be what it feels like to have your aura clenched. You wonder how long a meditation is gonna take, but are afraid to ask. You don't wanna disturb Jason like this, feeling that would be a bad move. So you jus lay there thinking about fresh air and freedom. After a long while and you figre you can take no more of this, Jason suddenly utters a long sigh. \"Wow, that was intense.\" You feel him stretching his legs and he stands up in a fluid motion, which doesn't show he's been sitting for a while. He puts his pants back on and turns around offering you his had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb on it expecting him to put you back on the balcony but he turns around and sits down, cradling his hands under you as he holds you in his lap. \"I like meditating outside, feeling the energy of the earth refresh me, and I did have some body to body meditation before, which felt even better, but this was just, like licking a battery. How do you feel?\" You think on that and answer, \"Quite well rested actually and well, I don't feel so anxious as I normally do.\" Jason grins, \"Good to hear, I thought you might get some energy back from me too. If you ever feel like you wanna try some more meditation-excersises just let me know.\" You answer honestly, \"I think I will, thanks.\" Jason grins, \"Just please don't tell the others I'm actually a bit of a spiritual person, I don't think most would understand.\" You grin, \"Sorry to break it to you, but I don't understand either, but if it works for you, your secret is safe with me. If you promise to never tell the others what just happened here.\" Jason laughs, that's a deal.</span></div></div>",

Guess we'll have ourselves a team-meeting after dinner?\" Jason grunts affirmingly, \"So guess we should get some food in our faces beforehand.\" Jonathan grins, \"I already had some on the drive over, so go ahead. Peter's dinner will be here shortly.\" At that moment a knock on the door indeed tells you your food has arrived. \"See you an hour or so.\"Jason says and lets the help in on his way out. \"Dinner for Peter.\" You hear and a young man rolls in a cart with only one tiny platter. He places it gently on your balcony table and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise your pretty hungry and dig in, some form of rice, a few strips of chicken and something mashed, you guess beans. After your done you look up and see Jonathan unpacking a box full of weird looking stuff. \"What's you got there?\" you ask. Jonathan turns and holds up some stuff, you recognise none of it, but after seeing the pad Manuel gave you you see some resemblences, shoulder path, hip pockets with belt, a strap for across the chest and more. \"Mom's carepackage has arrived.\" He says with a smile. \"Oh and there's something for you too. \"He hands you a small bag attached to a long string to make it easy for Jonathan to hand it over. You take a look at the card, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take care of my little brother and here, have a cookie!\"<br>\r\n\"M.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up the bag and see an assortment op cookies, probaly baked by Molly. You pick out a chocolate one and eat it. \"Oh wow, your sis is a great baker.\" Jonathan grins, \"She sure is, but the bites are alway a little small for my taste.\" He sit down on the couch and chows done a giant sized cookie. \"So what's your take on all of this, scared?\" You shrug and pick out a hazelnut cookie. \"Not really, just not sure if I should be more scared about the polo-players, the jockey's or my protectors.\" Jonathan laughs, \"I understand completely, best intentions of keeping you close might end up with you actually being in more danger from them than from the others.\" You nod, \"Exactly.\" Jonathan leans back. \"So for now it's me, Trevor, Matt, Jonas and Tom, apparantly. You met Matt and Jonas today, Tom is okay too I think.\" You think, \"he's the greying kid right?\" Jonathan nods, \"Yep that's the one. Still apparantly he's the fastest of us all and has energy to spare.\" You sigh, \"I know it's probably easier for you to have some people to share the burden of me with, so if these guys are willing to help out, we should let them.\" Jonathan glances at you, \"Hey now, stop saying things like that, you're not a burden okay! The school put us all in an awkward position, but I'm actually glad to have a tiny roommate, gives me a homey feeling.\" You give him a thankfull look and he grins, \"And if I ever think you're becoming a burden I'll just turn you into my underwear for a day or so, till I can deal with you again.\" You grin at this, you hope, joke and answer, \"Sure, but you'll just call it training purposes.\" He starts laughing and you join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan?\" you asks as he starts on his next cookie, \"What did you mean yesterday, when you came home from your run and told me you'd have me smell your pits another day?\" Jonathan nearly chokes on his cookie. He coughs up some crums and takes a deep breath, \"Oh jeez, you didn't think I was serious about that right?\" You shrug, \"Well, I don't know, it would seem all too fitting with that program you told me about, getting used to smells and stuff.\" He gives you a smile, \"Don't worry, even if it's part of the program, doesn't mean I'd just stuff you in my pits after a run like that.\" You give him a grin, \"So it IS part of the program.\" He blinks, \"Okay, you got me, yes eventually it is a part of the REGULAR program to smell most parts of your human trainer. In preperation of spending a certain amount of time on his or her body. But never after such a hard work-out. I mean you could've drowned in there.\" He chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan?\" you ask after a while, \"What did Bella mean, by you knowing what she would be capable of?\" Jonathan turns to you and grins. \"Some tinies are actually the most effective assassins around.\" You blink, \"Assassins?\" He nods, \"Think about it, you can enter a lot of places without being noticed and there's enough things a tiny can do to kill a man. Cutting a vein as he sleeps, drugging his food, or even injecting him with small doses of extremely effective poison.\" You look at Jonathan with an amazed look. \"You don't think Bella...\" He nods, I wouldn't be surprised if our Bella is actually the woman assassin that worked for the TCI called Belladonna. With Manuel being her partner and transport.\" You blink again, \"And we just let her offer us tea... How stupid are we.\" Jonathan an you share a laugh at that, when there's a knock at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jonathan gets up to open it, you run into your kitchen to put away the rest of the cookies as you hear several voices and feet enter the room. When you walk out on the balcony again you see five man sitting in a circle of couch and chairs. Jonathan placed a kind of Blue-tooth speaker on the center of the table. \"What's that? you ask, you voice returning to you from the speaker.\" Jonathan looks at you and says, \"Does that answer your question?\" You nod, looking to your right you notice Matt is sitting on the couch next to the balcony and he gives you a wink. On the other side a chair is put up where the grey-haired Tom is sitting. He raises his hand in a wave with a grin and you wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Jonathan says \"Guess we all know what we're here for, so let's get straight to it. We're not gonna let the Jockeys, The polos or anyone beside us get their hands on our team-mate.\" The guy roar in affirmation. \"But, to do this, we need to find a way to keep an eye on him.\" You chime in a little loud through the speakers, \"But I don't wanna be a burden to any of you, just saying.\" Suddenly Tom leans over and gives you a Toothpaste commercial smile, \"You're not a burden to any of us, you're our team-mate. And most of us come from tight families that take care of their own. And well our little group of 25 is our new family and you're just as much part of that as me, or any of the others.\" This speech gets a lot of affirming grunts and a 'Hell Yeah!' from Trevor. \"Thanks Tom,\" you say, \"And the rest of you too of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening is filled with Jonatha showing some of the carrying gear he got send by his mother and explaining how it works. And there's a lot of discussion in how to always have someone looking out for you, talk about sleeping with some of the others, Like Hell No!, you think. And you're happy to hear Jonathan explain there actually is a roll-away bed under your apartment for sleep-overs. Suddenly everything seems arranged and the guys just lean back, relaxing. Suddenly Matt sits up and says, \"I need some fresh air, Anyone up for an evening stroll?\"</span></div></div>",

Matt gives you a grin and picks the shoulderpad Manuel gave to Jonathan of the table and straps it on. \"Saddle up, Peter.\" He holds his shoulder close enough for you to climb on and you get to the top and put the straps around your thighs and middle that will keep you in place. \"Heigh-ho Silver.\" You say with a grin and Tom answers, \"I think I would be Silver, he would be... strawberry.\" The guys all laugh at this as Matt gets up, it starts out a little shaky, but as he walks to the door you already get in the rhytm. \"Wait,\" Jonathan says and tosses Matt one of the receivers. \"Don't forget this.\" Matt catches and puts it on. \"All set.\" And he opens the door and walk down the stairs out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you take a long deep breath, it's just about the last few minutes of twilight and the world around you looks dark and mysterious. \"Normally I would never go out this late.\" You say more to yourself than to Matt, but he answer anyway, \"I love the night. I think everything is just so much more peacefull when the sun has gone down.\" Matt takes you for a tour around the dorms but as the sun goes down you feel a little chilly, \"Jeez, it's cold up here.\" Matt doesn't seem bothered but looks at you. \"Want me to take you back? Or should put you somewhere a little warmer.\" You nod, \"A little warmer would be nice.\" matt looks down and you notice he's wearing a plain T-shirt and a pair of short. \"Oh, he says, I'm afraid I don't have many places. I guess the only place would be my back pocket, If that's not okay I'll just take you back.\" You think for a second, \"I think that's fine, I'm not ready to go back yet and well, Maybe I can peer out and see everything you pass instead of everything your walking towards.\" Matt gives you a warm smile and holds you gently as you undo the straps, before lowering you to his back pocket. slowly he lowers you in. It's pretty deep but you can grab on to the edge and pull it down just enough to hold your head out a little. As Matt starts walking again the pocket shifts a bit from side to side and the material stretches tighter around his left cheek when he steps forward, but not uncomfortably so. \"You mind if I take the long way back around the pastures?\" He asks you, \"it will take about an hour or so?\" You actually feel warmth radiating against your back from his ass, so you're far from cold. \"Sure, lead the way, I'm right behind you.\" Matt laughs at your wordplay<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you given any thought on the riding classes tomorrow? How you're gonna cope with that?\" You sigh, \"Not really, I'm still amazed I made it through my first day.\" Matt chuckles, \"I get that. Still I think it would be wise to think ahead a little too. Like what  will you do after graduation, or how to even get there. One wrong move you didn't think of could end you up with the Jockey's and there special saddle for gods now how long. Or with the polo-players, stuffing you down their jocks till they get fed up and toss you out, or just hand you down to the next generation.\" You shudder, \"Not really feeling comforted here Matt.\" He gasps, \"Oh, Sorry, it's just I think things through to much at times. And have this nasty habit of speaking my thoughts. I got that from my crazy aunt Ida, she used to do it all the time when she was nursing me back to health after I broke my leg, she always talked to herself too, and spoke every thought out loud. I learned not to do it in front of others again after finding out they thought it was weird.\" you grin, \"Kinda like your doing now?\" He skips a step, \"Oh, right, sorry, it's just why I take long walks sometimes, to let myself be able to talk out loud and clear my thoughts. My dad always told me to take a hike when I started talking to myself, so for some reason in my mind those two are linked in a way. It's why I normally talk these walks by myself, not that I'm not thankfull for the company, it's just something new I need to learn how to cope with. You know, not being alone most of the time, being in class, having a roommate, that kind of stuff.\" Man he can ramble you think, \"Don't worry Matt, I don't think you're crazy, well at least no crazier than me, I used to talk to myself a lot too when I was still in the main building, because there were very few tinies and they didn't have senders and receivers there for some reason. So noone could here me anyway.\" Matt laughs a little, \"I wonder if this is what people mean with talking out of your ass. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.\" But you're already laughing at the joke. \"none taken, I understand this is all kinda new to you guys too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt suddenly stops and you look back to see you let the treeline, slowly his hand comes back and you let yourself be pulled out of his pocket. He moves you to the front and you see a beautifull lake, glistening under the moonlight. \"I found this place yesterday.\" Matt says, \"I think it's really beautifull.\" You gasp, \"Wow, it is Matt, thank you for showing it to me, I don't think I've seen something so good in quite some time.\" Slowly Matt kneels to the ground and places you on a nearby log. \"Mind if I take a quick dip? I love a late-night swim.\" You shake your head, \"Go ahead, although I don't think I'm brave enough to join you in that ocean.\" Mat grins and takes of his shirt, revealing a sculpted body. She slowly lowers his shirt around you, \"To keep you warm.\" He says. Next he lowers his shorts and you notice a large scar running down the thigh of his right leg. It doesnt't seem to bother his movements though. You glance away as he lower his boxer-briefs, steps out of them and runs into the water, only spleashing a few times before taking a dive and entering the water nearly without any sound. It takes you a while to find him again after he surfaces and starts swimming around at high speed, but without much sound once again, sliding throught the water gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him go round and round and feel strangely peacefull, untill you suddenly hear a sound from behind you. A you turn around you see....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you turn around you can't hold back a scream of terror as from the edge of the wood, two bright yellow eyes stare at you, Slowly they move forward you can't make out anything but a shadowy form on four legs as is creeps closer, untill a ray of moonlight shines right on a very distinct M-shaped spot. \"Monster?\" You say, and you are answered by the soft whiney you heared before as he closes in on you. \"How did you get out?\" You realise you should be terrified right now, but for some reason you're not. Even when his head is only inches away from you and he sniffs a few times. Slowly you take a few steps on your log and stretch out your hand, just a little more and suddenly you're feeling the soft suede like skin of his nose. Ever so slowly Monster kneels down and places his head next to you on the log, you can see his bright yellow eye taking you in. \"It's a bit late for you to be out all alone, mister.\" You say in a stern voice, Monster just flicks his ears as if trying to say, look who's talking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some splashing behind you and suddenly Monster lifts his head and makes a sound very similar to barking. \"Wooh, boy, it's okay, he's a friend. don't hurt him.\" You hear yourself say, for some reason this calms down the horse a little, but he reamins very alert. Slowly he lowers his head again and you look back at Matt standing butt-naked near the water. \"I think I need my clothes?\" He says in a small voice. You don't think, you just act. You grab a bit of monsters fur and you climb up past the eery yellow eye till you are between his ears, you grab on to the start of his manes and just say, \"Come Monster, UP! let's go home.\" Without a second thought Monster stands up and starts to turn to walk back. You look back and see Matt scrambling into his clothes. \"Are you okay?\" He yells, \"For now...\" you answer, \"Please follow us, but keep your distance\" Matt waves an understanding and You turn forward again. Monster has very sure footing even in the dark and keeps a risk pace. After a while you see all the lights in and around the stables are on and you see a few people running around. Untill suddenly you hear one of them yell, \"There he is, get the ropes.\" You recognise Manuel's voice, \"Monster stop.\" You say and the horse stops. \"Matt hurry tell Manuel not to do anything, tell him I've got this.\" Circling wide you see Matt run forward and intercept Manuel and the others. \"Matt, give Manuel the receiver please.\" You see some exchange, \"Manuel?\" he waves as an answer, \"please get the others out of the way, I'm gonna lead Monster back to his paddock.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happens, but suddenly the group steps aside and you cluck your tongue, \"Come on, Monster, let's go home.\" Almost immediatly Monster starts walking again and passes the group, entering the barn and ending his walk in his own Paddock. Slowly turning around and you see Manuel closing the door and putting on the bolt. \"Monster lowers his head a little and you slide down landing on the wooden door before turning around and giving his nose a firm rub. \"Thanks for the ride Monster, but you shouldn't break out like that. Next time just let me know when you want to go for a run and I'll be happy to go with you.\" Monster answers with a soft friendly whiney before turning around and retreating to the back of the paddock and laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see Manuel standing there with open mouth. \"How?\" is all he can utter. You shake your head, \"I have no idea, Matt and me were out for a walk and suddenly... Monster.\" Manuel nods, \"Yeah about an hour ago we heared a noise and when we got here his paddock was empty. Matt steps up, \"We passed by about an hour ago before heading out to the trails. Maybe Monster, I don't know, Sensed Peter out there?\" manuel nods, \"Seems like the only logical explanation, which means you are either extremely lucky Monster caught up when you weren't carrying him, or he might have attacked you to protect Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realise, \"but he was following us for a while, I remember the yellow spots now.\" Manuel blinks, \"Okay, then he must have thaught you weren't threatened. But you?\" Manuel turns to you, \"You should be more carefull. Going off-campus with only one person to look after you and climbing on top of the foulest horse I've ever met.\" You interrupt, \"Hey, don't talk about Monster like that. He's a wonderfull horse, that's just a bit picky about who he likes. And I will not stand for you insulting him.\" In the back of the Paddock you hear Monster snort in agreement. Manuel's eyes almost seem to pop out. \"okay, you're right, that was uncalled for. But you're still an idiot.\" You nod, \"No argument there.\" This again shuts Manuel up and makes Matt chuckle. \"Fine, Matt, just get him to his room, tomorrow we'll have riding practice and I guess we'll see if Monster is as good to you during the day as he is at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and say, \"See you tomorrow Monster.\" As Matt picks you up and carries you out.</span></div></div>",

Matt notices and picks you up, placing you in the gap between his thighs, \"Better?\" he asks. \"A little, yes thanks. I guess y size isn't build for these drafty conditions.\" Matt grins and leans back a little. \"Feel free to scoot a little closer if you need to keep warm, I won't look.\" You figure it's either freezing or doing so, so you carefull move back a little bit until you feel Matt's shorts behind your back. Don't look up, you think, but of course you do and notice you're leaning agains Matt's groin, the biggest part of it hovering only inches above you. You decide to deal with it and lean back a little more, since there's no reaction Matt doesn't notice or doesn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some night,\" he says, \"I can't believe you just faced Monster like that.\" You chuckle, \"It's not like I had much choice.\" He chuckles too. \"I guess, but I would've hidden under the log instead of reaching out. That horse is one moody animal, no offence.\" You poke your elbow back, remembering to late where you're poking him and his legs twitch together, not enough to close thankfully, to get passed the moment you quickly say, \"He;s not moody, he's picky... and he has good taste\" Matt laughs shaking his body and rubbing his lower parts against your back. \"That he does.\" You lean back a little more and relax, \"Hey, he didn't attack you, cause he didn't think you were a threat to me, you should feel honoured he does not dislkie you as much as some of the others.\" Matt sighs, \"I think he just waited for the right time to pounce.\" You grin, \"He's not all lion, just his heart.\" you hear Matt chuckle, \"that's probably why you're not scared being that close to mine, because you have the biggest balls of the team.\" You poke him again, just because you can. \"You wouldn't look.\" Matt closes his legs a little, \"I didn't, but your poking gave you away. it's how I know you're still there.\" you smile a little, \"yeah well, if I have to choose between to evils, freezing to death or sitting by your balls, I pick the second one, Survivalinstinct.\" Matt chuckles, \"Untill I sit up and you're squashed by them.\" You sigh, \"I don't squash that easily.\" He answers \"So I've heared.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds he says, \"You kinda move quick for such a tiny man?\" You look up, forgetting you get a full view of his groin that way, \"Huh?\" You feel Matt shake with amusemen, \"Well, this is only our first date and you've already grabbed my ass and poked my balls, what's next?\" You flinch a little, \"Try switching size with me and see if you think it as much of a joke then.\" Matt chuckles. \"Sorry, just trying to break the ice.\" You grin and say, \"You were the one who just had to get naked in front of me.\" Matt laughs \"Besides I'm more of a dinner and a movie kind of guy for a first date.\" you add. Matt answers \"Oh so you did sneak a peak at what's under the hood.\" You chuckle, \"Just a rear-eyeview of something crawling up into nothing because there was a big horse standing near his clothes.\" Matt laughs again, \"Who the hell taught you how to banter like that? I mean I have 8 brothers, so the sexual innuendo jokes are a given, but I thought you were an only child.\" You grin, \"We had tv and shows with hillbilly tribesman talking each other down, maybe you were in one?\" Matt laughs hard at that one. \"Guess not, cause I fled hillbilly-land as soon as I could, they don't take kindly to my type.\" He remains silent for a while and you ask, \"Blondes?\" He shivers for a second, \"Gays.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it is, you are sitting in the shadow of the crotch of a gigantic gay man. Something used in stories to scare little tinies, you start to say a poem: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beware the Giant, big and tall,<br>\r\nHis mighty step, his feet will fall.<br>\r\nThe Giantess you too must shun,<br>\r\nFor her high heals are not much fun.<br>\r\nBut most of all beware you must,<br>\r\nThe giant gay, just filled with lust\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt remains silent for a while, untill you say, \"I'm not afraid of you. Even though my head is filled with rhymes like that. I never even realised you were until you just told me. You don't make me feel scared, today you made me feel safe. You were accepting, funny and maybe a little bit wimpy when it comes to horses, but still. I'm not afraid of you.\" You don't get a reaction at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a while you hear Matt speak up with a broken voice, \"Thanks, you are the first person to not freak out after hearing this.\" You answer him, \"Why would I? I mean so you like guys instead of girls, it happens, its simple biology. At least you're not a secret Microphile right?\" This makes Matt laugh, \"Not yet, but keep talking like that and I might just kiss you.\" you make a gagging sound, \"How do the girls say this after rejecting you: 'Let's just stay friends, okay?\" matt laughs again and you join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about you? Do you like boys, girls, both.\" You ponder that for a second, \"I don't really know. I never felt attracted to anyone really, mainly because I've been so busy trying to survive and hide from the world, I never thought about being part of it true a relationship or something. I just know that whoever I end up with, they need to like horses\" Matt chuckles \"Well with the whole LGTBQS whatever, there's sure to be one letter that fits you eventually. But fair enough, thanks for being honest...\" Next he adds mockingly, \"And hey apparantly I still got a shot as you're not sure and I like horses.\" You poke him once again hard, this time he does retaliate by slamming his thighs together completely closed. Trapped between the strong warm muscles you mutter, \"But you don't like the best horse.\" Matt keeps his legs closed just a little longer before releasing you, you kinda not hate the feeling of being between his thighs though. \"Sorry, reflex.\" he says.</span></div></div>",

As expected the thighs slam shut at once squeezing you tight. \"It just happens\" Matt says with a humourous tone. \"At least it's not that tight.\" You riposte, \"Oh really?\" Matt answers and squeezes a bit harder. \"Yeah really.\" You manage to say, making him squeeze just a bit harder. \"Better.\" He asks, \"Acceptable.\" You say and wait for him to release you. but instead you feel his stretch his legs. \"I'm locking my anckles as we speak. Say uncle of be squeezed a little more.\" You dare him, \"Auntie.\" And suddenly he squeezes you so tight you feel your body sinking into his flesh. \"What was that?\" He asks \"Auntie\" you squeal figuring he can't do much more, you were wrong. Even more pressure is put on you till you can't hold out, \"Uncle, Uncle.\" Almost immediatly he releases you and you drop down on the couch, panting.\" He laughs, I'm impressed, not many people needed my full-power squeeze to give in. You're sturdier than you look.\" You catch your breath and say, \"I told you so.\" Matt laughs, \"Well, now I know, guess that explains not being scared being steamrolled by my nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowy you sit up and move a little back so you can look past the bulge into Matt's face. \"You do know this is not making me feel better about telling you I feel safe with you right.\" Matt grins, \"Too late, you liiiike me and I know it.\" You sigh and mutter, \"Me and my big mouth. \"Just teasing you a little\" Matt says, \"I don't expect anything more from you than a bit of conversation and your friendship.\" You grin back at him, \"and a little secrecy for now, right?\" Matt grins, \"That would be appreciated.\" Matt leans back and you slowly walk back til you're unde his crotch before sitting down and resting against his warm body. \"So,\" you ask, \"ever done it with a man?\" Matt chuckles, \"I've done stuff, just not the big one.\" You grin, \"So, guess you're as much a virgin as me.\" Matt chuckles, \"I guess so.\" You wonder, \"So you fancy any of the guys on our team?\" Matt sighs, \"Not yet I think, no. Would I do'em? probably, but fancy is a different thing.\" You grin, \"Well, if you do eventually and need a little help figuring them out, just don't hesitate to ask me.\" Matt chuckles. \"Oh, and what could you do.\" You smile, \"So far I met this guy for a few hours and he came out to me. So I've got a score of a 100%, how about you.\" Matt laughs, \"Touch\u00e9. And well, thanks for the offer, who knows.\" he stays silent for a minute, \"And thanks just for being here with me for a little while. It means more than you know to just be open and honest about who I am for once. Just like Auntie Ida taught me. She wasn't crazy. I think she probably was the only one who knew the real me.\" You give him a soft poke, \"You should be the real you more often, he's a nice and caring, somewhat cooky boy. I think most people will like him. And those that don't can just suck it. And if any of the guys give you a hard time, I'm gonna kick their asses for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part sends Matt into a slowstarting but extended laughing fit. Trying to catch his breath he suddenly leans forward putting his head between his knees. And squishing you under the full weight of his bulge. As he keeps heaving he moves up and down, practically teabagging you all the long while. Finally he takes a deep breath an rolls back up, \"I'm so sorry about that, I just couldn't breathe.\" You laugh yourself, \"So I noticed, don't worry, it's okay, I guess the way our date has spiraled out of control you deserved a little over the short action. Just remember, not everyone is as easy as me.\" Matt laughs, \"Guess that formally ends our date for the night. Suddenly he stands up and you see his tight ass rise over you before he turns and gives you a wink, \"And that is how I draw in my men.\" He reaches down and you hop in his hand. Walking back to the dorm you come to your room, Matt gives a knock.</span></div></div>",

You groan softly as you open your eyes and thow off the blankets. Slowly you sit up and rub your eyes. \"Goodmorning, sunshine.\" You hear Jonathan say. \"I hate having a morning person for a roommate.\" you mutter, momentarily forgetting he can hear you, untill he starts laughing. \"Well, you should've slept in my pouched undies, then I'd be wearing grumpy-pants in the morning like you.\" You get up and stumble to the shower, \"I'm gonna take lessons from Bella so I can kill you.\" Jonathan laughs again, \"Just hurry up, we're expecting company.\" You barely register this as the hot water streams over your body. After a few minutes you force yourself to turn of the hot water and rinse off cold. Getting out of the shower you stumble to your closet as you hear a knock on the door. Jonathan will get that you figure and tune out. After getting dressed you move onto the balcony and see Tom's greying hair next to it. \"Goodmorning Sunshine.\" He mockingly says. You glance at Jonathan, \"You put him up to that.\" Jonathan raises his hands in innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Tom quickly places a large mug of coffee on your balcony. \"Cafein.\" you mutter and start slurping it down. \"You're really not a morning person are you.\" Tom grins. \"Guess that's one more piece of proof you're a regular city-boy. Waking at this time is sleeping in for most of us.\" You glance at him over the edge of your cup, \"No talk now... Coffee.\" You say and walk back inside to fix yourself some breakfast. As you return back to the balcony, Jonathan and Tom are having a lively talk about riding practice today and how they wonder which horse they get to ride. As they see you arrive they slowly watch your mood before including you. \"So are you looking forward to riding with us?\" Tom asks, \"Do you think you'll get your own horse or are you gonna share with one of us? I won't mind sharing, just let me steer.\" You take a sip of coffee, \"I'm okay with sharing, but I'm riding Monster today, so hope your brave enough.\" Tom laughs a bit unsure. \"That was a joke right? No one rides Monster as far as I've heared.\" you slowly take a bite and chew carefully before swallowing. \"I did.\" ask Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan suddenly gets up to go to the bathroom, leaving you alone with Tom, who looks at you questioningly. \"Do you hate me or something, or have I offended you?\" You look up, \"Huh? Oh sorry, no not at all, it's just early. I'll like you fine in half an hour or so. I didn't mean to be snippy.\" He lets out a sigh of relieve, \"Okay, got you. Sorry it's just... I've just got a slight case of ADD. As you may have noticed.\" You give him a smile, \"Not as such no, but than again, I haven't met anyone with ADD before. Just remember I'm probably the complete opposite of you till I get my morning coffee.\" Tom gives you a smile back, \"That I can deal with, just tell me when to shut up, I can handle that fine, I'm just not good with reading people, or with passive aggressive. So...\" You interrupt him. \"Tom?\" He blinks and finishes the sentence grinning, \"Shut up?\" You nod. He makes a zipping movement over his mouth and takes your empty mug to fill it. \"Thanks. Once this is down I promise to be a little more energetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing your cup you get up and stretch. Jonathan and Tom are already cleaning up. You figure it's probably a good idea to reassure Tom of not hating him as the two come back and Jonathan get's ready to strap on the bandolier or sash which can hold you in different pockets when you say. \"Tom, why don't you strap it on for a while, so Jonathan doesn't have to carry me all day again. I know it's tiresome, so it's a good way for you to burn of some excess energy.\" Tom blinks, \"Oh sure.\" And takes the sash. From behind his back You see Jonathan gives you a smile and a thumbs-up. After strapping it on Tom steps up and slowly lowers his hand for you to climb on, \"Where should I put you?\" You point at the chest pocket, \"That one seems pretty easily accesible and not in the way.\" Tom slowly brings you to it and you slide into a pocket deep enough for you to stand in. You feel a belt on the inside and tighten it around you. \"There's a belt in there so you won;t fall out when he bends forward.\" jonathan says. \"Way ahead of you, you answer. \"By the way, maybe you should bring the extra receivers if we're riding, This way if I fall and you need to look for me you can make a line of people who can hear me.\" Jonathan grins, \"Good thinking,\" he picks the case with receivers up, \"Better thinking? don't fall off.\" Tom, Jonathan and you laugh at that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the short walk you get your first view of the dorms and the rst of the campus by day. You notice there are a lot of boys running around, you can easily make out a group of the smaller jockey's in the distance and shudder. Also you pass a group of polo-players and you see one of them pointing you out to the others. But you feel quite safe against Tom's hard pec. After a while you're joined by some of your other class mates, Matt and a guy you think is called Simon. Matt gives you a wave and a wide grin, \"How's my partner in crime?\" You wait for Jonathan to hand him a receiver, \"Just fine, daddy didn't punish me too much.\" Matt roars a laugh. \"Say hi to Simon for me will you?\" You hear Matt pass on the message and Simon gives you a smile and a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk Jonathan holds Matt back a little and after they join you again, Jonathan gives you a wink. Good, you think, that's settled. Almost the entire team is waiting already. Tom slowly moves to the front, avoiding any accidental elbows and slaps gracefully, almost like a dancer. He ends up next to Jonas and you see Manuel standing in front of the doors, with crossed arms counting heads. After a little while he speaks up, \"So it seems we're complete?\" Jonathan, you brought Peter. Tom pipes up, \"He's here sir.\" Manuel looks at you and Jonathan is already moving in to hand him a spare receiver. \"Right, and that's number 26. Good. So you may not have heared, but your coach will be taking a few days off due to a family emergency. So untill he returns I'll be taking over as your coach.\" He pauzes a second, \"You will address me as Coach or Manuel. I will tell you how to handle the horses, if you fail to follow my orders I will ban you from my stables, quicker than you can say Rodeo-clown. In this stable there are a few rules. You never approach one of the horses in a paddock marked with blue X and don't even look at those with a red X, unless you got permission. Fernsworth?\" You chime in, \"Yes Coach.\" You hear your voice softly echo from a speaker above the door so everyone can hear you. \"You have permission to approach Manella and Monster and are for now the only person on this team with special permission to approach one of the more delicate horses.\" This starts up a soft murmur in the group. \"Thank you coach.\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen up, you will be taken in two or three at the time. Move among the first paddocks till you reach the blue line. You will choose a horse and stand outside of the paddock till everyone has chosen their horse they are gonna ride today. Each one of these is probably smarter than you, so pick wisely. If one of them clearly says no. You will move on for now, we're not trying to break them today, I need to see IF you ride first.\" He point at two of the guys in the group and they enter with Manuel, After a few minutes he comes back and points at two others. This repeats a while, untill nearly everyone has entered. The only ones left are You, Matt, Tom and Jonathan. Manuel closes in. \"So Peter, I guess you're sure you wanna ride monster again? I'd much rather have you ride with one of the others on Manella. But I won't stop you under one condition. He pulls takes a piece of headgear from his belt. \"You find someone brave enough to put this special head-gear on him. Cause I like my fingers too much.\" You look at the guys still around you. \"I'm sorry Tom, but I think Matt is the safest bet for this if he's willing to help me out.\" Matt steps up, \"I guess, just don't let him take my hand off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou undo your belt and let Matt pick you from the Sash. He holds his hand open so you can sit on it and see. Taking the headgear from Manuel. Slowly he moves into the stables and Manuel follows close behind. You see your teammates look at you like there's a parade passing and suddenly you not only pass the blue line on the floor, but also the red one. There's only a few paddocks here, most of them empty, but you know exactly which one you need to be at. As you get a good view you see Monster lying in the back, He looks at you and Matt intently. \"Monster.\" You say softly and clack your tongue. His ears twitch in recognision. \"Wanna go for a run?\" Monster gets up and let's out a roaring whiney, driving Matt back a little. \"Please let Matt put on this headgear, then we can go.\" Monster steps forward to the paddock door. \"Move in slow Matt.\" you tell him and Matt steps forward a few steps Monster suddenly snorts. \"It's okay Monster.\" You say in a reassuring voice. \"noone is gonna ride you or try to tie you down. nobody but me, just you and me. But you must let them put on the headgear.\" Monster stares at you intently, you notice a hinge of doubt in his eyes. \"Please?\" you add. You're answered with an almost purring sound as Monster lowers his head over the paddock. \"Now, put me on the door and put on the gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to give Matt credit for this. Because he does as you ask him without flinching. Lowering you unto the paddock door where Monster can see you, he leans in and shoves the headgear on the horse, that's standing completely still. When it is on Matt quickly takes a step back and Monster finally moves his head to nuzzle you softly. You give his nose a good scratch and start to climb up the gear till you reach a tiny saddle and the reins right in the middle between Monster's ears. \"Well, I'll be a monkey's Uncle\" you hear Manuel mumble. Suddenly Monster leans forward towards Matt and sniffs. \"Shh, Monster, he's a friend.\" Monster lowers his head a little. \"I think you can pet him now, Matt.\" A little shaky Matt staps forward and freezes as monster Snorts, but there's no other reaction, slowly Matt sticks out his hand and places it softly between Monster's eyes. Monster reacts by pushing against Matt's hand and rubbing against it. Before taking a few steps back in the paddock. \"That's very nice, but enough for now.\" You interpret. \"Can you open the door for us, we'll wait for the rest to get ready.\" Matt unlocks the door and swings it open. Monster doesn't move at all. \"Just call us when you're ready manuel, I think we'll bring up the rear for now. if that's okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuel nods and leads Matt back to the front, you hear him call in Jonathan and Tom and tell everyone to put on their saddles and hurry. After a few minutes you see Manuel ride into sight on Manella. He whispers. \"Bella is very impressed with you. Just don't try anything stupid and keep to the rear. Some of our friends will be close.\" Suddenly he turns and walks towards the entrance, you give Monster a soft command and he steps out of the Paddock and stands in the middle of the stables, facing the door, waiting. One by one you see the others move their horses out of the paddocks and leading them outside before getting on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon everyone is in the saddle and Manuel leads the group out into the pasture. You give Monster an encouraging grunt and he follows the group. You notice his head swinging a bit side to side as if trying to keep an eye on all the horses, \u201cI guess you think of them as you\u2019re flock.\u201d  You whisper in his ear and it twitches in reply. In front of you, you see Matt and Jonathan riding side by side and glancing back. They are still in range of the receiver you realise and are a bit at ease. You look at the two and they seem truely at home in the saddle. Swaying with their horses like they were born to do this. You feel a bit uncomfortable sitting a bit wide-legged and the swaying isn\u2019t enhancing your feeling of safety. You felt safe when you were in contact with Monster, but understand that this is probably something you have to learn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you crossed the field and Manuel is leading you onto the large racing circuit. As you enter you see there\u2019s another group in the center riding around. It\u2019s a group of jockeys. The horses they ride seem to be a little smaller and more slender than the ones your group is riding, like they are built for racing. You feel a littl unomfortable with them so close. But realise they are still far away enough you shouldn\u2019t worry. Besides, they wouldn\u2019t try anything with your entire team around. At one of the starting lines Manuel stops and points the first five to take positions. \u201cSo let\u2019s see how you guys handle a little race. On my Mark get set... GO!\u201d  The first five riders ride off at full speed, you notice Tom being part of the group and you cheer him on, even though he can\u2019t hear you. They run around the course and Tom finishes second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the next five are lining up. And after three more races suddenly there is only 6 of you. So when Manuel lines up Matt, Jonathan and three others he gives you a look. \u201cYou think you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d You shake your head and softly say, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d  But Monster softly shakes is head and snorts, rolling his eyes. \u201c But I guess he is.\u201d  You add and suddenly find yourself lined up with the rest. Only now do you notice the jockeys stopped their training and standing near the fences, you hear the once closed to the startingline say something about a horse without a rider. Jonathan next to you picks it up too and says loud enough. \u201cWell Peter, let\u2019s see if you\u2019re big enough to handle the horse no jockey could ride.\u201d Manuel understands the hint and waits a moment as the jockeys squint an suddenly point to you. \u201cIs that the tiny riding that beast?\u201d Manuel takes it as a sign and you suddenly hear him say, \u201cReady... Set... GO!\u201d The others are quick to react and race off, you take a second longer before telling monster to \u201cRun like the wind\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he does, he races off like a bullet from a gun, before you realise what\u2019s happening you pull yourself flat against Monsters outstretched head and loosen the reigns a little. You passed numbers 6 and 5 in a heartbeat. Already level with number 4, Jonathan and you exclaim happily, \u201cKiss my ass for a change.\u201d And already you\u2019re catching up with numers 3 and 2, passing them in the curve, which you realise is not tactical, but Monster doesn\u2019t care. He knows he can take them. Then only Matt is riding in front of you and you whisper. \u201cWe can\u2019t let him win.\u201d Monster stretches even more flat galloping ahead untill your level with Matt. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you win.\u201d  He yells at you and speeds up his horse entering the second bend. Suddenly you make a sound you didn\u2019t know you knew, something between a tweeting bird and a whineying horse and Monster storms forward passing Matt as if it\u2019s nothing. And racing on. Passing the finish line almost two horselengths before Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted by a cheer from your teammates and you realise some of the jockeys are also applauding you. You reach out as far as you can to scratch the base of Monster\u2019s ear as he pants a little. But you also realise he\u2019s strutting around like he\u2019s the king, making you his crown. \u201cYou were made to race, aren\u2019t you.\u201d  You whisper. \u201c I agree, a strange voice says and you look over to a slender man in his early thirties walk closer, a receiver on his ear, followed by Manuel without a reciever. Suddenly monster turns his head and, you can only think of it as, snarls at the newcomer. \u201cPlease don\u2019t come too close, Monster doesn\u2019t like strangers too much.\u201d  The man stops and gives you a nod. \u201cPeter is it?\u201d  You answer, \u201cYes.\u201d I must say I\u2019m quite impressed. Manuel told me you were the first to ever ride Monster and you even managed to stay in the saddle at such a velocity, I think physics would tell us that it would be nigh impossible.\u201d You blush a little, but he won\u2019t notice. \u201cThank you, and you are?\u201d  He gives you a grin, \u201cSorry, the name is Mister Fredrick Williams, coach of the racing team.\u201d  You nod, \u201c And former regional champion 5 times in a row. Coming in just second in the nationals.\u201d He smiles, \u201cVery good, yes that\u2019s me. So let\u2019s face the fact you\u2019re more built for racing than for rodeo. I wonder if you would agree on switching teams. I think you could help us win the gold. And at the same time be an example as of why tinies should have their own category in racing as your winning will set off a lot of discussion about fairness, seeing as you\u2019re in your own weightcategory.\u201d  He grins a bit too widely as he finishes, \u201cAnd the boys and me would really enjoy racing with you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You realise every word you say is gonna be passed on by Matt, Jonathan and some of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say Mister Williams, first of all, I don\u2019t know if I could win you the gold, but I don\u2019t want to be the tiny on the soapbox fighting for seperate rights. Especially not if it starts with making a lot of enemies amongst the Jockeys of the other schools I\u2019m racing against. I have a hard enought time trying to survive in a world of giants, so taking the spotlight in a war about sizeism doesn\u2019t sound like the smartest move for me to make.\u201d Fredrick doesn\u2019t look too pleased right now, his eyes give him away even though he keeps smiling. You hear your last words being repeated behind you as Fredrick says, \u201cI understand, but there might be other ways, maybe you can teach us how to tame Monster and have him race for our team, maybe even ride him with one of our other teammembers, noone has to even know you\u2019re there.\u201d You shudder as you almost hear him say that they are gonna stuff you in a saddle and ride you, if that\u2019s what it takes to ride Monster. You feel Monster also get twitchy scraping his hoofs in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mister Williams, but I haven\u2019t tamed Monster yet, I just work with him for now. And he clearly doesn\u2019t trust that many people. So I don\u2019t think we can get him ready to race with one of your teammates very soon. Even if I was riding along like a PART of the equipment.\u201d You emphasize the word, to let him know you know what he was implying. Fredrick drops his smile. \u201cMonster is property of the school and will be ridden by whoever we deem worthy. SO you just have to take one for the team and show some schoolspirit. I will not accept a no.\u201d At this moment Monster steps forward roaring at the jockey-coach, driving him back. And you answer. \u201cMonster stop.\u201d The horse, Monster stops in his tracks, his mouth inches away from Fredrick bending down so you can look him in the eye. \u201cYou will take no for an answer, because Monster and me are in agreement here. We are part of the rodeo team and have our own flocks to care and worry about. You can call the headmaster, you can call my coach, who is standing right behind you, you can call my parents or you can threaten to send the entire jockeyteam after me to make me regret it. But I will warn you only once, do not make an enemy out of me, Monster or any of the rodeoteammembers, because you will be the one to regret that.\u201d A few seconds later after you hear your words being passed on you hear a load roar from the entire team behind you. \u201cDo I respectfully make myself clear, Fredrick.\u201d Pushing the limit of not using his last name you realise this is the moment you made your first real enemy. He answers between clenched teeth, \u201cPerfectly clear, Mister Fersnworth. I will however not stop trying to convince you, by ANY means necesarry.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that he turns and takes of the receiver so you can\u2019t reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few deep breaths as you suddenly see Matt stepping up and reaching out to hold you in your saddle as you feel yourself collapsing. Monster resting his head in Matt\u2019s arms you realise. \u201cHey, he didn\u2019t snap at you.\u201d Before you pass out. </span></div></div>",

You look up and see a plaid shirt. You hear a faint clicking of hooves nearby and suddenly a soft whiney. \"What is it Monster?\" you hear Matt's voice say from above. \"I think he's trying to tell you I'm awake.\" Matt stops moving and raises you up a little looking down. \"Welcome back to the land of the conscious.\" He has a smile on his face, but his eyes tell you he's actually quite worried. \"He's back.\" He yells and suddenly you hear over a dozens of voice cheer your name. You kinda expect some other to come crowding in, but for now noone comes neer, except for a large black head with yellow eyes softly nuzzling you. \"Hi monster\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance you hear Manuel's voice, \"Are you okay, all in one piece and what's your name?\" You grin, \"I'm good, my name is Andrew and I'm a black and blue tailed banana-frog.\" This gets a few laughs from those that are in receiver range, including Matt, but Manuel doesn't sound that amused. \"Tell me your name.\" You sigh, \"It's Peter and I'm okay. just a little tired.\" Manuel answers still from what must be a mile away. \"Well you probably took a lot more G-forces than you're used to, so the lack of oxygen to the brain might have caused yo to pass out.\" You laugh, \"Guess the racing team wouldn't be my safest bet for one more reason.\" ut if you wanna check up on me, just come a little closer so you won't have to yell. It stays silent for a little while untill Manuel says, \"I can't... I'm not allowed near you by a certain horse. For some reason he's protecting you and by extension Matt from anyone who's trying to get near. Monster snorts once. \"Ah, Monster likes you Matt.\" Matt grins, \"I think it's more a form of acceptance than like. But I'm just glad he didn't attack me when I tried to catch you.\" You grin back. \"I'm just glad you caught me. Otherwise I would've probably be hurt a lot more. And thank you for being brave enough to come that close to Monster.\" att gives you a wink as he tilts his head. \"I noticed him looking at me, the moment you started to tilt over, so I knew it was okay.\" Monster snorts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't noticed Matt was moving again untill you look back and see the stables almost right on top of you. \"How long was I out.\" Matt answers, about 15 minutes, Manuel decided to return to the stables together to make sure you're safe. He just told most of the others to ride around the pasture some more. So right now it's just you, me, Monster and him.\" As Matt enter the stables he leads you back to monsters Paddock and places you on the door. Monster has entered his paddock and turned around to look at you. manuel comes up behind you, \"I didn't think about how to rub him down.\" But Matt already has picked up some straw and starts rubbing. Monster gives him a look, but takes it in stride, even when Matt begins with the brushes. \"Well, I'll be...\" Manuel just says and suddenly you see Bella climbing out of his shirt pocket and saying something. Manuel places her down beside you and she immediatly takes your pulse. Monster snorts and steps forward, so you quickly tell him, \"It's okay Monster.\" Allthough he seems tense he stops moving. \"Follow my finger.\" Bella tells you with a cautious look at the horse. You do as you're told and let her examine you. Suddenly you hear Matt ask, \"Am I seeing double? And did you turn into a crossdresser?\" Manuel throws Matt a second receiver. \"Hello Matt, the name is Bella, I'm Manuels partner.\" Matt just finishes brushing down Monster and Monster moves forward and places his nose to your back softly and whineys. \"Thank you for the ride and for taking care of me buddy.\" Monster turns and lies down in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Matt moves out of the paddock Manuel pushes it close slowly not to make you or Bella fall. \"We should move this into the back before someone else comes in.\" he says and picks up Bella, leaving Matt to carry you. In his office Matt places you on the desk whil Manuel gets ot the tiny chairs. \"I'm sorry,\" Matt says, \"How rude of me, it's nice to meet you Bella, I was just a little pre-occupied with keeping an eye on Monster.\" She gives him a wave, \"That's fine, I nderstand completely. Manny how about you make us some tea. Darjeeling would be nice and add a few spoons of the good honey.\" Manuel gives a nod with a warm smile, takes of the receiver linking to you and also takes out one of his earrings before he moves into another room closing the door. Bella turns to you. \"So, Now it's just the three of us, Manuel won't listen in. I need to ask a few questions mostly to you Peter, but there are a few blanks regarding you too Matt.\" You both nod and Matt sits down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, how did you make Monster run so fast all of a sudden.\" You think back. \"I guess I made a sound that felt right and he started running.\" She nods, \"Did you also use other sounds to make him start and stop walking, not words, sounds.\" You think harder and remember clacking your tongue and some other sounds, \"I think I did, unintentionally.\" She nods again, \"And the sounds Monster makes, do you think they all sound the same or do you hear a distinct \"voice\" in them.\" She air-quotes the word voice. And you remember his whineys and snorts. \"I guess they are somewhat distinct.\" she nods again. \"Can you tell me what's going on?\" you ask a bit confused. Bella nods an says, \"I think it means that you are more than you seem.\" you just blink, \"I think you, like me, can listen and talk to specific animals that are open to it. Like Monster and Manella.\" You blink again and ask, \"I can talk to horses?\" Bella smiles, \"It happens, there are some tinies that are just more open to animals than others, just like there are animals mre open to tinies. It is the one reason I never let Manuel sell Monster. He sends me nothing but hatefull messages, but he does talk to me in a way, whoch means he's special too. When you came here the first day with Jonathan I heard him react to you, inquisitive, and the second time when you looked in his eyes and he looked at you I wondered if it was possible that Monster wanted to connect with you like Manella did with me. And when he followed you that night I figured you're bond had started to form.\" You gasp, \"My bond?\" She nods, \"I encourage you to try and talk with Manella and some of the other animals I can introduce to you, but so far I've found that my one true bond is with Manella, it's just deeper and I can almost read her mind like she can read mine. It's the main reason Manuel and I took this job, when I met Manella on a miss... different job I new I couldn't be apart of her for too long anymore. I think you recognise that feeling.\" You nod, \"Today I just needed to ride with Monster, but is that why Manuel told me I can also come near Manella? because she too can understand me?\" She nods, \"I figured if I was wrong and there was no bond starting, I needed Manella to tell me if she could understand me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Matt, \"And now for you, why did you step up to the most dangerous horse we have to catch Peter from falling?\" He looks down, \"Because just before Peter passed out Monster looked at me.\" Bella continues, \"Just a look.\" Matt shakes his head, \"More like a call for help.\" she nods. \"Monster followed you the other night, when did he show himself.\" Matt looks at you and says, \"When I left Peter alone, so I could take a quick swim.\" Bella nods once again. \"Did you notice him before?\" Matt just shakes his head and Bella turns to you, \"Did you?\" You nod softly, \"I think I saw his eyes when he was following us.\" She looks from you to Matt and back. \"Thanks, I know enough. Matt will you get Manuel please.\" Matt gets up and opens the door, Manuel comes in carrying a pot of tea and a few cups. He pours the tea and puts on the receivers. \"Manuel,\" Bella says, \"I think we have a bonding in progress.\" You sip the hot strong tea with a strong hint of honey. And hear Manuel answer. \"What kind?\" Bella puts down here tea and looks at both you and Matt. \"T.A.G.\" she spells out and Manuel chokes on his tea. \"Are you sure?\" Bella just nods. \"What's a T.A.G.?\" you ask, Bellas takes a sip and answers, \"There are different bonds that we now off, one of the rarest is that of a tiny, an animal and a giant. It's called a T.A.G.\" You let the words sink in. \"Like you, Manuel and Manella?\" You ask. Bella shakes her head. \"No, that's just a T.A. me and Manella, but Manella accepts Manuel as my partner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt remains silent for a few minutes untill...</span></div></div>",

I don't know.\" He falls silent. Suddenly you realise something else, \"Wait, Does that mean that if I have a bond with Monster and Monster has a bond with Matt, that I'm bonded to Matt through Monster.\" Bella gives a slight smile, \"That is how it starts out most of the time.\" Manuel chuckles as he slowly sees your face shift from questioning, to wondering, to shock, \"Wait, this means I'm going to be bonded to Matt too eventually.\" It comes out a lot more harsh than you intended and you quickly glance at Matt who actually looks like he's just slapped in the face. \"just say it like it's the worst thing in the world, why don't you.\" He snaps back at you. \"Sorry Matt,\" I'm just a bit surprised by all of this. He doesn't seem too satisfied so you add, \"It's far from the worst thing that could happen, really, it's just...\" Matt gives you a small grin and finishes your sentence, \"it's just a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"I never heared of bonds or stuff like this. And well, no offence, but I just met you yesterday?\" Matt grins a little wider, \"Ah, no love at first sight.\" You grin back. \"Still waiting for my dinner and movie.\" Bella coughs and you look back a bit embarrased. \"Sorry.\" you say. Bella gives you a smile. \"Don't worry, we've seen many bonds where the bondmates have their own lives and partners, so you're not forced into a strict threesome in anyway. However if this is a T.A.G. you will over the coming months become more aware of each other. Even if you're apart.\" You blink as she continues. \"However I think it would be best to inform the Center of this and they will probably send over a small team to confirm my suspicion. Unless you're not ready and want to wait a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Bella a look and say, \"Is it okay for Matt an me to have a moment alone?\" Bella nods and Manuel and she leave the room, without your recevier. And you turn to Matt. \"So...\" you say. \"Yes?\" he answers. \"You feel bonded yet?\" you ask with a slight grin. He gives you a strange look, \"Honestly? A little yes.\" Your mouth falls open as he continues, \"I felt something about you when you first entered the class with Jonathan. For some reason you picked me to help you during leatherworking class and not Jonathan who was right next to you and who you knew. It's one of the reasons I suggested the lunches and volunteered to be the first. Don't you think it's weird I knew exactly what kind of foods to bring. I somehow new what you would like.\" You stare up at him. as he asks, \"So why did you say yes to a walk with me alone at night?\" You shake your head. \"I don't know.\" ButMatt keeps his gaze on you and you answer, \"Honestly, I guess because I trusted you to take care of me?\" Matt nods, \"Had you any reason to think that?\" You shake your head, and gasp in surprise before looking up, \"It was just a feeling.\" Matt nods, \"Just a feeling indeed.\" You sip the last bit of luke-warm tea. \"We are bonding.\" You say a bit surprised. Matt just nods. \"It's why I don't think Monster is bringing us together, but you're bring Monster and me together, we have to tolerate each other for now untill our bond starts to develop. But you're the glue that holds this bond together, I realised it when you asked if Monster was the common bondmate. He's not, but you are.\" You think on that for a second. \"Matt, I'm really sorry about earlier, I think from all the people I met here, or most giants I've ever met, I'm gratefull that if I get to bond with someone it's you.\" You look up and see Matt grin, \"You're an idiot.\" You blink, \"Wha?\" He shakes his head, \"You have to learn you don't have to say these things out loud to me anymore, I already know.\" You grin, \"That's gonna take some getting used to.\" Matt laughs out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manuel and Bella come in you look at Matt and realise it goes both ways and you turn to them and say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Covering her sending device as she whispers \u201cThanks, I really hope your bond brings you as much joy as it did me.\u201d You give her a look... \u201cWe can do that?\u201d she give you a wink, \u201cSure,\u201d she uncovers her sender before saying \u201cthey don\u2019t have to know everything we discuss.\u201d  You hear Manuel laugh. \u201c When you were busy I called in your teammates, so I guess they must be done with rubbing and grooming the horses. Why don\u2019t the two of you head back to the dorms and talk this over a little more, while Bella and me inform the Center.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slowly picks you up and brings you to his chest pocket. Taking the receiver from Manuel and moves out of his office. As you walk passed the Paddocks you give Monster a wave, trying to send as many happy thoughts as you can and he answers with a wink. You didn\u2019t know horses could wink, Passing the red line and entering the blue zone you hold an eye out for Manella, she stands at the Paddock door and snorts in recognision. You give her a wave too. Finally in the first part of the stables you see the slower or more perfectionistic of your teammates round up the grooming, one of them you recognise as Jason. And suddenly you\u2019re out in the sun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt holds still for a second soaking up the sun before moving back towards the dorms at a slow pace. He takes a slight detour to pass by one of the herbal gardens, the smell of rosemary and lavender filling your nose. A little while later you enter the halls of the dorm and he moves up the steps. Knocking on your dorm door. You hear a voice inside and as Jonathan opens the door you see him on the phone. \u201cOh, they\u2019re just walking in now. Thanks for the heads-up. I\u2019ll make sure to keep you informed.\u201d  He hans up as Matt walks over, taking you from his pocket and putting you on the large table before he moves into the kitchenpart to gather some of the left-overs from yesterday\u2019s lunch and today\u2019s breakfast. \u201c Make yourself at home why don\u2019t you.\u201d  Jonathan mocks as he sits down and lets Matt place a plate and utensils in fornt of him, after stalling out the food. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do, I guess you just heared I kinda got a permanent invite, so like a vampire I\u2019m free to come and go as I please. So you can\u2019t wal around in the buff anymore.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan barks a laugh, \u201c That obvious?\u201d  Matt and you nod in unison. Jonathan smiles, \u201cGuess that proves it. We\u2019ve got ourselves a TAG-team.\u201d Matt smiles, \u201cWell, I guess so, because for some reason I knew it was the center on the phone with you, while I didn\u2019t even know you were a member of....\u201d.he pauzes for a second, \u201cCome to think of it, I have no clue what the Center actually is.\u201d Jonathan laughs, \u201cHaha, well, that\u2019s usually how it all begins, thinking you know or understanding things, which you shouldn\u2019t be aware off. Random tidbits off information and emotions. Like knowing what type of food the other likes and what not.\u201d  You give Matt a look and a wink, \u201cI guess you were right about that one.\u201d Matt nods, \u201cSo what is this Center, that will come and look us over.\u201d  Jonathan swallows his food, \u201cThe Center for TCI, Tiny Citizen Intergration. And the inspection began with Bella and now continues with me. Before they send out an actual bonded pair. Seeing as they are rare enough it\u2019s not easy to go after every claim of TAG-ers\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Jonathan a look, \u201cSo you lied to me and are still an active member?\u201d Jonathan grins, \u201cI was a sleeping member. But they called me in to give a second opinion, seeing as I\u2019m already here and acquinted with you... a little.\u201d  He grins, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to say if you\u2019ve changed over the past three days.\u201d He shakes his head, \u201cAnd I have only seen a truely bonded pair once. Most bonds I\u2019ve seen are just T.A. And those are few enough. I remember Jake, who somehow got bonded to a queen bee, he actually lived in a hivelike hut, build by workerbees and could control them as much as their queen could, that was very impressive. And they still make some of the best honey you\u2019ll ever taste.\u201d Matt takes a bite of a sandwich and while chewing asks, \u201c So what exactly does this center expect of us, if we are a T.A.G.\u201d  Jonathan shrugs, \u201cDepends, they probably want to study you, but they might offer you a job. Some TAG-ers are actually well known as ambassadors or from the movies. But mostly they\u2019ll just register you.\u201d You blink, \u201cWhat kind of tests?\u201d  Jonathan shrugs, \u201csome psychological tests to determine wether you really are TAG-ers and to see how other bonded animals react to you two. And some things to see how far your bond will go, Can Matt tell you something through Monster or the other way around. And is your bond completed or open to even more.\u201d Matt grins, \u201cI think a horse and a tiny in my head is more than enough.\u201d Jonathan grins, \u201c Don\u2019t worry, you would be a first, more often it happens a two TA\u2019s get together, but the two bonds will never mesh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a bit in silence you suddenly ask, \u201c Jonathan?\u201d He makes a noise, \u201cWhat does it mean to be bonded. No that\u2019s not what I really want to know, I guess I\u2019m just wondering, how will this bond evolve and affect us.\u201d  You hear Matt chuckle and he say, \u201c Scared of being bonded to Monster for the rest of your life.\u201d  You look back, \u201cYeah, but you figure out which monster scares me more.\u201d The three of you share a laugh. But Jonathan sounds pretty serious as he says, \u201cWell, I know a bond between a T and A can get pretty intense, almost like a psychic connection. What this means for a TG or AG, there\u2019s not much known about it. In general the bond between a A and a G is less intense, as the animals have an easier time bonding to tinies. However since both T\u2019s and G\u2019s share similar intelligence and emotions. It\u2019s hard to say. The actual T.A.G. Will probably tell you some of the more usefull training excercises to both strengthen the bond and to keep you both sane individuals.\u201d Matt grins, \u201cOh, so we\u2019re finally getting a shred of sanity now that we\u2019re bonded.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle but Jonathan doesn\u2019t. He takes a deep breath and says, \u201cWell, insanity can sometimes be the result of an unsuccesfull bond. So are prolonged seperation and death of one of the bondmates.\u201d Suddenly you realise something...</span></div></div>",

Why would a giant family adopt a Tiny, or why would it be allowed. Molly as bonded to one of your families animals and it died. Driving her almost insane, so you decided to take her in. And help her.\u201d Matt coughs, \u201cWho\u2019s Molly?\u201d  Jonathan looks at him, \u201cMy adopted sister.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at you, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Molly was bonded to one of our goats, we didn\u2019t know by then, untill the goat got sick after giving birth and we noticed her sitting next to it one night, trying to take care of her.\u201d  Jonathan lowers his eyes, \u201cIf we had knew then, what we knew now we would\u2019ve tried harder to save her, but it was just too late. Life at a farm is harsh sometimes. Molly had no real familiy as far as we knew and somehow stumbled across our farm and bonded the goat without us knowing. She must have lived for a few years together, Molly wore a dress made of bits of plastic and fabric she found. Completely feral. When we called in the TCI they told us it would be best for her to either live on the premises or be taken in. So my parents decided to adopt her.\u201d He sighs, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to deal with such a feral tiny at first. But finally we managed to get through to her with food. My mom cooked for her and she got interested in that and learned to bake before she re-learned to speak.\u201d He looks at you again, \u201cShe started talking to some of our animals, at random it seemed to us, a chicken, two of the turkeys and the donkey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder, \u201c Was she trying to form a new bond?\u201d Jonathan shrugs, \u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t even know, she was just so lost and out of it. When she finally started talking to us, for some reason my father was her first, even though he never really tried to. Maybe that was the reason. She didn\u2019t feel pressured. I think it took about 2 years untill she finally felt a bit like herself and talked with me and my mother too. That is when the Center introduced us to Simon, another bond-survivor. He was actually double scarred as he was a TAG-er. He was a great help at first...\u201d You think for a second and finish the sentence, \u201cuntil Simon tried to bond with you?\u201d  Jonathan nods but doens\u2019t say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt breaks the silence, \u201cAnd you wanted to bond him too, to know what is like?\u201d Jonathan nods, \u201cYeah, even though I\u2019ve seen the wrecks of a broken bond I also saw so many happily bonded people, I wanted to feel so close with someone too. Maybe I was petty, from being an only child I suddenly had to share my parents with a wingnut-tiny.\u201d He grins, \u201cI love her to death now, don\u2019t worry, but at the time it wasn\u2019t all that easy for me. So yeah, when Simon told me about the bond and how good it feels to be bonded, I was intruiged. So we tried some stuff. He told me he knew ways to force a bond. He learned it over the internet, using certain herbal teas. Of course none of it worked and when Molly learned what Simon was doing she warned the center and he\u2019s been taken into custody and has been declared insane.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around at Matt, \u201cPromise me something will you?\u201d  He grins, \u201c What?\u201d You grin, \u201cI get to die first. Cause you said you were insane already.\u201d This makes Jonathan chuckle and Matt just laugh. You turn back to Jonathan, \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you push yourself on me, when you found out I was bonding with Monster?\u201d Jonathan smiles, \u201cBecause I guess now I can tell you that even though a bond wouldn\u2019t seem the worst, it also doesn\u2019t seem all that rosey to me anymore.\u201d You nod, \u201cBut you still thought it would be good for me to meet as much guys around here as possible, to find out if one of them was gonna bond with me and Monster?\u201d Jonathan nods, \u201cThe moment you bonded I realised I felt nothing, so it wasn\u2019t gonna be me. guess I really hoped it was one of the nicer guys around... But instead you got Matt.\u201d  He finishes with a grin and you laugh as Matt exclaims: \u201cHEY NOW!\u201d But soon joins in with laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d. Jonathan adds, \u201cYou could\u2019ve done a little worse. But I didn\u2019t expect you to bond anyone at all. I just wanted to make sure by introducing you to the guys you weren\u2019t a TAG-er, but just a T.A., you proved me wrong. I guess when I saw Matt step up to Monster today to catch you, I realised that Monster was already bonding with him too. I\u2019m just curious who initiated the bonds. Monster or Peter.\u201d Matt answers instantly, \u201cPeter!\u201d He grins, \u201cThat\u2019s what I told him, and that\u2019s why Monster and me are slowly working on accepting each other. But we\u2019re not besties yet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan gives a grin...</span></div></div>",

You wish Matt would leave for a while so you could talk with Jonathan. Suddenly Matt gets up and says, \u201cI think I need a shower after all this adventuring today. How about I\u2019ll just come back later.\u201d  You turn and he gives you a wink before turning and leaving you alone with Jonathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door closes you turn to him and seen him looking down at you, moving around the last bite of a sandwich over his plate. \u201cI don\u2019t know why him.\u201d You say and Jonathan nods, \u201cYeah, I know, it just happens.\u201d You nod back, \u201cI think I would be just as happy if it had been you. But for some reason, it\u2019s him.\u201d Jonathan leans back, \u201cI realised I was not an option when you bonded Monster and I felt nothing. Well and Monster rejected me almost immediatly.\u201d  he sighs, \u201cStill I wonder about it sometimes. How would it feel to be so close to someone you can almost read his mind.\u201d He smiles at you, \u201cThen again, maybe a nice tiny girl will show up one day, riding a beautifull white mare and sweep me off my feet. It could happen.\u201d You grin, \u201cHow about I\u2019ll tell you how it is to be bonded to a Giant, before you go on the prowl.\u201d  Jonathan grins, \u201cSimon told me a lot too. But I think in hindsight, he might have been a bit too \u2018sunshine and rainbows\u2019 about all of it, trying to convince me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only nod, \u201cMostly it\u2019s just weird, Monster I can deal with, he\u2019s a horse, he\u2019s more honestand upfront about it. Matt is... a bit of an enigma for now. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really happy about all of this.\u201d Jonathan grins, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot you know that?\u201d You look up...\u201dWha?\u201d Jonathan laughs, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more obvious to me since I\u2019m not bonded to him.\u201d You get up and cross your arms, \u201cTell me.\u201d Jonathan grins, \u201cHe\u2019s a total microphile and attracted to you.\u201d You blink, \u201cYou\u2019re just making that up.\u201d Jonathan shakes his head, \u201cLook at the signs. He\u2019s bringing you food, he takes you out on a date, he\u2019s putting himself in harm\u2019s way for you and he just takes the whole you\u2019re gonna be bonded to this little guy for the rest of your life as a given.\u201d You shake your head, \u201cThat\u2019s because of the bond... isn\u2019t it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan shakes his head, \u201cNot any bond I\u2019ve seen. Sure being a bonder as we call those that form the bonds you can probably easily convince someof the more open bondees to do things for you, be it animal or giant. But this is way more than that. So that puts you in the awkward positionof accepting a bond and returning his feelings, or accepting the bond and rejecting them. Either way you\u2019re bond will remain.\u201d He shrugs, \u201cBest to rip of the band-aid soon if you\u2019re not gonna return his deeper feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise Jonathan isn\u2019t lying, at least he thinks he\u2019s not. \u201cOh crap, I don\u2019t wanna hurt Matt and not just because we\u2019re bonded, he\u2019s a nice kid.\u201d  Jonathan grins, \u201cWell, the only way to really hurt him, is by not being honest.\u201d He pauses for a sec, \u201cOr you may end up hurting both of you in the process. So yeah, eitherway... you\u2019re completely screwed.\u201d You sink down into a crouch. \u201cGreat, thanks for the pick-up, roomy. Remind me to call someone else when I\u2019m standing on a ledge.\u201d Jonathan grins and you add, \u201cMind putting me back in my home so I can freshen up.\u201d  Jonathan picks you up, \u201cAh, wanna be clean for your honey.\u201d You decide not to lower yourself to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your place you walk into the bathroom and turn on the shower. As the water rushes down on you, you think back on this day. It\u2019s all too much to take in, riding a horse felt great, making an enemy of the jocckeys felt scary, learning about bondings felt weird... But how do you feel about Matt? You enjoy his company sure. You feel safe with him. You think he\u2019s funny and well, to be honest to yourself, kinda cute. But do you love him? You really don\u2019t think so, right? I mean he\u2019s a boy and so are you. But then again? Why did you want to be between his thighs and why can\u2019t you stop wondering about the large scar on his leg? You turn off the hot water to take a cold shower, you really need someone else than Matt OR Jonathan to talk about this. But who... Monster isout, because your bond isn\u2019t strong enough and besides if you talk to Monster, you can just as well talk to Matt. Why didn\u2019t you listen to your mom and dad and just stayed in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the shower and get dressed in sweats and a shirt.

This way his shirt falls open a little to give you a glimpse of the deep crevice between his pectoreal muscles. \"How's our star-racer doing.\" You give him a thumbs up and wait for him to pick up one of the receivers. \"I'm okay Jason, thanks for asking.\" Jonathan makes a bit of room on the couch and Jason sits next to you. \"You gave us quite a scare. But Manuel told me to tell the others you'll be fine by tomorrow. Something about too much G-forces all at once.\" You shrug, \"I'm not as used to riding as most of you are, so I guess I need some time to adjust.\" He nods, \"So wanna go for a walk? I promised to show you some of the outdoors.\" You look at the time and figure being away when Matt returns might not be the worst thing. \"Sure, why not.\" You close your book and see Jason strap on the sash and soon you're bouncing against his pec as he walks down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside he takes a different turn than most of the others and walks towards one of the smaller trails. \"This one leads to some hills, but it's about a two hour walk. Is that okay?\" You nod, \"Sure is.\" As Jason starts walking the forest grows a bit deeper and after a while the sun is blocked by the canopy. Jason is in his element telling you about different plants you encounter, he can tell you there Latin names, and what uses they have for both medicinal purpose and which are poisonous. You really enjoy the lecture as it gives your mind time to slow down and focus on his voice and the plants around you. Before you know it the path starts to climb steadily. You hear Jason's breathing getting a bit heavier and also notice a steady increase in scent as he starts to sweat. After a while the path twists to the left and the trees suddenly make way for a large meadow at the top op a hill. As he reaches the top he turns and you can see the school in the distance. Jason climbs on top of a large boulder and sits down. \"It looks so small even compared to me.\" you murmur. Jason justs grunts in acknowledgement. \"I like how it feels so far away.\" You continue. \"It gives you a different perspective for sure.\" Jason echoes your thoughts. You wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?\" He answers, \"Yeah?\" and you take a deep breath. \"I kinda have this thing I'm trying to figure out, but I'm at a total loss when connecting the dots.\" Jason chuckles. \"Anything I can help with?\" You sigh, \"Well, you do seem in touch with your emotions  the most of all the people around here. And this is one of those feeling things.\" Jason chuckles again, \"A feelings thing, or a feelings someone?\" You blush and say nothing. \"Who do you think pointed it out to Jonathan.\" he adds a bit mockingly. \"Oh, great, does everybody know?\" Slowly Jason moves his hand to allow you to climb out the sash and he lowers you to his knee to look at you. \"Most of the boys are just as oblivious to each others feelings as you. Don't worry, besides I'd never tell someone about how he feels about you. It's also not really fair for him to see you as a replacement for his sister.\" Wait... what? Oh... \"Well, it's just I don't know if I feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gives you a grin, \"You probably know what I do when I'm not sure about things.\" You nod, \"You meditate on them.\" He nods and you add, \"but I don't know the first thing about meditation. I mean, I tried shutting my brain up under the showers, but I was never any good at sitting still and thinking nothing.\" Jason smiles and stands up, leaping down from the rock and walking over to a shadowy pass covered in moss. \"I think I can help you with that if you'll allow me to meditate with you like we did yesterday. You give him a nod, \"I think it's the closest I ever came to meditating, so let's give it a try.\" Jason grins a bit, \"Fair warning though the walk has made me a bit more moist than yesterday.\" You give him a wink, \"I think I'll be fine. I passed out once today already, so I reached my quota.\" Jason slowly takes off his pants and lowers himself into a lotus position. \"It's up to you, should I place you on the moss, or do you prefer between my undies and my skin?\" You wanna say moss, but suddenly hear yourself say, \"I think I want to be against the skin of your root chakra without the barrier.\" Jason grins happily and suddenly slides you down the front of his boxerbriefs giving you a quick glimps of his monstrous cock and balls before sliding you against the moist skin of his taint, removing his hand and lowering his full weight down on your body. \"You okay?\" You gag a second at the salty and sour taste and musky smell before replying. \"I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Jason says, \"Now close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, focus on... well, focus on my scent.\" He chuckles a little, \"Sorry this is gonna be a bit weird for me too.\" You take in a deep breath and focus on the musk. \"Now breath out slowly through your mouth.\" Try to keep an even pressure and think as if you're trying to blow me away.\" You breath out. \"Now in again.... and out. Keep this up and try to slow your pace as much as you are comfortable with.\" You do a few breaths and notice you feel like the smell is even more intense now that you focus on it. Now try to dull your other senses, focus your ears so that they only hear my voice.\" You drown out his heartbeat and the soft cracking of the moss and focus on Jason's voice. \"Now lose your sense of taste, pick on flavour component and drown out the others.\" You try to focus on the very faint hint of sweetness in Jason's sweat untill you catch it and suddenly taste no more salt or sour? \"Good, now focus on your sense of touch, try to feel... me with all your body.\" That's an easy one, just ignoring the fabric clinging to your back. \"Good, now try to synchronise your breathing with me.\" And you try to follow his breaths. which is a lot harder than it seems. \"You are now hearing me, smelling me, tasting me and feeling me, open your eyes and see me even in the darkness.\" You open your eyes. \"All your senses are now filled by my presence. Suddenly you feel the faint tugging sensation again. \"Now lose yourself in the stream of energy flowing through my chakra's and let yourself be swept up and flow through me till your spirit burst through my crown chakra and into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tugging increases and suddenly you feel yourself being pulled from your body and skyrocket through Jason's body exploding from the top of his head. and floating gently above him like a small cloud of formless energy. Next to you a small cloud of energ forms to and you realise Jason has just granted yourself and him an ot of body experience. Suddenly you feel a slight tuck on your energy and you let yourself be pulled towards it. You fly over the fields and suddenly float into the stables and find yourself hovering near Monster. The horse looks at you and gives you a snort and a wink. But than you're pulled away again. You find yourself floating in your dorm room and see Jonathan on the phone with his sister. \"Telling her about what happened and asking her to tell him what to tell you about the bonds. Next you are drawn into a strange room, you see Fredrick Williams standing in the showers. His body lean and muscled, every fibre detailed as a sculptured masterpiece you feel yourself wondering what his body would feel, taste and smell like. Fredrick is talking to himself. \"When I get my hands on that kid I'm not gonna put him in my saddle. I'm gonna shove him down my shorts and ride him all day long. And I'm gonna use him like this loofah to scrub the sweat of my entire body. Every day for the rest of his life.\" Again you're pulled away and see Trevor standing in front of the mirror, \"He actually licked my hole? I wish he'd do it again.\" Finally you see Matt sitting naked on his bed softly mumbling to himself. \"Peter, I think I more than like you, no. Peter, our bond is one thing, but it's not all I feel, no. Peter, do you like being bonded to me? No.\" He kicks his legs in frustration and suddenly sucks the air in through his teeth as you notice him grabbing the scar on his leg. \"Stupid thing! Stupid Matt! Stupid Monster! Stupid Peter! Just like me already.\" And he starts sobbing as you are carried on. You float about the school for a while untill suddenly you feel the need to return to your body. You rush back and see the small cloud of energy you know is Jason act as an anchor as you enter through his head and pass down along his spine and enter your own body again, gasping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Jason gasp too. And he slowly gets up before removing you from his underwear. \"Wow, that was intense, I never expected you to succeed at an out of body experience on your first try.\" He smiles, \"Did you find any answers?\" You slowly nod. \"More than I bargained for.\" Slowly Jason places you back in the sash and puts on his pants. He start to walk back down towards the school and you realise that there is one person above all others that you need to see now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason has to walk back almost an hour, and all the while you keep thinking about that one person you should be with.The one person that needs you now more than ever. The one person in this world that will care for you without reservations. And who you realise yourself care for a lot. It\u00b4s not just the bond, that only made things more unclear. Even before you knew of it, you felt you could talk to him, you remember asking him to help you and he did. And now your stupdity is driving him crazy and you feel horrible. If Jonas hadn\u00b4t been such a great help you would have poked him a lot to move a little faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he reaches the schoolgrounds and he enters the dorm, waking up the stairs you notice Trevor coming down and giving you a smile. \"Hey buddy, up and about? Maybe we should pick a date for our tutoringsession in math.\" You wait for Jonas to pass the receiver before answering, \"Sure thing, but I've got something else to take care of first.\" Trevor grins and passes the receiver back, \"No pressure, yet,\" he says with a wink, \"Just happy to see you out and about again.\" Jason climbs the stairs and stops in front of your dormdoor. \"Three doors down Jason.\" You say and feel him shrug before passing two more doors and giving a knock. \"Just a minute.\" Matt's voice answers and the door swings open revealing Matt wearing sweatpants and no shirt. His toned upperbody almost takes your breath away, \"What's up Jason?\" He only notices the sash a second later. \"Oh and Peter.\" Jason shrugs, \"I'm just the transport for today.\" he says with a grin. Slowly he takes off the sash with you still in it and hands it to Matt along with the receiver, \"I think he needs your help now.\" And he gives you a glance, \"Just let him down easy?\" Matt takes the sash but flinches at Jonas' words. Before turning and closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Matt misunderstood Jason, you can guess why and instead of putting on the receiver, he just tosses it on the bed and next the drops sash with you in it next to it. \"Hey.\" You scream, but Matt ignores you and walks off to the couch on the other side of the room. You loosen the straps inside of the pocket and crawl out. Walking over to the edge of he bed you try to catch Matt's attention, but he's sulking and looking at the ceiling. Crap, this isn't going as planned. You look around for something to use. But there's just a blanket, a pillow the sash and the receiver. Suddenly you realise you don't need the receiver to reach Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to his pillow, a long track for you, and you lay down, burying your nose in it sniffing deep and you find a hint of his scent. You focus on it, the smell that has a hint of cloves and nutmeg, he likes spicy foods. but also the smell of horses and clear spring water. A soft undertone of coffee and a hint of mint from his shampoo. These and many more make up Matt's scent. You bask in it, allow yourself to drown in it and find the scent echoing in your mind, finding that one deep spot hidden away where you feel there's only a black hole. A black hole you try to fill with everything Matt. You remember the strength of his thighs, the way he walks and the soft touch he uses just for you, slowly the black hole starts to fill with a sliver of light. A small flickering flame, slowly pushing against the darkness untill it slowly grows. You feed the flame everything you know about Matt, the stories about his Aunt and his family, his rambling when he walked with you. The image you have of him stripping down and swimming, slowly kindling the flame and feeling it grow. Stronger and stronger Untill suddenly it flashes and you hear Matt grunt. \"Come here you idiot.\" You scream at the flame as you turn around to see Matt clamp his hands against his ears. He veers up and glances ofer at you. \"How...\" You focus on the flame and talk, \"Because you are mine and I am yours.\" Matt takes a few steps closer, \"The bond?\" he asks, \"The bond is one thing, but it's not all we feel.\" You recall him saying something similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt closes in a little more. \"I think I more than like you, Matt. I don't know how, or why. I just know there's more to this than just the bond. It scares me to death, to be honest, but the fact remains. I know you feel it too and whatever happens next. I at least want to be honest to myself and to you. I need some time to get used to these feelings, hell, I need some time to get used to being bonded to you and a horse. The fact I can speak to you without a receiver and the fact that you're not exactly the size I figured for a date. But I'll get there. Just give me time.\" Matt closes in during your speech and sits down at the foot of the bed. \"All the time you need, I can wait.\" You look at each other. \"Just... how the hell are you talking to me.\" He suddenly says with a grin, \"Because this is freaking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \"Mood-kill Matt, strikes again.\" You say, \"It's really simple. I figured if I could talk to Monster from a distance, there should be a way for me to talk to you too. Jason gave me a crash course in meditation and I looked for the link in my mind and found it. So I kinda just thought about you and presto, we've got a connection. I just hope I can turn it off too.\" Suddenly Matt dives forward and sweeps you up bringing you in close for a hug against his bare chest. \"Don't you dare turning that link down. I want to be able to hear you like this, for the rest of my life. Even if you will never truely love me in every way imaginable, I'm just so happy you care.and tell me it's not just the bond.\" You stretch your arms out across his chest and put your cheek against his warm pec. you can hear his heartbeat, it's very comforting.\" Slowly Matt pulls you back and lowers you to the bed before lying down next to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Matt lies down, you slowly get up and move a little closer, slowly reaching out untill you touch his side\", the tanned skin is silky to the touch. You feel warm and strong muscles and mumble, \"You look just perfect like that.\" Matt chuckles, \"I'm far from perfect, you know what's on my leg.\" You slowly walk down towards the edge of his pants sliding your hand along his skin, feeling him twitch as you're tickling him. \"Show me\" You say, and Matt reaches down and slowly lowers his pants. You expected him to be naked under there, but he's also wearing some black boxer-briefs. Slowly you make your way to te leg of the underwear and see the scar stretch out from unde it. You walk along to where it ends, just above the knee. \"Does it still hurt?\" Matt answers, \"Only when it's really called or when I move too fast.\" You slowly stretch out your hand and touch it. It feels more leathery than silky and the colour is a dark red. \"How did you get it?\" Matt twitches. \"Bull horn.\" Slowly you start to walk back up, keeping your hand on the scar. \"I think it only adds character, showing perfection through imperfection.\" Matt chuckles. \"Thanks, but you don't need to lie about it.\" You grin as you keep walking, \"You'd know if I was lying.\" Suddenly you reach the leg of his underwear as the scar dissapears under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you stretch out your hand and pull the underwear open a little. Matt twitches, \"What are you doing.\" You pull a little harder and stick your leg into his underwear, \"Relax will you, I just wanna see the hole thing.\" You slide your torso under the elastic band, becoming stuck for a second as it pulls tight as Matt flexes his thigh. But soon you can pull the rest of you in and you feel the band close behind you with a snap. \"This is getting weird.\" Matt says, but you know he doesn't mean it. Slowly you follow along by touch untill you reach the end of the scar jus below his buttock. \"Bend your leg will you.\" Matt slowly bends his leg at the knee and you feel his buttcheek tighten. You push yourself into the underwear until Matt finishes and you know feel an opening under his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but steadily you sqeeuze under his leg. Creeping forward inch by inch till you reach the other side of the leg and by the little light filtered by his undies you see yourself standing in front of his taint and you notice a small cave at the bottom. You relax your muscles and let the underwear pull you closer into the musky skin. \"Oh.\" Matt sighs and you give the skin a slow soft kiss. \"Oho.\" Matt cringes. And you go one stepbending your knees a little and talking a long lick stretching your legs in the process for maximum coverage. \"Oh gods.\" Matt gasps. His taste is salty and sweet at the same time, with a hint of bitter, like a salt-rimmed long island ice-tea you think for some reason. Slowly you kneel down, deeper and deeper kissing his skin as you go. Leaning back you stretch the fabric behind you so you can slowly enter your head and shoulders into the small cave of his crack. You twist aound a little to get on your back, Matt twitches too as you move around in his underwear. But finally you twist around. Using your arms and legs you slowly pull yourself into the dark musky cave and kiss the skin on your way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jezus, Mary and Jozef.\" Matt exhales softly clenching his butt a little, giving you even more hold to pull yourself in deep and already slick of his sweat you suddenly pop in and feel your face meeting Matt's pucker. \"Uuuuuuh.\" Matt groans and as you take a long lick, tasting the ass of your bondmate. He slowly clenches hard giving you a very close inspection of his powerfull sphincter muscle and filling your face, nose and mouth with a viscous fluid and a taste-explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the next moment you suddenly feel Matt rolling over and see the light go down as he quickly pulls up his pants. Only a second later you hear why as the door opens and closes and a familiar voice says, \"Hey Roomy? Taking a nap?\" You hear Matt yawning a little, faker, you think. \"Yeah, just laying down actually, so hope you don't mind if I don't get up.\" You groan as you suddenly recognise the voice...</span></div></div>",

You think to yourself, anyone but him! \"A nap doesn't sound too bad before studying.\" You hear bedsprings creak as Trevor lays down in his own bed. \"By the way, I saw our boy a while back. With Jason of all people. I figured he'd be hanging out with Jonathan or his horse, Or maybe even you. But Jason and him together. It's a weird combination.\" Matt grunts, \"But guess anything can happen.\" Trevor continues. Especially at his size, I guess Jason has a bit of a softer side to him that seems less threatening than some of the others. I think he might be a bit on the queer side, not that it bothers me if he is, just don't expect me to do him\" Trevor laughs at his own joke. His joke however has a effect on Matt. You feel him clenching a little tighter. \"Then again, I don't think it matters if it's a girl or a boy sucking your dick, licking your balls or eating your ass. As long as I'm not gonna have to acknowledge it too much. Jeez, you think does that guy ever shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever gotten your ass licked, roomy. I tell you, there's worse things\" Suddenly Matt sighs, \"Trev... can you just shut up? I'm trying to catch my fourty winks here.\" Trevor chuckles, \"Need your beauty sleep, aye, pretty boy? I hear ya.\" For a moment it does seem Trevor will shut up untill he starts up again. \"So do you think it's possible for a tiny to be attracted to a giant?\" Matt groans, \"Yes Trevor, If guys can date girls and they can date guys and there are even those going about fucking animals, I suppose tinies can also be attracted to giants.\" Trevor sighs, \"True, otherwse the word macrophilia would make no sense.\" Matt answers, \"And I suppose that means microphilia is a thing too.\" Trevor chuckles, \"Well I guess someone like me has to be attracted to beings smaller than himself. I just wonder how small I'd be willing to go for something serious.\" Matt stays silent, but Trevor knows how to fill it up. \"I guess there's no other way to find out by trying different things.\" Suddenly Matt asks with a bit of sarcasm, \"So I guess if you don;t know what you like, you're probably a virgin.\" Trevor growls a little. \"Don't you worry about me. I've had my share of pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparantly pissing him off coes quiet down Trevor for a while. \"Ugh, I can't sleep with the sun still out. I guess I'm just gonna sit and read for a while.\" There goes your hope of Trevor falling asleep and Matt being able to pull you out unnoticed. \"Matt,\" you whisper and he clenches his cheeks softly in response. \"Get up and go see Jonathan, he'll understand.\" Matt doesn't move at first, but after a few minutes he does slowly roll over putting pressure on you as he sits up and quickly stands. You feel him putting on a shirt and he says, \"I'm gonna check up on Jonathan.\" Trevor grunts and slowly Matt starts walking grinding you against his hole with every step. As soon as the door closes he spees up a little and you hear him knock at a second door. \"It's open.\" You hear a door open and you hear Jonathan's voice, \"Hey Matt.\" And a second voice, \"Hey matt\" you recognise Tom's voice. \"Peter's not here.\" Jonathan says, but you can join me and Tom for tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slowly walks over and sits down on one of the hard wood kitchenchairs. Pushing down on you hard. teatime is a bit of a torment like this. You can hardly hear anything because Matt's ass is sealing you in. You know you can't talk, because Jonathan will hear you and you're not sure if Tom has a receiver on. Finally after what seems like a lifetime Matt gets up. \"See you around Tom.\" You hear a door slam and finally you can't hold it in anymore, \"Please get me out.\" Jonathan reacts with a surprised, \"What the...\" But Matt is even more quick about stuffing his hand down his pants and scooping you up. placing you on the table as you catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan walks over. \"Ah, so I guess you two got your talk... and than some.\" You find enough strength to flip him off. Making him chuckle as he sits down and pours you a cup of lukewarm tea. You sit up and take a thankfull sip. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry!\" Matt says, but you wave it away, \"Not your fault... well not all of it.\" You take another sip, \"Besides you've got a nice ass, but next time let's take it a little slower.\" Matt grins, \"Oh... next time.\" You give him a nod. \"So.\" Jonathan breaks in, does this mean you two confessed your love and are now not only bonded, but also dating.\" You shrug, \"I guess so. Matt grins, \"What he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan smiles gently and get up, you see him walk over to his dresser and come back with something you recognise. \"Guess you'll be needing these then.\" And he tosses Matt a similar pair of undies he wore the other day. Matt catches it and looks at it. \"What's this.\" He unfolds the undies and takes a look. Suddenly he blushes a bit. \"Oh... I think I get it, but that's...\" He glances at you. \"You'd never agree to that!\" You give him a wink. \"Keep'em, you never know when they might come in handy.\" Matt shakes his head, \"No way, that would be suicide, or tinycide or...\" you grin, \"Or extremely hot to be an unaware part of your underwear for a while.\" Jonathan grins, \"You can wear them to the gym. So Peter can get his work-out in too.\" You give Jonathan a look, \"Don't give him any ideas, he's not even my trainer yet.\" Matt blinks, \"Trainer?\" You swallow a curse as Jonathan grins. \"Tiny-trainers get tinies used to extreme circumstances so they know how to survive them. I trained a few and I was gonna train Peter a bit. But well, that would be wrong now. Even if you normally train a tiny with at least two people.\" Matt grins, \"So, Peter agreed to training with you?\" Jonathan nods, \"Well I guess everything a proffesional can teach him can only come in handy, so don't let me stand in your way. As long as you also train me to train him.\" You give Matt a glance, \"Hey, don't I get a say in this.\" He looks down, \"No, you already made that commitment, so I'm not letting you back out if Jonathan doesn't.\" Jonathan chuckles. \"Sure, I'm game.\" You sigh. \"Fine, just don't get jealous if I start to like Jonathan more than you Matt.\" Matt laughs and taps you on the back with his finger, \"I'm not worried about that. Not in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jonathan looks at Matt, \"You're not wearing your receiver?\" Matt shakes his head, \"Wait, you can communicate without one already? And even in words, not just emotions?\" You shrug, \"I guess so, Jonas taught me some mind-over-matter principle thingy and here we are.\" Jonathan smirks, \"It sounds really deep when you say it like that.\" you shrug again, \"Sorry, all this bonding, meditating, out-of-body experiences and mind-control shizzle. It's a bit too much for a down-to-earth kind of boy like me.\" Jonathan smirks, \"Out-of-body experience.\" Matt chimes in, \"I'm curious about that too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalm yourself, \"Well Jason took me for a walk and taught me to meditate and I got an out-of body experience and visited some places.\" Matt and Jonahan lean in closer as Matt asks, \"What places.\" You avoid their gazes. \"The stables, My room.\" Jonathan asks, \"And my room?\" You nod and continue, \"Fredrick Williams' Room, and you.\" You look at Matt, you leave out Trevor just because that is TMI. \"What did you see.\" Jonathan and Matt ask at the same time. \"I saw you on the phone with Molly,\" You say to Jonathan, \"and, I saw you confessing your feelings to me, Matt.\" Matt blinks and you add, \"It's when I realised I shared them too and I made Jason bring me to you.\" Matt smiles gently, he's not mad, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?\" Matt suddenly asks, \"why did Jason tell you to let me down easy?\" You completely forgot, \"Oh, that wasn't about you, that was about him.\" you point at Jonathan. \"Jonas thinks he has a crush on me.\" Jonathan blinks, once, twice and suddenl burst out a roaring laugh, so catchy both you and Matt join in. \"That makes more sense.\" Matt says after catching his breath. Jonathan asks, \"But why did you visit Fredrick?\" You shrug, \"It was my first time, I think I just visited people that had me on their mind at the time.\" Matt shakes his head, \"I don't think it's a good thing you were on his mind.\" You shudder at the memory, \"No, it wasn't a good thing.\" Jonathan looks down, \"What did he say or do. Unfortunately you can remember it vividly, seeing the gourgeous man in the shower saying: \"When I get my hands on that kid I'm not gonna put him in my saddle. I'm gonna shove him down my shorts and ride him all day long. And I'm gonna use him like a loofah to scrub the sweat of my entire body. Every day for the rest of his life.\" Matt and Jonathan veer up, Jonathan a bit shocked, but Matt steaming with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's safe to say we have to keep you away from him.\" Jonathan concludes. You give him a wink, \"I don't know, there are worse things I can imagine than being scraped along his perfect body like a loofah.\" Suddenly you feel Matt grabbing you from behind and turning you to him, a bit of a smoldering look. \"You think that's a joke?\" You give him an apologetic grin, \"Well, yeah?\"  Matt gets up and looks at Jonathan, \"Do you mind if we use your shower for training purposes.\" Jonathan leans back with a smile, \"Not at all.\" You gulp. Matt's kidding right...</span></div></div>",

I think that would be letting you off easy. Since I have no clue how much you can take and besides I showered only two hours ago.\" He looks up, \"Why, Jonathan, why don't you show my little boyfriend what it feels like to be a loofah. You look like you haven't showered since this morning. And well you know a bit more on proper training techniques. Why don't you take this one.\" You gasp and turn to Jonathan, \"Don't you dare.\" Jonathan grins, \"You know, trying to discourage me by being bossy isn't really the best way to go at it.\" You roll your eyes at Matt, \"Please Matt, don't make him do this. I'm really sorry.\" Matt looks down at you still sense a lot of rage and you wonder why, \"I could always take you to meet Frederick himself, but I think you're better off facing the music with Jonathan or me.\" For some reason you realise there's no getting out of it, Matt is really gonna make you go through with this. You lower your eyes. \"Fine. If it will make you happy and stops you from being so angry.\" You turn your head to Jonathan, \"Guess I'm gonna have to ask you to step up. If you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan gets up with a slight smile. \"Very well, I guess I could use a shower.\" Matt hands you over to him and says, \"I will no if you're going easy on him. So don't.\" You give Matt one last desperate look, \"Just so you know, I probably would have done it for you if you had asked me. Now I only do it to prove something. It doesn't feel the same.\" Matt ignores you and Jonathan carries you into the bathroom. As he enters the room he steps over to the shower and places you in the soapdish before turning away. You collapse and sit down pulling your knees to your chest, wrapping your arms around them. As you look up you see Jonathan taking his shirt off, revealing his broad shoulders and slender waist. Bending forward he lowers his pants and you get a full moon view of the first ass you ever volunteered to be under. Slowly Jonathan turns and you see his massive pecs, slightly defined six-pack and even lower his monstrous member At least two times your size even in its flacid state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he steps into the shower he gives you a soft smile, \"Don't worry about it, it'll be over in no time and well, I guess it had to happen one of these days anyway. At least I hope your happy it's with me and not with Fredrick.\" You look up, \"I already disliked Fredrick, so it wouldn't be a big deal if he did it. I'm just not sure I'm gonna like you after this.\" Jonathan shrugs, \"Guess we'll find out in about half an hour.\" And he turns on the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he lets the water run over his entire body, but after a minute or so he lowers his hand to you and you climb on. As you lie in his palm he slowly lifts his other arm and raises you into his hairy and dank pit. At that precise moment you give in to the bond with Matt and push at it hard. Sending every bit of sensation you feel through it, the feeling of the rough hairs, the taste of sweat, the pressure, the smell and the helplessness as you are being scraped up and down. Suddenly a load knock sounds at the bathroom door. \"STOP IT.\" You hear Matt yell, but this is payback and you tell Jonathan, \"Just keep going, he needs this lesson too.\" Jonathan looks down at you and grins, \"You're a bit of a bastard, aren't you.\" You give him a wink before he slides you into his other pit. Again you push everything towards Matt. As you are removed from the pit you notice the knocking has gotten weaker and you hear a soft sob, \"Please, no more.\" You pressure Jonathan, \"Just one more, let's give him a sense of what it's like to not only be an ass, but to be in one.\" Jonathan gives you a look. \"Are you sure.\" You nod and he slowly lowers you into his crack, scraping you down, you taste sweat, skin and musk and by the end even a little slimey stuff. It is all a taste explosion, salt, sour, bitter and a little sweet. Your nose feels like it's burning up from the scraping and the scent of man-ass. Finally you are retreived and you clearly hear Matt heaving on the other side of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan lowers you to the bathroom floor as he finishes his shower and you make the track towards the door. Slowly you crawl under the door and suddenly you see Matt sitting with his back against the bed. Eyes red and puffy and when he notices you he looks away. \"I'm sorry.\" he whispers, I just got so mad of the thought that you would rather have someone else abuse you than be with me. I snapped.\" He swallows, \"I never imagined how it would be for you. I'm the worst person ever.\" You walk up to him and put your hand on his bare anckle. \"You're not Matt. If anything I was thoughtless too, making a joke out of it. And I was even crueler in letting Jonathan continue after you begging him to stop.\" You blush, \"I'm just not aware of how much stamina I build up on torture over the years. Sending you all those images and senses, that was just plain abuse from my side.\" He finally looks at you, \"I deserved it.\" You shake your head, \"No Matt, you didn't, neither did I deserve your anger. But we're gonna make mistakes. This is all as new to you as it is to me. And well.\" you shrug, \"Neither of us is handling it very well so far.\" Matt smiles a little. \"Guess that's the true training we need. Living with someone else. But I promise, I'll never put you through something like that, ever.\" You give him a sly grin, \"Never say never, who knows, maybe some day I'll feel up to the task to explore your body like that. But I think we should take it a little slower for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nods, \"Just a little then.\" As he picks you up softly to hug you. All of a sudden Matt and you both gasp at the same time as a strange feeling comes over you both...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Monster!\" you both exclaim at the same time. Suddenly well aware of your nudeness you tell Matt to get you to your balcony, you run in, pick up the first pants and shirt you see and run out. Matt grabs you and stuffs you down his pocket. As he runs out you are jostled around while trying to work youself into your pants and shirt. Just as you finish putting it on you hear Manuel's voice in the distance. \"I'm warning you. Monster is not a race-horse, you're not getting him.\" Matt speeds up a little as you hear Fredrick's voice react. \"It's really not up to you anymore. I got permission to take him.\" Suddenly Matt stops and says, \"No one is taking Monster.\" He slowly grabs you from his pocket and as you come out you see Manuel and two jockey's standing near Monster's paddock with a rope and a strange looking head-collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Fredrick answers, \"And who are you to order me around, STUDENT?\" The emphasis on the last word make's you boil on the inside. Fredrick gives you a glance. \"And look you even brought our little friend along with you. Good, because he's going to be transferred along with Monster, headmasters orders. So hand him over.\" slowly your vision starts to redden. \"You're not putting one hand on me or Monster.\" Even as you realise Fredrick can't hear you, you hear your voice echo from Matt's mouth, you notice the bond between you pulse and realise he's not echoing you, but saying the words at the exact same time, including the tone. It sounds really dreadfull even to yourself. \"Back down Fredrick,\" you continue, \"You will never have me or my partners for your team.\" Fredrick scoffs, \"You're partners? You're wrong my tiny friend, Monster is school property, and as far as the headmaster is concerned, so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the jockey's the one with the rope takes a step towards Monster's paddock. Suddenly you let out a cry of anger, this one is not only mirrored by Matt, but also by Monster. The jockey steps back quickly. Frederick takes the rope with force and glances at you, \"That's a neat trick, but you'd best safe your energy for later.\" He steps towards the paddock and again you let out a cry. This time it is mirrored by Matt, Monster, Manella and a few more horses. from the rafters two cats jump down at the other end of the barn and hiss. \"Step away, Fredrick.\" You hear Matt announce your words. Next to Matt suddenly two chickens, a dog and a rabbit appear. You hear even more sounds outside. All of your senses are burning with new sounds, new smells and most of all unacquited rage. You hear Manuel gasp and say, \"Be carefull Williams, don't push him too far.\" A large magpie lands on Matt's shoulder and a Raven lands on a nearby paddock door. \"What this?\" Fredrick says with a smirk. \"More tricks, you're telling me all off these animals are here to help the poor tiny?\" A loud buzzing announces the swarm of bees flying in and hovering over Matt in a swarm.  Letting out one more scream, all the gathered animals mirror it, making for a deafening, cacophonic roar. From behind Matt you hear the roar mirrored by several more creatures you didn't even see come in. Suddenly you see Jonathan stepping up next to Matt, only wearing some shorts, probably he just put them on before he came running. You notice he's not even wearing shoes. And even from this distance you can see Bella poking out her head from Manuel's pocket. the cats advance together with a large snake that entered through the back, a few rats and mice and you even notice a few toads or frogs, you can never tell which is which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone and every creature that is suspectible to a bond has come to your aid it appears. \"Stop this nonsense, right now.\" you hear Fredrick say, but his voice isn't all too steady anymore. The two jockeys are standing close together, their backs against each other. Suddenly you hear yourself from Matt's mouth, Jonathan's mouth and even Manuel is now mirroring your words, \"The only one that can stop the madness is you Fredrick, drop the rope and leave, or we will end the madness for you.\" You hear the animals behind you shuffle and know there's a path being created and you turn all heads to the jockeys. \"Leave... Now!\" slowly at first they move towards you, but they soon run past you and out of the stables. Only Fredrick is standing strong, grasping the rope and bending over to pick up the headgear the second jockey dropped. \"Noone ever told me I can't have something I wanted.\" You shake your head and answer in multiple voices, \"Then let me be the first to deny you. You CAN'T have us. Suddenly a large barnowl sweeps overhead and silently flies down grabbing the rope and pulling it from Fredrick's grip. At the same time both of the cats race forward and clamp on to Fredricks legs. He screams in pain and drops the headgear. A dog runs forward to grab it and runs to the back, carrying it in his mouth. After which the cats retreat too. Fredrick stares at his empty hands and suddenly gazes at you with a look so full of hatred you almost pity him. \"This is not over. This will never be over.\" In one last desperate move he....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However the sole Magpie on Matt's shoulder is quicker. He dives forward immediatly and before Fredrick can react the magpie takes out his right eye. Fredrick stumbles and falls, grabbing his now bleeding eye-socket. Screaming! You see feel Manuel, Matt and Jonathan snap out of their trance as you feel there is no more danger. The three of them look around, most of the animals around you seem to have lost their connection to you too. Birds fly off, the snake slithers away and only a handfull of critters remain, looking around. As Matt looks around you are given a show at exactly how much animals were gathered behind you, seeing a goat, a few ducks, a donkey and is that a cougar slipping out the stables?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan and Manuel dash forward to pick up Fredrick, Matt however passes him without looking and runs to the Paddock where Monster is kept. Monster comes forward too and you see the horse nuzzle Matt's face making him chuckle as he uses his free had to rub the horse under his chin. Next he gives you a friendly soft nuzzle, pushing you down on Matt's palm. The three of you share a worthless feeling of love and devotion. untill the moment is suddenly broken as Fredrick screeches, \"I will get you expelled for this.\" Matt turns around and says, \"How would you expell him? Are you really gonna spin a tale on how one tiny controlled a magpie to poke out your eye? Or are you gonna say he did it? Admitting a strong champion like you has been bested by a tiny. That wouldn't look good on your resume, if you can't even handle one student.\" Manuel looks at Matt with a look of both amusement and anger, \"Shut up Matt.\" He turns to Jonathan, \"run into the back and call an ambulance.\" He turns back to Fredrick. \"Don't touch it, it'll get infected. Just stand up and let me walk you outside.\" He gives Matt one more look, \"You two.... wait in my office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slowly follows Jonathan into the office and you hear Jonathan calling 911 and telling them there was an accident and someone lost an eye. As he hangs up Matt has already taken a seat and placed you on the table. Jonathan takes the other chair, Manuel's chair and glances down at you. \"What the hell just happened, one moment I was in the shower, the next I'm standing in the stables, just wearing a pair of shorts and seeing Fredrick crying on the floor missing an eye.\" You look back at Matt, \"Do you remember what happened?\" Matt nods, \"All of it, suddenly I felt you push against me and I kinda let you take control. But I was there with you the whole time.\" You nod and turn to Jonathan, \"Well I think somehow I got so mad I just used my bonding abilities to call on everything and everyone near enough to come help me.\" Jonathan gives you a look, \"I'm not bonded to anyone.\" You nod, \"I think that doesn't mean you can't be. Because you were open enough for me to call on you. Jonathan blinks, \"So you're saying we're going to bond?\" You grin, \"I don't know about that, I sure hope I'm not gonna bond the whole menagerie that I just called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not likely to happen, thank the heavens.\" You are startled by Manuels voice as he enters. \"What you did was very dangerous and highly irresponsible.\" He slowly lowers Bella to the table and she rushes over, \"Are you okay?\" She feels your forehead and pulse. \"How did you call on so many?\" Manuel is handing out the receivers so the others can hear Bella and also takes one of the spare receivers so he can hear you. \"I don't know.\" You answer honestly, \"I just got really mad, and a little scared, which got me more mad. And I needed to protect Monster.\" Bella nods, \"I understand, but I think it's best we get a bonded pair out here ASAP to teach you how to properly control your bonding abilities. Do you have any idea what could have happened?\" You shake your head, and she give you a sad look, \"One of the worst things that could have happened would be a mind-fracture, or maybe in this case a complete mind-collapse leaving a piece of your mind in every creature and person you bonded for the moment.\" You shake at the thought and process her words, \"So wait? I did bond all of the animals and people?\" She nods, \"It's a force-bond where you take over their minds for a while. None of the animals or people will know what's going on, it's actually a complete violation of privacy.\" You look at Bella, Manuel and Jonathan, \"I'm really sorry for that.\" Jonathan nods and Manul gives you a grin. \"Well, it's not a total loss.\" You see Bella glance at him with a smile. \"Wait? are you two bonded now?\" Bella turns to you. \"We tried many times, but Manuel never seemed to have the potential. I guess your fury found a small point of entry I never could.\" Manuel grins again, \"And you tore it open like my mind was made out of paper. But when I came true I suddenly could hear Manella poke in my head. Just a really happy thought that she could finally send me her love. Of course I immediatly checked for Bella and I could suddenly... feel her.\" Bella grins too, \"Guess we should thank Fredrick for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan suddenly gets up. \"I guess once again I'm the only one who gets left out of being bonded, how great is that.\" You look at him and say, \"Jonathan, wait...\"But he stomps of and slams the door behind him. \"Poor kid.\" Bella says, \"it's always so sad if you find you can't have something you really want.\" You nod, \"I'm just scared for him, if I tore open Manuel's bonding-ability, maybe I did the same to him.\" Bella nods, \"If that's the case, he may need to visit the center soon, to find out if a suitable bond-mate is there for him. Or he might keep looking.\" You look back at the door he just slammed, \"No, Manuel says, a tiny has never bonded more than one human.\" You turn your head in shock as if Manuel read your mind. He just grins down, \"Easy guess,\" he said, \"And to be completely honest, I wouldn't know if it was possible, mainly because we were thaught that what you did today shouldn't have been possible either. No tiny ever force-bonded more than three other creatures. You not only called on at least 10 times that amount, you also force-bonded Bella and two humans.\" Bella nods an agreement, \"Just remember that you already have one bonded pair. Nobody knows what will happen if you bond another human, will the bond merge or will you have to seperate bonds to worry about, slowly driving you insane. Especially if you have to deal with the loss of one of your bond-mates.\" Matt chuckles, and you give him a look, \"At least then you can take over his body and leave me alone.\" you give him a grin, \"You've got a weird sense of humour.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you turn your head at the same time as Matt, you feel an urgent call coming from Monster and Matt gets up and takes you as you open the door you see Jonathan sitting on the ground, his back towards you and he's holding something close to him. As you slowly move forward you notice it's a very large hare, mainly because the ears give it away poking over Jonathan's shoulder. As you come closer the rest of the head pokes up too and you see it stare at you curiously. All of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment you lay eyes on the massive hair you see its ears twitch in your direction. The nose wobbles once, twice and suddenly a searing pain shoots through you head. All you can do is scream once. Before fainting. You wake up slowly hearing only pieces of a conversation:<br>\r\n\"... mind not capable...\"<br>\r\n\"... Help him...\"<br>\r\n\"... Time...\"<br>\r\n\"... going insane...\"<br>\r\n\"... touch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world snaps into place again and you find yourself lying on something soft. You feel horsehair. Slowly you sit up and notice it's pretty dark you hear a soft whiney and look back to see to familiar yellow eyes. Suddenly a shape next to the horse starts to move. \"Peter?\" it's Matt's voice, \"Are you awake.\" You shake your head to clear it, \"I think so.\" Suddenly something jumps up on the horse next to you. The shape in the dark is hard to make out in general, but two pointy ears give it away. \"Tara\" you know the name of this hair, you don't know why. Until you realise you know exactly why. But before the thought finishes, next to Matt another shape moves a bit. \"Are you okay?\" Jonathan's voice. \"You let the hare sniff you and she give you a soft lick with a raspy tongue. \"I don't know.\" You answer, you still feel dazed and disoriented. \"What happened.\" Slowly Matt and Jonathan move around Monster sitting between the legs of the laying horse leaning their heads down one on either side. Tara the hair crawls a little closer and sits behind you so you can rest your back against her warm flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan clears his throat. \"When I walked out on you, I stopped at Monster's Paddock and for the first time he didn't snap at me. which in itself was freaky enough. But I didn't want his pity so I turned to storm out. But a little farther I saw a hare sitting to the side completely relaxed and as I moved closer she suddenly raised her ears and stood. When she hopped over to me I just felt a wave of amusement come over me and a second wave of recognition. When I crouched down she jumped into my arms and suddenly I felt a warmth I never thought I'd feel. I heard Monster call you. I don't know how, but I heared him and then you two came walking over and suddenly you were screaming and you fainted.\" Jonathan becomes silent and Matt takes over. \"Manuel and Bella came running out and they told us to take you back into the office and all but kicked us out. You were babbling non-stop, like in a seizure, it almost sounded like words, but not quite, like some strange language only you knew. After a while they called us in and told us that this is why there were no records of mutliple bonds, a mind is not capable of forming a larger bond than three.\" Jonathan picks up again. \"So we asked if there was anything we could do to help you. And Bella said only time would tell if you could survive, but she wasn't hopefull. And even if you woke up you might end up going insane from the pressure. There was only one tiny person who was known to ever bond with more than one animal and one giant. He was known as the hive-mind and ended up comatose, living only through his bondmates, they said they could feel him locked away behind their eyes. They eventually killed themselves trying to free him, which ended up killing him too.\"Matt finishes the story, \"So Bella suggested the only thing she could imagine, getting you as close to all your bonded as possible, that's why we ended up sleeping here in Monster's paddock. He wasn't particularly fond of it at first, but apparantly him and Tara get along fine. It's just us he didn't want to share his straw with untill Bella told him it was for you.\" Monster lets out a soft purring sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you catch your breath again and open your mind, you feel like your brain is filled with small holes, some holes are just black, but a few of them shine in the darkness like stars. Four of them to be exact. From those starts you feel you bondmates send you their energy. Monster and Tara seem to be doing it on purpose, whereas Matt and Jonathan don't even seem aware. \"Peter?\" Matt asks. \"I'm sorry,\" you say, \"I was just zoning out for a second.\" Matt sighs, \"Don't do that. It scares the hell out of us.\" Wait did he say, but Matt continues just as confused, \"Wait, did I say us?\" Jonathan chuckles softly. \"Oh crap, are you gonna be reading my mind now?\" Suddenly down the line a horse whineys and you realise it's Manella. Ony a few minutes later you see a dark shape in front of the Paddock. \"Is he up?\" Manuel's voice a hushed tone. \"Yeah he is sort of.\" Jonathan answers. \"Good.\" Manuel answers, \"In the morning there will be a transport ready to take the five of you to one of the trainingfacilities of the center. I cleared your classes for the rest of the week, so you have some catching up to do if you get back.\" Wait why did Manuel say if? \"you should get some rest. And don't try to work on your bond Peter, You've over-exerted yourself in a very dangerous way today. If you keep going at it like that, you're gonna end up hurting yourself and those closes to you.\" With that Manuel walks away. The five of you stay quiet for a while. Suddenly you feel Hester stretching out on her side. Next you see Matt and Jonathan lay down on their sides facing each other and using Monster as a pillow, they stretch out their hands and interwine their fingers before lowering their hands over you like a blanket.

ANYTHING, but no females (reduced to rare mentions.) and no death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoads of gift points for good additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginal story by <b>World Shaking</b>.
