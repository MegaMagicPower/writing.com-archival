You are quietly laughing to yourself as you work on your latest chemical concoction, one that will temporarily change you into a living toy doll. Only, you know that your sister does not have any boy dolls so you make the serum so that it will also temporarily change your gender as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou intend to use the formula so you can sneak into your sisters room and raise havoc with her. You will maintain your own strength and speed but at a doll's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there are certain risks involved in this little raid.\" you think to yourself. \"She is a practitioner of Black Magic, which means she could, in theory, change the conditions of my transformation and have her fun with me for violating her personal space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself. \"But then, without risk, this would not be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the finished serum and leave your secret laboratory to the basement. Form there, you walk upstairs and down one hall to the door of your sister's bedroom. You push the door open ajar and then drink the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you start to change. Two round orbs appear on your chest and grow into an ample pair of breasts as your male organ vanishes becoming nothing but skin. Fortunately for you, dolls are not anatomically correct. Your hips push outward, making your bottom more profound, while your face becomes feminine and your hair turns blond and grows down to your waist. Then rest of your body conforms to the shape of a woman. Finally, your skin turns silky smooth as your body begins to quickly shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get too small, you reach into your jeans and retrieve a tiny remote. You press a button and your clothing vanishes, taking the remote with them.  Soon, you are in the form of a six inch naked woman bu the changes are not yet done. Your skin turns to plastic and rubber, making you the perfect living doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your new form and giggle in a high, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" you laugh. \"It worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on to your mischief.  You enter the room and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You where laying on her bed, waiting for her when she entered the bedroom. She was instantly annoyed, seeing you on her bed. Clearly, she was very angry that you had invaded her personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my room, you mad science nerd!?!\" she asked, angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you a little something.\" you said, smiling mischievously. \"I wanted to surprise you with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith that, you quickly aimed a gun like device at her and pulled the trigger. An eerie green light shot from it and zapped your sister before she could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you hit me with, you whacked out weirdo!?!\" screamed Chris, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm a nerd?\" you asked, laughing. \"Just wait. That ray I hit you with will physically transform you and your clothes into that of a 'real' nerd!\" you laughed again. \"For one hour, you know what a nerd looks and sounds like by just gazing into the mirror!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned red with anger for a moment then suddenly gave you the same mischievous smile. \"Oh really?\" she asked. \"Well, hows this for a twist?\" she then said something in Latin, waving her hand at you. \"I just cast a spell on you that will make you receive the same fate! Change me back and I will reverse my spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore another word could be said, you both began to feel strange, the transformation had begun. It started with yours and Chis' shoes. you looked down to see your shoes ahd changed from string tie to Velcro. Yours were white with the TMNT logo on them while Chris' shoes were black with the Pokemon logo. You turned to her and she crossed her arms, tapping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting.\" she said.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Soon, they had become a loose fitting pair of pair of black jeans. The TMNT again appeared upon your ankle socks, only they were now shin highs, drooping down embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cancel your spell, Chris!\" you warned. \"This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started this, Jan!\" countered Chris. \"You reverse your ray's effects and I will reverse my spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Christina`s skirt came together and grew longer, becoming a pair of purple jeans that where a little to big for her, as a belt appeared on her with a belt buckle in the from of a Pokeball. Her -T-shirt then changed color to yellow with Pikachu on it as her socks became thicker and where suddenly covered with Pokeballs.

Able to see again you turn to the door and as you shuffle out of it you call to your sister in a nasally voice, \"I think it's high time we upscaled these sporadic confrontations into full scale warefare. Science and Machinery against Incantations and Blasphemy.

How does that sound?\u201d she said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez sis\u2026 That would be really nice for a change!\u201d I laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll love it!\u201d she said, as she grabbed a notebook out of her backpack and started jotting down a few verses out of the old spell book which lay on the bed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou promise me that you\u2019re not going to cast any spell on me that will hurt me, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then\u2026 I\u2019ll take your word for it, sis!\u201d I said to Chris as I got up and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went into my room and started reading a book for school until I became sleepy and dozed off in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after I had fallen asleep, Chris came into my bedroom, holding a small rubber balloon which was completely deflated. She held the balloon in one hand, and a piece of paper in the other. As she held the balloon in her hand, she pressed the balloon up against my chest while I slept, reading several verses out loud which were written on the sheet of paper. By doing this, she had enchanted the balloon and cast a spell on me; binding the size of my muscles to the size of the balloon, which she held in her hand. The little red balloon was now ready for action but I didn\u2019t know it, since I was sound asleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got up the following morning, I walked over to the full-body mirror and admired my reflection as I took the time to slowly wake up from my slumber. While I was standing there with my back facing the door, Chris had quietly opened the bedroom door, and observed what I was doing. It was then that she placed the spout of the enchanted balloon between her lips, and she gently started blowing air into the small, rubber object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exact same moment that she blew air into the balloon, I felt a slight tingling sensation all over my body, specifically over every single muscle! Then, out of the blue, every muscle on my body began to inflate! It was just as if the balloon was inflating my muscles with more muscle at the same time as Chris was blowing air into the balloon which she was holding in her hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What\u2019s happening?\u201d I gasped, as I noted my biceps grow bigger, my pectorals become rounder and my calves bulge out, all at the same time! Not only that, but I was overcome by an increased surge of physical strength which felt awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just gained a few more pounds of muscle, bro!\u201d Chris laughed, as she showed the balloon in her hand. \u201cAll thanks to this!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe it! My muscles were being inflated\u2026 by a balloon! I had to admit that this spell was certainly among the coolest ones my sister had ever come up with. The question was\u2026 When and where was my sister going to use this on me?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Julie Powell was short and slender, with blue eyes and long black hair, knotted together in a pony tail. She was always happy and smiling, and she greeted every student who walked past her, including me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026\u201d she said to me, as she walked up to me and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy\u2026 My heart just melted right there and I was left speechless for a moment. Then, I felt something else going on in my body. Was I nervous? Yes. Was I anxious? Definitely. Then there was this weird tingling sensation in\u2026 my muscles? Just as I was talking to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Julie\u2026\u201d I said to her, as I cleared my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s going, Jan?\u201d she asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to answer when I spotted another familiar figure in the corner of my eye, standing a few feet away from me, holding a balloon in her hand: my sister Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing alright, Julie\u2026 How about you? How are your ---\u201c I was about to ask her, when I felt my chest inflate, my biceps bulge, my calves grow bigger and my thighs become wider. My shirt and jeans were feeling incredibly tight as my muscles pushed all my clothes to the limit before the growth came to an abrupt halt, much to my relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my\u2026 What?\u201d she asked in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you classes going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re just fine! I really like my teachers! Except for Mr. Johnson. He\u2019s kinda strict, but that\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d she replied. \u201cSo\u2026 How\u2019ve you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright\u2026 Just busy with classes and playing soccer\u2026\u201d I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool! You look great!\u201d she grinned, as she ran her finger over my bulging chest. \u201cHave you been working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You look like you just bulked up while you were standing here talking to me! You\u2019re so big and buff! I kinda\u2026 like it\u2026\u201d she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Well\u2026 Umm\u2026\u201d I stuttered shyly. \u201cI-I g-g-guess you can say that\u2026 Y-y-you know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so humble! I like that in a man\u2026\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the bell rang loudly, indicating the start of the next period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta go to class. I\u2019ll talk to ya later, big Jan!\u201d she whispered to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away, leaving me with butterflies in my stomach, while my sister was laughing in the corner while holding the inflated balloon in her hand. I guess I needed to come up with something to make her more attractive as well. In the meantime, I didn\u2019t mind her inflate my muscles. It was kinda fun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your team, thus far was undefeated but it was not due to cheating through your mad science skills, it was all from team work and much practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris cast a spell on me that would expand my muscles at her command with the use of a simple balloon.\" you said to your friend and fellow mad scientist, Sam Bowers. \"It was a sort of peace offering after we nearly went too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" said, Sam. \"any pain involved in this physical alteration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\" you replied, kicking him the ball. \"Just a slight tingling sensation, the magic doing its job, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was about your age with dust blond hair and blue eyes. He had a perfect body, scientifically speaking, with muscles one would not expect to see on one who dedicates his life to the study of the forbidden sciences (mad science). He kicked the ball towards another player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will your contribution be to this cease fire in your relationship with your sibling?\" he asked, helping to cover the player with the ball. \"I know your profile, Jan, you always attempt to out do your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will all depend upon on how she intends to use this new spell on me.\" you replied. \"For the time being, I am giving her the benefit of the doubt as she has not attempted to 'pump me up' at any inappropriate time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled. \"Interesting analogy.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ball was kicked to you and you moved to make a goal. Only the goalie on the other team was Frederic Jones, a young mad scientist with longish red hair and green eyes. He was not particularly strong, thus he had no quips about cheating to get what he wanted. In this case, it was to win the game and you knew that he would cheat to block your kick as it would end the game with your team the victor. Fortunately, so did Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Fred.\" she whispered, raising the balloon to her lips. \"Let's see how you like the game turned against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she blew into the enchanted balloon and your muscles bulked immediately with no pain, just a mild tingling sensation but you were too involved in the practice game to notice. You kicked the ball as Fredric used a telekinetic shield to black it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cheating!\" called Sam. \"Foul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" asked Fredric. \"Its only practice and besides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words died in his throat as he saw your muscles suddenly bulge and kicked the soccer ball with enough force to make it sound like a sonic boom. The ball had been treated with a special covering so that it would take greater punishment and it crashed through Fredric's shield as if it were not there, making the winning goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical alteration is cheating!\" yelled Fredric. \"That point did not count!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What physical alteration?\" you asked, having returned to normal. \"Besides, you cheated yourself with that telekinetic shield around the goal. That makes the kick fair as I became no stronger than Samuel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grinned. \"He has a point, fellow colleague.\" he said. \"This game is ours.\" he then gave Fredric a one handed hug. \"We're on the same team, let it go and see this as a lesson... cheating will always get you in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lesson well learned.\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left practice, you wondered what you could do for Chris.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This enraged you and, before you knew what you were doing, you grabbed him and roughly pushed him against the wall with one hand!  Kim opened her mouth to scream but Sam mentally blocked the sound from being formed and quickly walked up to her. \"We'll deal with this jerk.\" he said quietly. \"Get out of here and bring the student police back with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you get in trouble too?\" asked Kim, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be long gone before you get back.\" you replied, still holding a struggling Russ. \"Just go, you don't want to see what we plan to do to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim, fearing the worst, ran out of the bathroom and started screaming. \"We have to work fast, man.\" you said, once she was gone. \"Let's have him 'stick' around for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grinned, knowing that you had planned and helped as the two of you securely duck tapped his wrists, ankles, and waist to the wall before gagging him with the tape as well. Once that was done, you turned the duck ape pink and began to tightly wrap his shorts in it, making it appear to be a pink pair of bloomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice touch, man.\" chuckled Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet.\" you said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pulled the bottom of Russ' shirt into the top and pulled it down before wrapping it all with the pink duck tape, making it look like a pink bra. \"Now I'm done.\" you said. \"Let's make ourselves scarce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded and the two of you ran out of sight of Russ before vanishing at the door just as Kim and two fifteen year old girls rushed in, looking angry. Only as they saw what had happened to the known girl hater, they burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever did this must have worked fast, Janet.\" said one red headed, muscular girl, shaking her head. \"I say he got what he deserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, Vanessa.\" said Janet, a black haired giant of a girl. \"Only we can't have vigilantes in our school.\" she turned to Kim. \"Do you know that two boys who did this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't get a good look at them.\" lied Kim. \"The second one forced Russ to release me, I ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kim.\" said Janet. \"You may go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, you and Sam were quietly laughing over what you had done to Russ when Chris walked over with her cellphone in hand. she had a serious look on her face but you could not determine her mood as she said, \"It's for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you took the phone and put it to your ear. \"This is Juan.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was on the other line?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unknown to you, there was a war between witches and mad scientists that lasted for centuries, ending in a cease fire a few months before the end of the cold war in 1989. It was during this war and to that date mad scientists considered witchifaction to be a nightmare and an insult. \"You need to vanish for a few days until your father and I are certain this mess you made has been cleaned up.\" said mom, sternly. \"There are reasons why you must not use your powers in public!\" she sighed. \"Don't be too depressed, you'll be having some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris paled, seeing herself shrink as well. \"Mom! NO!\" she screamed, tearfully. \"What did I do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used your powers to increase Jan's strength during a soccer game!\" scolded mom, pulling a small boy's outfit out of the box. \"This gave him an unfair advantage, <i>another</i> mess we have to clean up!\" she paused to calm herself. \"Your mad science training starts tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sobbed, seeing her now male self as mom gave her the outfit and you the dress. \"You two may find this cruel and unusual but try to understand there are certain lines we can not allow you to cross.\" she said, softly. \"Get changed and wash up for dinner. As of now, you are my adorable seven year old twins, Janna and Christopher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, you and Chris made your way up the stairs to your new bedrooms to change clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He waved his hand at the screen again, revealing Lilly and Samantha inside a contemporary home somewhere. \"Well played, Sweetie Lilly.\" startling both women, he said. \"Toying with thirty boys at once is a new record for you and your 'pet'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the home, Samantha turned to a holographic likeness of the man, annoyed. \"Careful, Olly Travers.\" turning red, she said. \"Such a sharp tongue can cut your own throat.\" she shook her head. \"You should have allowed us to make you 'Olivia' permanently... such a waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlly suddenly smiled. \"Two can play at your game, girls.\" he said. \"We shall see who comes out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he let out a maniacal laugh before the hologram vanished.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She knew Karl and Greg's sisters, Tara and Daniel, they often visited her for tea, not knowing she was a witch. When they first met, she was feeling alone and they were running away from home. At first, Lilly was not sure what to make of them as they were nothing like their infamous brothers but she managed to convince them to return home to their families. Sure, it earned her some points but she felt she had gained more than that... true friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn, I wanted to make them toddler girl versions of themselves but I turned them into their sisters instead!\"</i> cursing, she thought. <i>\"Fortunately, it only lasts for a few hours.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl and Greg screamed, seeing themselves as their own sister and began to panic as their old clothing was too big for them now. Lilly was about to speak when two new voices were heard... \"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly turned to see the real Tara and Daniel, staring at their new twin sisters in shock. Tara was a petite girl with long blond hair and sapphire green eyes. Daniel was slightly taller but just as thin with short cut brown hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard rumors that you were some kind of a witch.\" stunned, Tara said. \"We thought they weren't true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rumors are... partially true.\" wincing, Lilly said. \"I assure you, I'd never do anything to purposely harm anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who- Who are these... copies of us?\" stunned as well, Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, it's me, Karl!\" blushing and in tears, Karl said. \"Make this crazy lady change us back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Daniel!\" sobbing, Greg said. \"We thought this witch was holding you two hostage and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg!?\" surprised, Daniel asked.

Karla it seems as if we need to help you two relax.\" smiling, Tara said. \"I think some new clothing and a makeover will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No!\" begging Karla said. \"That won't help me relax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along... Gina.\" ginning, Daniel said. \"I am going to enjoy taking you shopping.\" she giggled, \"I think we'll start with some nice dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please!\" crying, Gina begged. \"Don't make me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's too bad that spell included some 'passive' properties.\"</i> grinning, Lilly thought. <i>\"They will be like putty in their sister's hands until they finally relax.\"</i> then she said, \"I could offer your new sisters some more appropriate clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Daniel nodded and Lilly waved her hand, causing the boyish clothing to morph. Within seconds Karla and Gina were in matching pink dresses. \"Have fun, girls.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara and Daniel lead their reluctant sisters out of the house, Lilly heard a giggle. \"Well played, Lilly.\" said Elvira's voice. \"It seems your one true friendship has strengthened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems.\" smiling, Lilly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They appear armed and dangerous, approach with caution!\" screamed Tonya Powers hysterically into her magical microphone which appeared to be nothing more than a sunflower growing from her dorm room garden flower pots. She had seen the group of boys flying, armed to the teeth with ray-guns and freeze-rays and had misinterpreted their intent as hostile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the danger they had set upon themselves, you and Sam continued to lead your quickly gathered collective of mad-scientists to the Spell-blossom girl boarding school. Little did you know of the hornets nest you had stirred up by heading there on your mechanized broomsticks unannounced. Your Anti-Gravity Vehicle, or AGV was a sleek modified rocket engine Ural Land Ural Red October with a miniature twenty four missile rocket launcher, two ten millimeter anti-magic machine guns with magic shield piercing rounds, a zero inertia freeze cannon, and a blast wave concussion cannon... that was just on the side car. Sam was riding what looked like a rocket powered uni-ski with saddle straps in the middle and a teleportation/levitation weaponry summoning rack that allowed him to call upon any weapon he may desire in combat. The rag-tag collective of mad scientist boys apparently all had uniquely customized broomsticks, matching their specialized skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the occasion?\" shouted Pierce, a newbie scientist, to Jan through the squealing wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your mike, rookie!\" scolding, Sam called through his mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister, Christina! She's at the boarding school!\" anxious, you replied. \"I can't just leave her there among those rogue witches, who knows what they will do to her and the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What concerns me is that Spell Blossom is the home of the Hunters Elite, witch commandos.\" through his mike, Pierce said. \"How did the rogues manage to get past them?\" pausing, he added, \"Also, didn't you hear about what the head witch, Elvira said, 'There is no need for scientific might, we the witching world will deal with this crisis'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were flying in a tight triangle cover formation but had to hoarse their voices just to be heard above the din, even though their communication mikes. The boys had colored goggles strapped across their eyes to prevent being blinded from insects flying past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter!\" determined, you said. \"I'm not leaving my sister behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons!\" shrieked a terrified unbroken voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hunters Elite...\" gasped Sam, pulling his broom up and to a stop. \"It's a trap!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes widened, their pupils shrinking at the sight of their opponents. In front of the collective of boys swarmed two dozen Wyverns - massive winged reptiles with scaled bat-like wings and razor talon claws hanging from their lower limbs similar to that of eagles, hovered in waiting like a falcon before its death decent. From the torso's of these flying lizards, elongated necks emerged  with snakelike heads attached to the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch-riders stood on their flying steeds within saddle shaped like chariot stools draped around the upper back region, just before where the ostrich-like necks of the Wyverns escaped the body. All of them carried serious expressions as they knew mad scientists, despite their age, were all dangerous and unpredictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya Powers' jetblack hair reeled behind her back from the force of flight. She stood on the lead Wyvern, wearing full Valkurion battle armor and held a staff with a glowing blue-ember on the point - just like 23 other witches on their respective wyverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrender or be subjugated!\" she ordered in a loud booming voice, as if talking from a microphone; once again holding a small sunflower in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?! We didn't do anything wrong!\" in insolence, Sam shouted back. \"Why are you defending the rogue invasion!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue invasion?\" asked a witch behind Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya suppressed a smile. \"They think that transmission was real.\" speaking in witch tongue, she said. \"Let's give these boys a real shake down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, their intentions are pure if they believe that...\" the witch stopped, seeing Tonya's logic. \"They won't believe us, no matter what we tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are called <i>mad</i> scientists for a reason, Natasha.\" turning serious, Tonya said. \"They <i>will</i> attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tonya expected, Sam charged, giving you no choice but to follow through or lose face even though the odds were against you a million to one. The Wyvern-riders were amongst the boys in a heartbeat, as if waiting for the least provocation. The battle was over rather pathetically quickly, as you had darkly predicted. The mad-scientist boys were just that - children and were overpowered in short order by the amazonian women who, easily deflected any shots from the boys' technological armory as if they were mere water-sprays with a flick of their staffs, and manhandled the boys from their brooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sam were ingenuous, but far from combat experts. Tonya took you by the collar and bodily threw you into a small jar, your body shrinking in the blink of an eye to fit right in. Once the lid was screwed on tight, she causally placed you in a mess bag situated behind her saddle. When Sam tried to resist, he was promptly turned into a petite weak 10-year old girl wearing a pink flower dress before shrank like the others and placed into a shatter proof jar. Within seconds, it was all over and your entire collective was captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I'm a little girl... Again.\" muttered Sam to Jan in a squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused, Lily. Was THAT it?\" asked Samantha, looking into a massive glass orb standing on top of a wooden pedestal - the image inside the orb showed the scene where boys were being collected like insects by the Wyvern riders, similar to a television screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...they didn't even put up much of a fight! If they're captured then...how could they act as a decoy to the boarding school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, dear simple-minded Samantha. The boys were mere pawns. Bait. They were SUPPOSED to be captured.\" the red-headed Lily was busy combing her hair, paying no head heed to the events that she had started. \"Now with their fellow mad-scientists in custody, the Patriach and his little syndicate will have no choice but to act if he doesn't want to lose face. Then...\" she said turning with a malevolent sneer to Samantha. \"..then I will finally kill the Cyclops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Devin Bizarre, the leader of the mad science collective!?\" snapping at Lilly, Samantha asked. \"Did you forget the power he yields!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will not risk rekindling the Dark War by acting upon an isolated incident such as this.\" unconcerned, Lilly said. \"By the time they all realize it was a misunderstanding, we will have obtained our objective.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clerks rushed around and back with stacks of papers and managers shouted into their phones to their sub-ordinates.<br>\r\nEach entrance to each room was guarded by a pair of \"Shock-troops\" on either side to prevent unwarranted entry (they wore fullbody white lab-coats like trenchcoats draped to their lower shins; their plastic gloves and boots were pseudo-military/scientific; their faces covered in either gas-masks or amber-goggles; in their hands they held Radiation-rifles with tazers attached like bayonetes to the muzzles - the cause of their name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst all this chaos, walked a strange creature with a purpose. It appeared humanoid in shape and size, but closer inspection revealed it to be nothing like humans at all. It's skin was grey-blue and its hands and feet were webbed between the appendages. Through its somewhat-transparent tight-hugging wetsuit-like attire it could be seen having gill openings at the side of its ribs and neck. It had a shark shaped dorsal fin protruding from its spine between the shoulder blades and a long, slender, cylindrical tail emanated from the sternum with thin vertical fins sprouting from the point end of the tail. Its face looked as if someone had chopped off the nose, leaving only 2 narrow slits for a sense organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's bizarre and intimidating appearance was further complimented with it having sleek dark-blue hair growing frantically beneath its faceplate-like vizor and glowing yellow fish eyes. The most fearsome aspect of this creature was its maw: whenever it so much as grinned, twin sets of razor sharp shark teeth protruded from its flat inward laid lips, indicating to the world that it was without a doubt carnivorous. It looked amphibian in nature and sharklike in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's name was Alcaidas. It was a G.I. (A Genetic Infantryman). A Genetically engineerd and surgically enhanced supersoldier with bionic-cybernetics. Bred for death; this creature's true home was the battlefield.<br>\r\nCurrently Alcaidas was in search for its Creator: the mad-scientist whom had raised it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went straight to 2 Shock-troops standing idle in front of a massive metal sliding door, like 2 elevators directly opposite one another. Alcaidas held an ID in front of him to the lead trooper.<br>\r\n\"Unit 75 reporting for Hadrian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock-trooper slung his Radiation-rifle across his back on its sling and carefully inspected the ID.<br>\r\n\"It's valid.\" he nodded to the second shock-trooper and together they both pulled off their black latex gloves and placed their hands on scanners which stood like keypads on the 2 sides of the barricade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good to go, freak. The council-room is the 3rd on the left.\" said the lead-trooper callously in a voice muffled through his gasmask. Alcaidas sneered at them both and walked past. He didn't need any directions: as a humanoid-shark hybrid his sense of smell in the atmosphere and hydrosphere was unparalleled. He could reek his Master from miles away to find him between crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening a set of wooden sound-proof doors revealed the emergency meeting already in session. 17 mad-scientist Commanders stood in a shouting-match around a flat diamond-shaped table, voices rising with tempers as accusation and counter-accusation of incompetence flew across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlcaidas's vision rested on the figure of his Master and Creator - the Cyclops...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bunch of bleeding imbeciles!\" screamed Visrek Kommandantur, the founder of the dreaded Frankenstein Brigade; his gleaming white labcoat's neck pulled across his mouth and bald lower head; his eyes were covered with thick pitchblack goggles. \"A rescue party is exactly what we shouldn't do! If we try anything funny, then the witches will most certainly accuse the boys captured today of having been sent on some 'hidden agenda', then we'll have a fine mess on our hands!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest then?!\" retorted Field Marshal Sir Misery. \"Do we just leave our comrades to rot and become the sick experiments of of those hags! They are only boys! In my well-thought opinion we can not let this unprovoked outrage stand! We must-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Please!\" spat Zack Maelstrom in heavy sarcasm, a blond blue-eyed young man, wearing a grey mobile armor suite. \"Since when have YOU become SUCH a humanitarian?! You just want an excuse for invading enemy territory for profit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One to speak out of his place as always 'captain' Zack! If I remember accurately one of the young scientists captured was named Sam. He is your own cousin, is he not? Quick to abandon your own family, or do you just have a short memory-?\" spited Sir Misery back at Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your nose out of my affairs, you fat basterd! I'm well aware that Sam was captured!\"<br>\r\n\"And yet' you'll do nothing to aid him in the least!\"<br>\r\n\"How dare you?! You wanna take this outside?!!\"<br>\r\n\"Let's!!! I'm sick of your cowardice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" raged a deep voice that sounded like metal girders being sawed. Alcaidas smiled; his master had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Cyclops' was a title most befitting to Grand-Admiral Konrad Gears. He was a giant of a man. His leather black lab-coat draped over his shoulders, reaching all the way to the ground.  His legs, or their absence, made a queer sight. The limbs from beneath the knees were missing, replaced by iron rods extending together into a fat monocycle rubber tyre. On this rubber monocycle he moved around as if standing on a one-wheeled motorized wheelchair. But Konrad's right eye was the selling piece. A red-lensed telescope similar to those of digital cameras emerged from the socket; and rotated and zoomed around frantically as if trying to take in everything at once. Often Konrad would stand idly with his left biological eye closed, while his bionic right one would stare you down piercingly till you broke down in nervousness. The red-glow from this bionic eye contrasted sharply against Konrad's dark garb almost gleamingly. One does not win a staring contest against the Cyclops...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go after those boys.\" said Konrad, simply. \"Doing so will be exactly what Lily Void wants.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that the harpy who took your eye?\" asked Zack.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Zack spoke again. \"What Lily Void would gain from all this. How do you know she had anything to do with the capture of the boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's the one who imitated the fake-broadcast about the rogue witches incarcerating the girls...what was it?...Spell-blossom boarding school.\" replied Visrek. \"Probably instigating the flight of the squad of broom-riders in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go after those boys.\" repeated Konrad. \"'We will create a political incident. The boarding school is situated above a large Mana-mine.\"<br>\r\nSilence resounded throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WHAT mine?\" asked Zack confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana. An ore of imence magical properties.\" explained Visrek to the less experienced Zack. \"You see: the only thing separating witches from normal humans is that they are sponges of magical energy. Literally, the more magic you can absorb the more powerful spellcraft you can practice. Young witches are weaker than veterans, because they haven't learned how to absorb as much magic-forces yet. With mana, witches construct their cute little staffs and wands and spellbooks and whatever. This is because mana amplifies the potency of spells, making it less and less necessary to absorb large quantities of magical-energy to cast powerful curses and such. Witches go ballistic if you try to get between them and their sources of Mana-ore. Hence the reason why the Elite Hunters overreacted and incarcerated the mad-scientist boys today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So those boys are in trouble?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" answered Konrad. \"The witches will think the boys were trying an insurgency into the Mana-mine. And when the boys try to explain they were only going to save their sisters from the rogue-witches which never existed in the boarding school (all thanks to Lily Void), then the Hunters Elite will think the boys are knowingly lying and are in fact spies or saboteurs for us. If we organize an operation to forcibly take back those boys, we will only prove the witches right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just do nothing?!!!\" raged Sir Misery, amonst the disgruntled murmurs of several other displeased mad-scientists, whom clearly indicated they didn't feel like letting the situation stand as it was.<br>\r\n\"Just for now!\" interjected Visrek. \"Till we smooth things over with the Hunters Elite! Say Zack.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you know this Tonya Powers - the commander of the Hunters Elite? Can't you give in a word for those boys? That they were only were only acting foolishly? You 2 had a relationship-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack snorted and laughed. \"Tonya HATES me. In fact: she hates the very ground I walk on!\" his smile subsided into seriousness. \"I already asked her if she could release the boys. She was hardheaded. Said they had fired home-made weapons on them. Therefore they as witches, bla bla bla, self-defense against psychotics and all that. So no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic!!!\" screeched Sir Misery. \"If I'm alone to form a retalaitory strike against the Hunters Elite, then so be it! I will not stand aside while the pride of the Mad-scientist is mocked in this way!\" Many scientists concurred and threatened to leave then and there out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go, you will play directly into Lily Void's hands!\" shouted Konrad in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what is it this 'Lily Void' of yours wants, Cyclops?!\" said a wheezing sickly, coughing voice.<br>\r\nAll eyes homed in to a fragile figure sitting in a hover chair that had just entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Patriach.</span></div></div>",

Sarah was a short and slender girl with long blond hair, blue eyes and doll like features. She and her best friend, Hank had known about yours and Chris' powers for nearly a year and were sometimes drawn into your games. Sarah had low resistance to both magic and mad science but she did not really mind being changed in the spirit of fun. Only, she did not like the fact that they were always at each other in fear that someone less understanding would see them.  \"Are you two at it <i>again?</i>\" she asked. \"Can't you knock it off for a while and have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Sarah, slightly annoyed, as Chris did the same and replied in unison, \"We <i>are</i> having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you and Chris looked at each other, then laughed before canceling and reversing the others transformation and shaking hands. \"Pick this up later?\" you asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled with you. \"Sure, two o' clock sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled her eyes as Hank stepped in behind her. He was about your size but with muscles that seemed to have been carved out of stone. He was extremely athletic and had a love for martial arts.

It was a lifelike four foot doll with a vast collection of accessories and a outfits to match it. Despite being five foot even, you knew that magic could change your height and appearance, making you a perfect doll. Also, you knew your sister's style of 'fun' as yours was very similar in nature. \"Don't get any ideas, of trying to overpower me, sis.\" with a teasing finger, you said. \"I too have friends, its called a collective.

They were five other witches in all, each around Chris' age with mom and dad standing nearby. Dad was a tall, muscular man with hazel eyes and crew cut blond hair, a near perfect replica of you only a far more powerful mad scientist as his power rivaled magic itself. No underage witched dared challenge him directly except for mom (which is why he fell in love with her.) The young witches respected him as he too had a playful nature. \"Behave yourselves, girls.\" with a grin, he warned. \"You know the laws regarding use of power before the non knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'non knowing' referred to those who were unaware of real magic and mad science existing, it was frowned upon to allow any such people to see us use our powers unless there was no other option or your trust in them was complete. Seeing dad wink, the girls all giggled with mom following. \"That goes for the boys as well, young man.\" looking at me, she said, smiling. \"Let's try to be gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was a tall and thin woman with shoulder length dust blond hair and ocean blue eyes, a near perfect replica of Chris only her powers of witchcraft were equal to dad's mad science. Like dad, no young mad scientist dared confront her directly, not that she minded a challenge, she too liked to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll bring the boys back in one piece.\" smiling at you, Chris promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls will return unharmed.\" returning Chris' smile you promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a great time, then.\" waving them off, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us how everything went when you return.\" waving as well, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and the others had left, mom turned to dad, grinning. \"Do you sense mischief on the horizon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do, my dear.\" chuckling, he said. \"Here I thought it was going to be a boring summer vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the factory, you moaned slightly as you found the factory...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The machinery was running with barriers and security guards in place to keep the visitors at a distance from the working equipment. \"I am sure all of you young ladies would love a close look at how these adorable dolls are made.\" said a young woman guide. \"However, the machinery was not made to be 'human friendly' as it makes lifeless, unfeeling dolls.\" pointing to the assembly line, she added, \"If one of you were to be accidentally pulled into the doll making process, you are likely to be seriously injured or worse... packed up and shipped to a toy store anywhere within a thousand miles to be sold to an unsuspecting family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all winced at that, along with a few boys who were reluctantly tagging along as the guide continued her speech. \u201cNow, who would like to see a \u2018Little Sister\u2019 doll being made?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little magic could make the doll maker process \u2018human friendly\u2019.\u201d Giving me a slight nudge, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo could a little mad science.\u201d Smiling, you countered. \u201cHowever, a struggle at this point would be noticed unless you girls already set up a blanketing unaware spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea, Jan.\u201d grinning evilly, Chris said to her friends\u2019 giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, boys, I'm Tera Morgana.\" said a tall, slender girl with waist length black hair and green eyes. \"Yes, I am related to the real Morgana the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fawnia Merlin.\" said a petite silver haired girl with emerald eyes. wincing, she added, \"Yes, I am related to Merlin, the wizard. He referred to himself by his last name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as the legendary Merlin was the first person to find the link between magic and science, hence always hunted by Morgana, throwing the first sparks of the ancient war between witches and mad scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Viva Nimue.\" said a tall, raven haired girl with sky blue eyes. \"I am a direct descendant to Nimue, 'Lady of the Lake' who blessed King Aurthur with the mystic sword, Excalibur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm seeing a trend here.\" whispering, Hank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rewarded with a light shock from a tiny, four foot girl with long blond hair and blue eyes. \"I am Dolly Strange, daughter of Elvira Strange, the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be her daughter?\" rubbing his sore thigh, Hank asked. \"She must me anci....\" he shut his mouth, seeing Dolly's face hardening. \"Forget I said anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother may have some age under her belt.\" smiling, Dolly said. \"Only, just because there's snow on the roof doesn't mean that there isn't a fire <i>roaring</i> inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Note to self, do not try to make her a doll.\"</i> shivering slightly, you thought. <i>\"The head witch has no rival when it comes to magic.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sara Arc.\" said a brown haired, brown eyed girl about Chris' size. \"Yes, I too have a descendant, Joan of Arc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, they declared, \"We are the witches of the round table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at that then froze as you realized that you and the others were dangerously close to the beginning of the doll making assembly line. \"Using introductions to slowly teleport us into position.\" seeing you and Hank were the closest, you said. \"That's a new low for you, sis.\" you then smiled, adding, \"You're learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or your getting slow.\" smiling back, Chris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can not interfere beyond this, Chris.\" seriously, Dolly said. \"The unaware spell is up and you have them in position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chris gasped, finding herself teleported where you once were with you standing in her place. \"The game is a foot, my dear sister.\" grinning evilly, you said. \"Let's dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly before anyone could make a move, a buzzer sounded and you caught the movement of a large square frame rising up from behind. In the blink of an eye, four metal clamps slapped onto your wrists and ankles. They then pulled to the four corners of the square, leaving you suspended and spread. \"Hey!\" shouting, you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my doing.\" surprised, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt yourself moving and realized that, by switching standing positions with Chris, you had placed yourself on the conveyor belt and 'volunteered' to be the next doll! \"NOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to focus on using your mental powers as your hands were unable to grab any device from your belt. Only, the loud clanking of the machine made it impossible to think clearly. Desperate, you tried to call out for your collective but realized that it was useless as the unaware spell silenced your screams within its hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got to help him!\" concerned, Chris said. \"I'm altering the assembly line so it won't kill him, just... (giggle) make him the perfect doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll help.\" smiling, Viva said. \"We'll make him real pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that.\" backing up, Hank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could openly protest, Dolly hit him with a spell, rendering him unconscious. \"We'll have enough to focus on than to have to worry about you playing 'hero', Hank.\" looking at him sleep, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were quickly approaching the first station of the doll making process.

You blushed a deep red, seeing the tour groups looking up at you, pointing and smiling at the newest dolly being made. Fortunately and unfortunately, the unaware spell made everyone see you as only a lifeless doll, not a struggling teenage boy. \"Someone stop the machine!\" desperately, you screamed. \"Help me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, your voice became nothing but silence to those around you as the belt stopped at the second glowing station where you felt a strange tightening and realized that you were shrinking to the four foot height of the dolls. If you were not struggling before, you were struggling now as more robotic arms came into play and began to spray you from head to toe with an odd smelling liquid. You were completely soaked before long until fans came into play and you felt a breeze everywhere, including your scalp. \"A hair remover!\" gasping, you said. \"I'm as bald as a mannequin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching and helping to control the transformation, Chris winced, seeing your naked, hairless body. \"Sorry, Jan.\" she whispered, though you can not hear. \"This can all be repaired, just don't freak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a reason Chris hoped you would not freak out. Magical energy and Chaotic energy (source of a mad scientist's power) were like mater and anti matter, bad things happen when they mix. Meanwhile, you were being moved to the third station where your body was then sprayed with another strange smelling liquid only you recognized it. \"Chris, you maniac!\" screaming, you cursed. \"This is the distortion potion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distortion potion allowed the wielder to change any feature, big or small, on the person it was poured on and you felt your face changing to a more feminine appearance. Looking down, you saw, to your horror, that your gender had been altered to a neuter state... just like a doll. \"This is going too far!\" panicking, you said. \"She's trying to lock me inside a doll body and so many potions and spells, I may never break free of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His heart rate is going through the roof!\" sounding a warning, Tara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense his power rising!\" concerned, Fawnia, added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, he's going to fight!\" alarmed, Chris said. \"Can we hit him with a calming spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's moving too fast and, if we miss, he may take mistake it as an attack and <i>really</i> freak.\" shaking her head, Dolly said. \"We'll just have to hope Jan can calm himself down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that was not the case as you saw what looked like electronics being moved about the next station and blindly fired a full body energy blast, just as you entered the next compartment. This was used to fire a strong blast of chaotic energy in all directions, like a bomb. Unfortunately, this move 'short circuited' the magic influenced station and a robot arm shoved a small rectangular device against your throat and into it! Your skin opened, giving way, as if it were almost made of sand and the device was placed around your voice box. <i>\"Shit! What was just forced into me!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to speak but all that came out was, 'I wuv you mommy...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The doll voice box!\"</i> now in a real panic, you thought. <i>\"I must be enchanted, I can't speak with that in place!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen more robot arms came in and you found your eyes being forced wide open as a pair of baby blue optic lenses were rammed into place, making you see stars. Now stunned, you could not use your science until you were able to recover but the machine was not about to pause for any reason as the Little Sister doll logo was burned onto your left bum cheek with a laser, causing you scream. Alas, only doll like giggles came out instead and with your new contact lenses, no one could even see your eyes beg for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream \"NO! NO!\" seeing a thick diaper, your size, coming at you but only, \"Di Di\" came out as the diaper  was firmly secured around your bum, forcing your legs apart where you were certain you would have to waddle. <i>\"It's dress up time.\"</i> crying, you thought. <i>\"Girls, have mercy!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, this doll is about ready for the final stages, said the tour guide, pointing right at you. \"Who would like to pick out this dolly's wardrobe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to pick it out, sir.\" came a small voice. \"She's just about my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the doll lenses, you were able to see Dolly walk up to the control panels before she threw you an evil look and began to program the last stage, following the guides instructions of the clothing options....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guide nodded then hit a large green button, causing the conveyor belt to move again. <i>\"I have a bad feeling about this.\" </i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your were back into the motions of the machinery and saw racks upon racks of doll clothing, all of therm glowing as you were drawn towards them. What happened then was a blur as you were attacked by not robot arms, working to dress up a lifeless doll but the clothing themselves! Each article hit you like a heavy liquid, covering a part of your body, then reformed itself onto me as if I had put it on myself. First a plastic pant set appeared over my thick diapers before a pink frilly pair of panties appeared over them. Next a pair of white tights with red roses formed onto your now silky smooth legs before a vest and petticoat combo materialized onto you. Your eyes widened, seeing the row after row of frilly layers of silk and lace, causing you to blush. \"Please not a dress!\" you tried to shout but all that came was 'Baby wuves a new dwess.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Right... I can't speak with that damn doll voice box in my throat.\"</i> wincing, you thought. <i>\"I just hope I didn't give anyone any bright ideas.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a large splash of pink liquid came at you from one of the racks, hitting you with a numbing impact before you found yourself sporting a fluffy, frilly pink dress with a large red bow sash. You struggled harder, feeling the dress becoming tighter and tighter as buttons in the back were being closed. Of course, your struggles were in vain, as they were before, and you looked down to see a pair of pink mary janes onto your feet before feeling a firm push onto your scalp as a row of sand blond curls fell in front of your face. <i>\"I think its over.\"</i> hopefully, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was not as the conveyor belt moved again to another station where robotic arms with air paint guns mounted at the ends came in from all directions. <i>\"Of course... what doll is complete without a pretty face.\"</i> sarcastically, you thought. <i>\"Might as well get this over with.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes as your face was sprayed again and again in various places while you felt your nails becoming slightly heavier which meant longer nails and, of course, polish. It was not until you finally left the humiliating dool making process when a mirror appeared in front of you, sowing yourself  as a Little Sister doll with a heavily made up blushing baby girl face with sand blond hair and a red bow on top. The 'dool, you, was wearing a frilly, poofy pink dress with heavy silk and lace petticoats. You blushed more, seeing that the dress did not completely cover the the pair of pink, frilly panties, plastic pant set, and diapers underneath. With white tights with red rose accents and pink mary janes, you looked exactly like a Little Sister doll, ready to be backed and shipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to purchase your new doll, straight from the factory and take it home?\" asked the guide, back at the tour's end. \"Or would you like it delivered to your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we would like it delivered to a toy store my friend works at.\" with an sweet smile, Dolly replied. \"she gets a bonus with each Little Sister doll sold.\" speaking slightly louder, she added, \"We already have every accessory that comes with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, you panicked as robotic arm forced you into the doll box, wire tying your ankles, legs, wrists, waist and neck to the back of the box. <i>\"SHIT!\"</i> you thought, seeing the clear plastic lid being placed over top of you. \"Damn you Christina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a grave truth among mad scientists, they possessed great power but to have it all at once would destroy them and that is true madness.

How long have you been in that truck? You lost track of time while fuming at your situation.  As the back door of the truck was pushed open, you saw that it was now in the dead of the night. The driver worked with a young woman, neither you could see, as the boxes were unloaded into the store, one at a time. Before long, it was your turn and you were carried into the bright toy store where you saw the four foot dolls standing inside their boxes as you were carried towards them. Only, you became alarmed as they took you passed the main display to place you among a smaller group of 'Littler Sister' dolls before a woman came in and began to take pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" confused, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the photographer was done, the woman who had carried you into the store came into view... \"MOM!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled slyly at you and the other dolls in the small group. \"Welcome, participants, to Spellblossom witch school's living doll competition.\" looking straight at you, she said. \"We chose the 'Little Sister' doll line for this contest as they are closer to the size of a normal teenager or child...\" winking, she finished, \"with some modifications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been roped into a living doll competition!?!\" startled and disturbed, you thought. \"CHRISTINA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This competition calls for a two doll group.\" still looking in your direction, mom said. \"Those who are entering this contest reluctantly, rest assured that you will soon have company.\" she then giggled. \"All of you will be 'purchased' tomorrow afternoon by those who had registered you with the proceeds going to charity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groups of two?\" now concerned, you thought. \"Who could Chris and her coven be targeting next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each 'doll owner' must take pictures of their living doll in various cute to humorous settings and situations in a variety of clothing,using all of the dolls accessories.\" with a slightly evil smile, mom said.  \"The winner will gain a one million dollar contract with the Little Sister Doll company as their 'favorite doll'.\" she laughed. \"You will be promoting their 'real girls' line of clothing of which you will model, as girls, for the next fiscal year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed inside but paused as mom walked right up to your box. \"Good luck to all of you and... enjoy being a 'Little Sister' doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom walked out of the store with the truck driver, whom you still could not see, before the lights in the store went out and you were left on display with the other 'dolls' waiting to be 'purchased'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bonds holding you, like your transformation, were magically enhanced and would not give an inch. Finally giving up after an hour of struggling, you dozed off, wondering if any of the other 'dolls' had any choice in their participation in this competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will me massive retaliation for this outrage!\" furious, you thought. the wheels began to turn in your head and the perfect plan for revenge began to form. \"I am going to win this competition and then, just when Christina feels the most invulnerable, I will force a body swap on her and that upstart Strange girl so they can be the company's 'favorite dolls'....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at the thought, this time not minding the doll like giggle as it only fueled your passion for revenge. Your doll like giggle filled the silence of the toy store until you finally fell into a restful sleep. <i>\"Revenge is a dish best served cold as it numbs the heart and chills the soul.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up hours later to find that it was now early morning, judging from the amount of people walking passed the store front window and curious people walking around your display. \"Why are these models not for sale?\" curious, one customer asked, pointing directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These dolls were specially built by requisition order and are waiting to be purchased by those who had them made.\" replied a familiar voice. behind your contact lenses, hiding your eye movement, you saw Tera Morgana, smiling at you. \"See how very lifelike this model is? The one who ordered this is a stricter for detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" raising an eyebrow.\" the man said. \"Where can I order a special doll made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a form you can fill out at the checkout counter.\" pointing, Tera replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the man had left, Tera leaned down behind your box. \"Its lucky for you guys that this is just a friendly competition.\" whispering carefully, she said. \"Had this been for real, you would have all been placed on sale at a discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror filled you mind but you quickly pushed it away with your plan for revenge with additional thoughts of paying Tara for her silent taunting. \"You will all be feed after you are 'purchased'.\" turning serious, Tera whispered. \"There will be dire consequences for the one who registered you if she does not arrive before closing time as you are living beings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, part of me hoped Christina did not show up but that began to quickly change. With each passing hour, your feet began to hurt and you felt the nagging pains of hunger and thirst. Worse, you felt as if your bladder was going to explode into the diaper you were wearing. Only, as it was most likely magically enchanted, you guessed it could hold a lot without leaking. \"How much longer does she plan to keep me waiting in this damn box on display!?\" irritated, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just one hour before closing time before Christina finally entered the toy store with mom in tow, both smiling as they approached you. You were the last box standing on the center piece display as all the other 'dolls' had been collected and 'purchased' by other girls. \"Cutting it a bit close, aren't we, Chris?\" loud enough for you to hear, Tera asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a hard time convincing the other 'doll' to play along.\" with a sigh, Christina replied. \"We made it before the deadline and we have everything we need to feed 'Little sister'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am required to remind you that your 'dolls' are living beings.\" again loud enough for you to hear, Tera said. \"Any harm to them will mean immediate disqualification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's covering her own ass.\" grinning inside, you thought. \"Clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand the rules, Miss Morgana.\" patiently, mom said. \"Let's get our 'doll' purchased so we can get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then carried to check out where Tera ran the price scanner over the bar code on the front top left of your box and stated the price, which mom paid. Shortly after, you were carried out of the store to a van where mom slid your box inside then closed the doors. Once no one could see her or you, mom carefully opened the box but she did not release you from the wire ties holding you inside it. \"I apologize for being so late, sweetie.\" quickly, she said. \"Your current condition will only allow a liquid diet until we can get you settled at home for the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she produced a baby bottle from a bag, filled to the top with milk. You were unable to resist as mom pushed the nipple of the bottle into your mouth. The refreshing taste of the milk and the sweet feeling of moisture in your mouth moved you to quickly suck on the bottle, wanting to get every last drop. Mom smiled, watching you drink the milk and giggled once you were finished. \"Did my little baby girl like her ba-ba?\" teasing, she asked. she then turned serious. \"The milk is heavily fortified, its like an energy shake, we will not allow you to become malnourished so do not fear about any of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to see a slight ray of hope as mom was assuring you of your safety but you were not certain of Christina and her playful coven. As mom them replaced the clear plastic box lid, you sensed a long day coming tomorrow...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again, you began to fume but kept the thought of revenge at the front of your mind so not to fall into madness.or despair. Eventually, the van stopped and the back doors were open with mom easily carrying you into the house. You wondered if it was because your modified form was so light or if mom was naturally that physically powerful. Either way, you were darkly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"At least mom is keeping this competition real.\"</i> with an in inaudible sigh, you thought. <i>\"I wonder how far they plan to take this forced role-playing.\"</i> Your answer came when mom carried you into your bed room. <i>\"No....\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire room had been redecorated with fairy and butterfly wallpaper, covering every wall. Your clothes were gone with very frilly Little Sister doll outfits taking their place. Looking about, you saw that two rocking horses stood where your entertainment stand used to be with a large toy box next to them. In the corner, where your bed used to be was a giant crib, made for the Little Sister dolls and two giant strollers standing next to it. Everything was decorated with heavy frills and bows in shades of pink, lavender, and peach. The largest insult was another Little Sister box with another reluctant doll trapped inside. As mom brought you closer, you recognized the silently crying person. \"Sarah!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does baby Jenna like her new bedroom?\" teasing, mom asked. \"Say hello to your fried, baby Suzie. You two will be sharing this room for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then placed you on the other side of the room so you and Sarah were facing each other across the open closet doors as Christina entered smiling evilly. \"I can't wait to open my birthday presents!\" turning from you to Sarah, she said. \"Can I open them tonight, mom? Please....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear.\" giggling, mom replied. \"Why don't you set up the high chairs in the kitchen while I finish here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Christina left, giggling, mom turned to you and Christina, looking serious. \"First, I'm sorry this had to happen a day before your birthday, Jan.\" looking at you, she said. \"I promise we will make this up to both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to speak but only 'I wuv you, mommy' came out, frustrating you as mom giggled. \"Sarah was given the same conditions you now suffer, Jan.\" motioning to Sarah's box, she said. she then conjured a calendar, showing them a circled date on the next month. \"On this date, next month, the contest ends and you are required to be freed from your doll forms.\" frowning, she added, \"Any attempt to keep you that way after that will bring the rogue hunters, witch police, and the witch courts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned pale to that, not that anyone could see it under all the makeup you were wearing.The witch courts were known to be a hundred times worse than a military tribunal with their zero tolerance of breaking witch law while a delicate cease fire was in place between witches and mad scientists. Mom waited for her words to sink in then caused the calendar to vanish. \"Lastly, all of your belongings are safely stored away in your lab with the lock down in place.\" looking at you, she said. \"The reason you can not use your powers is because your father is using his own power to prevent you from activating them. Rest assured, once time runs out, your powers will return at their strongest ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to Sarah. \"I am terribly sorry we had to force you into this game, Sarah.\" quietly, she said. \"We know the crush you have on Jan and figured this would be the best time for you two to bond through this experience.\" she then winked, whispering, \"Your reward for your services will be your own magical talent... welcome to the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinkle formed in Sarah's eye, one you noticed. You did not know what mom had told her but it obviously brightened her mood slightly. Then, Christina entered, still holding her evil smile. \"the high chairs are ready, mom.\" happily, she said. \"May I open my presents now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may, Chis.\" smiling, mom replied. she then took her arm and pulled her very close, meaninglessly whispering, \"Remember the rules of play if you don't want to lose your powers for life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gulped then nodded before they both smiled again, slowly advancing towards you and 'Suzie'....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, due to that, your legs were a wobbling mess and you fell onto your bum the second you tried to take a step. \"Aww! Baby Jenna is trying to walk!\" cooed mom, giggling. \"How sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris laughed, causing you to blush. Anger flashed in your eyes, not that anyone could see it under the cosmetic lenses that made your eyes seem lifeless. Then, you noticed several small cameras floating in the air, capturing every moment of your embarrassing time as a doll and guessed that they would be following you and 'Suzie' everywhere. Soon, Sarah was released from her box and she found it just as impossible to stay on her own two feet, which mom and Chris both giggled at before you finally began to crawl out of the room with Sarah reluctantly following. \"See how clever baby Jenna is?\" teasing, mom said. \"She already figured out how to crawl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One month of this humiliation!?\" seething, you thought. \"Mom had better have something huge in mind to make up for this or I'll be raising the wrath of hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResiding yourself to tolerate the girls' game, for now, you swallowed your anger and crawled into the kitchen where you found dad, giving you a bemused look. Unknown to you, he had a short conversation with Christina the day before she led you to the doll factory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let's verify that all of the data had been compiled and organized the the proper order.\" sighing, dad said. \"You wish to incorporate Juan with a Little Sister doll for an inanimate photo beauty competition?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a living doll competition, daddy.\" giggling, Chris had said. \"Jan will be released in one month, when the contest ends but will stay a girl for a year more, if he wins, to model girls' clothing made after the doll line wardrobe.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dad shook his head. \"You must have a death wish, girl!\" eying his daughter, he said. \"Such an act of mischievous aggression will only lead to Jan unleashing his full wrath upon you!\" he sighed. \"However, if you promise me you can keep Jan and the other 'doll' under control and make this up to them enough to satisfy their honor, I will allow it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I promise I will keep everything under control, dear.\" said mom, entering the conversation. \"I have plans to make this up to Juan and the other 'doll', Sarah.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Very well.\" softly, dad said. \"You may proceed...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present, dad smiled down at you. \"Hello, baby Janna!\" sweetly, he cooed. \"Does my little baby need help into her highchair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you nodded, not really wanting to be anywhere near the humiliating contraption. Dad chuckled, lifting you up, before setting you into the highchair seat and buckling you in. He pushed the food tray into place before you could lift your arms, effectively trapping you inside it. \"There we are, is my baby girl all comfy cozy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at dad, cursing the cosmetic lenses, hiding my true emotions, causing him to laugh. \"I'm sure you must be staring after your long stay in the toy store.\" patting my head, he said. \"Don't you worry, mommy will be in soon with your breakfast and then we'll decide what to do today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that mom entered, carrying Sarah. She had a wicked smile on her face as Chris followed with the same devious smile, eying you. \"Poor baby Suzie had an accident.\" smiling, mom said. she turned to Sarah. \"Didn't you, my darling little baby dolly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought on three good laughs, but not you or Sarah. No one could see either of you blush, due to the heavy amount of makeup on your faces or see any emotion  in your eyes behind the cosmetic lenses you were both forced to wear. Once the laughing died down, mom made short work, placing Sarah into the highchair next to you. \"It's time for a yummy meal, yes it is!\" tickling your chin, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom and Chris opened several over sized jars of baby food. All of the labels had been removed so to prevent you from seeing what flavors they were. This caused you to cringe as you did not know what was coming. \"I hope they at least picked some palatable food combinations.\" eying the selections, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide 'cause here comes the choo choo!\" cooing you, mom said before making train sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the hangar, here comes the plane!\" teasing Sarah, Chris said, then made airplane noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, as you both were unable to speak your mind, you opened your mouths and accepted the unknown baby food to find it tasted.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It did not take you long to figure out that each spoonful you and Sarah were forced to take in had a different flavor. The only problem was, as each flavor lingered, they mixed and made a putrid taste in your mouths.  \"Disgusting!\" wanting to vomit, you thought. \"Eating baby food is bad enough, this is over kill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, you managed to make a funny look, expressing your distaste but it only made mom and Chris giggle as they were baby faces, followed by coos and giggles from the accursed baby voice box. You could only guess what they had done to Sarah to force the same conditions but vowed to avenge her if they failed to make this up to her. \"Each spoonful has a different taste so baby Janna and baby Suzie won't get bored with one flavor.\" winking at one of the cameras, mom said. \"This will make both our babies nice and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Sarah's baby food was laced with a potion that is slowly building a magical talent within her and the baby treatment is merely a fun way to initiate her into the world of witchcraft. For you, it was a test of patience. After what seemed like an eternity, mom and Chris were done feeding your meal but they then forced a full bottle of milk into your mouths, which you were compelled to drink. At this point, your stomach felt full and even more was starting to make it ache but you could not stop yourself from sucking on the bottle. You instantly knew magic had a hand in that. Still, the milk was washing away the bad taste in your mouth so you did not really complain. It was not as though you could anyway. Once the bottles were empty, mom and Chris took the feeding trays away, allowing you and Chris to raise your arms. \"Finally.\" you thought. \"That wasn't too bad.\" only, they placed the trays back into place before snapping a few pictures with a digital camera. \"Oh yeah, the living doll competition requires pictures in cute to humorous settings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pictures were taken, mom and Chris cleaned yours and Sarah's face clean then finally released you both from the highchairs. The humiliation was not over yet, though. Mom, holding you, placed you belly down onto her shoulder and proceeded to burp you while dad took pictures, causing you to turn another shade of red. A moment later, a soft burp echoed from your throat, as did with Chris and you were both placed back into the highchairs before mom and Chris turned to dad. \"Where do you think we should taker our little darlings today, dear?\" asked mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere they can get plenty of fresh air and sunshine.\" giggling, Chris added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Oh, I think I can trust you two enough to find a fair place to go.\" eying them, dad replied. this was the only hint he would throw. \"I mean, I know how much you love your little babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its between the park and the boardwalk at the beach.\" smiling, Chris said. \"Personally, I prefer the boardwalk. There are plenty of shops and people to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The park is a little more private with kid swings, a baby fun house and so much more.\" after a thought, mom said. \"What do you think, my dears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, looking at you and Chris, knowing you could not speak your mind. This was infuriating you and you had no doubt it was doing the same to Sarah. Finally, it came to the toss of a coin. \"Heads, we go to the park.\" giggling, mom said. \"Tails, we go to the boardwalk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin was tossed by dad and he allowed it to fall to the floor for all to see. It landed on....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, with a wave of his hand, he used his own powers to force our legs to move in a robot like walk and follow him out the door to the family car. There, he placed us onto the back seat, one at a time. As he buckled you in tightly, he looked into your eyes and sighed. \"Fear not, your plight will not end without reward.\" in a low voice, he said. then with a growl, he added, \"Otherwise, it will not end unchallenged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pulled away, closing the car door, before taking his seat in the front. Dad's words brought a twinkle to your eye, knowing that dad would, at least, step in if things fell out of hand. Only what was 'out of hand' to a seasoned mad scientist who had seen and, possibly' experienced it all? You turned to Sarah and saw some hope in her eyes but were still unaware of what mom had said to make her more cooperative than you felt. <i>\"Mom must have promised her something big.\"</i> raising a single eyebrow, you thought. <i>\"I wonder what it was.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, mom and Chris returned with a number of bags, which they stored into the car then piled in with mom driving and Chris sitting next to Sarah with me forced to take a window seat. As we drove towards the ocean, mom and dad talked in a language that was vaguely familiar but I could not put my finger on the dialect. You turned to Chris, she seemed just as confused by what they were saying. It became obvious to you that they did not wish anyone present to know what they were planning. You wanted to ask but you knew that would be impossible with your voice useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we all reached the Boardwalk. Mom found a parking place and stepped out with Chis, unpacking the two strollers that were in your room. You and Chris were placed into the strollers and tightly strapped us into them as if we were nothing but unfeeling, inanimate dolls. You winced, feeling the straps dig into your skin a little but paused as the tiny green floating cameras turned yellow. Chris saw the color change immediately and loosened straps holing you, making them go green again. <i>\"I see...\"</i> catching onto the game, you thought. <i>\"The cameras are there to monitor the events and warn the 'doll owners' when they step out of line.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you a little more confidence and did not struggle as Sarah was strapped in by mom, more carefully before we were pushed along towards the long line of shops and vender booths. \"Oh, mommy, look!\" yelled one girl. \"Its the Little Sitter Dolls from the TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of the girl smiled and asked if her daughter could get a picture with the dolls, which mom and Chris were more than happy to allow. As the picture was taken, you noticed that mom had conjured a copy of the picture for the contest and added it to the others. \"I see she's determined to win this competition.\" enduring another camera flash. you thought grimly. \"Only mom and Chris are more playful than this, what could she be planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question was answered when mom and Chris pushed you and Sarah into what looked like a small storage shed behind a venders booth your your last name on the reserve name plate. Inside the little shed was far from small, it had the room to fit your entire house with room to spare. It was one of the benefits of magic and mad science. The only thing about this booth was that it was stocked with just about everything one could do to a doll to dress it up or modify it in any way. Things did not look too good. \"Alright, what shall we turn our little darlings into for our little side show?\" grinning, she asked. \"We have all day to put on puppet shows for those passing by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart began to sink again. It was going to be a long day indeed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning to the cameras, you saw them turn from green to yellow and then a light shade of red, seeing small eye hole screws appear and drill into Sarah's joints at the ankles, knees, wist, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and neck. Sarah's eyes widened with tears running down her perfectly molded doll like face as she felt the pain of the screws driving into her skin and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the process only lasted a few seconds and mom waved her hand, making the cameras turn back to yellow and then green as the tears vanished from Sarah's unmoving eyes and cheeks. \"They will not hurt coming out later.\" you heard mom whisper. she then turned to Chris as she lowered herself back to the floor. \"You must perform the task quickly.\" warning her daughter, she said. \"Otherwise, we will both be disqualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded then turned to you. \"The same thing is going to happen to you.\" whispering, she said. \"As you can see, its going to hurt so prepare yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Chis levitated herself above you and repeated the process mom had done to Sarah. You screamed on the inside, feeling the screw drill their way into your real skin and bone before the strings tied themselves to them, making it impossible to move on your own. Your entire body was throbbing in pain and you could see the camera again holding a light red color before Chris waved her hand, causing your pain to quickly subside until it was gone. The tears that had run down your face dried up and Chris smiled at you as the cameras turned green again. \"Was that so hard?\" teasing, she asked. then she turned serious. \"They don't hurt coming out so keep it cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Chis then began to sift through the clothing racks, looking for cute outfits for you both to wear while you and Sarah were left magically hanging in the air, waiting to be 'used'. <i>\"I don't like the looks of this.\"</i> fearful, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, mom and Chris returned with two puffy princess dresses with six inch high heels and elbow long gloves. \"Normally, we would magically make these dresses appear onto you both.\" with a sly smile, mom said. \"Only magic takes energy and we are going to need all we can muster for this show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we are going to dress you two up the old fashioned way.\" grinning, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then began to undress you, the clothing moving past the strings as if they were not there, soon leaving you wearing only your diapers. You felt the heat of your blushing as Chris then began to place stockings onto your legs, along with the high heels, then put you into the dress and elbow length gloves. \"You look beautiful... <i>Little Sister.</i>\" giggling, she said. \"You and Suzie will be the dancing princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled as she had finished dressing Sarah. \"You two will be a hit.\" smiling, she said. \"The princess dance is just the beginning of the show.\" her eyes became dreamy. \"We'll next do a baby babble song duet then a crawling race, followed by another dance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed, smiling. \"Its going be quite the first day for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't wait.\"</i> sarcastically, your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen dad came into your field of vision, as you could not move on your own as a living marionette and you saw him whisper something to her and she slowly nodded. \"A change of plans.\" almost reluctantly, she said. \"We will break for lunch at the end of the performance after the clock strikes two in the afternoon.\" sighing, she added, \"You will be released from the marionette spell then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On with the show.\" smiling, dad said, pointing to the steps to the booth. \"We mustn't keep the audience waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Chris giggled as they took hold of the control wands and marched you and Chris to the stage with them taking their place above you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only, unknown to you, no screws appeared, they merely discretely tied themselves around their wrists, knees, ankles, and so forth. Mom, getting the idea, opened her mouth as if to scream then fell limp. <i>\"We need to keep Jan patient if we wish to keep him in the competition.\"</i> sending a mental message to Chris, mom thought. <i>Play along and maybe he and Sarah will allow us to raise the bar a little.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris fought the urge to giggle as she opened her mouth to scream as well, feeling the strings tie themselves around her joints. Only, as they did, her body went dumb and she found herself unable to move on her own. <i>\"What...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jan is not a fool, Chis.</i> serious, dad's voice echoed in her mind. <i>I must make this seem real or he will view all of us as an enemy when we all know this is not the case.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled to see mom and Chris get the same treatment and made to march onto the stage with you and Sarah but it gave you a sense of justice, knowing that they had shared in yours and Sarah's pain by being forced to become 'living marionettes' themselves. <i>I wonder what kind of performance dad has in mind for us to give.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mom and Chis joined you and Sarah on the stage, you all fell limp and the curtains opened. You were able to see and hear but you were not in control of your movements. A musical number began to play, catching the attention of some people, passing buy and you felt yourself slowly rising to your feet. Your arm rose to dad's command and you waved at the audience. A small girl, standing with her mother, giggled and shyly waved back while Sarah rose to her feet as well, giving a wave of her own. Cameras started to flash as people began to take pictures when mom and Chris rose to their feet next. Seeing them, you wanted to laugh but your mouth was now sporting a pacifier that filled your entire mouth, making any noise impossible. Mom and Chris were both dressed as boys but dad did not change their gender, making them look completely ridiculous. Seeing Sarah's eyes, you could tell she was laughing inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Leave it to dad to come up with something to level the playing field.</i> amused, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad giggled slightly as he made Chris dance with you and mom dance with Sarah. The audience was howling, it was so funny and camera flashes lit up the scene as others came to see what the crowd was laughing at. You were made to twirl in your princess dress, revealing your panties and diaper. The audience laughed even more, making you turn ten shades of red with embarrassment. Sarah was made to do the same with the same result. Only, as mom and Chris spun, their pants fell down, revealing diapers only, making the crowd explode into tears of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm starting to have fun with this little show.</i> knowing mom and Chis were blushing deeply as well, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost sad when the show ended shortly after twelve noon struck and the curtains closed. <i>\"That was fun.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great show, family.\" smiling, dad said, waving his hand. \"Now lets all get out of these marionette costumes so we can eat some lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strings vanished from around mom and Chris' joints and they were able to move again only they both made a mad dash for the bathroom making dad laugh. \"What's wrong?\" teasing, he asked. \"Were the diapers I summoned onto you not big enough to hold everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed inside, though no sound came out, and was relieved when mom and Chris magically cancelled the puppet curse, painlessly removing the screws and strings that turned you both into living marionettes. Chris turned to dad and opened her mouth to say something but dad cut her off. \"Its time for lunch, young lady.\" sternly, he said. \"I will not have anything interrupt my busy schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed and silently nodded before grinning at you. \"Time to back into your stroller, dolly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed inside, knowing that your lunch was going to consist of the energy drink milk.

He had been returned to normal but looked furious, angrily mumbling to himself as he stormed past. What caught his attention was that his black hair was gone, replaced by a long blond wig, glued into place. Right behind him was a girl with similar features, looking desperate as she caught up with the boy.

Never again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the boy continued to storm off, the cameras flying around him turned black in color then vanished. As the girl sadly walked away, back to her mother, dad sighed. \"They had been disqualified.\" whispering, he said. \"There are limits and rules to every game, including this one.\" eying Chris, he added, \"You would be very wise to see them as an example, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris quickly nodded, knowing that you could have seen the boy and girl and heard their conversation. \"I know Jan's limits.\" quickly, she whispered. \"I will not cross that line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" with a thin smile, dad said. \"I believe its now time to get our little ones ready for the beauty contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChis looked at your sleeping body and giggled.

Their smiles vanished when a tall aged woman entered the scene. You recognized her as the head witch, Elvira Strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, participants to the annual 'Little Sister' living doll competition.\" kindly, she said. \"I am aware that many of you have entered this contest unwillingly; please rest assured that this is not a permanent situation and rewards will be given for your patience and punishments will be issued to those who cross the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, who had been giggling before, all gulped as Elvira then turned to them. \"This segment of the competition is not only to make your 'doll' the prettiest but to make the transformed boy or non-magical girl the most calm.\" firmly but kindly, she said. \"The point of this competition is not to learn how to dominate mad scientists or non-magical people but to control a situation so nothing falls out of hand. The cameras will be the judge.\" pausing, she added, \"There is nothing more dangerous than an individual or group hell bent on revenge... try to remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elvira took a seat next to mom and Chris who watched as the girls waited uncertainly for the contest to begin.

They have their own game that they play, you will learn of it later in the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris gulped. \"Why was I not told of this?\" fearful, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have been had you refused the chance to toy with your brother on an extreme level.\" serious, Elvira replied. \"This is more than a game, its a lesson in the life of witches and mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Struggle as you might, the shirt was on you seconds later and it too changed, becoming black before its collar dropped down, revealing a piece of the pink bra you were now wearing.

It was not magic so you knew it was not anything Chris had done but you were still worried as the power seemed technological and much stronger than your own. The thought that dad might be a mad scientist as well did cross your mind but you could not allow yourself to leave anything to chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vibrations seem to be the strongest here.\" you whispered, standing before a grandfather clock in dad's den. you then looked around, realizing where you were, and sighed. \"Looks like mom and dad knew all along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed at the prospect that keeping yours and Chris' powers secret was in vain, you carefully searched the clock for a way to access the chamber or corridor behind it. Of course, you could have used your science to open the 'door' but searching for the way in was more fun. Within minutes, you found the switch and the clock slid to the side, revealing a small elevator, the doors opening for you. \"Bingo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into the elevator and it, detecting your presence, closed the doors and took you far below the house to a massive, well lit chamber. Coming out of the elevator, you were immediately greeted by a number of robots. Thinking that they were to programed to protect the chamber, you took on a defensive stance, expecting an attack. Only, the robots stopped a few feet away and bowed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your father's laboratory, young Juan.\" they said in unison, rising to face you. \"He is expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not surprised that dad was expecting you, being an obviously powerful mad scientist, but you were curious why you did not sense his laboratory much sooner. As the robots escorted you through your dad's laboratory, you found that it was far more advanced than your own, making you want to explore. The only thing that held you back was  the fear of risking dad's wrath. Finally, you stopped at a small carpeted area in the center of the chamber where you found dad, sitting in a comfortable seat, behind a desk, going over a number of reports. He did not look pleased at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Announcing young master, Juan Smith.\" said one robot with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to you, offering a small grin. \"Welcome, Jan.\" he said, his voice slightly stressed. \"Please, come closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so and noticed that he waved his hand over the papers he was studying, causing them to vanish from view. \"What were you working on?\" you asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed, forcing a low chuckle. \"Nothing you need to worry about, son.\" he said. \"Hopefully not for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I possess the intelligence equivalent to several PhDs, dad.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad roughed your hair with his hand. \"Yet, you have the fragile emotional state of a teenage boy.\" he replied, smiling, not revealing the bet he had with his wife. \"All will be revealed in due time.\" he then turned serious. \"Do not enter this chamber unless I am with you, there will be consequences if you disobey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he escorted you back to the secret elevator and sent you back to the house. As the grandfather clock slowly slid back into place, you became thoughtful. <i>\"Dad is hiding something.\"</i> you thought. <i>\"Judging by his expression and warning, it has to be major.\"</i> you knotted your jaws in decision. \"I have to get back into that lab but dare I risk dad's wrath by sneaking in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could not help wonder, as you flew your AGT into the air, if they were doing something other than going on adventures. Unknown to all, except mom and dad, Hank's parents were mediators, immune to both magic and mad science. They were off to different parts of the world, desperately trying to keep the peace between the two powers.You shook your head, dropping the thought for the moment and focused on your mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far is it to this witch school?\" you asked Chris, flying near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About fifty miles from here.\" replied Chris. \"We should get there just before they lock down for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and punched your forward drive with Chris following suit. Twenty minutes later, you and Chris arrived at the witch school, which looked like any other boarding school from the air. Chris signaled you to follow, you nodded and you both came down in front of the school to a pair of very surprised young women, you knew were witches, standing guard behind the closed front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see what I see, Eliza?\" asked the first witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do indeed, Lucy.\" replied Eliza. she turned to you and Chris as you dismounted. \"We were just about to lock up for the night, young lady, you are lucky your brother got you back here in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a...\" Chris began to say but the second woman cut her off as she opened the gate inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuses, young lady.\" said Lucy, sternly. \"All students here know that curfew is strictly enforced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to grab Chris' hand, to pull her inside, but found herself facing you. \"Incompetence!\" you hissed. \"Every witch who attends here is given a magical marker in order to locate them should they ever go missing!\" you frowned. \"Do you sense such a marker on my sister or I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza smiled. \"You both have that marker... the second you sneaked out of your house, unauthorized.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped, realizing that you and Chris had missed a failsafe that magically registered you both as students at the witch school. Before you could make a move, Lucy grabbed your hand, pulling you behind the gate while Eliza did the same to Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were informed this morning that you two might pay us a visit.\" explained Eliza as Lucy transformed you into a girl, despite your efforts to resist it. \"Your parents will be given the choice weather to come for you upon their return or to leave you both here for a year of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo!\" whined Chris, seeing herself regressing to the age of ten. \"I already went through training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it should be easy for you.\" said Lucy, giving a giggle. \"You can help your new twin sister adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your ATG and Chris' broomstick were both confiscated and you were escorted into one of the buildings, now wearing only pink nightgowns and undergarments. Inside, you and Chris were each ushered to a bed and ordered to get some sleep. Looking around, you noticed that there were four other girls in the room, all fast asleep. You released a low sigh and crawled into your bed as Chris reluctantly did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will meet your teacher in the morning.\" said Eliza, kindly. \"Oh, and kids,\" she smiled. \"welcome to witch school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, they quietly left the room.

Janna.\" said Lucy with a giggle. \"Go shower and change into your school uniform. Chris is already dressed and ready for class, get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned, eying Lucy with an air of annoyance, then got up and showered before getting into the school uniform. It was a short dark blue skirt with a white blouse and a dark blue jacket with a light blue bow around the blouse collar. It came with knee high socks and black mary jane shoes. In all, it was embarrassing for you to wear, having the mind of not only a teen boy but a mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is humiliating!\"</i> you thought, walking out of the bathroom. <i>\"I hope that Zed does attack, just so I can vent my anger for this outrage!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were fuming inside, you failed to realize that you were brightly blushing which brought all of the girls to the same conclusion, you were a boy on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you have already guessed from Janna's blushing.\" said Lucy, smiling at you. \"She is actually a transformed boy, all classes at witch school have at least one in their group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed more brightly at that as Chris giggled. \"So much for going unnoticed, sis.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls giggled with her and you turned away to go back to bed but one of the girls caught your arm. \"Don't take it so hard, Janna.\" she said, kindly, releasing you. \"I have a twin brother too, none of us care if you were once a boy.  My name is Melanie Harrison, my friends call me Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around at the other girls, who nodded in agreement and sighed. You were relieved that the girls did not see you as a threat, most likely because they did not know of your true talents. \"My real name is Juan Smith.\" you replied. \"My friends call me Jan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel shrugged. \"Jan is short for Janna.\" she said. \"I see no harm calling you Jan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would make me more comfortable.\" you agreed. \"Is your bother here as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel shook her head. \"He is at Roughneck boot camp, learning to be a police officer of sorts.\" she said. \"We really don't like the idea but his talents are strong, he needs proper training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, knowing that the Roughnecks were a select number of witch boys who exhibit limited magical power as a boy, namely energy blasts and defensive shields. The only problem is that their group had an 80% 'fatality' rate. That was to say, 40% of the entire number push their power too far and become girls and, thus, witches. Another 20% actually die in the line of duty. An additional 20% fall in love and fake their deaths and live in isolation to raise a family. The final 20% make it to retirement and die of old age...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Erica.\" said a second girl, pulling you out of your thoughts. \"I know how you feel, being here. I was originally a boy as well. My older sister fell into tears, no knowing how to tell me she was a witch.\" she paused, shedding a tear. \"Mom misunderstood it and permanently changed me into a girl as a punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit harsh.\" said Chris, wincing. \"Didn't the witch court do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica nodded. \"Two women in police uniforms, I learned they were called rogue hunters, came for her a few hours later.\" she said. \"Only I had forgiven her by then and told them that I had found a vial in front of a closet door and slipped on the wet kitchen floor, trying to ask her about it.\" she grinned. \"The vial flew from my hand and broke on my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A magical mishap.\" said Chris, smiling. \"Clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at such a thing happening to you then turned to the third girl as she spoke. \"I'm Natasha Wealth.\" she said, smiling. \"My family comes from a long line of healer witches, I'm here to learn magic so I can learn the trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Patti Garrison, daughter of the dean to this school.\" said the last girl. \"Before you think anything, I do not take advantage of that title so please do not ask for any favors.\" she then grinned. \"My mom does not believe in taking the 'easy' way so I'm going to have it just as rough as all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your story, Jan, Chris?\" asked Mel. \"Spill it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chris looked at each other, uncertain...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zed was not a bounty hunter by any stretch of the imagination but Sarah had no way of knowing otherwise. \"What do you want of me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you got yourself into witch school by very cleverly forging documents.\" said Zed, not knowing that 'her' mother had sent official documentation prior to Sarah's forgeries. \"There is going to be an attack on the school by a rogue mad scientist, I need to get into the school undetected so I may protect the students when the attack occurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just inform the witch council?\" asked Sarah, still shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Events have shaken the trust between the two powers.\" explained Zed. \"The teachers and staff must not know I am there so they will act normally and I can catch this rogue in act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slowly nodded. \"I understand.\" she said. \"I will get you in so long as you do not inform my father where I am, it is my desire to be a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed frowned. \"So be it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he fired an energy blast at Sarah. She did not have the time to scream as the force of the hit rendered her unconscious while Zed transformed himself into an exact copy of her. \"I'll just take your place.\" he said. \"It makes me weep, knowing that a child mad scientist would rather be a witch... how weak you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, with Sarah tied and gagged inside an abandoned house down the street, Zed walked onto school campus with an evil smile on 'her' face. \"Now then, to find those two interfering girls....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Sarah' walked back into her dorm and looked about, she did not sense the two girls who had sent the school onto high alert with their sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be in another class.\" she thought. \"I'll have to search for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave when a young woman caught her arm. \"Were you able to get a hold of your mom, Sarah?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sarah' turned to the woman and, fortunately recognized her. \"The line was busy, Miss Thomas.\" she said. \"I... I didn't want to try my dad's line.\" she forced a blush. \"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas was a virtual Amazon, standing at six foot ten with the body of an athlete. She was also well developed in the chest but carried a humble personality. She smiled at Sarah, thinking she was the shy girl who had left minutes earlier before pulling her in for a friendly hug. \"Don't worry, dear.\" she said, kindly. \"Your father will come around eventually. Personally, I am proud that you chose to be a witch, just like your older sister, Joann.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sarah' smiled. \"Thanks, Miss Thomas.\" she said. \"Um... I heard a rumor that we have two last minute students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas giggled. \"The rumor is true, they're parents are a part of the peace effort between witches and mad scientists.\" she said. \"They are twins, one is a witch and the other is a mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They must have caught wind that I might attack the school and came here to stop me.\"</i> thought 'Sarah'. <i>\"Only the school sensed them coming and enrolled them to keep them out of the way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Sarah?\" asked Thomas. \"You are not the only mad scientist learning to be a witch here.\" she giggled. \"The only difference...that other mad scientist is not doing this quite as willingly as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sarah' giggled with her then reluctantly walked with Thomas back to her class. <i>\"I've got to sneak away and find those twins before they sense me.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"If they are the Smith twins, as I suspect, they will be a threat to my plans if they decide to interfere.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the school, you stared in wonder at your first produced magical flame test with a child like grin on your face. \"Extraordinary!\" you whispered to the girls' giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is just the beginning of your magic potential, Janna.\" said Lucy. \"Just bear in mind that magic does not mix well with science, the resulting power becomes too unstable to control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then voiced your greatest fear. \"Is there a chance that this magic will take root?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled. \"If that magic flame appears on its own with no concentration on your behalf, then you can worry.\" she said. \"Otherwise, you have nothing to fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" you said, smiling, \"what's the next step?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris laughed with the others laughing. \"You truly have a curious mind, sis.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your class continued the lesson with Erica learning to summon her test flame next. \"Just relax and visualize the blue flame harmlessly burning in your hand.\" instructed Lucy. \"The magic within you will do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a deep breath to calm herself and did as Lucy asked. A moment later, a blue flame, slightly smaller than your own appeared and harmlessly burned in her hand. She smiled seeing it. \"Cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Socially speaking, in the witch world, the fame is only purposely summoned to prove you are a witch to a friend or younger sibling or to challenge another witch or a mad scientist to a duel.\" said Lucy. \"I urge you not to summon the test flame for any other purpose to avoid misunderstandings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was fascinating to you that a test flame could communicate so much and wondered if the same could be applied to a pyrokinetic flame. It was close to five in the afternoon and Lucy had finally allowed you and your class to relax and socialize for the remainder of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a fool to think I wouldn't learn anything here.\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to you, amused. \"I'm surprised you did not discover the many uses of a magical test flame while competing with your sister for nearly a year.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \"I've hardly been here a day and I am already discovering what was right in front of me all along.\" you said. \"Maybe I need glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls giggled. \"Sometimes the hardest thing to see is right in front of you, Janna.\" replied Lucy, gently. \"All you need to see it is to take a step back.\" she smiled. \"I think I will add this to tomorrow's lesson so you can all benefit from Janna's realization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you griped Chris's arm and pulled her behind you in an instinctive act of protection as you sensed the power of a mad scientist, other than yourself. Knowing you well, Chis became concerned and looked about, becoming nervous. Lucy recognized the look on your face as she had seen it on her own brother, Paul Connors, who was a Roughneck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use the flame, Janna.\" she whispered. \"Put my teachings to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her, you summoned a magical flame and made it dance in a way that indicated possible danger. Upon seeing it, Lucy began to sense the presence as well and could feel the anger within it. \"Everyone stay here.\" she ordered. \"I will go investigate this, it's probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked out of the dorm room, into the hall to find 'Sarah' from a class on the other side of the school, out wandering the halls. Lucy knew of the conflict Sarah had with her father and guessed that she had been in contact with him as she could sense anger and frustration within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Mitchel, what are you doing away from your class?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I heard that there was another mad scientist in school.\" replied 'Sarah'. \"I thought he... err... she and I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled, she could smell a lie from a mile away. That and the fact she had dealt with mad scientists before was one of the many reasons a fourteen year old witch was asked to become a 28 year old teacher at witch school. \"There are a number of mad scientists learning the art of witchcraft here, Sarah.\" she said. \"There are none in my class but, even if there were, we are forbidden to discuss their identities to students outside of our group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" said 'Sarah' trying to sound defensive. \"I wasn't asking where 'she' was, I was just hoping to sense 'her' out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can sense your way back to your class, young lady.\" said Lucy, sternly. \"Before your teacher reports you missing and that will bring you more trouble than you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, 'Sarah' turned around and walked back the way she had come, looking over her shoulder occasionally as Lucy watched her leave. After 'Sarah' was out of sight, Lucy grabbed a small radio. \"Security, we have a breach.\" she said. \"Sarah Mitchel is missing...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In your case, it was a matter of sibling rivalry, training, but nothing serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chris nodded as the other girls looked at the two of you smiling, Lucy noticed this and smiled herself. \"As you two have had some experience in private dueling, why don't you demonstrate to the class how it is done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are technically three different types of private duels.\" you said. \"There is the phantom duel in which you physically and mentally fight each other but no one else sees, hears, or feels the fight happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is also the potion/serum duel.\" added Chris. \"Basically a discrete 'got you last' mischief duel that can go on for weeks and even months, depending on how stubborn the two fighters are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there is the mind game in which the two participants battle it out in a form of telepathic arena.\" you said, finishing. \"Everyone else will think they are having a pleasant conversation or sitting alone, away from each other, when in fact, they are actually fighting inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded. \"correct.\" she said. \"However, I would like the class to witness this duel so please show us either the potion/serum duel or the phantom duel, revealing yourselves every few seconds so we may get an understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich duel do you and Chris demonstrate?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Elvira talked to Mel, Lucy opened a hole beneath you. A surprised yell escaped your lips as you fell and a hole appeared in the ceiling just before you fell through it, into the first hole again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Erica, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy giggled. \"It's called a loop hole, a classic witch and 'mad' scientist prank.\" she said. \"Always be ready for a prank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Lucy!\" you yelled, falling from one hole to another. \"Stop this... crazy magic... contraption already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy giggled and, after a minute, snapped her fingers, sealing the holes. You hit the floor, stunned and dazed. \"He'll be fine in a minute, class.\" she said. \"You all now have a better idea of the rules behind the private duels. Verbal agreements mean nothing unless they are followed by a handshake, sealing the agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy continued to lecture her class, Elvira finished talking to Mel, saying, \"Janna will be serving as your 'body guard' until we can safely capture Zed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel sighed and replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never keep a witch boy transformed for too long.\" she said. \"One of three things will happen. One, she will learn magic and strike back; Two, she will gain enough magical resistance and change back on her own, which means a pummeling for you; or three, her form will lock which means to loss of your powers as a punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she restored Chis to her female self. \"Thank you for your participation, Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were besting him with seemingly little to no effort and it angered him to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this boy?!\" Frustrated, he muttered. \"His talents are beyond any I had ever encountered before!\" He wiped the blood from his mouth. \"I have to kill him now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the classroom, Lucy had reached Elvira Strange on the intercom. \"Zed Brawl has attacked Jan Smith!\" Worried, she reported. \"They are having a duel in the hall just outside the room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prefects are in the two joining halls, waiting for their opening to move in.\" Serious, Elvira replied. \"Only they can not intervene with the duel, it is too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean too dangerous?\" Concerned for you, Lucy demanded. \"Jan does not stand a chance against that psychotic madman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls around her, including Chris and Mel began to cry, worried for you only they paused as Elvira replied. \"Jan Smith is not a just mad scientist. He is a pseudo witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel turned pale. \"His science has become so advanced, it is like magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Melanie.\" Darkly, Elvira said. \"Jan's mad science has reached such heights that  it has <i>become</i> magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the hall, Zed roared, summoning all of his power. You responded with a smile and transformed back into your female self. Zed raised a single eyebrow but turned pale as you summoned  a powerful flame to your left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance, you psycho novice.\" Grinning, you said. \"Surrender or face humiliation by being beaten by a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling a mad scientist a novice was a great insult. It was worse to be beaten by a girl, transformed or not. He roared in complete fury, forgetting the powerful mad science at his disposal and physically charged you. Seeing your opening, you fired a bolt of lightning, hitting Zed dead in the face! He flew backwards, hitting the floor twice before striking the wall, unmoving. It was then the prefects jumped in and placed Zed into glowing handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your class then opened and Lucy ran out before giving you a quick hug and pulled you in out of danger. \"That was very foolish and dangerous of you, Janna!\"<br>\r\nHissing, she scolded. \"You could have been killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elvira ordered me to defend the class.\" Weakly, you replied. \"Mission accomplished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed before touching your head and looking into your slowly drooping eyes. After a moment, she took you into her arms as you had fallen unconscious.\" I am very sorry, Chris.\" Softly, she said. \"However....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sedative dulled the pain from his shattered arm, and knee, but not enough to dull his thoughts. <i>I can't believe my orders. For years, i wanted to win the war by blowing up the head witch, and then I got orders to protect her</i>. the fact some rouge witch  confronted him wasn't any surprise. He suspected some wanted to see Elvira in fifty pieces. Others still would want him in the same pieces. As he pulled his limbs back into position, he thought of his own family. Three daughters and all on the path to ruin. Worse still, the fourth who saw ruinous magic and was seduced by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Science is superior to outdated, immoral and preverted witchcraft</i> he thought. <i>It could be used for constructive purposes by men and women alike. Instead, I get daily reminders why I have to fight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I'm home\" a voice called out. Its his sixteen year old daughter, Samantha. It was ultimately her that convinced him to play 'bodyguard'. That and direct orders from Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'daddy' me. I know you've been up to no good. Who was it <i>this</i> time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some big jock that thought he could get me to date him. I told him I'm not interested in jerks like him. Maybe now 'he'd' know how I feel..\" Samantha said, grinning slightly. She'd have magic for a couple years, but only recently discovered her real talent at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam...\" Charles started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am using my powers constructively, daddy\" Sam pouted. \"You're fighting your way.

He was practically a Juggernaut with huge muscles and a massive frame. Only his gentle green eyes, showing through his longish black hair gave away some of his true nature. You stood at his side and bowed respectively to the head witch and your sister. \"The time has come to talk of the possibility of a better understanding between us.\" said Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a time long over due, my brother.\" said Elvira. \"We must find a way to end the violence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you stepped forward and offered your hand to Chris. \"Walk away from these talks alive, Chris.\" you said. \"I would be lost without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same to you, Juan.\" replied Chris. \"Stay sharp and focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then parted ways, following your mentor to their perspective places as the peace talks began...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah sensed it as well, though she did not understand what was, and turned to her two hostesses, uncertain. \"Do... Do you feel that?\" she asked them. \"A feeling like a bad storm coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine sighed. <i>\"I guess Elvira did sense something inside of her.\"</i> \"Yes, there is a powerful presence nearby and doubt its friendly.\" she replied. \"You better take Hannah upstairs to the spare bedroom and lock the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded but, before she could move, the front door was reduced to splinters by some mild explosion and the four saw a massive seven foot robot enter the house, breaking the door frame in the process. Catherine and Natalie both turned pale, seeing him and slowly backed away in utter terror. \"Phobos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" asked Sarah, just as terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The living machine.\" replied Hannah, pale as well. \"Jan told me about him, he's known to be merciless and cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's putting it mildly.\" said Catherine, pushing Sarah behind her. \"RUN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started to run but hesitated as a large flame appeared in her hand. She screamed in terror, not knowing what it was and shook her hand, unintentionally throwing an energy blast at Phobos. Only the blast was powerful, forcing the living robot back a few steps. Sarah looked on, completely stunned as Cathrine jumped in front of her. \"Get out of here while you can!\" she ordered, shaking in fear. \"We'll hold him off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hannah, getting an idea, pulled something out of her dress pocket. It was a smart phone she had with her when they jumped back in time. \"Keep that tin can occupied for a minute!\" she yelled, frantically pressing buttons on the phone's key pad. \"I have a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be one hell of plan!\" yelled Natalie, throwing energy blasts at Phobos. \"We won't last more than a minute against this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, focusing this time, managed to make the flame appear again and turned to Catherine. \"How do I do that, I want to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on throwing the flame at the tin can and it will fly from your hand!\" explained Catherine, quickly. \"Just be careful, his guy shows no mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried and managed to fire one powerful blast after another, not having the training to control the amount of power she used, slowly pushing Phobos towards the front door. Only, she was getting exhausted fast and feared she would soon pass out. \"Hurry up, Hannah!\" she screamed, panting. \"I-I'm getting tired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, after pulling a USB cable out of a slot in the side of the smart phone, turned to Phobos. She quickly searched him with her eyes then jumped onto his back, causing him to stumble about the room, trying to throw her. \"Chew on this, you tin can!\" screamed Hannah, shoving the USB plug home into the back of Phobos' head. \"It's called a computer virus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hannah hit the send button onto her smart phone. The virus Hannah had pulled from her phone's virus vault was down loaded into Phobos just before he managed to trow her off and he began to scream, holding his head in agony. It was not long before the living machine lost all control and began to crash against everything in the room, desperately trying to yank the smart phone out of his outer access port. Inside of him, all of Phobos' systems were going haywire, causing his neural-net brain to overload, killing magical mind control but leaving Phobos in complete pain, confusion, and disorientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a mad scientist or witch boy, I would have sensed that.\" mussed Catherine, stunned by what Hannah had done. \"Yet he's managed to really mess up that tin can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, seeing an opening, summoned all of her remaining strength and fired a powerful blast at Phobos, sending him literally flying out the destroyed front door. His robotic body hit the ground in front of a stunned 17 year old Eva and 18 year old Helena Kruse. <i>\"There is no possible way Catherine or Natalie Strange can be that powerful!\"</i> thought Eva, shocked. <i>\"Who else is in there!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Eva and Helena walked into the house to find Catherine and Natalie. They were slumped into chairs with a girl they did not recognize, exhausted from their fight with Phobos. The only one standing was Hannah, who they did not recognize either but knew she was the one who made the final blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a powerful witch for someone so young.\" whispered Eva, impressed. \"We should take her with us instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother wants Natalie.\" whispered Helena, sternly. \"I dare not test her patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the two witches decide.?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natalie, sensing their power, winced, knowing she could not help her. Hannah threw a fist full force, ending her reserves to fight. She missed but Eva felt the breeze from it, causing her to gasp. Helena's face hardened but only until Hannah spoke, knowing she had blown her one chance to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had I made contact, your sister would not be standing.\" said Hannah with a fake smile. \"Had I cast a spell, neither of you would be standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a witch?\" asked Helena, confused, not sensing any magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please let this work.\"</i> \"I was a witch.\" said Hannah. \"My dear sisters removed my magic years ago, they were jealous of my power.\" she smiled, gambling on their womanly pride. \"Any fool can work science but magic is an art, one only girls can truly appreciate. I turned to science as there was no other recourse but I will not become male to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena and Eva turned to each other, surprised, then smiled. \"She's the collective's star student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah tilted her head, slightly, confused but before she could react, both witches hit her with a sleep spell and she crumpled to the floor unconscious. Natale, Catherine, and Sarah could only watch in fear and concern as Hannah was carried out by the two girls. By the time Sarah managed to find the reserves to run to the door, she saw Hannah being thrown into a black van with tinted windows. She was impressed that Hannah still had some fight left in her but worried that it only made her look more powerful. With her reserves nearly spent from her fight with Phobos, she was helpless to stop Eva and Helena and watched as they drove off with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Catherine reached the door in time to throw a single spell, hitting the van with it as it drove off. \"I put a tracking spell on the van.\" she said, weakly. \"I'll know where they are until the spell wears off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to help her!\" wailed Sarah. \"She's powerless against a witch, let alone two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried about her running her mouth off.\" said Catherine. \"Only, we can't help her until we first help ourselves.

Witch boys have the same rights as witches due to the fact that, if turned into a girl, they become a witch as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch without training.\" countered a woman on the witch council. \"I am Wilma Hues, secrecy department. Witch boys gain resistance to magic as it is used against them.

Another witch from the council rose and you smiled, recognizing her as your grandmother, Viki Vulcan. \"I suggest a safeguard be put in place in all households that will prevent magic and or science wars among relatives.\" she said. \"A powerful spell that will reduce two or more squabbling relatives to three year olds until a trained witch or mad scientist can return them to normal or a twenty four cooling off period has passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter rose from both witches and mad scientists alike but not due to the fact they did not like the idea. The suggestion was quickly passed and added to the peace treaty, slowly being forged through negotiation and compromise. <i>\"Go grandma!\"</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the back of your mind, you sensed trouble approaching and turned to Chris who had the same expression on her face. You gave her a solemn nod then turned to Devon. \"We have hostile forces approaching, sir.\" you whispered. \"Most likely rogues, wanting to stir up a ruckus, I suggest we move the peace talks to a new location.\"<br>\r\nAs you spoke to Devon, Chris said the same thing to Elvira, who nodded at her then turned to Devon who nodded as well before rising his hand for silence. \"Our prodigies have detected rogues of unknown discipline approaching this location.\" he announced. \"With the permission of the witch council present, I will move us all to a new location where we may continue without interruption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth witches and mad scientists voiced their agreement and Devon worked a control panel in front of him.

It was Victoria who had 'melted' Elena's face, jealous of her natural beauty years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have no idea where my mom is!\" barked Catherine. \"If you will excuse me, I have to return to my lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to slam the door in Victoria's face but she rushed passed before she could and looked down at the little boy in girls' clothing, grinning. \"Who might you be?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A victim of magical mischief.\" replied Hank, grumpily. \"She has to learn to change my clothes back to normal for me to get them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla, who had entered behind Victoria, laughed. \"So, who are you then?\" she asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed slightly. \"I'm Sarah, they say I'm a first witch.\" she said. \"This magic is harder than it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria smiled, having no real interest in her or Hank. \"You'll get the hang of it.\" she said, reassuringly. \"Welcome to the witching world, Sarah.\" she then turned back to Natalie and Catherine. \"The sooner you tell us where your mother is the sooner we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you!\" protested Natalie. \"We have no idea where she is! Get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria suddenly grabbed Natalie's throat, causing her to struggle for air. \"I don't appreciate your tone, young lady.\" she hissed, angrily. \"Perhaps I should show you some respect.\" she pulled out a small blade and gently rubbed it against her face. \"What do you miss more? An eye or an ear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off her!\" screamed Catherine, summoning a flame. only Darla and her twin sister, Carla stood in her way, producing flames of their own. \"Out of my way, amateurs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let mom have her fun.\" said Carla, smiling. \"You and we can have fun of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sarah jumped to Catherine's side. \"I'll hold them, you help your sister!\" she said, quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How touching.\" said Victoria, unimpressed. \"The dog tries protects her master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned red with anger but before she could react, a low boom was heard and Hank was back to normal. He angrily took Victoria's knife hand and pulled it away before slamming his fist into her jaw. Victory was forced to release Natalie as she stumbled back, stunned. Only Hank was not done as he knew all it took was a wave of the hand for her to cast a spell, taking away his initiative. He continued to pummel Victoria with blow after blow as Natalie crumpled to the floor, coughing, catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one hurts my friends!\" screamed Hank, still beating on Victoria. \"Get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla and Carla, also stunned to see a boy beating their mom senseless, were taken of guard by Catherine and Sarah who sent them flying with energy blasts. As they stumbled towards the door, Hank grabbed Victoria by the waist and spun her once before physically throwing her to the floor, next to Phobos, startling her. She turned to counter attack, so to at least save face but froze as Hank had his smartphone pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used this same technique to take down that bucket of bolts.\" he said, breathing heavily. \"It works on organic lifeforms as well, care to test it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't sense chaotic energy within you.\" hissed Victoria . \"What are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank smiled, seeing a number of women in police uniforms. Having had magic used against him, he knew they were witches, more specifically the rogue hunters Catherine had mentioned. \"I am Hank.\" he said as the rogue hunters entered the house. \"That is all you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not over, boy!\" hissed Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then vanished in a puff of smoke, along with her daughters. Once they were gone, Hank slumped over, breathing a sigh of relief. \"For a second, I thought she would force my hand.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a brave boy... Hank.\" said one of the rogue hunters. \"I am Grace Tanner, are you the one who took down the living machine, Phobos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank nodded. \"Yeah, but I was lucky.\" he said. \"Besides, I had to protect Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie blushed brightly as the other policewomen giggled. \"I see...\" said Grace, smiling. \"You have eyes for the daughter of the head witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank paled slightly, realizing what he had said, then blushed himself before nodding. \"Yeah, I... I guess I do.\" he said. <i>\"It's too bad she's an adult where I come from.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue hunters smiled then went back to their work, taking the still rigid and unmoving Phobos out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Verina was a tall woman with light brown hair and brown eyes, wearing a gown that accented curves well. \"You haven't changed a bit, <i>princess.</i>\" purred Elena. \"Turning you into a girl was the best thing I could have done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerina grunted. \"You could have divorced me first.\" she said, frowning. \"Making me your third daughter and marrying me off was not what I had in mind for a second honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked you a good man with connections.\" argued Elena. \"Besides, had I not defended you from that Bane bitch, it would have been you that looked as I do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said over the phone that we had a massive problem.\" said Verina, changing the subject. \"Mind sharing the details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena told Verina what she had sensed and what she feared may be the result before stating, \"All I wish to do is cripple the space platform. The last thing we need if for those mad scientist leaders to made into icons of valor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerina nodded. \"I saw the platform being launched.\" she said. \"The rumors of it existing came from me but no one takes the word of a 'rogue' witch.\" she shook her head. \"I agree it must be taken down.

His face turned pale, hearing of their plot and quietly sneaked off to his room to send out a warning to his pen pal, Jack Strange. Verina had found Daniel, slowly freezing to death in the cold last winter. He had no memory of his past so she decided to take him as her own and slowly fashion him into his daughter once he reached the age of thirteen.

You, young lady would make a <i>powerful</i> mad scientist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew such power could come from twins uniting!?\" said the witch, pushing Garth aside. \"I am Sarah Forester, here in place of my father, Charles Forester.

Moments later, the agreement to peace talks was signed and word was quickly spread as Elvira sent the rogue hunters elite, witch commandos, to the sight of the missile launch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear, young mad scientist.\" said Garth, boldly. \"I will adopt whoever chooses to stay behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk.\" said Elvira and Devon in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, witches and mad scientists began the process of leaving the station with Devon's promise to dismantle it as a gesture of good will. \"This is just the beginning.\" said Devon, hours later in the Strange residence. \"It could take years for the peace talks to end this war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a step in the right direction.\" said Elvira with a sigh. \"For the moment, we have other concerns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.

You will discover it in your own time, all I ask is that you use it wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank nodded then turned to you, Chris and Sarah. \"I guess this is good bye, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good bye.\" said Sarah, hugging him. \"Until we meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank nodded, tearing up as Sarah released him and Chris hugged him. \"Look us up sometime, okay?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" promised Hank as Chris released him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then took his hand and shook it. \"I will miss you, Hank.\" you said. \"Stay out of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at you.\" said Hank, tears falling. \"See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Sarah walked up to your side and you activated the return sequence. With a flash, the three of you were gone, back to your present time. Unknown to you, Samantha, who had been silent until then wrapped her arm around Hank, causing him to blush. \"You know, you're not so bad, for a boy.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" snapped Natalie, wrapping her arm around Hank from the other side. \"He likes me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not after one date, he won't.\" countered Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His first date will be with me!\" yelled Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then flew into a cat fight as the others shook their heads. \"Should we warn them about the safeguard we had agreed to for squabbling siblings?\" asked Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled, shaking her head. \"Let them find out for themselves.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, both Natalie and Samantha screamed, finding themselves three year old girls....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked at your time return device, it was completely drained of power and now fried beyond repair. Looking at your calendar, you were pleased to see that you had arrived the very same day you had left. You were more pleased, seeing it was only a few minutes since you, Chris, Sarah, and Hank had vanished backwards into time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've arrived at the right point in time.\" you said with a sigh. \"Only Hank is an adult now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what changes had occurred from leaving him in the passed.\" mussed Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, mom called from downstairs. \"Jan, Chris, Sarah, we have company!\" she announced. \"Our neighbors wish to welcome us to the neighborhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchanged a worried look with Chris and Sarah then ran down the stairs to find boxes everywhere as men carried in furniture and sealed metal containers, pieces of your laboratory. Although your bedroom and house looked the same as you remembered, it seemed as if your family was just moving in. You turned to mom who gave you a sad smile. \"I know its hard, being the only boy in the family, Jan.\" she said. \"I miss your dad too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard. \"Dad died in this new present?\" you thought, feeling sick. \"What!? How!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris began to cry as well, saddened to return to having no father and mom comforted her, pulling Sarah in for the hug as well, confusing her. \"It's okay to cry, Sarah.\" she said, softly. \"I know you miss your mom and dad but they will be back when it is safe, I promise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Sarah too began to cry as a man approached you. There was no mistaking his face, it was Hank, all grown up. \"I don't know if you remember me but I am Hank Harrison.\" he said, smiling. \"This is my wife, Natalie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, young man.\" said Natalie with a quick wink. she motioned to four children, behind her. \"These are my daughters, Hayley, Melanie, and Hannah.\" she smiled. \"This is my son, John, he is Melanie's twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The- The pleasure is-is mine.\" you replied, crying. \"Sorry... I just miss dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank gave you a sad look, tears forming. \"Your father, Samuel Smith was driving with me the night of the car accident.\" he said, as if explaining. \"He used his mad science to teleport me clear from the car before it was hit by that truck, saving my life.\" placing a gentle hand onto your shoulder, he added. \"Unfortunately, he did not survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI completely fell into tears, realizing that going into the past had greatly altered our present time. Natalie took me into her arms and rocked me gently. \"I am so sorry things turned out this way.\" then she whispered, \"He's not dead, just in isolation but I can not say anymore than that, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, knowing dad had always 'isolated' himself in his lab in your old reality so not much had changed except for Sarah who had taken Hank's role as the lonely one. \"Thank you for the welcome.\" you said, wiping away your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't your kids show mine around town.\" suggested mom. \"I think they could all use a break from everything that had been going on lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a splendid idea.\" said Natalie, smiling. \"I'm sure John and his friend, Hank could use another guy to hang around with and my daughters and their friend would love to take Chris and Sarah shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right his way.\" said John, politely. \"I'll introduce you to Harry Rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and Mel grabbed Sarah and Chris. \"Come on, you'll love Megan Thompson.\" they said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a panic, you tried to resist the magic with your science as you began to swim in your own clothes. Only you were too slow to focus your mind as you quickly fell below the age to use your power. You no longer had the ability to block the spell, you were trapped. \"What do you have planned for me!?\" you asked, frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, little one.\" giggled Chris. \"You'll only be this way for two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced as you felt your teeth lowering and vanishing into your gums, giving you an idea of what your sister had planned, and you did not like it at all. \"Pwease, Cwiss!\" you begged, loosing your ability to speak. \"Not a baby boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris laughed. \"Okay, you can be a girl!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes bugged out as you then felt your hips widen slightly and something tugging on your boyhood before it shriveled up and morphed into girlhood. You glared at her to which she shook her head. \"I'll allow you to speak normally but that it the limit I will allow while I have my bit of fun.\" she said. \"Besides, I need the experience if I'm going to be babysitting for extra money this summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the transformation was complete, Chris picked you up off the floor and waved her hand at your clothes, causing them to vanish. \"You won't be needing those for a few days.\" she said. \"shall we get you into your diaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have a choice?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris giggled then walked you over to a changing table that was not there a moment ago. She laid you onto the table and strapped you down before reaching for a bag she had under the table. You watched in horror as she lifted your feet with one hand then slipped a disposable diaper under you. Before putting you down, she grabbed some baby powder and applied a generous amount onto your bottom and you genitals. \"We don't want to risk a diaper rash, do we, Jessica?\" she asked, smiling. \"We want you to be a happy baby girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sealed you into the diaper, undid the straps, holding you down, and took you over to a high chair where she strapped you in and locked a tray into place. \"I know its been a long time since you ate baby food.\" Chris told you, walking over to the cupboard. \"So, I conjured up the entire line of flavors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the cupboard, revealing hundreds of jars of baby food, causing your jaw to drop in disbelief. <i>\"Where is she getting the energy make all of this happen!?\"</i> you thought. <i>\"She should be at the verge of collapsing at this point!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing magic took a lot of mental and physical energy to work. The same applied to mad science, which was why you were stunned to see your sister making everything happen around you. Seeing your expression, Chris giggled. \"I have been planning this for weeks.\" she said. \"I had all of this conjured over time so I would not exhaust myself.\" she smiled. \"Try to relax and enjoy your humiliation. Sarah and Hank will be over to help me watch you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" you asked, panicked. \"Granted, they know about us but why do that to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that she was about to change your bedroom into one that suits your new body and situation. You hurried after her, struggling in your three inch heels, hoping you are not too late.

Unfortunately, it seemed as if Chris was ready for you and blocked the laboratory's power from reaching you. Unknown to you, it was your dad that stopped you from powering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jan.\" thought dad, smiling. \"We can not have you fighting a reality spell when your mind is clouded with anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, sensing your power rise, then suddenly fall, gave you a wicked smile. \"Like I said, 'Jane'.\" she giggled. \"You are going for a dress fitting right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what possesses you to think you are going to get me to cooperate?\" you asked, becoming angrier still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled, snapping her fingers and you suddenly found yourself standing inside a dress shop, wearing only a pair of panties and a bra with a tall woman about to take your measurements. You tried to scream, you tried to run but you were unable to do either. Little did you or Chis know, it was your mom, in disguise, who was taking your measurements and magically keeping you still and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember doing this to Simon for his dress fitting.\" she thought, smiling. \"We were married on Halloween so my role reversal prank on him went off without a hitch.\" she giggled on the inside. \"Of course we got married the proper way that same evening but the look on his face, forced to play the entire role of the bride... (sigh!)... the memories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took your measurements, inwardly pleased that you were not yet angry or desperate enough to try to use your power without the support of your laboratory. For mad scientists, it was the laboratory itself that allowed them to use their inner power. Without it, their power would quickly become dormant. However, you had the rare talent to use your power without the laboratory, giving you an edge. The only problem was that it took much energy and effort to use, also, there was always a chance that you would fully awaken your power and cease to be a mad scientist. You would become your sister's true twin and a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a great body, Jane!\" said mom, playing the role of a worker at the dress shop. \"I'm jealous, you are going to look stunning in your wedding dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvisible and off to the side, dad covered his mouth, silencing a laugh as you were slowly placed back into the wedding dress with mom throwing you an occasional complement. \"I feel your pain, son.\" thought dad, smiling. \"Don't worry, your mom and I won't let this go too far and you will survive it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to mom, dad, and Chris, your patience was quickly beginning to run thin. \"Have your laughs, Chris!\" you thought. \"You won't be laughing much when I turn the tables and make 'you' the bride instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are.\" said mom, still in disguise. \"You are all ready to march down that aisle and start your new life with the man of your dreams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to give mom, who you thought was a random dress shop worker, a small grin. \"It'll sure make some fond memories to look back at.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's smile faltered a little but she was quick to recover. \"He's plotting something.\" she thought. \"We better give Chris that push and soon before Jan inadvertently makes things worse for himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Chris snapped her fingers and you found yourself sitting in front of a vanity, getting a makeover from her with mom and dad watching, invisible, off to the side. \"It's almost time for you to meet your 'husband'.\" said Chris, teasing. \"You are going to love the boy I picked out for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt it.\" you said, pouting. \"I never pulled a prank on you this big, sis. You better know what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled, ignoring you. \"You just have a case of cold feet, sis.\" she said, hugging you. \"All brides to be get them.\" she paused, smiling. \"Would you like me to bring your mom in here to cheer you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, mom smiled. \"That's the opening I've been looking for.\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then dropped her disguise and allowed herself to become visible again, startling both you and Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my big girl on her special day?\" asked mom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking ahead, you saw your mom, looking back at you and Chris, smiling as the wedding march was being played on the organ. Waiting for you and Chis, st the end of the aisle, were two tall, handsome, and muscular boys, yours and Chris' husbands to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, dad!\" you whispered, taking a chance. \"We get the idea, no more fighting, please don't throw us away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Don't worry, kids.\" he whispered back. \"You're not really getting married, we're not <i>that</i> mean.\" he then winked at you. \"Behave yourselves at the 'reception' and we will think about ending this just before you two go off on your honeymoons and make out with your 'husbands'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a low sigh, you and Chris reluctantly walked down the aisle to the alter where your grooms stood waiting to take you both away. Dad released you and your sister before giving you both a push before sitting down with his wife. \"They're both scared, Elvira.\" he whispered. \"I had to throw them a line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big softie!\" mom whispered back, smiling. \"I would have not done so until, at least, after the 'I dos'.\" she paused, concerned. \"I just hope this little 'fun' does not get... interrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave mom a one armed hug. \"We left that war between witches and mad scientists fifteen years ago and never looked back.\" she told her calmly. \"One would hope it had ended by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right, Max.\" replied mom, smiling again. \"It must be over by now.\" then she thought, \"I hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell silent and watched as you and Chris stood nervously as the conjured minister, kept stable by dad's lab, began his ceremonial wedding speech. \"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to all, outside the warehouse that was being used as a 'church', two small groups had gathered and were fighting with wands and remotes. They were witches and mad scientists, each determined to win over the other in a war that still raged on in small pockets throughout the world....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone believes that these two couples should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" said the minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, the fight outside broke into the 'church', causing all of the magical and holographic created 'guests' to scatter, screaming. Those that were hit with a stray spell or event (technological spell), instantly vanished as the reality spell broke down. Mom and dad grabbed you and Chis, both quickly returning you to your original forms, and raced to get you both and themselves away to safety. Only, in the chaotic fray, you were all separated as both sides began to take prisoners. Mom and you were taken by the witches while dad and Chris were taken by the mad scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chis!!\" you screamed, seeing a strange man, hauling her away. \"Let me go, my sister is in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan!!\" screamed Chris, seeing a woman she did not know dragging you away. \"Unhand me! Jan!,  <i>Jan!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you were starting to break free, someone hit you on the back of the head, the world around you vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you awoke to find yourself...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sat up, feeling dizzy, due to a hard hit sleeping spell, still in your system, and took a careful look around.  Behind you was a large window, over looking a small but inviting court yard. To your left was a sizable mirror, taking up almost a quarter of the wall.  On your right was a door, leading to a tiny wash room. Across the room from you was a closed door, you guessed was the only exit. Your memories of what had happened the night before were still fresh in your mind but, for some unknown reason, you were strangely unafraid, merely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled out of the bed and discovered that you were now wearing a fashionable pair of blue pajamas.  Upon closer examination of himself, he found that you were carefully bandaged from head to foot, making you look somewhat like a mummy, only increasing your confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your feet and found a pair of brown slippers, which you slipped on, then walked uneasily to the closed door.  Of course, the door was locked.  But, still in a daze, you were unaware that you were subconsciously using your mad science to augment your strength as you turned the handle. The lock broke with a low crunch and the door handle ripped off in your hand as the door slowly drifted open.  You looked at the handle, slightly surprised, then lightly dropped it to the floor as you then cautiously walked out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe- Hello?\u201d you called, politely. \u201cI- I\u2019m sorry about the door.  Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around as no one answered and began to slowly wander the halls, curiously taking your environment, uncertain, but not afraid.  \u201cHello?  Is anyone here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My but you are a strong boy.\" said a voice behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to find a well dressed, tall and attractive  young woman, standing in the hall. She smiled politely and motioned for you to come to her. Detecting no threat, you walked over to her. \"Where am I?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in my mother's mansion, I am Dani Dorsey.\" replied the woman. \"You were badly injured after protecting me and others from an explosion, we all thank you for your courage and valor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" you said, slowly, still confused but calm. \"Have you seen my family?\" you asked. \"We were in the middle of some... err... family fun when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time, young man.\" said the woman, kindly. \"Your mother and mine are waiting for you in the living room, won't you join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and followed Dani through a virtual maze of hallways and corridors to a huge room with portraits covering every inch of the walls. Still under a calming spell, you noticed but did not become concerned, seeing all of the images in the portraits moving. In one was of a small girl in a pink dress who covered her mouth, giggling, before waving at you.  Shyly, you waved back at the girl who giggled even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious place.\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw mom, sitting on a couch with an elderly woman with long black hair and green eyes. Both rose to their feet, seeing you coming. \"Glad to see you up and about, Jan.\" said mom. \"That was quite a blast you saved us from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember a... blast.\" you said, honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will come back to you in time.\" said the elderly woman. \"I am Delora Dorsey, second in command to the head witch, we need your help, Juan Smith, mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\" you asked, still calm. \"Why don't I feel nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a calming spell around this house, keeping all who enter here clear headed and rational.\" replied Delora. \"It is so no one will panic, under any situation.\" she urged you to sit, she and mom soon followed. \"We have a problem of which only you and your sister can help us with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my sister?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is safe with dad inside the main mad scientist collective.\" replied mom. \"She is being talked to by the second in command to the collective master, your version of the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question, Juan, both witches and mad scientists are being attacked by a new culture of people.\" said Delora. \"These people can use both magic and mad science without transforming. These people are quite mad and they are using both dark magic and hellish science to obtain their goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it were not for the calming spell on the house, you would have been in a panic. However, you found it relieving to be able to keep a clear head. \"What exactly is their goal, Delora?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To conquer both powers and rule us all.\" replied Delora, seriously. \"Both sides are still fighting an old war in isolated parts of the globe. It is slowly ending but this new group is trying to rekindle it, using poor brainwashed souls as their weapons, using their magic and science through them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people, once released from the brainwashing, lose all memory of what had been done to them, covering this new group's tracks.\" added mom. \"They are being very careful not to be detected, only the head witch found them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This new culture wished to divide the two powers in a war and take over in the midst of the chaos.\" you said. \"How can Chris and I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Chris, through your constant... err... training, have developed the same ability as the new culture.\" explained Delora. \"We need you and Chris to infiltrate their numbers and report to us of their activities so we may be ready.\" she sighed. \"I know it is a lot to ask of a child but if we can stop these people before they have time to expand their numbers, we may be able to prevent the rekindling this war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have told Delora that the decision is yours alone to make, I can not, will not persuade you.\" said mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into mom's eyes and knew that she was fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your decision, Juan Smith?\" asked Delora.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chris waved her hand, releasing you from the sheets and you quickly got up, just as mom walked in to see the bed a mess and both of your clothes badly wrinkled. \"Were you two fighting?\" she asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were... discussing the idea of me being Christina's true twin for a while.\" you said, quickly. \"The debate became slightly heated over different opinions of how long my experience should last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at you, questionably then turned to Chris. \"What brought on this discussion so suddenly?\" she asked. \"School starts again in one week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...\" you said, searching for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan thinks he can understand girls better by being one for a short time.\" said Chris, grinning. \"Only, he believes a few weeks is all he will need for his 'research'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, this is what brought on your disagreement.\" said mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I am weary of spending a full year due to the twin factor.\" you said, not wanting to give away your 'games'. \"I like girls but not enough to risk becoming one for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled and you could tell she was plotting some mischief. \"Well, Jan.\" she said. \"Since you are so very curious about life as a girl, I will help you.\" she giggled. \"As long as you limit your use of magic, stick with science, a permanent transformation will not occur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how long are you planning to keep me... err... your daughter?\" you asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Relax, sweetie.\" said mom, giggling. \"This is what you want, isn't it?\" she waved her hand, casting her spell, and added, \"You will be twin sisters for one...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grumbly walked out in the front, to the door that would lead to the unfriendly streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not forget about one thing, and you were certain Chris would have noticed to. With each step he felt his balls and cock swing left to right and back. Your face became warm and bright red. What was not unnoticed by Chris, she smiled \"Is there a problem little brother?\" in the most innocent tone someone could think of. \"I allow you to speak to me again\" She knew exactly what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are my private genitalia public to the world!\" You asked, in rage \"Well you are a dog ofcourse, dogs don't need privacy\" Chris laughed out loud She had the perfect view on her brother's privates \"Besides you don't have to feel ashamed, I'm your sister I would never have an impure thought. And the rest of the world is seeing a nicly formed German Shepard slit\" She had a wicked glare on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were immediately alarmed, Why? Why would she needed the world to see him as a female dog! \"Chris, you won, it's over.

Silence bitch!\" <b>Zaappp</b> He felt a large electric charge on his ass, his balls retracted and het let out little yilp \"Move! Ahahahaha\" Chris forced him forward through the door, into the front yard. Your sister walked to the fence and opend the little gate.<br>\r\n\"Come doggie!\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled as she let you out of the garden on the sideway. The first thing you noticed were the annoying little stones and scraps were you walked on. Dang that sucked. Chrisss, I-     \"Mblbmf\" But ofcourse, you haden't been given permission to talk. Your sister looked at you and grinned \"What's the matter, can't you talk to me? Well maybey that's better, untrained dogs shouldent be allowed to do whatever they want\" She fired a little lightning at you. and hop, you decided that you could bare it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good little bitch!\" She approvingly pedded you. \"Just try to relax, you will get used to it, look at the beautiful airs, gardens and-- look who's over there!\" Chris said in \"played\" amazement.

You never could get along with this 9 year old kid, but his sister always played with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy stopped a few yards from Chris, he pointed a finger at him \"Is that your dog Christina?\" the little kid seemed a bit unsure to enter her range. \"Is it dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HaHa, Cody, how are you doing? Yes this is my new dog\" She smiled \"She is not dangerous, she is just a dog\" Chris said with a glitter in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not talk, but you barked at Cody, hoping to scare him away before Your sis would do something bad. It seemed to work as he backed off and made fleeing motion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Cody, she is all talk but no action!\" Chris shouted to him. The boy stopped \"Really?\" She laughed \"Ofcourse,  come closer and try to give her a command\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO no, it was worse enough to listen to your sister because you lost to her, but he would not be orderd around by a little brat. Cody came closer, he doubted for a moment as he said \"Sit doggie,Sit\" Immediately Juan felt the warmth he experienced before. He was a little dog, a submissive dog, who would do as dogs are told to do. Such potent magic he thought, rrrrnnnngggg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your naked butt on the sidewalk, You placed your feet on the gound and placed your hands between them. You tried to look down to the ground, you were deeply ashamed you were sitting as a ordinary dog would sit. Then you felt a tingle in your mouth and your tongue dropped out, now you were also panting as a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy gave a scream of pleasure and your sister nodded in agreement. \"Can I try more?\" Cody asked with a glint in his face. \"Sure, do whatever comes to mind\" Chris grinned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy walked in front of you, you tried to look the other way. But you could not. \"Doggie give paw!\" Coday said firmly. Disgusted for being used as a attraction, you still gave Cody your hand. He let out another joy word, he picked up a stick and asked Chris \"Can he fetch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead\" She nodded and with that Cody threw the stick in a yard \"Fetch doggie\" you stood still for a moment. No matter what you would not get that stick! 1 second, he did nothing, 3 second there came the warmth, and within 5 seconds he ran into the yard. Take that dang stick and throw it to his face was the thought in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............ You could not pick the stick up..... For some retard reason you did not know how to pick that stick up with your hands!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Cody and your Sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your mouth\" Chris laughed, you had no choice ofcourse. You opend your mouth and picked up the stick, blegh dirt was all in your mouth. You deliverd the stick to the boy.... He pedded your head and smiled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to rub your belly, roll over!\" Cody commanded \"No!No! you thought\" But you rolled over lifted your legs and hands above you, just like a dog. You turned deep red,<br>\r\nyour cock and balls were in full view! Cody started to pet you upper chest rubbing and schratching, it felt so good and natural. You looked to your sis, she was amused. And a little smile turned on her mouth. Then Cody reached your private area.. His eyes grew big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody pointed with his hand at your sex and turned to Chris \"It's a Girl doggie\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister bursted out in laughing \"Indeed it's a little bitch! That is how female dogs are called\"  Tears ran down your eyes, you were sure mom wouldent agree to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked puzzled,  She makes puppies then? Could I have one. I always wanted a puppy but I couldent find a dog my mama and papa liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in shock, you held in your breath. And you heard your sister say...</span></div></div>",

Inside the secret room in the basement of your house, your laboratory came back on line, reacting to your emotions, and your powers restored. It was the laboratory itself that was the source of your power, without it, you were helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the crowd goes wild!\" you thought, grinning. \"Chris temporarily disabled my laboratory to have her fun with me but now, it's my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that your power levels were quickly rising again, Chris quickly turned to Cody, who was happily petting you. \"I hate to cut this short, kiddo.\" she said. \"But I have to finish my walk so I can get to my homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's Friday.\" said Cody. \"You got all weekend to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled. \"I rather get it out of the way now and have the weekend to have some fun.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" said Cody, running off. \"Let me know when Jane gets pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" promised Chris, smiling. \"See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cody was gone, Chris knelled down and looked you in the eye. \"Don't even think about trying to cancel my spell with your science!\" she warned, serious. \"Reality spells are very tricky, anything could happen to us if they are disturbed or suddenly canceled.\" she paused, smiling. \"Besides, you forget that you are naked and you have a submission collar locked around your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew wide as you blushed brightly, realizing the consequences if you broke her spell before she had her fun and returned you home. Canceling the spell would cause everyone to see you as you were, a naked 14 year old on all fours, wearing a dog collar. It would completely ruin you, socially, if that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I disable the submission collar with my science, Chris still has me by the proverbial balls!\" you thought. \"I have no choice but to play along with her humiliating game... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you will be a good girl?\" asked Chris, smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you nodded and she patted your head, giggling. \"I can only keep this spell up for a few days, at best, around the same time mom and dad are due back home.\" she reminded you. \"After that, you will have no knowledge of me ever doing this to you so there will be no lingering effects, hurt feelings, or grudges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't have too much fun at my expense!\" you warned. \"My science is equal to your magic, I can send you through this nightmare just as easily as you are to me!\" you then paused, giving Chris an evil smile. \"Don't believe me, call my bluff and see what happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grunted, ignoring your threat and gave your chain a heavy pull. \"Heal, girl!\" she commanded, sending a charge of magic through the leash and collar. \"Let's take a walk through the park!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a warmth run through you but it was immediately halted by your own power, allowing you to resist her. Still, you obeyed, not wanting her to cancel her own spell and leave you naked outside. \"I could teleport myself back to my laboratory with relative ease.\" you thought. \"But first I would have to disable this accursed submission collar without her knowing about it so she doesn't cancel her spell at a bad time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very angry, frustrated, and humiliated, knowing that Chris, for the moment, had full power over you and intended to take advantage of it for as long as it lasted. However, deep down, you were impressed, knowing that her powers had grown and, if anyone outside of the family attacked her, she would be able to defend herself and retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Chris was secretly impressed with you as well. \"His resistance is a lot higher than before.\" she thought. \"That's good, it means that I won't have to worry about him as much.\" she then allowed herself a low giggle. \"Now let's see if his patience has grown as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, blushing brightly, you walked into the park, about three blocks from home with Chris walking at your side. Occasionally, she yanked on the chain, ordering you to 'heal'. Upon reaching the park, Chris stopped at small booth where she pulled out a small bag and a pair of gloves, which she placed into her small purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in case you have to 'go'.\" she said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, knowing that she was going to try to force it to happen. \"She must be enjoying every second of my 'dog' humiliation!\" you thought, hoping she gets bored with the game soon. \"As soon as I can find a place where I will not be seen for a while, I'll disable this collar, cancel her spell, and teleport myself back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Chris knew what you were planning, as she would plot the same if the roles were reversed. She kept you clear of anyplace that would allow you any privacy. She looked down at you, happy that you had managed to keep your cool, for the moment. Then, she decided to push you a little further by sending a quick spell into you through the leach and collar, causing your bladder to quickly fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" you thought, frustrated. \"She's going to force me to relieve myself in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered at her, knowing that your speech would be interpreted as barks to everyone else and Chris looked down at you, smiling evilly. \"What's wrong, girl?\" she asked, sounding innocent. \"Do you have to go?\" she then whispered, \"You know you have to do it as a dog does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated and feeling humiliated, you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then clarity sparked as Chris whispered, \"Female dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great.\" you sighed then tried squatting waiting to relax so your bladder would release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a cute dog.\" some guy said to Chris making you realize people were watching.  Immediately, you bladder froze as you felt the humiliation of everyone's eyes seeing you naked and peeing in the park.  Fortunately, your technologically superior intellect overcame that thought as it was just an illusion of exposure, and relief quickly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was now having quite a conversation with that guy, and no wonder.  He was obviously very cute, at least from your analysis of his features, clothes, and stature compared to what you knew that a witch girl would think.  He seemed just slightly older and taller which would put him in the high percentile of the ideal height and maturity that would be attractive to a girl of Chris's size and years.  Again, this was proof that only science could determine, not attraction by magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited patiently scanning the park for whoever else may be watching and would see any action you took.  This was your chance. With Chris distracted you could have the lab use its technology through your power to remotely disable the submission collar, but you would keep pretending until you could teleport away and break the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just then you noticed that the guy had a dog on a leash.  It was just sniffing aimlessly behind him until it caught sight, or perhaps the scent, of you.  It cocked its head and stared.  It's eyes seemed perplexed by what it saw rather than interest.  Suddenly you noticed that it had a collar on very similar to what Chris had put on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to concentrate hard at the dog using applied physics to get through the interference around the creature that was distorting its real shape so your eyes couldn't see. Not to your astonishment, the dog began to fade and another shape came into focus in its place.  You would normally call on your power to use advanced technology to rapidly cut through, but that would alert Chris of your growing power.  Also, it was good practice to use the logic side of the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the second shape could be supposed while it gained further definition.  It was also human, but a female.  A rather attractive female, at least from your analysis of her features, shape and curvature, and poise compared to what you knew that a mad scientist would think.  She seemed just slightly younger and smaller than yourself which would put her in the high percentile of the ideal height and maturity that would be attractive to a boy of your size and years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to initiate disabling the collar when the dog/girl trotted over your way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jan stood up and turned towards the oncoming dog-disguised girl as he used a quick surge of his power and the lab's technology to disable the submission collar and convert it to a spell-absorption device. He was sure that Chris would notice the power surge, so he shook himself and barked at the other dog as it approached hoping that would distract her into thinking he was just excited about the other animal. It seemed to work, as Chris started to pull his leash tight and sent another shock along it, but then eased up telling \"Jane\" to be quiet and went back to her conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they kept getting closer, Jan could not make out more than the face of the girl. Her body seemed to be wrapped in a haze of pixelization. However, if he let his mind relax, the dog she was came through perfectly clear. In fact, she was a male dog, and Jan could see her sheath and scrotum hanging and swinging as she approached. He wondered if she could see him - his male human body, and he suddenly felt very self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">H e l l o ?</font></span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sound like an echo across an empty stadium formed within Jan's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Use telepathy science. Con-cen-trate.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time a bit stronger, and Jan realized it was the girl trying to communicate with him. Normally, he would have invoked the Inter-Human Telegraphic Communications Link, but that would use so much power that Chris was bound to realize he was up to something and intervene. So he pulled from his memory what he'd studied on the old-fashion science of mind reading and thought transmission. As he began to concentrate, the connection between them gradually sharpened as if tuning an analog radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, again. Can you understand me now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Clearly. Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cayenne, a third level mad scientist. And you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jan. That's my sister, Christina. I'm a mad scientist, and she is a witch.\" he says then adds after a pause, \"There are levels?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. When you go into formal training your knowledge and abilities are tested against the standard scientific knowledge and execution criteria to judge your progress towards a master of mad science. Your parents should have explained this to you. Can your sister do telepathy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I didn't know there was actual training. Not telepathy. She can only understand when I dog speak out loud. My sister and I have been learning and experimenting since we discovered our powers, and on our own, with little pranks and testing each other, keeping our abilities secret from our parents so as not to frighten them or have them lock us away. They aren't much into such things. Just normal parents with no interest in science or magic, or any technical skills or imagination.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, \u2026 OK.\" Cayenne seemed to be holding something back, maybe just an opinion, but that slipped right past Jan. \"So, is this one of your pranks?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my sister's. I'm stuck temporarily in a reality spell where everyone except she and her friends sees me as a dog, ... a ... ah female dog.\" Jan ends rather embarrassed then continues showing his confidence and scientific ability, \"As you approached, I was able to disable her submission spell and collar while distracting her so it has been realigned to be a spell catcher and repository after converting them to base elemental molecular form. I'm just waiting for an opportunity to dissolve the reality spell and teleport to my lab before the spell's disguise over me reveals \u2026 ah ... me ...\" now getting embarrassed again, \"in my ...ah, full glory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am trapped under similar enchantment. My brother is a witch at bronze cauldron level, fairly strong. He just learned this reality spell and used it on me at the bequest of some witches in a coven at school. They told him that if he subdued a mad scientist and humiliated one enough to break him or her, they would let him join. He said this would arrange to give me the opportunity to really show my projected self. It seems he's trying to convince your sister to do something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan instantly thought of the conversation with Cody. \"Surely Chris wouldn't fall for some sweet talking cute guy's evil plan just to humiliate me.\" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCayenne continued, \"We've always competed with each other, but I never thought he would do such a thing to me. The coven must have promised him something he couldn't refuse or maybe they did some group magic to turn him. I don't know, but I will not let them take him. I just have to find out what he intends and convince him that the their coven is not what he really wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also was able to sneak out of his submissive spell. Actually, he uses that so much, I have developed an immunity, but I never let him know. Can you see the real me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only your face. I want to get a clear vision of your body, but my tries are having difficulty getting to it.\" Jan projected from his mind, then quickly added thinking that he sounded like a pervert about to ogle her body, \"Not that I need to ... er see ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're actually being prevented by your own honesty and modesty regions of the cerebrum lobes of your brain. Your discipline to use science technology knowledge properly indicates a high level, perhaps even a five.\" she explained. \"And you should know that I can't see you. When I first spotted the dog form, there was a sort of aura emanating from it, a sure sign of a spell. I took a chance at communicating hoping you might be a mad scientist and may be able to help me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help any way I can, but we both have to break the spells and escape.\" Jan offered. But something strange was also happening to him. He was starting to get very agitated and his body was heating up. \"Is it getting warm out here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a new odor in the air that could be affecting us.  Perhaps an aroma spell. I seem to be getting very excited for no reason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought conversation had all taken just a few seconds as telepathy and thought all function at the speed of light especially true when done by mad scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan looked over at Chris and saw her give him an evil smirk then turn and wave at some of her friends to come over. Looking the other way, Cayenne's brother was motioning several rough looking boys and girls over as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to act fast before they get here and see me naked acting like a dog.\" Jan looked around. His focus on Cayenne had shifted back to just seeing her dog cover which had ears and tail erect and the tail flipping back and forth excitedly in short wags. Jan couldn't see his dog cover, but assumed it was doing similar. Cayenne's also showed its mouth open and panting. She was now straining on the leash for some reason to get over to Jan who had turned and was starting to walk away slowly with Cayenne behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay.\" Chris commanded holding up her hand, and Jan stopped so she thought she still had him under submission. Just then Cayenne's leash went limp and she bolted towards him. Everyone was getting close, and Jan had to make the most difficult decision of his life so far. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then your superior intellect kicked in and you realized what was happening. \"Oh, God, Cayenne is being forced to mate with me!\" you thought, feeling sick and betrayed. \"That must mean that Chris has every intention to make my transformation a reality and get me pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no other choice in your mind. You summoned the power of your laboratory and ordered it to activate a satellite  teleport, sending both you and Cayenne to the medical bay of your lair. The reactor, powering your lab came to life and your computers sent a command to an orbiting satellite. Seconds later, just as Cayenne reached you, the satellite fired a beam, striking you both. Instantly, you and Cayenne vanished from the park and reappeared inside a massive, impressively equip  laboratory, returned to your normal selves, the collars missing. Only, you and Cayenne were both naked and worse, you were not inside your laboratory, you were somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" you whispered to yourself, slightly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This is not your laboratory?\" asked Cayenne, becoming alarmed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, not wanting to face her while she was naked. \"No, it is not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the collective, Juan Smith and Cayenne Jones.\" said a male voice approaching them. \"I am Zed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCayenne let out a low scream and instinctively jumped behind you, blushing, as you instinctively stood your ground, though you were blushing yourself. \"State the nature and reason for this abduction!\" you demanded, summoning your power. \"We are in no mood for any games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abduction?\" asked the man, smiling. \"Dear boy, you were <i>rescued</i> from a hoard of witches, both male and female.\" he then frowned. \"Also, this is not a game, far from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the process of returning myself and my associate to my laboratory.\" you protested. then, you became curious. \"I beg your pardon, the collective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"The collective is a gathering of mad scientists, psychically linking all of their laboratories and minds through a massive network allowing us to become one, superior intelligence.\" he said, proudly. \"We summoned you here with our power as it would be impossible to trace to its source, even with so many witches in one localized area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" said Cayenne, finding her voice. \"We must demand some attire before we listen to any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed snapped his fingers and two young girls, both about ten years of age and looking very much afraid, very quickly but carefully approached you and Cayenne with a neatly folded stack of clothing in their arms. \"May I have the honor of dressing you, my lord?\" asked the first girl, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the young girl, your heart going out to her, then turned to Zed, your eyes demanding an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are two of our <i>servants.</i>\" explained Zed. \"They are young witches we are in the process of converting to mad scientists, like yourself.\" he sighed. \"Please understand that they first must be broken of their magic before we can convert them to our ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brainwashing!\" you thought, terrified. \"These people are insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pupils are dilated, your heart rate has accelerated by nearly 20.3 percent.\" said Zed, still smiling. \"Also, your adrenaline levels are spiking, along with your mental power.\" he shook his head. \"Try to relax, these girls are having a very difficult time right now but within a few months, they will <i>thank </i> us for our efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my lord.\" begged the small girl, tearing up. \"Allow me the honor to dress you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my greatest pleasure to dress you, my lady.\" begged the second girl, tearfully bowing to Cayenne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the nearly broken faces of the two girls then turned to Zed, becoming enraged. \"Normally, I welcome the customs of other nations, races, and religions.\" you said, your power steadily rising. \"But this... cruelty, I can not, will not tolerate from anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you summoned your full power and you, along with Cayenne and the two frightened girls were teleported away from Zed, into the safety of your laboratory. The two girls looked around, in shock at the sheer size of your lair, then completely broke into tears. Only there was no time for you to ascertain why, you had to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMPUTER, RED ALERT!\" you commanded. \"ACTIVATE LOCK DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, sirens went off everywhere inside your laboratory as all normal exits were quickly sealed with massive metal walls the rose from the floor. Cayenne watched you for a moment, slightly impressed, then did her best to comfort the two girls you had rescued from Zed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not allow those maniacs to get their hands on me or Chris!\" you said. then you paused. \"Chris! Computer, locate sibling identified as Christina Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sibling, Christina Smith is in town park.\" replied the computer. \"Her biological stats are elevated by 26.4 percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is upset!\" you thought. then you asked, \"Is there any signs indicating Christina's life is in jeopardy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative.\" came the computer's response. \"Scans indicate that she is searching for something that is lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your chin, thoughtful. \"Computer, how much time has elapsed between my teleport from town park and my arrival within this laboratory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four minutes, twenty three and one half seconds.\" replied the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed then turned to Cayenne. \"I hate to say this, but, if we are to warn my sister and your bother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must go back into the game.\" finished Cayenne. \"I understand. This Zed and his collective are a clear threat to peace between witches and mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the two girls, huddling in a corner. \"Computer, provide my two guests with proper essentials, they are to be kept safe until my return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged.\" replied the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then turned to the two girls. \"You are safe here.\" you told them. \"My laboratory will provide you will all you will need until I can return you both home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls immediately fell into tears. \"Thank you!\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to Cayenne. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you and Cayenne were back in your collars, only they were powerless now, in your original disguises. Chris turned to you, looking worried. \"Where did you disappear to?\" she asked. \"Bad girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"There is something important you need to know, sis.\" you said, seriously. \"Hear me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Chris say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't do anything terrible or try to break you, and the little half broken witches wouldn't either, you were sure.  But allowing anyone else in is a big risk.

How will I know where it will be?\" Cayenne interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you meet me later when I go to my coven? Since you were with Jan, you can support the story and convince them.  Then you'll know even before Jan.\" Chris winked at Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  I better do a flash transfer spell to send myself back.  Can you open a gate?  Oh, yeah, where are we so I can make it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris waved her hand and said something you don't understand, but Cayenne smiled and nodded.  Next Cayenne turned her back to them while her smile became a smirk and her eyes lit up as she vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  Now sis I need to get back to my lab and talk to the withes to see what Zed may have done to them and let them know they will be safe back with witches very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sense in creating a another gate. See you later, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you connected with the lab, and your combined powers did a perfect teleport.  This was really true science, and it always felt so good.  Not like the smoke and mirrors magic that ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>INTRUDER ALERT.  WARNING.  Unknown person has materialized without authorization.

'Eligere Sententia' was Latin for 'elite way of thinking', a fitting name for a private school that trained young mad scientists in the art of their science based powers.

Unknown to me, Chris had cast a spell, changing herself into a being of energy and was slowly stepping into my place, surrounding me like a second skin. I felt something driving itself into key spots in my back, legs, and arms and knew that she was locking herself into place. Finally, I heard her voice inside my thoughts. \"It is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're off to Eligere Sententia, then.\" I thought back. \"How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels weird.\" replied Chris in your thoughts. \"We better get going, Dr Vague is expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the telephone booth, closing the door, then picked up the receiver and dialed the number. After three rings, someone answered, \"Hang up and you will be teleported.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant you placed the receiver onto the hook, there was a bright flash and you found yourself in a large, well decorated office with a tall and powerfully built man sitting behind an great oak desk. \"Welcome to Eligere Sententia boys boarding school, Jan.\" he said. \"I'm glad that you could come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Dr Vague.\" you replied. then you thought, \"You still there, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little nauseous but I'm still here.\" replied Chris in your head. \"That was quite a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled inwardly. \"You get used to it.\" you thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm slightly hurt that you felt the need to shield yourself, Jan.\" said Vague. \"Has news of this conflict shaken you so badly that your trust in everyone has slipped?\" he took a step away from his desk. \"Your heart rate is rising and I sense a certain amount of concern, care to enlighten me, Jan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing your reactions, Devon smiled kindly. \"Relax, children, you have nothing to fear from me.\" he said. \"Please show me your evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris summoned all that she and you had gathered then levitated herself up to place it all on the desk in front of Devon who thanked her politely as she returned her feet to the floor. Devon poured over the papers, video disks, and photos, occasionally grunting or nodding his head. Finally he placed the papers aside and eyed you and Chris as a low sigh escaped his lips. \"This is most disturbing indeed.\" he said. \"Both Elena and Zed are considered rogues by both sides, they could be promising their followers anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming his fingers onto the desk, he looked towards a window and stared out it for what seemed like an eternity before knotting his jaws in decision. \"I must call my sister, let her know of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly took up a telephone and dialed a number before hitting the speaker phone switch. \"Elvira, we need to talk.\" he said, firmly. \"Can you meet me in inside Crystalline cave within an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very rare that you call me Devon.\" replied a familiar feminine voice on the other line with some concern. \"Why do you want to meet in the neutral regions, is there an emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just received strong evidence that points to two rogues, one for each side, trying to rekindle the dark war.\" replied Devon, gravely. \"We must act quickly before this gets out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause before Elvira replied. \"Very well, Devon, I will see you in one hour. Bring those who presented you with the evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the line went dead and Devon turned off the speaker phone and turned back to you. \"You must accompany me  to the neutral regions of the Crystalline cave system.\" he said. \"My sister is not very trusting of me and I am not trusting of her but... we are still family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who might your sister be?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chris gasped, her face turning an ashen white. \"You're sister, she's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded. \"Elvira Strange, the head witch.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Crystal Caverns were located under the Atlantic ocean floor, off the coast of Florida. The trip there only took a few seconds as Devon used a teleportation device to take himself, you, and Chris there. The entrance was an air pocket found deep inside a blue hole. \"I will go first, watch what I do carefully then follow after ten seconds, one at a time.\" said Devon with a firm seriousness. \"The crystal caves are guarded by dragons, the last of their kind. they do not like a crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hard swallow, you and Chris nodded then watched as Devon dived into the entrance of the cave, which had a strong current of air to keep out the Atlantic waters. You were not certain if it was magic or science that was causing this but it was indeed a powerful source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Devon had safely landed on a large stone ledge about a hundred feet down, he looked up at us then entered the cave as you went next. The air held you up but gradually allowed to fall as you positioned your body to fall towards the ledge.Once you landed safely, you looked down and shivered as you saw a collection of human skeletons from those who had either missed or were not invited. \"I hope Chis makes it.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the cave to find Devon waiting for you. Seeing your pale expression, he nodded. \"Those remains you saw were of divers who were unfortunate enough to find this place.\" he explained. \"You saw the sheer walls, once you hit the bottom, there is no climbing back up unless you can jump twenty feet to get back into the strong air current.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't the dragons, guarding this place pull them out?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without exposing themselves.\" replied Chis, appearing behind you. \"Dragons were nearly hunted to extinction by certain cultures of mankind, thinking they were demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A discussion for another time.\" said Devon. \"I'm certain Elvira is already waiting for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chris followed Devon through a number of carved out corridors to a huge chamber where you found Elvira, a tall  woman with night black hair and piercing green eyes. Eying her long black dress, you were impressed that she had great curves for her apparent age, though you did not voice this. You might have been a mad scientist but you were far from being suicidal as to risk insulting a witch.  Then, your eyes turned to a great white dragon, resting behind her with large red eyes and all canine teeth. He looked down at his four visitors and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rule, Elvira Strange and Devon Bizarre, no fights. The crystals absorb all energy that is released into its halls and chambers but it does <i>not</i> absorb dragon's fire.\" he said with a hiss to his baritone like voice. \"If you forget this rule and start fighting inside my home, all of you will receive a <i>deep</i> tan to remind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no fights here, Arragon.\" promised Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came in peace, we shall leave in peace.\" promised Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArragon nodded then turned to you and Chris. Catching his glare, Chris quickly said, \"We honor the rules of any home we visit, there will be no fights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here to prevent a fight.\" you added, just a quickly. \"It would do us no good to start one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may proceed.\" said Arragon. \"I will add my wisdom, when asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he fell silent as Elvira turned to you and Chris and said...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our side, their side, and then the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The witches side of the story is that witch boys became power hungry as they can not work magic and wanted a power of their own to level the field.\" said Devon, calmly. \"Of course, the witches had claimed that they offered any witch boy wanting power to become a witch but certain boys wished to be themselves and turned to science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me it goes deeper than that.\" said Chris, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded. \"According to the written logs of the time, we were dubbed 'mad' scientists as we experimented on witches to find a way to make their power work for us through science.\" he explained. \"Countless of witches became crippled or worse in the development of this power for boys. Through the years, as mad scientist became more powerful, witches claimed our hunger for power became greater. Eventually, a line was drawn and the war began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mad scientists' side of the story is that witch boys were seen as nothing but toys for amusement to their witch sisters, mothers, relatives, and friends.\" countered Elvira, equally as calm. \"So they say, witch boys were constantly humiliated and or tortured through the years until one brave boy decided he had suffered enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He stole a magic book.\" you said, guessing correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"According to legend, this boy used a magical artifact to study the magic book, while not transformed and spent the next twenty years of his life to develop and create what is now called 'mad' science. After the creation of his first laboratory, he teleported copies of his notes in a book entitled, 'The mad science book' into the hands of every witch boy, allowing them to fight back. Thus the war began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both sides have done what each claim but not to such a grad scale.\" said Arragon, chiming in. \"The truth is far more disturbing that anyone may imagine.\" He took a breath. \"Mad Science and witchcraft have existed, hand in hand, since the age of the Pharaohs. There existed an unsteady peace between the two powers until a madness plague ripped across Europe, thus the strange tales that came out of the Dark Ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A madness plague?\" asked Chris, startled. \"I never heard of such a disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bubonic plague was used to cover it up.\" replied Arragon. \"The madness disease effected everyone, including witches and mad scientists only, due to the power and inner jealousy of each other...\" he sighed. \"It was that madness that ultimately sparked the war and it did not end until the disease finally died out, fourteen years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane.\" you whispered. \"Why would Zed and Elena want such madness to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people can not let go of the war, regardless of what truly started it.\" replied Devon. \"The real question is, how to we stop this before its too late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will hold an emergency meeting with the witch council.\" said Elvira. \"Maybe we can think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded. \"I will call upon the mainstream collective and search for an answer.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care to come along, you two?\" asked Elvira. \"Your insights could be valuable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come gather with the collective, Juan and Christina.\" suggested Devon. \"Your knowledge would be invaluable to finding a swift solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you and Chis decide to go with?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is possible they will launch anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if this looks likely, any nearby chaotic scienist will wipe the island and everything on it off the map. again\" Devon says. \"I have some serious convining to do\" he says, cutting his link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Chris demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mad scientists may want to deal with this themselves, and they're more reckless than us. There is a reason why they're called mad\" Racel says. You bit your tongue. Elvira smiles. \"I need you to indicate when you've about 100 miles from the target. Then I'll teleport a strike team into Sydney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help?\" Chris asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way. It is the closest major witch population center in the region to that island. They would detect the teleports there and hopefully not focus on you\" Elvira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few minutes later, as you're about to board your plane, Elvira runs up to you, giving you a needle. \"One more thing. Eva is truely is spiteful and insane. If you disable her rockets, she might release the modified girl maker thought the island compound just to spite those who stopped her. We have this counteragent. If you come into contact this the agent, use the needle and inject yourself into the heart...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice. Realy nice...</span></div></div>",

The two were more partners than pet and master. Like you and 'Max', they spoke to each other telepathically. <i>\"No, Christina, I can't sense anything through that radiation.\"</i> the cat gave an apologetic meow. <i>\"Sorry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your familiar will have to remain on the plane, Chris.\" you said, hearing the cat. \"I don't have a shield geared for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, it was easier to put a shield on a pet carrier.\"</i> thought Madeline, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie, behave!\" whispered Chris. \"This is a dangerous mission, I don't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, you two!\" you snapped. \"We're within striking range of target, keep an eye out for traps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you said that, two poles shot out of the water and an energy shield appeared between them. It was part of a massive 'wall' to stop ships and low flying planes. The shield could come up all at once or in sections to save power and was triggered automatically by underwater motion detectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" you yelled, seeing the energy wall. \"We triggered a barrier trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roughly turned the stick, sending the plane spinning out of the way and around the section and through before the next section could be triggered. As you passed, the two poles sank back down into the water. <i>\"Max, any signs we've been detected?\"</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Negative, all is still silent.\"</i> replied Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madeline, anything?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline meowed urgently. <i>\"Hard right, magic trap!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Chris sensed it and roughly turned a stick of her own, turning the plane hard to the right as a large hand, made of water, rose up and slammed down, just missing the plane. \"Shit!\" you exclaimed. \"Eva set a few magical traps, she has to know we're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That trap is a century old.\" said Madeline's voice in your head. \"It's powered by an enchanted chest, used ages ago to cover the escape of a witch ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not take any chances.\" you said. \"Power up your shields and check your gear, I'm bringing the plane in cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you powered down all of the mechanical systems and hit the bio-cool down switch, instantly making the plane cold enough to seem it has not run in years. The rest was a simple matter of gliding the plan in for a landing with Chris using the magical systems to erase the fresh landing tracks in the soft sand. \"What's the plan, bro?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must split up to make this mission work.\" you said. \"I will go after the rockets with Max augmenting my power in case of any left over traps or automated defense systems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will I be doing?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have to keep Eva and any cronies she has occupied, without directly confronting them.\" you replied. \"Madeline can augment your power, if necessary, through the plane's magical systems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded then turned to Madeline. \"Do you remember how to do all of this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline looked up at Chris as if to smile. <i>\"I remember, just don't make me come to your rescue.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled, remembering that Madeline could become any cat, including a tigress. \"We'll be back.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline watched, meowing worriedly, as you and Chris departed the plane then jumped up onto a cushioned stand near come controls. <i>\"Return safely.\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

According to Devon, something like that happened the last time someone fought on this accursed rock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you about to look for a vent of something, you get two warnings from Max. The first is bad. <i>Analysis of vents indicate radioactive waste.

You know you can't afford to be tired here; Eva would do worse than leave you for a day as some sort of catgirl-mermaid hybrid as Chris did the last time you lost a fight against her. The second message is worse. <i>Missile launch sequence detected. Five minutes to launch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're failed, before you have even begun. Would Eva launch way before her own deadline? You grimace, not much relieved when Max informs you that the target is Elvira's distaction. You know that the scilock can shoot the missile down, but that would make Chris's mission harder, as well as your own, since Eva would be alerted to your presense. However you also know even if the missile is shot down by Elvira before it can reach Sydney, it would be detected. While a normal military might be able do, the science collective would for sure.

The rocket exploded, sending shock waves that shook the sandy beach. Only your smile faded as the shock waves also triggered the island's automatic defenses. The barrier shield went up all around the island with sirens going off everywhere and you turned to see numerous robot crabs, the size of small dogs coming out of the sand. You knew the crabs were 'old tech' but they were still lethal with their poisoned pincers and telescoped laser eyes. One shot at you, forcing the creation of a telekinetic shield, which took the risk of Eva detecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast it all!\" you whispered. \"So much for sneaking in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed that your mission had become more complicated, you decided to deal with the crabs quickly and fired off a localized EM pulse, an option on your shielding. The move fried the circuitry of the crabs but it reduced your shield's power by 10%, due to the heavy drain. \"I had better be more careful.\" you scolded yourself. \"I'm more vulnerable now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hurried across the sand to find a vet and, as Max had warned, it was lined with a thick gel like form of radioactive waste that caused the walls to glow slightly. Gulping, you saw no other choice and moved to enter the vent, only to jump aside as a flame shot out of it. Approaching more cautiously, you found a number of miniature flame throwers, all activated by motion detectors. \"The mad scientists of old truly went to extreme measures to keep out any uninvited guests.\" you stated to yourself. \"I don't have time to deactivate all of the defenses, Chris can't keep those rogues busy forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, you took a deep breath and took a flying leap into the vent, sliding down the slick radioactive walls with the flames reacting a second after you pass the sensors. By the time you reached the underground base to begin your mission, the shield had dropped another 10%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Proceed with extreme caution, Jan.\"</i> came Max's digitized voice. <i>\"You know have precisely twenty minutes of protection remaining in your shielding before you will be forced to draw upon your own power.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tell me something I don't know.\"</i> you thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The activated barrier can be seen from satellite imagery.\" replied Max. \"Approximately ten minutes before it is detected by a military power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" you whispered, annoyed. \"Just perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that time was not your ally, you hurried down the hall, using decade old schematics from Devon to find the rockets while, elsewhere....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had planned for the rocket to force the witches there to defend themselves, giving away their location to the already panicked mad scientist collective. Only, an old witch trap stopped the rocket before it could go anywhere. Annoyed, she looked at the command center, shaking her head at the technology the room offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe that, even after a decade, all of this is still beyond normal human comprehension.\" she whispered to herself, ruefully. \"Yet, no matter how advanced both sides have become, we are yet to determine who is stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, there can only be one power in this world... Evana.\" came a raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva turned sharply, hating to hear her full name being spoken, and gasped. \"Phobos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos was a mad scientist so obsessed with power that he molded his laboratory into the form of a robot and literally fused it to his own body, making him a living machine. During the Dark War, he was a vicious leader and a merciless enemy who caused both witches and mad scientists alike to shudder in fear before him. As he stood in the entrace to the command center, Phobos gave a low chuckle. \"The years have been good to you, sis.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you use my full name!\" said Eva, a twinge of fear in her voice. \"If I had my full power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have used your birthname... <i>Evon.</i>\" said Phobos, emphesising his sister's male name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva sighed, wanting to scream but she knew that she would not stand a chance against her older brother. \"I thought you had died in the last great conflict.\" she said, eying him. \"Where have you been hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never left the island.\" replied Phobos. \"I remained here, honing my skills, waiting for the war to erupt anew.\" he paused, looking at Eva with his dead robot eyes. \"It surprises me to see you here, Evana. I give you one last chance to reclaim your manhood and stand by my side, brothers reunited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva shook her head. \"You psychotic <i>mad</i> scientist!\" she screamed. \"I remember how you treated my sister with your 'noble' intentions. I was the one who defended her, even after she discovered magic. When it came time for us to chose a side in the war, I <i>begged</i> my mother to make me a witch!\" she sighed, keeping her distance. \"I knew, even then, the path your were going down would lead to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reconsider, my brother.\" said Phobos, ice in his tone. \"I would prefer to claim you as an ally than a trophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva summoned a flame to her hand then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking that Eva had found you, she ran down the hall to where the screams were coming from and entered the room. There she found Phobos, who she knew nothing about, using telekinesis to rip the bones from Eva's body. She gasped, hearing Eva's tortured screams, then turned red with anger. In her mind, no one deserved such a fate, action was called for and she knew it would take more power than she could summon alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her mind out, she screamed, <i>\"Jan!\"</i> before summoning all she dared to throw at the robot. You heard Chris' scream echoing in your mind and sent her all the energy you dared to release, reaching her immediately. Phobos looked up to Chris' scream just in time to see her throw a very powerful energy blast that threw him clear off his feet. He landed with a metallic crash on the other side of the room as Chris then quickly took a vial from her jacket pocket and gulped down its contents, making a face at the taste. \"How can he stand drinking this stuff!? she asked herself, feeling her strength and energy return. \"It's disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get me up!!\" screamed Eva in a blind panic. \"He'll kill us both if you don't hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris waved her hand, releasing Eva's bonds, then gave Eva one of the restoring serums. \"It tastes horrible but it'll quickly restore your energy and strength.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva drank down the serum, making a similar face, then pushed Chris out of the way as she ran out. \"Remind me to thank you later, if you live!\" she yelled, running out. \"I have some rockets to launch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\" screamed Chris, now regretting freeing her. \"Come back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would worry more about yourself, little lady.\" said Phobos, now standing again. \"No one attacks me and lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned to Phobos, knowing that she could not rely on another boast from you so she called to her familiar, Madeline, giving her a look through her eyes. \"Who or what is it?\" asked Chris. \"How do I fight it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response chilled her to the bone. \"He is Phobos, the living machine. You do not fight him alone, you run or die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, hearing this, ran for the door only to find it slam shut and seal as she felt something pulling on her body. It was to her good fortune that she was able to resist it, otherwise, she's be in a choke hold by Phobos' hand. \"You are Phobos, the living machine.\" said Chis, circling him. \"I need Eva alive, for now, to carry out my mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, pray tell is your mission?\" asked Phobos. \"You have nothing to lose, save your own life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mission is to re-secure the peace between witches and mad scientists.\" replied Chis. \"Eva is one of few trying to rekindle the Dark War... I need to stop her and to get her to tell me where her sister is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos grunted. \"You are too young to truly understand beauty the horror of war.\" he said. \"However, I shall give you a piece to take with you to the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he began his attack, using techniques that Chris never saw you ever use, slamming her against the wall or surgery table before she could offer any defense. He had slammed her around, cutting her, bruising her, burning her to the point that her magic became nearly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... no more.\" begged Chris, barely standing. \"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos laughed. \"How easy it is to make a witch beg for mercy!\" he said, amused. \"Now that you understand a little more about the beauty of war, I shall show you the horror.\" Chris' eyes widened to the size of saucers, seeing Phobos motion to the table. \"Get on unless you want me to place you there myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' lips trembled, fearing a slow and horrible death at the hands of this powerful enemy when a loud crunch reached her ears and she saw the door to the room being literally torn away by a giant metallic hand. Taking advantage of the distraction, Chris ran to the door as fast as her injured body would allow her as a giant robot came into view It looked like an old school diving suit but the left hand was replaced with a giant drill and the helmet was completely sealed with cameras instead of windows. As she took a stand near it, holing a magical artifact, Phobos turned to the new visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like shit, sis.\" You said through the robot. \"The rockets are all junk, thanks to this old battle suit I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jan, this is...\" began Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phobos, the living machine.\" you said, interrupting. \"Yes, I read about him.\" he then turned to Phobos. \"You have a lot of balls, daring to hurt my sister, you tincan! Let's see how well you fair when the odds are more even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you charged Phobos, knocking him to the metal floor. Phobos, completely enraged, fights back physically and the two of you began to roll around on the floor, exchanging blows. Chris, caught in the middle, managed to gulp down another restoring serum before running from the room at full speed. She had no time to pick a direction as you and Phobos crashed through the wall in an all out death match. Unknown to Chris, you had summoned the power of your lab to increase your power, knowing full well it could trigger your gender to forever change....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a strange voice, she said, \"I am Christaun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristaun ran back into the command center, through its halls at incredible speed to find Phobos, preparing an escape ship he had built in the decade he was living on the island. \"I will miss this island, many memories lie here.\" he said to himself, opening the hatch to the small submarine. \"No matter, I still have my mansion in the south Pacific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will forever remain here, Phobos.\" said Chistaun, appearing. \"This war will not continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos laughed. \"So, the legend behind twin witches is true.\" he said. \"Even as one being, you can not stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristaun did not respond, she merely waved her hand, causing the submarine to completely dismantle on its own, leaving Phobos no means of escape. \"I will not be stopping you, the 11.0 earthquake will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos, though it could not be seen, turned pale. \"That high of a magnitude could crack the very Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beauty and horror of war.\" said Christaun with a rueful smile. \"The earthquake will sink the island but no tidal waves will come of it as the shield around the island will prevent it.... ironic, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos growled, sending forth a powerful lightning blast only Christaun knocked it away, sending it into a control panel, destroying it completely. \"You're science is powerful, Phobos.\" she said, calmly. \"So is magic but the union of the two is stronger still, you can not win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream of rage, Phobos began to fire everything he had at Christaun as she, in turn, fought back. The entire compound shook with their duel while, inside a mansion on the Australian shore, Elvira frowned, sensing the massive power levels coming from the island. Standing by her side was mom and dad who stood with worried looks dominating their expressions. \"Phobos is on that island.\" said Elvira to mom, who began to cry. \"It's forced the merger.\" she shook her head and sighed. \"We have no choice, I will tell Devon to begin the countdown. Hell's Gate Island must be sent to bottom of the ocean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Juan and Christina!?\" asked mom, distraught. \"You sent them there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They volunteered.\" Elvira fired back. \"They knew the risks from, the beginning.\" she then sighed. \"Had I known Phobos was still alive, I would have gone myself but it's too late for regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked away as mom fell into dad's arms, crying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the island, Phobos pushed Christaun into a shattered electrical panel, causing her to scream as her body shook with convolutions. \"Die, abomination!\" screamed Phobos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christaun's body took the electrocution, Jan laboratory at home took the damage. Sparks flew from every machine as alarms sounded and robots scrambled to put out the small fires that were sparking everywhere. Jan knew that if he took too much damage, he would become a witch. He dared not think of the reverse and took all the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Scilock jet, Madeline sensed Jan's move and shook her head. <i>\"Typical boy.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"Always playing the macho hero.\"</i> she sighed. <i>\"I'd better boost Chris's share of the power or I'll never hear the end of it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she glowed, changing shape, becoming a a full grown tigress. Madeline roared, her power reaching Christaun immediately, giving her the power to throw Phobos off of her. She walked away from the panel then waved her hand, taking away a section of Phobos' armor.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was ironic to Christaun to find a small 13 year old boy, sleeping inside the chamber as it explained the name of the feared and dreaded living machine. Phobos, Greek for fear, as its creator feared it. <i>\"You poor, unfortunate fool.\"</i> thought Christaun, shaking her head. <i>\"You gave the AI of your laboratory too much freedom. It became corrupt and your slave quickly became your master.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not the first to discover my secret, abomination.\" said Phobos, his body already repairing itself. \"My creator had wished to see the end of the war with his own eyes. I am granting him his wish, even if it takes an eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark War is over, Phobos!\" said Christaun, charging him. \"Your services are not longer required!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war is never over!\" raged Phobos, fighting back. \"Not so long as one power stands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggle renewed only this time, Phobos was forced to be on the defensive as Christaun gave him not time to focus on repairs as she pounded away on the lines that were holding the sleep chamber to his massive frame. energy blasts, flame attacks, lasers, and shields were thrown everywhere as the two struggled in this one on one duel to the death. \"I will not be defeated by two children!\" screamed Phobos, lashing out with an energy sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade sliced deep into Christaun's arm, drawing blood from Madeline's right front leg as she roared in pain. Your laboratory responded by increasing power output, allowing Christaun to fire back with sword of flame, slicing away one of the four power lines to the sleep chamber. As this was done, the boy inside began to stir. \"I do not believe your creator will be pleased with you once he awakens, Phobos.\" said Christaun, slashing the second power line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos did not answer as he roared with rage, lashing out with all he had with Christaun countering, doing all she could to disconnect the last two power lines. It was a duel unlike any either you or Chris ever faced. A power blast from Phobos sent Christaun flying off her feet, into a wall of twisted and jagged metal, forcing an explosion at your laboratory, taking out a third of its power to keep Christaun intact for as long as possible. Inside the Scilock jet, Madeline laid down, no longer able to stand as all of her legs suffered damage. <i>\"This death duel will end soon.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"I only pray Chris and Jan come out victorious.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the mainland of Australia, mom and dad were still looking out in the direction of Hell's ate Island. \"They are strong, Elvira, we raised them that way.\" said dad, trying to be of comfort. \"They will come home alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pray you're right, Simon.\" said mom, tears falling. \"I had hoped to keep them out of this war but it came to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then began to wail again with Simon doing all he can to keep himself together. Withing them Elvira Strange sighed. \"I should gone myself.\" she whispered. \"Forgive me, children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the island, Christaun had managed to tear out the third power line and had her hand on the fourth. \"This ends now, Phobos!\" she screamed. \"Awaken, Francis Kruse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped the line out with a satisfying spark of electricity and the chamber opened, sending the boy, Francis, falling out of Phobos and rolling away on the metal floor. He immediately awakened and rubbed his eyes before turning to his robot creation with fear and hatred in his eyes. \"You... You... <i>abomination!</i>\" he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to where you belong!\" demanded Phobos, moving towards Francis. \"The war still rages on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war is over!\" screamed Francis, angrily. \"Strangely Bizarre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobos halted, inches from taking the boy into his arms, all of its systems shut down and unmoving. Francis then rose, unsteadily, to his feet and walked over to Christaun. \"The attack on this island will come very soon.\" he said, shaking. \"We must leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we must move quickly.\" replied Christaun. \"You are unable to run in your condition, I will carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish it.\" said Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Christaun five minutes to leave the compound and return to the Scilock jet. By then, the ground had already begun to shake violently. She found no sign of Eva, though she did scream her name. She boarded the jet and strapped Francis in before returning to two individuals. Only there was no time for you to worry about which gender you were at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out of here, now!\" you yelled, ignoring your voice. \"Chris activate only the magical systems, we have to get passed that water trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that!\" replied Chis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jet was soon airborne and was flying away from the rapidly sinking island. In his seat, Francis stared out the window, crying for his sister as he had originally created his robot to bring a peaceful end to the war. He found it disturbing that his good intentions had created a monster. \"I'm through with science.\" he whispered. \"Good bye sis.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, he was not an exact match of her DNA, or his either. If either of those were true, then the defensive isolation neutralizer would have had a positive green match from the personal characteristics authorization database and not have initiated level five containment around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to relax, Jan projected his personal power into the lab's energy-matter modifier to transform himself back, but nothing happened.  Figuring it was also confused by his mixed molecular state, Jan sent a mental signal to the security verification designation module to disengage and stop this nonsense.  Immediately, the lab responded with a mild shock to Jan and upped containment to level seven.  Jan then began to fume at his sister knowing she must have known this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main computer quickly asked Jan, \"Miss Christina ??  Why have you materialized in your brothers lab? You know he has instructed me never to allow even you to be released.  Only he has the technical ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Chris.  It's me. Turn this thing off!\" Jan interrupted the synthetic patter although only the two of them could understand over the screaming alarms, the containment field not even allowing sound to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try Miss Christina, but just because you have no clothing doesn't mean I can't see you. Juan's advanced physical definition restorer has clearly unmasked your frail magic so that my sensors have visual ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut this now or when I get out of this, your hyper-auto determination neurological converter amplifier will be taken and shoved into your anterior positronic output collator so that your seismetric gyroscopic pressures increase until you ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then the computer realized only Juan knew those technical details, and was relieved when the lights and sound effects went off.  It didn't want any rearrangement of any of its mechanical or electronic mechanisms, especially those being described by Juan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan closed his eyes to calm himself while he counted to ten.  He was glad Chris wasn\u2019t there or she\u2019d be laughing at his predicament (actually she was using her crystal ball and enjoying this immensely). Once he was relaxed, he stepped forward right into the containment beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIT !!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that it can't be turned completely off without dual control input authentication per Juan's failsafe instructions; but at level two, intercommunication with the lab can be recognized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan was so exasperated, that all he did was exactly that - free himself and add his current PMD (physical-mental DNA) to the PCAD (see above).  He thought about modifying the whole reactive defense system so his mad scientist power could be transmitted through any electronic containment wall and be a positive identification factor recognizer, but that would take time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was short now, and he needed to get the rescued witches ready to be put under the protection of Chris's coven. \"Where were they, anyway?\" he wondered as he strode forward still naked looking like his sister but forgetting that fact. \"I hope all this scientific warning protection alarms didn't scare the poor things further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow!  That was close.\" one of the young witches said as she came walking over to Jan. Neither of the witches had seen Chris before, and they actually thought Jan was an agent of their coven who somehow broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't sure it could be turned off at first.  This lab is more complex and sophisticated than Zed's.  If he ever got his hands on this, ...\" the other informed Jan with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first quickly added, \"Are you alright?  I think I can still do a healing spell. This place let's me do some minor magic that I've recovered since we escaped Zed's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Jan had turned off the anti-magic diffuser shield when he had first teleported the witches seemed to be a good thing now to let these, what Jan thought as broken and harmless, witches recover without his lab zapping them. Jan now remembered how his sister had snuck in once and he had to install this after she \"played\" with him. He began to be distracted by other modifications and \"playing\" with his sister when he was brought back to the present when the other little witch spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is much more sophisticated and not like Zed's that manipulated anything we tried so he could break us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir constant mention of Zed had Jan very intrigued to find out more about Zed's lab and capabilities.  His logical scientific right-sided mind, as well as compassion, instantly narrowed his focus on what Zed did to them so he could help them recover plus know how it works to combat it. Jan continued to dismiss his current physical state of Chris's form which he found very comfortable and ignored the subtle changes in the lab as well. There were some runes on equipment as well as small things here and there that looked like little creatures hanging onto the sides of some equipment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about Zed's and what he did so that I can better protect us all and modify the lab as necessary.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two witches eyes went wide, and they backed off. Suddenly the lasers fired several short bursts and Jan felt for a moment like her body turned to jelly.  There was a flash, and he had a nanosecond blackout before the sound and lights dissipated leaving him standing once again fully himself, a male, naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witches gasped and seemed to be holding themselves back from bowing down as they whispered to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I thought she was from the coven getting an interim report.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Her, ah ... his science is powerful, and he used it as a woman, but he <u>is</u> quite a man. He will definitely be a great asset to us, er ... our cause.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan had turned to grab a nearby lab coat (since he still had no clothes on) and didn't see them talk. When he came back around, he explained, \"My sister had put a little spell on me and, a ... forgot to remove it when I teleported. We sort of play with each other this way.\" he added a bit embarrassed at having been tricked by his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their expressions and now remembering what they said that Zed had done, Jan kicked himself knowing he probably just scared them by the powerful bio-electronic techno-physic demonstration of science over magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that without explaining first. I didn't mean to frighten or offend you.\u201d Jan rattled off until he needed a breath, then continued, \u201cIs there anything I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other. Their eyes met and sparkled as just a hint of a smirk pulled at their mouths.  When they turned back, they asked if Jan could help them reverse the treatment Zed had done on them.  Perhaps allow them to work with Jan's computer to develop a process to break the science and let them regain respect for magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis struck Jan as not unlike what he would have proposed to do especially if no one had come up with a plan to return them to the coven.  His natural good-heartedness would always be his greatest asset, and he instantly agreed to help just as realized he hadn't told them of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I completely forgot. My sister is arranging for her coven to take you under their protection and to set a place and time where we will meet them.  They will protect you until you can be reunited with yours.\" Jan blurted out before he again forgot to tell them. \"Until then, anything you can tell the computer about specifics of Zed's techniques would help us battle him, and there's no reason that it can't be used to help you recover as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two thanked Jan profusely to the point at almost groveling at his feet. It made Jan feel very good that he could help, although their overreaction embarrassed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner call.  Your mom is searching the house for you.\" the computer announced before Jan could initiate a proper planning methodology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have go but will be back later when I find out where the transfer is to take place.  Computer, work with these two to set a way to break them of science and institute pride for magic.\" Then turning back to warn them, \"Be careful and don't overdo it. The lab has a self protection program and might react unintentionally if magic starts making things fly around the room.\" Jan smiled and winked at them, then rushed back out the secret door and headed to his room to get dressed before his mom got upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two witches looked at each other amazed for a several seconds as smiles crept across their faces. Then they said simultaneously, \"He will definitely make an excellent witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one then added, \"Once we break and control him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other chimed in with, \"And his lab will give us cover to subdue then rule all mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My father thought she would make a fine mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect compatibility .\" you said, now smiling yourself. \"Perhaps that is why my sister and I get along so well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stuck her tongue out at you, winking as she did. You winked stuck your tongue out in return, causing mom to giggle slightly as she brought a large pot of soup to the table. \"Careful, you two.\" she said. \"If you act like toddlers too much, I just might make your bodies match your behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a personal note, kids.\" said dad, looking at mom. \"Your mother had, and still does have some great 'software'.\" he chuckled. \"I know my 'hardware' reacts, every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blushed brightly but dared not giggle, as you reacted in a similar manner. Mom merely shook her head, grinning. She knew why dad was talking the way he was and sighed. <i>\"Here we go again.\"</i> she thought. then she said, \"I just finished telling the kids to behave themselves and you start acting like a child, making a mockery of our usually very productive dinner conversation!\" she sighed. \"What ever am I to do with you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad frowned. \"I was not my intention to instigate inappropriate social behavior.\" he said, simply. \"I was merely attempting to convey your unrivaled beauty in terms that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In terms that would embarrass me.\" said mom with a sigh. \"I believe you need to learn a lesson... <i>young man</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she waved her hand and dad transformed before yours and Chris' eyes. You watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as dad regressed back several years. \"Honey, no!\" cried dad in protest, his voice becoming very child like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be my husband again after a good nights rest in a crib.\" said mom, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, dad had been reduced to a mere infant. Mom walked over and picked him up, shaking off his old clothing, before taking him to the counter where she conjured up a number of baby items. Concerned, Chris and you walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really turned dad into an infant?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Your father burned himself out a little due to over work.\" explained mom. \"When he does that, he tends to get a little strange minded. When that happens, I return him to an age where he will be guaranteed a full stomach and a good nights rest.\" she grinned at you and Chris. \"It's better than listening to his rambling all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chris laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were excused from the dinner table, you returned to your lab to find that your two guests were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, on to your mischief. You entered the room, surprised to find it was ransacked and angered to find the person responsible was still there! It was a young woman, you estimated to be in her early twenties, with shoulder length light brown hair and piercing green eyes. The woman was frantically searching your sisters bedroom for something, pulling out drawers and dumping their contents onto the floor, before quickly and carefully going through the pile. Obviously, it had to have been very important for her to tear apart a little girl's room. Your mind set switched from a bratty sibling to a protective brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does that woman think she is!?!\" you thought, becoming enraged. \"She's wrecking my sister's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately, silently returned yourself to normal, with your normal clothing, and summoned your tech wand to your hand so to face her. \"Identify yourself immediately!\" you declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spun around, surprised, to find you with your wand ready. \"Well, well, well.\" she said, placing her hands onto her hips. \"The teenage witch has a mad scientist brother.\" she smiled. \"A twin brother, no less, interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Identify or defend yourself!\" you said, growing impatient. \"You have no business inside my sister's bedroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do you.\" countered the woman, smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live here, you don't.\" you replied, calmly. \"Last chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then quickly hit a small code of buttons on your wand without looking, showing the woman, if she knew about mad science, that you were not a novice at the dueling game. The woman saw the movement of your thumb and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Helena Young.\" she said, finally, giving a slight bow. \"I am searching for a certain 'artifact' that I need to save my sister, Eva Morgana, from an unjust imprisonment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Helena Young and Eva Morgana were rogues, or evil witches, stripped of their power and wanted by their fellow witches for crimes of cruelty. Of course, if you did know, you might not have cared, you were defending your sister's room and her honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have asked her in private.\" you said, coolly. \"Then again, I doubt she would not give it to the likes of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotioning with your wand, you said, \"Get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena eyed you coldly as she took a step towards the door, then suddenly threw an energy blast at you! Having faced such attacks from Chris, you saw it coming and dodged the attack. The blast kept going and reduced Chris' dresser to splinters, startling you. \"This woman ain't kidding!\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing you were in a serious duel, you caused your wand to vanish and fired a heavy energy blast of your own, which Helena dodged, and your attack set fire to your sister's new wardrobe instead. \"Your powers are surprisingly strong for someone your age!\" hissed Helena, circling you. \"You would make a fine witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm comfortable being a boy, thank you.\" you said, circling her. \"I repeat my demand, Get out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena sighed. \"I tried to give you a chance.\" she said. \"But now, I'm afraid that I will have to destroy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she fired a bolt of lighting in your direction. There was no time for you defect or dodge but, thanks to remote command to your lab, (the buttons you pushed on your wand) a shield was already in place to save you from harm but not from being thrown from Chris'  room. You hit the wall hard, in the all, and slid to the floor, stunned, just as Chris rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan!\" she gasped....</span></div></div>",

Helena was still there, tearing the bedroom apart, searching for the artifact she had mentioned. You could feel Chris' anger rising and you were happy it was not towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't 'care' who you are or 'what' you're looking for!\" raged Chris, startling Helena. \"Get out of our house!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena saw Chris, standing strongly near the door with her wand at the ready. She then saw you beside her with your tech wand in hand. Only you were approaching more cautiously, due to your first encounter with her. \"You must be Chris.\" said Helena, smiling. \"I'm looking for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!!\" shouted Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved her wand in a quick circle before pushing it forward, sending an energy blast the size of a basket ball flying at the intruder. Helena let out a low scream of surprise before raising her hand, the energy blast struck a shield, sending her back a step. Chris was not holding back, as you did, which surprised you. Then, you saw the hand Helena raised, it had a familiar ring on each finger. Seeing the rings, Chris let out a low gasp as she recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pharaoh's rings!\" she whispered, fearfully. \"You... You're a 'rogue' witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena giggled. \"Very clever, girl.\" she said. \"Now you have a better idea of what I want.\" she rose her hand. \"I know you have the last ring, GIVE IT TO ME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris took a single step back, gripping something under her blouse, whispering, \"Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered Chris was given a special gift on her thirteenth birthday from an old friend of the family. You and Chris only new her as Ms H. The present was a ring on a necklace, the very ring Helena was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena began to turn red with impatience. \"Give me the ring or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you had heard enough and caused your own wand to vanish again and hit Helena with an energy blast, throwing her off her feet. She was too preoccupied with your sister to sense it coming but she was up in the next breath, clearly angry with you and her both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way!\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired a second round of lighting at you only, this time, you were ready for it and defected the blast with a wave of your hand before firing in return. Chris joined in the fight immediately after, firing energy blasts and spells. You then threw  in a few 'events', or technological spells into the fight to force Helena to leave. Only she was determined and difficult to keep up with. Unknown to you, she was having a difficult time, fighting against you and your sister as well. Meanwhile, Chris' room was getting completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to get my robots to rebuild her room as soon as this is over.\" you thought. \"Mom and dad will freak if they see it like it is now and our secret will be exposed.\" you paused, then thought, \"Or are we just kidding ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Chris were quickly becoming exhausted, neither of you had fought so intensely for so long and you began to worry. Then, for some unknown reason, Helena broke off her attack and vanished from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is far from over, brats!\" her voice screamed. then, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily from the fight, you and Chris slumped against one wall and slid to the floor, happy that you had managed to fight her off, at least for now. \"She'll be back, Jan.\" said Chris, panting. \"There are ten of those rings in all, any woman who can assemble them all will be granted incredible magic power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work on guys?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will grant a man protection from magic but not the use of it.\" replied Chris. \"The point is, that Helena is a rogue or criminal witch. Rogues are stripped of all their power so not to cause evil again, the Pharaoh's rings will not increase a witch's power but they will restore power to a witch who had lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this Helena and her sister Eva are after to regain their full magical strength.\" you mused. \"Once they achieve that, they will have the power to seek revenge upon those who had incarcerated them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded. \"Ms H made me promise to always keep this necklace with me.\" she said. \"I have kept that promise.\" she then began to tear up. \"But if I keep it around my neck with that Helena after it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll become a target.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared, Jan.\" said Chris, honestly. \"Any suggestions?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sent your call through fifteen different satellites and four ground relay stations before allowing it to reach Ms H's home to make it near impossible to trace or listen in. Eight rings later, Ms H answered the telephone.

If I am going to protect my sister, I 'need' to know exactly who I am up against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not mean to press Ms H, who you guessed was a powerful witch, but you knew nothing of other witches and this Helena was serious business.

Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hit the television behind you with an 'event' and it immediately transformed into a robot. \"And now the news!\" it said in a robotic voice. \"Helena Young has attacked the home of Jan and Chris Smith, searching for the last piece of the powerful Pharaoh's rings! She was successfully fought off by the children's brave efforts but she had promised to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot then transformed back into a television set as mom and dad gaped at you in complete shock. Finally, mom rose to her feet and began to look you over carefully, as if she was looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, mom?\" you asked. \"This is not a joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom hushed you quiet and continued, checking every scratch and bruise you had, causing you to blush. Once she was done, she turned to dad and nodded. \"He's fine.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded back and slowly rose to his feet. \"Son, we knew of yours and Chris' powers from the day you were born.\" he told you. \"I am a mad scientist as well, your mother is a witch. We merely allowed you two to train each other as you are so competitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to say something but dad silenced you with a wave of his hand. \"We will explain everything to you and Chris as you need to know.\" he promised. \"Right now, we need you to place your games aside for the time being and focus on protecting each other. Helena Young is a stubborn woman, she will not give up easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect you and your sister to stay alert, young man.\" said mom. \"I have tangled with Helena before, she likes to use friends and loved ones to get what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped, thinking of your best friends, Hank and Sarah, and quickly ran from the room to warn them. Your friends knew about yours and Chris' powers and they were okay with them but neither of them had any power of their own. What was worse, was that Hank often spent much time at home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that Helena discovers that Hank and Sarah are close to us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dared not think of the consequences as you rushed into your laboratory and quickly set up your secure line. \"Who do I call first?\" you thought. \"Both will certainly freak but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you decide to call first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'd serve better to keep her away from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again eyed the statues, causing Lilly to sigh. \"Your concern for them is admirable.\" she told you. \"However, you know nothing of the circumstances that surround each person. I assure you I am carefully watched, I do not need nor want another pair of eyes on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are my chances if I take on Helena Young alone?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good, child.\" replied Lilly. \"She may be at a great disadvantage, having to rely on magical rings to regain her power, but she is a combat veteran from the dark war.\" she sighed. \"She and Eva never could let a grudge down and they have a depressingly long list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dark war?\" you asked, slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \"The name we gave the war between Mad Scientists and Witches.\" she said, patiently. \"Now then, I am giving you one and only one chance to leave here, still a boy. I suggest you take it and remove all thoughts of engaging Helena Young on your own!\" she turned, walking away as she added, \"There are worse things magic can do than 'turn you to stone'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting a second, you took up your communicator. \"Lab, emergency beam back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly turned back, just as you vanished, then picked up a telephone and dialed a number. \"Samantha, this is Lilly.\" she said into the phone. \"We have a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, you were back inside your laboratory, wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, you are called down to greet a visitor.

She had long black hair and deep, piercing green eyes that seemed to see into my very being. From the looks I was getting from mom and dad, this was a very powerful witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan, this is Elvira Strange, the head witch.\" said mom, introducing your visitor. \"What have you done to warrant her visit to our home, young man!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, El.\" said Elvira, calmly. \"I am here, not to serve a punishment, but to issue a friendly warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to me, annoyed. \"You went after her, didn't you?\" he asked. \"We <i>warned</i> you not to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Enough!\"</b> barked Elvira, sternly. \"The only crime young Juan is guilty of is untrained use of a magical artifact.\" she then turned her sharp eyes onto you. \"You were very fortunate that Lilly had placed a return spell on that travel wand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly has a number of transformed boys in her home.\" you fired back. \"They are being held in stone epoxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of Lilly Sweetie's actions, young man.\" replied Elvira. \"Please do not change the subject, you're very smart and destined to be a powerful scientist.\" she paused, sighing. \"However, you are not yet strong enough to combat Helena alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to try!\" you said, protesting. \"She is threating my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Elvira sent a energy blast in your direction. you were able to put up your shield but the blast threw you off your feet and into a chair several feet behind you. Elvira then waved a single finger, causing the arms of the chair to come to life and hold you in place. You struggled but in vain as Elvira then came up to you, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can not defend yourself from that simple attack and bondage spell before the next attack comes, you have no chance of winning.\" she said, gravely. \"Helena is as evil as they come, she will resort to any means to permanently seal your fate as a girl or worse if you go after her as weak as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat angered you and you began to furiously fight against the chair. When you found that was useless, you glared at Elvira, breathing heavily. \"What do you expect me to do, <i>witch!?</i>\" you asked, angrily. \"Roll over and let her take what she wants!?\" you shook your head. \"I think not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed, hiding her impatience as, behind her mom and dad both turned slightly pale. You turned slightly pale yourself, realizing your mistake of acting out of anger but it was too late to take your words back. Elvira shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man, I think you need to see first hand...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wince, as you begin to drop. \"Arrgh\" you moan, as you hit the floor, hard. Least now, you're free to move, but Elvira doesn't give you much time. You gasp, as sparks of electricity crackle from her hands. Your science have stopped the worst of your sudden electriculaion, but you're still hurting bad. You know now you can't face Elvira alone, so you decide to call Chris for help. Its a mental thing, thanks to being a twin of a witch, but it is risky thanks to the twin factor. Elvira smiles. \"Doing that old trick. Interesting move, but useless. your sister will not get here in time. Still it has given me an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she again lifts you into the air, and you look on helplessly, as Elvira pulls in a mirror. \"A mirror? What is she up to?\" you wonder, as she casually assembles it, so its facing you. You believe whatever this mirror does, its won't so you anything good. Although you try not to look, you see a young girl dressed like a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that what you're going to do to me?\" you demand. Chris has plenty of times threatened to do that to you, reduce you to a little girl then dress you up, but has never attempted to do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Elvira sneers. \"This is what you're going to do yourself\". In a voice more like her own, she adds, \"Helena likes using a victims on powers against them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" you say, seeing your hand move, towards the mirror. You try to regain control of your arm, but the force acting on it is too powerful.

You answer,\"Nice to meet you my name's Juan Smith but you can call me Jan.\". At this statement you shake hands.  During this you feel a shock to your hand and you jump away.  As you yank your hand away there is a mixing green and purple lightning bolt that is shooting towards your hand that John stops.  John says,\"Now to get down to business.  My mom has brought you to me so I can teach you something new and exciting.  But, the best part about this knowledge is that only a twin to a witch can use it.  What I am going to teach you is a power so advanced that it evolves past magic or mad science.  This power is called Puedomagic officially even though it is more than magic.  Basically Puedomagic magic is safely mixing both science and magic.  Now watch this demonstration.\"  John then raises one hand and the green mad science test flame appears.

Turning back to yourself, you saw your arms become slender as your shoulders fell slightly before your body shrank to match the height of the girl in the mirror. Looking at her, you saw her smile and open her mouth as if to giggle. this sent chills down your spine as you winced, feeling your manhood retracting into your body, reforming into girlhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is not happening!\"</i> you thought. <i>\"My science should be able to fight this magic, why can't I!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too frustrated and frightened to realize that your panic was only speeding up the transformation.

As you discretely looked around, you found that everything in the living room was not exactly where it was supposed to be, including the furniture. Then you realized,  <i>\"There was a struggle here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have a good reason for progressing your age, young lady.\" she said, sternly. \"It's never wise to do that unless you have good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded. \"Helena Young was at the mall, looking for us, mom.\" she said. \"I had to create a disguise quickly so she would not recognize us. Only, I could not change us back as the risk was too great that Helena might have still been in the area after leaving the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's face softened. \"I see.\" she said. \"I'll over look it this time, please return to your proper age before you get to like it too much. You can not take shortcuts with magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed, glad that she was not in trouble and regressed herself back to fourteen. Only, seeing the subtle signs that there was a struggle in the house, you wondered if that was a wise idea. Before you could say anything, however, Chris waved her hand, returning you to your original form, causing you to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you laughed at the irony of everyone's situation, including your own, it broke the curse.\" explained Chris. she then restored Sarah and Hank to their original forms as well. \"Now we can focus on what to do about Helena Young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about that, Christina.\" said mom. \"You had better give the ring to me so I can keep it safe. You never know what that rogue will do if she catches you with the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris winced as mom never used her full name unless she was angry with her. Only she could not determine what she was angry about. \"I can imagine what she would do if I didn't have it.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, forcing a smile. \"Chris, please give me the ring.\" she said, this time using her shortened name. \"It's not safe in the hands of a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Chris knew something was a miss as mom had not called her 'a little girl' since she was twelve. Mom then revealed her hand, causing Chris and you to gasp. She was wearing four rings on her left hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helena!\" screamed Chris, firing a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing the fact she could not hide the rings from sight, Helena blocked the spell and dropped the disguise. \"Little brat, give me that ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank, Sarah, RUN!\" you yelled, firing an event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank and Sarah did not have to be told twice as they ran out of the living room as you covered their escape. \"What did you do to mom, Helena!?!\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is right here!\" came an enraged voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Chis turned to see mom, cut and bruised, her favorite dress torn and dirty, as she stood in the door way with her arms crossed, tapping a single finger....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was not long after that the fighting started to quiet down.\" she allowed herself a low chuckle. \"Maybe, our leaving the war started it, one can never tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the war still on?\" asked Chris, fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently, there is an unsteady cease fire.\" said mom. \"However, its on a hair trigger.

It was one of the many reasons Zed was feared and hated on both sides of the ancient conflict, he knew how to strip a witch or a mad scientist of their power. Only the most skilled of witches or mad scientists could counter it. Helena had the same power but  that was lost when Elvira stripped her of her magic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will go then.\" he said. \"Do you with Witchbloom to stand or fall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena cackled, knowing full well that Witchbloom was a school for young witches and transformed witch boys to learn the art of witchcraft. Elena saw the boys, choosing to learn magic, to be noble as they would love magic and remain witches for life. However, those boys who had chosen mad science, she saw as traitors to their family, enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even you are <i>that</i> powerful.\" she said, finally. \"The head witch resides there most of the year and not even I could match her power in my youth.\" she shook her head. \"No, we'll use a 'back door' approach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed smiled, then vanished from the room before Helena sighed. \"How long must we continue to tolerate that lunatic with his borrowed laboratory, mother!?\" she asked, annoyed. \"He's already cost me a hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was silent for a moment, remembering that, when a mad scientist is marked a rogue, their laboratory, gadgets, and notes are all destroyed before they are stripped of all their magic resistance. All the scientist is left with is their vat knowledge of dark science and the potential to become a witch, a thought most scientists cringe at. The only way they could regain some of their power was to steal another mad scientist's lab. In Zed's case, he had killed his own brother so to have a back up laboratory when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother!\" said Helena. \"I asked you a question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, my daughter!\" snapped Elena, twisting Helena's cybernetic hand, still healing. \"I do not appreciate your tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena screamed in agony as the wrist began to bleed where the hand had been attached before Elena released her daughter, allowing her to 'lick' her wounds. \"Forgive me...\" she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena snorted. \"You are acting like a spoiled child!\" she scolded. \"We must endure Zed's madness as we need him to obtain our goals!\" she took a breath. \"You know the plan, carry out your mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena nodded, still nursing her wrist and vanished as well. Once she was gone Elena sighed. \"I only prey Zed and my daughter do not run into... him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, miles away at Witchbloom boarding school, Zed reappeared with a strange device that looked like a space age leaf blower with the power supply and super tech strapped to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we break shell.\" he muttered, activating the device. \"Then we break the little chicks inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he fired the weapon, sending a powerful green electrically charged beam. It soon made contact with a solid energy shield that was not visible before. Inside the school, alarms sounded as teachers urged their startled students to return to their classes. In one class, two girls, Jacinta and Paula, offered to stand and fight the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We studied and practiced mad science before our... change in life.\" said Paula, firmly. \"We can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help by protecting the rest of your class.\" replied their teacher, Lucy Connor. \"I'm certain they are frightened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula and Jacinta nodded then ran back into their room as Elvira and a tall brown haired boy came into view. \"I fear that the situation is dire, madam head witch.\" said Lucy, grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"It's been a long time since the school was last attacked by a mad scientist.\" she said, with a certain calm that surprised Lucy. \"Do not fear though, my grandson will deal with this intruder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy?\" asked Lucy, further surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"He's no mere boy.\" replied Elvira. \"I can not explain any further, we are under attack and time is crucial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Elvira lead the boy to a door and opened it for him. \"Good luck, John.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, John, nodded before suddenly becoming a teen girl and walked out to Elvira's sigh. \"He still likes to shock people, just like his father.  The girl walked out and stood before Zed just as the magical shielding failed under the power of Zed's device. \"Science prevails again.\" said Zed, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is as far as you go.\" said a girl, standing before him. \"Leave now while you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed laughed maniacally. \"You are a fool to challenge me alone, witch!\" he said, finally. \"I'm sure you see yourself as powerful with your magic but my science is superior to you in every way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl remained serious and  Zed, believing she was bravely or foolishly trying to buy time, fired his weapon at her only top be shocked as the girl skillfully blocked it with what he recognized as a telekinetic shield she had summoned, sending the discharge right back at him!  Zed was forced to release the trigger and jump aside to avoid being hit by his own device. Stunned by a girl using mad science, he turned to her. \"A girl can not be a mad scientist!\" he screamed. \"Show your true form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrugged then returned to his normal form as John. \"I am not a mad scientist, I have... evolved beyond that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolved?\" asked Zed, almost in a whisper. \"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, still serious, replied, \"I am the pseudo witch.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that the laugh drove your brother crazy, especially when he was losing. \"Icing on the cake!\" you said, beaming. \"Tell me... shorty!  Describe the changes to me and I MIGHT be nice to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan glared at you but then quickly shrugged and began to speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fabric of my briefs are becoming softer against me skin.\" he began. \"It's most likely turning into silk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo!\" you said, teasing. \"Silk, huh? Do continue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan sighed. \"I can feel it becoming smaller, the elastic band around the waist opening becoming more narrow. There is a thin elastic band forming at the legs openings as well.\" he paused. \"I can now feel me T- shirt changing. The sleeves are dwindling down into nothing more than a pair of straps. The rest of it is shrinking, changing into a softer fabric, probably silk, like my new...\" He choked down the word... \"panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is your T-shirt changing into, dear sister?\" You asked, smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bra.\" replied Jan, flatly. \"You would think it was obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Jane.\" you said, teasingly. \"Be nice and continue the description. The longer you talk, the less time you will have to endure PLAYING with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jan sighed in surrender. \"As you can see, my pants have ripped at the seams and are now merging with my over shirt. My belt is turning into a pink silk and is growing in width, becoming a sash. If you will note, my panties are now pink. I can only guess that my bra is as well. (sigh!) Back to my pants and over shirt, they are also turning a light shade of pink as they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jan continued to describe his clothing transformation, you discretely searched his bedroom with your eyes, looking for his magic wand. You knew that, once he had it, he could easily end your fun with a simple incantation.  This time, you wanted to make certain that he did not have a chance to seize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it!?!\" you thought, frustrated. \"He always hides it in a different place but how many places can you hide a seven inch by one inch piece of wood!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you spotted it. The seven inch long, one inch round wooden staff was resting on the lower frame of a picture, just in the reach of his small frame. Seeing this, you cursed under your breath as you then realized that he too was using his long description as a distraction.  He had been slowly inching his way to where his wand was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Finally, as you can clearly see.\" said Jan, reaching for his prized wand. \"I am now wearing a beautiful, pink silk dress with white pantyhose and shinny black girls' dress shoes.\" he smiled. \"I hope you liked this little bit of fun, big sister. It's been surreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then raised his hand to grab the wand as you charged forward to grab it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't!\" you yelled. \"I'm just starting to have some fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Jan managed to grab the wand, it was instead thrown across the room where it slid under Jan's bed.  With the clothing transformation complete, you had nothing more to distract him with so you decided to go straight into the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not nice of you, trying to spoil my fun.\" you told Jan. \"Now, I am going to have to punish you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick yank at the collar of his pink dress, you forced Jan to lie over your knee as you then lifted up his dress, pulled down his tights and panties, then began to repeatedly and mercilessly strike him on the bare behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! (slap!) Ow! (slap!) OW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan looked up at you, highly annoyed then mumbled a few words under his breath. You did not see any threat it it until you brought your hand down onto his bottom and felt the stinging pain in your own bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" you cried. then turned to him as he started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pain transfer spell!\" he said. \"From now, until this potion wears off, any pain you send my way, you will feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very clever.\" you said. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS! Wand! To may hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately jumps as the magic staff flew out from under Jan's bed on its own power, into his small girlish hand!  Before you could act, he vanished from your lap and reappeared, standing before you as you summoned your reality remote. Only he was still a ten year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not undo the potion without the counter potion.\" said Jan, seeing your surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it once again comes to this.\" you told him. \"Do we duel?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were energy blasts, filled with billions of nanites, mentally programed to do what ever you desired within your power. You smiled, remembering Hank and Sarah's reaction when you showed them your power. Of course, they did not believe that you were a mad scientist and Jan was a warlock. So, you had transformed Sarah's dresser into a 'living' monster of wood and clothing with an 'event' and had it do a little dance in her bedroom. Sarah and Hank both freaked at first but once you returned Sarah's dresser to normal, they quickly relaxed then smiled. They both told you they thought it was to know a mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan showed off his magical powers in his own twisted way, by transforming Hank into 'Hannah' for a few minutes with one of his spells that very same day, one week after yours and Jan's thirteenth birthday party. Hank hated the demonstration, even though he did later admit he made a sexy girl. Still, they both knew of yours and Jan's powers. they had both been keeping the secret for over a year now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present, you turned back to Jan, making a decision. Let's stick with teaching each other where we have proven to have strengths first.\" you suggested. \"That way, if there really is a secret war being waged out there, we'll both have an extra edge to protect ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan nodded in agreement. \"Since you will be teaching me first, I'll follow you.\" he said. \"But, in case a mad scientist you know asks, I asked you out of curiosity.\" he paused, thinking. \"I will do the same if a witch I know asks me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To prevent arguments.\" you said, catching on. \"Clever, let's go with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, from downstairs, mom called, \"Jan!, Chris! Hank and Sarah are here, they want to know if you want to go with them to the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How convenient.\" you said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan frowned, serious. \"Hank and Chris could use a little edge as well, since they are so close to us.\" he said. \"If there truly is a secret war going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" you said. \"We'll fill them in on the way to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down stairs, you smile at Hank, who you sensed had a crush on you for a while. He was incredibly well built, for his age, with short, jet black hair and piercing hazel, almost yellow eyes. Some people feared Hank, merely by his appearance, some avoided him due to unfair rumors about him. Those who took the time to know him, like you and Jan and a few others, knew him as the most gentle, loyal, and trust worthy friend anyone could dream for. He was a fine kick boxer and was an excellent outdoors man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hank.\" you said. \"Your timing is perfect, we were about to head out to the mall ourselves to show each other a little about our powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave you a knowing smile, seeing your mom and dad nearby. \"So, you finally told them, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, smiling. \"They knew all along.\" you replied. \"Mom is a witch, like Jan, and dad's a mad scientist, like me.\" you giggled at yourself. \"They've just been playing dumb, watching us 'train' each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed. \"I might have known.\" she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was very petite for the age of thirteen with long and flowing light brown hair and gentle green eyes. Many people looked out for her, due to her frail appearance. Only, she had three black belts in karate and uncanny acrobatic abilities, most of which was self taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you, Jan, hank, and Sarah were at the mall only, having learned of the secret war between witches and mad scientists, you were all a little more on guard than usual. Committing yourself to the original plan, you lead the group to your favorite electronics store. Only, upon reaching it...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just wanted to scare him into submission and have a little fun before getting him off the hook. The last detail to worry about it weather Jan will accept his fate for the week or resist, in which case, you would have to adapt your strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Jan respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were on the cheer leading squad as well and you wanted a few of them to meet your bother as they were young witches as well. You were not sure why they voted for this strategy to get him into the group for seven days but they promised no mischief . It was common knowledge to a witch never to anger a mad scientist unless you know the exact location of their laboratory as it was the source of their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I won't make you do anything dangerous.\" you said, rolling your eyes. \"I'm not evil.\" then you giggled. \"But, you 'will' be doing a number of cheers in that cute uniform with the boys drooling over your great body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan glared at you. \"If you keep me in that ridiculous outfit one second more than seven days...\" he threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy!\" you said, sternly. \"There's a little more to this than revenge, use your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan looked at you for a moment then nodded. \"There was other witches on the cheer leading squad.\" he said. \"I take it that they want to meet me and see how I react to group magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, the thought of 'group magic' had not dawned upon you until then. Group magic was the combined effort of several witches to test the magical resistance of a boy without him detecting it as they would all use low levels at the same time. It was a common practice, so she read, to test a witch boy who had a number of sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" you replied, honestly. \"They may also be trying to get you to open up about other young mad scientists at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a few.\" admitted Jan. he sighed. \"Alright, I'll go meet your friends as long as you create a believable cover story, like the one you 'should' have used when I took away your hair for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, not wanting to admit that you did not find Jan's note on your desk until after you returned to school and had already created a story of your own. \"Alright, you are down with a bad case of the flu for the week.\" you said. \"May I assume you still have the 'sick leave' android in working condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan nodded then grabbed the pink book bag you had materialized for him. \"Let's get this over with.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you and 'Janet' arrived at school where you meet up with the four of your witch friends, all in cheer leader uniforms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had never seen him before but you knew that he did not belong, especially not inside his laboratory. You had trespassed on numerous occasions but only to play pranks, you never fiddled around with  his equipment as he never played with your potions. It was an unspoken rule of respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get inside here!?!\" you thought, frightened and angry at the same time. \"How did he even know Jan's laboratory was here to begin with!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man spoke to himself and you paused to listen. \"This boy has powers that would make an adult scientist envious.\" he said, with an impressed look. \"He would make a fine soldier in the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War?\" you thought, shivering. \"What war!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man continued to talk and you were chilled to the bone by his words. \"Those witches will soon learn that we 'mad' scientists are the superior and we WILL rule over everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He 'is' a mad scientist.\" you thought. \"He's crazy if he thinks Jan will ever agree to joining up with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jan's voice rang out in the room. \"Identify yourself!\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man froze as a number of laser cannons emerged from the floor and ceiling, aiming themselves at him. \"I am Zed.\" replied the man, with a slight bow. \"Zed Brawl. I am a 'mad' scientist, much like yourself, it is a pleasure to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the pleasantries, Zed!\" said Jan, clearly annoyed. \"State your business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed smiled. \"I am here, looking for recruits to help us in a war.\" he replied. \"A war that is raging all around you, without your or anyone else's notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan lifted a single eyebrow. \"A secret war... in my backyard?\" he asked. he grew red with impatience. \"Just how naive do believe me to be!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This war is real, Juan.\" insisted Zed. \"It has been going on for centuries now. In the beginning, there were only witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan's eyes widened in surprise, which Zed noticed, but he continued. \"We were their sons, their brothers, and their male neighbors, all perfectly happy and feeling safe.\" he then frowned. \"That was until the witches decided we boys, who had no magical power, were best suited as toys for their private amusement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science has been around since the age of the Pharaohs.\" countered Jan, unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science, yes.\" replied Zed. \"But not 'mad' science.\" he then continued his story. \"For several years, we witch boys lived in fear of our witch relatives, doing their bidding. We did so in fear of becoming a doll for their youngest daughter, or a six year old girl with the mind of a teenage boy, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan took a step closer, keeping a mental hold on the lab's defensive cannons. \"How did this all explode into the war you speak of?\" he asked with you still listening, close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One brave boy decided that he had enough.\" said Zed. \"As a little girl, he stole a magic book and began to study it. Only, he was not studying the book to learn magic, he was searching for ways to make it work through science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan and you continued to listen to the man, Zed with a certain morbid curiosity. \"I take it that this one boy succeeded in his mission?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed nodded. \"Yes, but it was not for another twenty years of torment before he managed to create the first chaotic science laboratory.\" he said, with a hint of pride. \"From there, he sent countless of copies of his mad science book to every witch boy in the world, giving them not only the power to fight back but to take over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus the war between witches and mad scientists began.\" said Jan, following Zed's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" said Zed. \"As I had said, this war had raged on for centuries. However, I sense that you have a power that may tip the odds in our favor and end this war with us mad scientists reigning supreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Jan is silent and you were hoping that he was thinking of a way to get rid of the madman.

Returning the favor, you then sent an energy blast of your own, sending him back a few steps more. \"We are the best of two worlds, Zed!\" you screamed. \"Your war is not welcome here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan's laboratory defenses then turned upon Zed and began to fire, forcing him to put up an energy field to protect himself from serious injury. \"Leave now while you still can!\" you ordered. \"My brother's defenses are relentless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jan then began to work together, throwing energy blasts at Zed, both hoping that he would get the hint and teleport out, just as you guessed he had got in. Only, to your surprise, Zed suddenly let out a loud grunt, sending his force field outward at high speeds. You and Jan were thrown off your feet as the the energy field overloaded the laser cannons, completely destroying them. The laboratory, although filled with smoke from the cannons, again became silent as Zed then walked up to you and Jan, lying stunned on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My force field can be used as a weapon.\" he explained, smiling. \"It will destroy any nonliving object by sending a high voltage charge through it at the molecular level.\" he then raised his hand at the two of you. \"I gave you the chance to join me Jan but if you refuse to be a part of the solution, I have no choice but to treat you as part of the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill to stunned to do anything, you prayed the Jan could.

Then, you heard something like the rapid movement of machinery as rd a computerized voice cried out, \"PROTECT THE CHILDREN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes in time to see a massive robot, that was once one of the mad science stations, strike Zed with its metallic fist, throwing him across the room. The other stations around you transformed into robots as well, declaring the same statement, \"PROTECT THE CHILDREN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both impressed and terrified that Jan had such extreme defenses guarding his laboratory. Then, you saw a look of complete shock on Jan's face and realized that he too knew nothing of the robot defenders. \"This is insane!\" you thought. \"If Jan didn't build those robots, who did?\" then the answer came as you gasped, whispering, \"Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to Zed and watched as he desperately fired his energy field weapon at the robots, only to find that they had energy fields of their own, protecting their metal bodies. The robots continued their assault upon the intruder until he had no choice but to retreat or be destroyed. He glared at you and Jan, saying, \"This is not over!\" before teleporting out to an unknown location. After he was gone, the robots returned to their original positions and transformed back into the laboratory stations they once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be back, and soon.\" said Jan, breathing heavily. \"I have to get to work and set up a force field to keep him from teleporting in again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, Jan!\" you said. \"Aren't you curious who built those robots who just saved our lives!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was clearly one of our parents.\" replied Jan, flatly. \"However, time is against us, we can not allow that madman to get back into this house!\" he sighed. \"I'm just as curious as you are, sis, but we have to set priorities. First, we will strengthen our defenses, then we can talk to mom or dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, knowing that he was right, and helped him the best you could. Within an hour, a low level forcefield was placed around the house to prevent anyone from teleporting directly in. you and Jan then quickly cleaned yourselves off and moved to the kitchen to find your mom and dad. Only, they seemed very worried.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You started first with a gender spell, which Jan easily dodged by teleporting out of the line of fire. He reappeared behind you  and fired an 'event', as he called it, the technological version of a spell or curse. It was basically an energy blast containing millions of nanites, or single celled machines, mentally programed to do whatever he wished done. They all grew inside of him and your dad, the secret behind the power of true mad science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your spells as well as you can see my events, Chris.\" said Jan, firing his attack. \"We could be at this all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a simple matter of one out lasting the other.\" you replied, dodging the attack and sending another of your own. \"We both know that working magic and mad science is like heavy exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jan reached into a pocket and threw a handful of dust in your direction. You screamed, jumping out of the way, holding a hand over your mouth and nose. \"Event dust!\" you thought. \"If I breath in even a little, I'll lose!\" you sighed, mentally kicking yourself. \"I forgot to set any rules, which means anything goes and Jan knows it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to hold your breath, firing back an occasional spell, until the dust had fully settled before breathing again. Fortunately, event dust was fairly heavy and settled in a matter of seconds, becoming harmless upon hitting the floor to prevent accidents. You could have tossed a potion at Jan but he had serums, the technological equivalent, and you did not want to escalate the duel any further unless he did so first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten better at this, Jan.\" you said, smiling. \"You might actually be a challenge to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to throw Jan off guard, hoping he would give you an opening to strike and end the duel. Only, to your dismay, Jan was not fooled. \"Nice try, sis.\" he told you. \"I rarely fall for a trick twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan fired off another event, which you dodged but gasped, surprised,  as it suddenly turned, following you! Seeing your expression, Jan laughed. \"Like my new tactic?\" he asked as you dodged it a second time. \"I programed the nanites to 'pilot' the energy blast to its target, no matter where it goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever.\" you replied, annoyed. \"However, you forgot one thing, I can do that too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you threw a chasing spell of your own, causing Jan to run as well. Standing out of the firing line, mom and dad both laughed, seeing you and Jan dueling in your own unique way. \"Care to make a wager on the outcome, honey?\" asked mom, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grinned himself. \"If Jan loses, I'll do all of the house work, without mad science, for a week.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled, liking the idea of having a week off from house work. \"If Chris loses, I'll become the kids little sister for a week, leaving you in charge of me for that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grinned, liking the idea of making mom, a regular tomboy since birth, become a true girly girl for a week. It meant more work for him but he could have his robots do all of the house work. \"We have an agreement.\" he said. the two shook hands then watched the duel with increasing interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not appreciate mom and dad placing such pressure on you and Jan as you finally canceled Jan's attack and he canceled yours, they were actually betting on who won and lost. \"They're worse than kids!\" you thought, ignoring the fact that your were a kid yourself. \"I don't believe them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea came to you and you sent a magical mental message to Jan. \"Did you hear what mom and dad just did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're placing bets on the outcome.\" came Jan's mental reply. \"What's with that!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jan continued with the duel, firing and dodging spells and events as you and he privately talked. \"Let's make it a draw so we each decide for the other.\" suggested Jan. \"That way, we know the other will be fair in their decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" you thought back. \"Also, it will force mom and dad to both honor the bet. Dad will have to play Mr. mom, without mad science and we get a little sister to play with for a week... mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jan giggled aloud then each fired off a spell or event only you both get nervous at the last second and dodge the blasts. What was worse, you attack was a body switch spell and it flew towards the back door where...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a very petite young girl with waist length sun blond hair and bright hazel, almost yellow eyes. As you saw then enter, both wearing their school uniforms, your face turned pale, knowing that your body switch spell would hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys.\" said Hank, concerned. \"What's up, we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never finished his sentence as your spell it them both, throwing them to the floor, causing you to wince. \"Sorry, guys!\" you said, seeing then slowly get back up. \"You really should learn to knock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hit me?\" asked 'Sarah', moaning. \"I feel so weird.\" then she noticed her change in voice and screamed, discovering whose body 'she' was in. \"What happened!?! Why am I suddenly Sarah!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a manly scream echoed from 'Hank's' lips. \"Why am I Hank now!?!\" he asked, alarmed. \"I don't want to be a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I like being a girl!?\" asked 'Sarah'. then  she paused. \"Wait a minute, what's wrong with being a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with being a girl?\" countered 'Hank'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy!\" you called to them. \"We will explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hank' and 'Sarah' turned to you, their eyes demanding an explanation. \"I am a witch.\" you told them. \"So is my mom, she and I command the power of magic.\" you summoned a flame to your hand to prove your words true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am what you might call a mad scientist.\" added Jan. \"I have the same powers as my sister, only through science, my dad has the same powers.\" he them summoned a flame of his own, only it was yellow, compared to your green flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your two were hit with a body switch spell, intended for Jan.\" you explained. \"I had intended to have him switch bodies with me for a while to learn magic as only girls can work it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hank' and 'Sarah' looked at you and Jan, shocked, then slowly smiled. \"Who knew that our best friends were a witch and a mad scientist.\" said 'Hank', grinning. \"I take it you two play a lot of pranks on each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, as did Jan. \"We like to challenge each other every now and then.\" you replied. \"It keeps things interesting.\" then, you wondered if you should tell them about the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you two change us back?\" asked 'Sarah', begging. \"I'm feeling a draft in this skirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harry' suddenly laughed. \"You don't know half of what a girl goes through every day.\" 'he' said. \"I wouldn't want to torture you, though, you couldn't handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" protested 'Sarah' \"A boy's life is not all fun and games, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier than a girl's life.\" replied 'Hank', unphased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to make a wager on that?\" asked 'Sarah', smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"It looks like we have a challenge.\" he said. \"You two will remain as you are until the end of the weekend, just as Jan and Sarah will be for part of their training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hank' and 'Sarah' looked at dad, stunned. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"You two challenged each other to live the other's life for a while.\" she said. \"We are going to help you both see this challenge through but I must insist upon no wagers.\" she then grinned, waving her hand and you and Jan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you or he could react, you found that mom had switched your bodies and you both screamed. \"MOM!\" you yelled in protest. \"I asked you not to change us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were moving too slow, young lady.\" scolded mom. \"This is not a game but serious training and time is obviously against us, as you had witnessed for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"You're right, mom, sorry.\" you said, reluctantly, with Jan's voice. \"When will I be starting my crash course in mad science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing tomorrow morning.\" replied dad, seriously. \"I will give you the rest of the day to get acquainted with the smell and workings of the male body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same goes for you, young lady.\" said mom, eying Jan in your body. \"We will start your crash course in magic after your lavender bath in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah' laughed at that, to which mom grinned and added, \"You are next as you two will be living with us for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harry' giggled. \"It's all a part of being a girl... Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we have that all settled.\" said dad. \"How about I order out some pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone approved then idea and headed out, into the living room while dad pulled a cell phone from his chest pocket as he walked out himself. You were about to follow when 'Hank' quickly grabbed you arm. \"What do you say we play a litle prank on the 'girls' tonight?\" he asked, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" you asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hank' grinned back. \"Nothing big, just a makeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at the thought. \"Midnight sound good to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hank' giggled with you. \"Sounds great.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, on the step, was a young teenage girl with shoulder length blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a strange school uniform. She let out a low scream, seeing the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend!\" she screeched, raising her arms, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad lowered his weapon. \"Forgive me, this house was recently under attack.\" he said. \"Please, enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl walked in, who mom immediately recognized. \"What are you doing in town, Jakaia Zara?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakaia Zara was the daughter of Elvira's twin sister, Natasha Zara, they lived nearly a mile away. \"Our house was attacked as well, aunt Elvira.\" said Jakaia, sobbing. \"Mom sent me here with a teleport spell while she took my older brother, Caine to the witch hospital.\" she paused, crying. \"He's hurt bad, he... he may end up my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakaia then fell into tears as mom comforted her. You curled a fist, knowing that, sometimes, when the son to a witch is severely injured, mad scientist or not, the only way to save him is to make him a girl and allow her magic to repair the damage that was done. \"Fun time is over, mom.\" you said. \"We will all need to stick to our strengths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave Jakaia a wink, causing her to giggle slightly, despite her fear. \"I'm sorry... <i>Juan</i>.\" she said, giggling. \"You will need this experience, more now than ever.\" she sighed. \"If necessary, we will switch you four back but until then, you stay as you are for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been in male form for days at a time during your year, 'playing' with Chris but you had never dared to try using  his power of mad science. Of course, the same was for Jan, he never took the risk to try magic as a girl. \"This is bad.\" you whispered to Jan, in your body. \"We had better start teaching each other the basics, just in case that psychotic renegade, Zed decides to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" replied Jan. \"I'll teach you first, mad science does not come as naturally as magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we start?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start by trying to produce a pyrokinetic test flame.\" said Jan. \"The principals are the same for both powers. Find your center then focus your energy in your phantom uterus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phantom uterus?\" you asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, hearing your hushed conversation, chuckled. \"Its a large bundle of muscles, located where a uterus would be in the female body.\" he explained. \"This muscle group is only found in witch boys and it grows with their resistance to magic or power of mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in surprise. \"That explains a lot.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus your energy as you normally would.\" instructed dad. \"Only, unlike magic, the flame must be maintained with your mind, it will not continue to burn without focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and did as dad instructed. A few tense seconds later, a harmless flame appeared in your hand. \"I did it!\" you said before moaning as the flame went out. \"This is harder than it looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must keep the flame burning with your mind.\" said Jan. \"Once you get the hang of it, the flame will burn without any real conscious thought behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I master this, what comes next?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get to know the laboratory.\" replied dad. \"I have one prepared for you, in case of an unfortunate permanent change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I have a cauldron room ready for you, Jan for the same reason.\" added mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jan nodded, just as the doorbell rang. \"Pizza delivery!\" came a female voice outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the voice, Jakaia turned pale as dad cautiously answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You made them all pancakes and sausage, which they all ate quickly and ran off to do their own thing. Sighing, you made your breakfast and sat down at the dining room table alone to eat. You greatly enjoyed the few moments of peace, for as long as they lasted. You took your first sip of tea, enhanced with a magic potion to increase your alertness and endurance, when you felt the house shake slightly, followed by Jan's muffled scream, followed by him yelling, \"Chris! Get out of my laboratory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled to yourself. \"The twins are staring their games early today.\" you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan and Chris were both born with great power, you could sense it the day they were born. Jan became a powerful mad scientist while his sister, Chris became a powerful witch, like yourself. You and your husband fell in love with each other on the battle field between witches and mad scientists. The war had been going on since Vlad Tepees used science to try to gain the power of a witch in order to become invincible. Tens of witches were tortured and killed by him, sparking a war. Other mad scientists emerged as science progressed but it only expanded the war as rogue, or evil, witches attacked them in fear of being 'experimented' on or to reclaim their 'good' name. You met your husband, Simon, during one fight in the empty streets of a remote dessert town. You were a medical witch and he was a 'medicine man', as the mad scientists called their medical team. You were there with a team of witches to shut down a mad scientist base. Neither of you enjoyed the fighting and began to work together, at other battles, healing the wounded on both sides. Unfortunately, this made you and him targets of debate from both witches and mad scientists. Over time, you and he fell in love and ran away from the war, never to look back. It had been fifteen years since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you chewed your food, you heard Chris' muffled yell. \"Give me back my wand, Jan, it's not a toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another slight shaking of the house followed with Jan yelling, \"Ga!! This isn't funny, sis!  Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Jan has done to himself this time.\" you thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys will be boys.\" said Simon, rubbing your shoulders. \"It's a good thing we both have great hearing. Otherwise, we'd have to let them in on our secret, ruin their secret 'fun and games'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a low moan of pleasure as your shoulders did feel a little stiff. \"I know, honey.\" you said. \"On the bright side, they do really care for each other and they both work hard to keep the other's power a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled. \"Maybe, someday, the fighting will end and they will meet the rest of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teared up a little. \"That would be wonderful.\" you said. \"If only both sides could see what we see in each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world is not that simple, Elvira.\" said Simon, kissing your forehead. he chuckled. \"That reminds me, whose turn is it to check up on our two little angels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and replied....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You inwardly grinned as they fell silent, seeing you. \"Oh, hey, mom.\" said Chris in a happy tone. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad will be working in the garage for a while.\" you said, trying to sound serious. \"You know how he hates to be interrupted so please stay out of there until after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom.\" said Jan with a smile. \"I'll probably be in my hobby room in the basement all day anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where I'll be, mom.\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, smiling. \"Your private room in the attic, I know.\" you said. \"All of us need a place to call all our own, I have a place for myself as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Jan nodded. \"The sewing room.\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Only I weave more than just mittens in there.\"</i> \"Try to get along, okay?\" you said. \"It's not often I get a day to relax and unwind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Jan nodded and you walked back down the stairs. \"That should buy me at least ten minutes.\" you sighed, once out of earshot. \"Mom told me raising a witch and a mad scientist would not be easy.\" you giggled. \"It should be interesting to see what happens when she visits later today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a near image of yourself with a firm figure for her age and walked with the aid of a pink diamond cane. \"Hello, El.\" she said, smiling as she stepped inside. \"How are you and Chris doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a husband and a son, mother.\" you replied, patiently. \"They deserve your love as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know I love Juan with all my heart, dear.\" cooed mom. \"I merely think he would be much happier as a girl, learning magic with his sister.\" she winked. \"You know accidents happen around the home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it, mom.\" you warned. \"My husband will not stand for it and neither will I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shrugged. \"As you wish it, dear.\" she said with a sigh. \"I can not control your life. Fate will step in eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, knowing Simon will not stand for her mischief but you could not deny her entrance as she was your mother and the only reason fellow witches had not stormed your house. \"Please try not to fight with my husband.\" you begged her. \"Jan and Chris know nothing about the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't told them yet?\" asked mom, surprised. \"They'll be in for a shock if it find its way to your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll deal with that when the time comes, mom.\" you said, firmly. \"This is my family, I make the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom grinned. \"At least you play a dominate role in the family.\" she said, showing some pride. \"There's some hope for you yet, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jan came down the stairs with a worried look on his face. \"Mom, I don't feel so good.\" he said, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed a hand onto his head, looking into his eyes. It was an old and time tested way for a witch to use her magic to search for ailments or other problems in a person's mind.

You had never been a very powerful witch, this was the reason you had resorted to being a medic on the battlefield. Clanking up the street came Phobos. He looked truly terrifying. Twice as big as a man, he wore a helmet filled with colored gases which he could call on at will to fire at his opponents. You unstoppered one of the potions and downed it in one. You then threw one of your explosive potions. You were never too good with explosive potions, you always seemed to pack in far too much explosive powder. The potion went off with a large bang and an orange colored sphere of fire surrounded Phobos. As it cleared, you saw a green force field surrounding him. It faded, but you knew it was still there. You threw three more of your powerful explosive potions, while running towards him. Not one of them even touched him. You knew that if you could get him into close combat, he would have no choice but to lower his shield, which would give you the opening you needed to engage him in unarmed combat. </span></div></div>",

On one particular day, discovered that your family is made up of powerful witches and mad scientists. The females were all witches while the males were mad scientists. You father and mother, (Khan and Mulan) revealed the truth to you after a curious flame appeared in your hand.  At first, you panicked. Only, as you did not feel any pain from the flame dancing on your left hand, you became curious and questioned mom and dad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is called the test flame, son.\" dad explained. \"As it is blue in color, it means that your chaotic power has taken root... you are what the world would call a 'mad' scientist. Today you are ready to receive your laboratory and your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why my older sister, Gaia vanished last year?\" you asked, the flame vanishing. \"She's off for training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Kenty.\" said mom, gently. \"A green flame appeared in her hand, indicating that her magical power had taken root, she is a witch. Gaia was given the choice to either learn here at home or to go to a special witch school known as Witchbloom all girls boarding school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the same choice, Kenty.\" said dad. \"You may either learn here at home or go to a special school for mad scientists, known to the world as Eligere Sententia boys' boarding school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eligere Sententia... Latin for 'elite way of thinking'.\" you mussed. \"Clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you decide to train at home, I will become your teacher.\" said dad. \"If you decide to go to Eligere Sententia, I will help you start packing immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that I don't have much time to decide.\" you said, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll give you a day.\" said dad, serious. \"It will not take long for others to sense your powers have come to the surface and come to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to see me, why?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Only girls can be witches and only boys can be mad scientists.\" she replied. \"If I were to turn you into a girl, you would gain magical powers, making you a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were to have changed your sister, 'he' would have gained chaotic powers and become a mad scientist.\" countered dad, grinning. \"We both agreed not to get into <i>that</i> argument however, there are witches out there who would see you as a better witch and try to change you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottom line, you need to start training, here or at Eligere Sententia.\" said mom. \"The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a full day of thought, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

You reappeared in your sister's room and quickly searched her vanity and desk. Soon you found her acceptance letter and noted the address of the school before vanishing from sight again, reappearing at the rear wall of the school. \"This teleportation takes a lot out of one, I'm feeling tired.\" you whispered. \"I should have brought a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to keep moving, you imagined yourself walking up the wall and willed yourself to do it. Of course, it worked but you still kept your focus on performing the task so not to break your concentration. Once on the other side of the wall, you placed your plan into action and casually walked across the grounds, trying to sense your sister's presence. Having no training in mad science, you were merely working your powers as you had seen it done in the movies, praying there was at least some accuracy to them. \"This is harder than I had thought.\" you whispered. \"So many girls here, its hard to find one person's presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you caught Gaia's 'scent' as it were. It was an energy pattern that only belonged to her and you quickly followed it, hoping your incredible luck held out until you reached her.  You followed her 'sent' to an empty locker room where you found here, just finishing getting dressed. \"Kenty!\" she said, surprised. \"What are you doing here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing she was about to sound some sort of alarm, you used your game ploy. \"I- I just found out ab- about our family's pow-powers.\" you stammered. \"I-I'm not sur-sure who I-I want to-to become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia looked at you for a moment then giggled, summoning an extra uniform. \"I could help you see what magic is all about without being enrolled.\" she said, smiling. \"Of course, if you get caught, I know nothing about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kleedoll.deviantart.com/art/Commish-Kenty1234-178416059\" target=\"_blank\">http://kleedoll.deviantart.com/art/Commi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia giggled then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like something constricting you... around the chest. You realize what that meant.

Within a minute, you're in the same uniform as her, and on your very male body, you feel awkward.

When you discovered this at the age of 10 you were initially disappointed to learn that many of the myths and legends about Vampires were untrue. Some were true, you aged slowly and were a lot stronger and faster than normal humans. Despite looking 14 you were actually 280 (you aged 1 year for every 20 years). Unfortunately another true myth was the one about burning in the sun. While you would burn slowly and not die instantly you couldn't last more than 12 hours in the sun without dying.<br>\r\nSome myths were untrue though such as being able to turn into a bat. Your brother Nischal was slightly different than the rest of the Vampires. He had only one Vampire parent so was slightly weaker and slower than you. However he could also last a lot longer in the sun. He was closer to you than anyone else in your family and you agreed on nearly everything. However there was one major disagreement between the two of you.<br>\r\nThere was a war going on between the only other supernatural creature you knew existed, Witches, and Mad Sicentists. Nischal thought that Vampires should get involved with the war. He thought that both sides were competition for Vampire's places as the most powerful type of human in the world. He was convinced that whichever side won the war would come after Vampires next. He was always telling you how if you want to war with them now you could exterminate them while they were busy fighting each other.<br>\r\nYou on the other hand had nothing against either of them and thought you'd be better of out of the war. While Vampires would probably win your losses would be huge and not worth it. Nischal was continuously trying to change your mind on this.<br>\r\nBoth a Witch and a Mad Scientist went to your school, a brother and sister named Juan and Christine. They didn't even know about the war but that didn't stop Nischal from picking on them all the time. You tried to just ignore him when he was like that and just went to spend time with your girlfriend Isabelle Rayner.<br>\r\nOne night you were getting ready for bed when Nischal came into the room you shared. \"I've got something really important to ask you.\" he said.<br>\r\n\"It better not be about that war again.\" you replied tired of hearing about the war.<br>\r\n\"It is but please listen. As you know I meet weekly with a group who feel the same way as me about this. We believe we can convince all the Vampire's to go to war but we need a leader. You are well respected especially for your age and are a great speaker. I believe with your help we could convince our leaders to go to war with those awful Witches and Mad Scientists.

He has both of them held up against a wall and is searching them for anything of value. You groan when you see this, Nischal is normally a nice person and all this is giving him a bad reputation. \"Wait one sec.\" you say to Isabelle and approach Nischal.<br>\r\n\"Nischal stop there's no point in this. You'll just end up in trouble.\" you say and he listens to you and releases them.<br>\r\n\"Sorry but you know how I feel about them and can understand why I do this.\" he says as Chris and Jan run off. Isabelle is standing there looking confused as she has no idea what Nischal is talking about.<br>\r\n\"Just please, try to stop ok?\" you ask and he nods. The rest of the day goes normally and thankfully Nischal stays away from the twins. However that night when you are eating dinner Nischal stands up.<br>\r\n\"I feel weird what's happening?\" he exclaims. Then he falls to the floor in great pain and begins to shake. You gasp as you see him begin to shrink and his hair begin to grow. \"Mom! Dad! Come quickly!\" he shouts in a higher voice than normal. You watch with amazement as he continues his transformation. After about 30 seconds it is over and your dad and step mom rush in. Nischal has completely changed into a female version of himself and you are positive that either Jan or Chris did this. You just hope he/she doesn't realise as that would give him/her a great excuse to get a war started. You also feel sorry for him as it's likely a permanent change.

But he was able to reunite with the love of his life. He understood some of this magic council from the letters he had gotten from his friend John. How he was something called a pseudo witch and they had witch hunters called rough necks.

It was a common feeling to him, usually when he was doing a near all nighter hitting the books. Then he felt cold metal against his bare skin, Ryan's face contorted into a wince. Just as he tried to move however Ryan noted that he couldn't, his hands were bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that set alarm bells ringing in the mind of the young man, his eyes instantly opened fully. And he took in his surroundings, needless to say Ryan didn't like the place he was currently in. He was strapped to a metal table, wearing only his boxers. His arms and legs had been bound right to the table he was currently on, looking around Ryan could see his clothes neatly placed on a chair to his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his katana there! Ryan knew it contained the soul of an extremely powerful demon slayer, who gave his life to save Japan centuries ago. Ever since he obtained the blade the being inside of it referred to Ryan as his master and lord, perhaps if Ryan willed it the blade could move forth and free him from his binds. If he didn't then God knows what could happen to him, even more so as Ryan clocked the surgery tools close to his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan concentrated, trying to picture the blade in his hands. And sure enough he heard a faint whisper in his head, it spoke in Japanese. \"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asura, can you hear me?\" the young man mentally responded, saying it in his head as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord, you are in danger aren't you?

Ryan quickly rolled to the right to dodge the attack.<br>\r\n\"Are you the attack dog that mongrel boy John sent here?\" the woman said with barred teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smirked and said \"Maybe, but don't touch what you can't afford lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shot out a stream of lightning towards Ryan. He quickly combinded his katana with his scabard and spun it in a rapid motion, like that of a hurricane. The electricity was diverted and Ryan dived under a table to begin his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe contacted John's Mother and Sisters for advice. \"Ms. Harrison got anything on this broad that can help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes her name is Victoria Bane. She's a known rouge felon who hates boys in all shapes and forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guessed that. How should I go about this?\" Ryan asked as he kept rolling around the tables to avoid Victoria's blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she loves to turn guys into girls. Only those in the UK are immune to that sort of thing so....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could bait her into trying that and then attack with her guard down.\" Hayley finished her Mother's sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let her win Ryan!\" Hannah yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. I know what to do\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and yelled \"Go on then. I know who you are and what you like to do to boys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria stopped and smirked \"Accepting your defeat already? Typical of a boy I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan put his hands up as if to surrender. When Victoria fired a gender change spell aimed right at Ryan, it might as well have been a pillow hitting him. It had no effect on him what so ever. \"How is that possible?!\" Victoria cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 17 year old gave a small grin and opened his left hand. There was a stun grenade held thight in it.<br>\r\nRyan flung it at her and lept into the air. He made sure to close his eyes as he knew that weapon inside out. <br>\r\nWith a mighty battle cry he reached Victoria. He slashed his katana into her right shoulder. Near where the arm was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria gave a yelp of pain and fell to the ground, clutching her now useless arm as blood spurted out of it.<br>\r\nRyan wiped his katana and sheated it. \"Now I see....Not only have I lost to a boy but to a foreigner as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan kneeled down and decided to give her the fright of her life. He muttered in a dark tone \"What can you offer the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's eyes went wide, Ryan went on with \"All you do is commit crimes and hardships for innocent people. Perhaps I will do the world a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put one foot over her and drew his sword and aimed over her. \"Ryan don't do it!\" John yelled into his ear piece.<br>\r\nIt was too much for Victoria to take,  the evil witch blacked out from her pain and Ryan gave a smirk.<br>\r\nHe put his sword away and walked onwards. Making sure he trodded on Victoria's knocked out body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went into the next empty room Ms. Harrison said to him \"Ryan what were you doing?! Hannah is very upset by your actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan responded with \"Oh please I was not actually going to do the deed. Hannah if you can here me then I'm sorry for upsetting you, but if you don't behave then something bad could happen to you in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn cut in with \"Ryan.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's called karma pal.\" Ryan said as he neared the computer for that base.</span></div></div>",

It was about the 2 times the size of Ryan's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed smirked and changed his dagger to that of a claymore.<br>\r\n\"Now this is like old times.\" Zed said as if he were addressing a long time friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have survived our last encounter but not this time!\" Asura yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two clashed thier blades and moved from one place to another as the elevator kept rising.<br>\r\nJuan looked up, he could see the sky get nearer and nearer.<br>\r\n\"John we're getting close.\" Juan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay we're coming in to pick you up. Deal with Zed in anyway you can and get the two of you out of there!\" Juan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan felt his wound.

Both turned to see the 14 year old stand. Only Zed showed a hint of fear as they both noticed Juan was glowing with an eerie dark light. \"It's been too long since I was last released.\" in an echoing voice, he said. \"You must have really pissed him off this time, Zed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Juan.\" pushing Asura Ryan back, he said. \"The boy's true madness emerges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Juan laughed. \"I prefer to think of myself as misunderstood.\" smiling, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he fired a blast of dark energy at Zed. He quickly dodged it and the blast blew the elevator door off as they passed a level. Asura Ryan could hear startled screams as the people on that floor ran from the heavy flying doors as Zed charged the dark boy only to have him vanish an appear behind him, laughing. \"This guy is dangerous.\" Ryan whispered. \"Why did Juan release such a insane being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer came when Dark Juan caught Zed's sword with his bare hand without a single scratch and ripped it from his hand, still laughing insanely. He then delivered an incredibly rapid series of crushing blows and kicks to Zed's body, literally sending him into convulsions before pushing him towards Asura Ryan. \"I softened him up for you, old boy!\" laughing, he said. \"Finish him off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan looked down at the nearly defeated Zed then turned to Dark Juan. He knew, without a doubt, that this version of Juan was much like his own evil counterpart only he seemed more bent upon hellish 'fun'. He had to make a decision and fast. \"If Juan can't get this darker side of himself under control soon, we may have more trouble than Zed himself.\" he thought. \"I only have seconds before we reach the top.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rather the darkness that was housed by a child younger than his master.<br>\r\n\"But regardless of honor I must ensure my Master's wellbeing. If I satisfy the darkness of this child then my Master can be saved.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked forward to Zed and said to Dark Juan. \"I require his sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Juan gave a smirk and tossed the blade to Asura Ryan. <br>\r\nAsura Ryan then said to Zed \"You know what the warriors of my country do when they are faced with death right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed nodded and said \"....The art of hara kiri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsura nodded and handed the blade to Zed.<br>\r\n\"Redeem yourself in this way to ensure your well being in the nirvana.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed gave a smirk at this. \"Heh at least it would be better than facing that boy. But they remain unaware of my cloneing machine. My soul will not reach the land of Zen. Instead it will travel to a newly cloned body.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now I will play along with this act.

His Master nearly being killed was one thing, but mocking the culture of his land was another.<br>\r\n\"No I must ensure my Master's safety. That is the rule that a samurai must follow with regards to his damiyo.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed then aimed the sword over his stomach and said \"I regret nothing.\"<br>\r\nHe then plunged the blade into his belly. At the same time Asura Ryan slashed down on the head of Zed.<br>\r\nThe head that once belonged to the head of Zed was now rolling toward the edge of the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsura Ryan looked up and could see the plane that had John in.<br>\r\nHe then sheated his katana and muttered to Dark Juan.<br>\r\n\"Be sure that my Master's wellbeing is secured. Else I will unleash a path of destruction, starting with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the aura of Asura Ryan faded and the 17 year old was back to his normal self.<br>\r\nHe fell to the floor with a heavy thud, his energy totallly spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Juan smirked and said \"Well I guess I'm done here....For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Juan returned to his normal self.<br>\r\nJohn had opened the landing strip to the plane and was yelling<br>\r\n\"Come on!

The reminants of both forces fled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to head into a radioactive hellhole?\" Juan demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell's Gate Island is the resting place of the most powerful creation of both mad science and magic.\" in a dead tone, Devon said. \"The book of Merlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-The what!?\" stunned, Ryan asked. \"Do you realize the secrets held within that book!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"One who possesses the book of Merlin will be able to control magic and Mad science simultaneously.\" in a dead tone, she said. \"It was through Merlin that your sword was forged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, it has a brother.\" looking at Ryan, Devon added. \"It is called Excalibur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We leave immediately, madam head witch.\" bowing, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would go more smoothly if I take my team in alone.\" cutting in, Ryan said. he turned to Juan. \"No offense but I feel we are better suited for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were selected for this mission, end of story.\" firmly, Juan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still taking my team.\" equally as firm, Ryan said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However his real name was Light Killer. He was a top secret project in the witch council.<br>\r\nThe aim was to create a male who could use magic. It worked to a good extent, however Light grew mad from the testing and escaped.<br>\r\nHe was found and taken in by Ryan, in return he now acts as a sort of bodyguard to the 17 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Amy, one of Ryan's dormates. She grew up with a general distrust for the male gender.<br>\r\nThe reason for this was due to her Father and Brother being witch hunters and she left to be rasied alone with a nanny.<br>\r\nHowever after meeting Ryan she decided to open up to the other gender, to a point.<br>\r\nOften her role in the team was defense, she could conjure barriers that could damage the attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rear of the team was Charlie. He was a young boy that was tortured by his rouge witch family ever since birth.<br>\r\nHe was then saved by Ryan and Chon, as time went Charlie was able to tap into huge amounts of sheer power.<br>\r\nIt activates whenever his emotions get really high or if Ryan and his team are being attacked.<br>\r\nCharlie can then foucs his emotions into his fists to do powerful feats, such as crushing rocks and even bending metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside Ryan was his old friend Alexander, the two were friends at Ryan's old high school. After hearing Ryan needing his help he eagerly jumped into the action, using his enchanted rapier that had ice based powers he can strike right past any defense that his enemy has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was Jenny. At first Ryan tried to get her to not come, her safety was one of the most important things to him.<br>\r\nBut per Devon and Elvira's request Ryan had no choice but to bring her with him. Her magic was preformed rather differently than most witches. For she is of a dying race known as the Neko, witches who are part cat and part human. So in order to use her magic she reads pages from her Grandmother's old grimoire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People we are nearing the stronghold in five.\" the Captain of the ship said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan got out of his seat to give a talk to his team.<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, it's our job to finish what the old folks started. This fortress we're headed to is gonna be loaded with inhuman witches that'll rip your heads of in a second. It seems that they've found something that's so hot that they are running over each other to get thier dirty hands on it. Well I don't care if it's some old dusty tome or the lord's very own death star. We ain't gonna let em have it. What we will let em have is a pool of thier own blood to drown in. Am I right people?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir yes sir!\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah damm right I am.\" Ryan said in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan and Chris had to give a smirk at that speech that Ryan just made.<br>\r\n\"Heads up, we're landing now, the doors are opening!\" the Captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slid open and Ryan said to Juan, Chris and his team<br>\r\n\"Heads up, we're going into hell folks. It's time to dance! YEEHAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could use any kind of magic at will.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\nRyan always did his best to look after the kid. In fact there was a joke at his school that he was Charlie's dad and Jenny was the mom.<br>\r\nOf course that joke was always said when all three of them were out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving along.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChirs nodded and said \"It's odd, Elena loves to clone herself so her rivals have to fight more at once. But there ain't no one here apart from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight killer smelled the air. \"It's a trap if I've ever seen one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and said \"But still we should carry on with the mission. If they have set a trap then they will be forced to reveal themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group agreed and set on towards the castle. The door opened with a mighty creak. There was dust all around the room to show that it was not used in ages.<br>\r\n\"This place gives me the creeps.\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo annoy her, Ryan in response hummed the x files theme. Jenny gave a playful hit to her beloved.<br>\r\nJust then Light killer looked up to the lights. \"There's someone here! Show yourself!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the group could see a shadow moving past them. Suddenly a figure appeared before them with a hood over thier head.<br>\r\n\"To those who dare to disrupt the will of the rouges I bring you pain.\" a female voice muttered.<br>\r\nThe rouge then took the hood off to show....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a huge creak the door opened.<br>\r\nChon's senses told him that nothing was there.

But every footstep seemed to be like an echo. His actue senses told him about some latin chanting going on. His chi sight noticed several red chi witches gathered around a boy with blue chi.

He had lost the only member of his family<br>\r\nto evil witches and he made his life mission to fight rouges till they took him out.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe blind 18 year old dashed right towards the witches as Devon and Elvira watched the fight unfold.<br>\r\n\"So one of Ryan's team found the boy first. He does not seem to know who he has saved.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded and said \"I wonder how Chon will survive this. I have heard tales of his kenpo being legendary. His drive for revenge gives him extra power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chon dodged the blasts. he lept into the air. With a smirk he did something that could only be called horrific.<br>\r\nHe yanked his blindfold off to show what remained of his eyes. Everyone present, even Elvira and Devon who watching the fight all had a look of sheer horror. \"My god the blood's all crusted!\" one rouge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just like a pitch black hole. But there two small ones instead!\" another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord he's walking around with an injury like that?\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's to remind him of his revenge.\" Devon suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon was right as Chon lept down and karate chopped the nearest rouge's head clean in two. As the witch fell down Chon said<br>\r\n\"Look upon my former eyes for they're gonna be the last thing you see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Chon focused his chi energy and dashed to the nearest rouge. He uppercutted her so hard that her head stuck onto the top of the room. He then grabbed the nearest one and used her as a shield to stop many of the other rouges from attacking him. He then flung the now knocked out rouge at the group and lept into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon came right down to earth with a dive kick that landed right on the skull of a rouge. He then wrapped the back of his right leg around the neck of the nearest rouge and quickly snapped her neck.<br>\r\nThe blind man was then knocked back by the use of lightning. One of the rouges then fired a TG spell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the spell not only just brushed off Chon but a large red aura was around him.<br>\r\n\"I think you just made him mad.\" one of the rouges said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was correct, Chon moved at a god like speed towards the rouge who casted the TG spell.<br>\r\nDevon and Elvira looked on in shock as Chon ripped out the rouge's heart and flung it in her face.<br>\r\n\"Oh my that's very brutal.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nodded and said \"His revenge drives him to perform murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Chon used his chi dash to zip past the spells that were being casted at him until he was in the middle of them<br>\r\nChon then charged his right leg with his fighting energy and did a full 720 spin kick that took the form of blades that either decapitated or mortally wounded the rouges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only a few left after this and Chon began to pant, he had spent quite a lot of energy in doing those moves and he was feeling spent. But to his good luck the rouges that were left ran in terror for fear they would be next. Chon then walked over to where his blindfold was and wrapped it around his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sat down and sighed among his handiwork. \"No matter how many of them I kill I don't feel any different. It's only when it's ones who killed my Brother that I do.\" he muttered as he gazed at his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then noticed that the boy was waking up.

He kicked the door that led to the hovercraft. He then turned to Juan and said<br>\r\n\"These girls are the same age as I was when I lost my only family. 8 years later and look at me now, unable to see right and lusting for revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan decided he should say nothing to it and went after Alexander and Chirs.

I remember dueling him, he had courage and hope in his heart. He died a hero Chon.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.....But look what's happened to me.

I would look after them as my Brother did for me. In doing so I hope that magic may not destroy thier lives like it did for me.\" Chon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled and thought \"You have one heck of a younger Brother Chung. You would be proud.\"<br>\r\nShe then said \"Very well Chon you may take the V twins into your care. I'm sure Ryan won't mind. You shoud take those collars that they are wearing. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the screen vanished and Chon noticed the two girls were waking up. \"You're that blind man!\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we lose to that guy? He said his name was Juan.\" Vogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded and said \"Juan took advantage of your own habits. But listen I wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" the two of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon stood up and went near them. \"I've heard about your story. I came to offer you a new start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls said nothing and Chon went on with \"Come with me to the UK. I learn at a place where all are equal. You will live with my kind hearted fellows. What I'm asking is...Can I look after you both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Do you mean it?\" the two girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded and said \"I've never told a lie. Is there anyway I can prove it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva said \"Can you take our collars off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man smiled and said \"Hold on.\" he then used some of his chi to gently tug the collar off both Viva and Vogue.<br>\r\nThey rubbed thier necks and looked at Chon in shock. The two girls had tears rolling down thier faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thank you...\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this second chance!\" Vogue cried out as the pair wrapped thier arms around Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was a bit shocked, he could'nt remember the last time he'd ever been hugged. Sure he had touched people before.<br>\r\nShaking hands with Light killer, being carried by Ryan when Chon was ever wounded. Slapped by Amy during one of thier talks.<br>\r\nEven touching witches to inflict his killing kung fu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being hugged, that was a long time ago. He sighed and thought \"I could used to it.\" the blind man returned the hug and muttered <br>\r\n\"It's over now. Your new life will start soon.

A large barrier went around the girl.<br>\r\nThe Elena clones landed on it and were zapped to hell. As thier dust blew away Amy used her left hand to pull some hair strands back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Killer, known to many as John Doe charged towards several of them. He stopped as he neared them, he then sliced his left wrist with his right hand to place his blood on many of the clones. He then smirked as the blood he spilled onto them turned to acid that melted away thier bodies. Another tried to sneak up behind him, only to have her neck sliced by Light's claw like hands. The wound that Light made on himself quickly healed up thanks to his powers. All the while he grinned in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny held her Granny's diary tight. Flipping into the pages she said \"And as the danger loomed over me, I brought forth blades made from blue flames to hunt my foes.\" When she said that small blue colored swords were over Jenny's head. They then flung themselves into many directions and impaled several Elena clones to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was in the corner. Five clones were nearing him, intent on hurting him. The 10 year old dug his hands into the earth and lifted a large rock out of it. With a large battle cry he chucked it at the rouges. A few were hit and the rest went nearer. Charlie started to have flashbacks to when his Sisters would torture him with their powers, namely zapping him with electricity. He began to cry and rushed right up to the two rouges and nailed both of them in the gut. They went flying into a nearby wall and Charlie snapped out of his state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan and Arthur were in the middle of the room, back to back. The clones were attacking from all directions. <br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Arthur asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 17 year old grunted in the afirmative and the two began to rapidly slash through all. The spells the clones casted, the clones themselves.<br>\r\nThier blades tore both skin and bone as they slayed all that attacked them. Ryan wiped his blade clean from blood and sheated it. Ready to fight in the lai stance.<br>\r\n\"Not bad Mr.\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sure handle a blade kid.\" Ryan said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point there were only a handful left of Elena's clones. Alexander said \"I've eyeballed the real one.\" Alexander was born with perfect eyesight due to magic. He could study a person's fighting style and find holes in it to attack. That's why he was undefeated in fencing duels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" Juan said glad he could stick it to the evil Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one who's limping. She's used so many clones it's given her a small injury!\" Alexander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, Bro shall we?\" Chirs said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded and the two shot fire and ice at the real Elena.<br>\r\n\"I will not be beaten here!\" she said as she countered with her clones alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teams were in a stalemate. Just then Elena noticed that the boy known as Alexander was gone.<br>\r\n\"He was right behind them!\" Elena thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she felt a pain in her belly and looked down. Alexander's rapier had stabbed her in the back.<br>\r\nElena fell down and Alexander wiped his blade and said \"For an infamous witch, you went down rather easily\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chirs secretly winked at him and said \"Nice move Alexander. You know human anatomy or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander smiled and said \"A bit, to help in any situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira and Devon smiled as they watched over the whole thing.<br>\r\n\"It looks good so far. I wonder what Ryan will do next?\" Devon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they still need to find the book of Merlin.\" Elvira said.</span></div></div>",

The light coming from the roof opening gleamed from the blade into her eyes.<br>\r\nElena tried to move out the way however Ryan held her head with his left hand. \"Get you hand off me.\" Elena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smirked and said \"Okay.\" he then used that same hand to deliver a hard backhand to Elena's cheek. He then sat down on a rock next to her. \"Here's how it's going to work. I ask you a question and you give me a response. If it's not something I like then I'll hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove his point Ryan took his blade and placed it to just below Elena's kneecaps. \"I'll start from here and work my way up. And it'll just hurt more and more. If you want to do something about it then tell me the right things and we'll go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena said nothing to that and Ryan said \"Okay then here's the 50 million dollar question. Tell me where to find the book of Merlin.\"<br>\r\nAgain nothing. Ryan smiled and said \"We know you're here for it. Last chance before my attack.\"<br>\r\nNothing, \"Suit yourself, just remember this hurts you a lot more than it hurts me.\" Ryan said as he plunged his blade into Elena's right knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena screamed in agony. Asura's blade was enchanted to deal extra pain to those who were evil of heart. Even though there are no records of it, Asura would often use the same sort of method that Ryan is using now. Maybe that's why it's so effective.<br>\r\nRyan let the blade out and said \"Wanna talk now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah a child like you cannont hope to use it.\" Elena said with panting breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said \"Don't wanna use it. I'm sure you put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into trying to find it. Here let me add some more to that.\"<br>\r\nHe then jammed the blade into her other kneecap and then pushed the blade up and down. More blood poured out and the bone could be heard being torn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny watched in shock. She thought \"Jesus Chon must be rubbing off on him.\" Light killer was having an ear to ear grin. Amy was covering Charlie's ears and eyes from the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander muttered \"Don't look dear.\" to Chirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded and said \"For once I agree with you.\" Ryan actions reminded him of Dark Juan all too well. Juan and Alexander gently turned Chirs away from the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan yanked the blade out and aimed it to Elena's belly. \"Get this wrong and you're child bearing days are over. Tell me where the book is!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was in despair right now. No help was coming and this 17 year old may have just crippled her legs for good. <br>\r\n\"Tell me and I'll make sure you get a nice comfy hospital bed, followed by a prison room.\" Ryan offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine there's an elevator down the path from here. You can find the book there but you won't get it. It's in the center of the earth.\"<br>\r\nElena said as she tried and failed to get movement in her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan stood up with an uncertain look on his face. Elena was sweating bullets and said \"You got what you wanted! Take me and haul to the jail just don't hurt me anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira and Devon watched what Ryan would do, would he either pay evil onto evil and slay Elena? Or would he follow the path of good morals and arrest her. This would affect if he would pass his test or not. Ryan then.....</span></div></div>",

But there is a straight path right to the book. Won't be easy though.\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator then showed the center of the earth. It had large streams of lava flowing around below large rocks. At the far end of this from thier elevator they could see a book that was sure to be the book of Merlin. Ryan drew his katana and Arthur drew his blade. Both swords glowed. \"Our previous wielders knew each other it seems.\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt they must have dueled in the past.\" Ryan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reckon we could do that?\" Arthur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so kid. You ain't my foe so you ain't my problem.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur grinned, he had read the dossier of Ryan. He had to steal a copy of it as it was highly classified. Let's just say that the things that Ryan's done in such a short year, any normal starmage student would be tried in court and jailed. But Ryan gets results in the end, so no one could complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this is it.\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slid open to reveal an intense amount of heat. Ryan could feel sweat trailing down his brow. \"I thought we would be cooked chicken in an instant.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power of our wills and blades are what's keeping us safe Ryan. Don't let your blade go no matter what.\" Arthur explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, let's do this.\" Ryan said in a quiet tone, he would survive this he was certain. All the good things he'd done were not for justice.<br>\r\nIt was for Jenny and his own belief. His belief in what was right.</span></div></div>",

Why did you have to show up?\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a large rock not too far from them was Dark Ryan. The black suit he wore was unharmed by the heat, his red cat like eyes danced with madness. \"You know him?\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan drew his blade and said \"He is me. Don't hesitate kid, do so and it's all over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur nodded and the two drew thier blades. Dark Ryan grinned and stood up. He gathered a surge of dark energy in the palm of his right hand. He lept off the rock to join Ryan and Arthur in the air. The dark side of Ryan conjured a shield to block both heroes sword swings.<br>\r\nThe shield burst and sent the two of them back to the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some energy he's got. So that's you're real dark side? Must have been bad when you still had him in you.\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid you don't know the half of it.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Ryan had a grin plastered onto his face as he ran towards them. He snapped his fingers and a bolt of dark energy went between Ryan and Arthur. They dodged it and Arthur said \"Watch and learn Ryan.\" He then conjured some power into his blade and sent it towards Dark Ryan in the form of a blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark side took it and was nailed into the rock path. However he sat up and started laughing. \"What the? How can he be joking about this?\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy loves pain and suffering. But if he takes too much he'll bog off.\" Ryan responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Ryan sat up and dusted his suit. He smirked and conjured a blade made from dark energy into his right hand.<br>\r\nBoth Arthur and Ryan ran towards him. The duel was like that of two jedi vs a sith. Dark Ryan kept stepping back with each attack that Ryan and Arthur made, however he kept up a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was quickly nailed in the jaw with Dark Ryan's elbow and Ryan was slashed across the gut. As the 17 year old fell to one knee Dark Ryan prepared to attack the stunned Arthur. He clicked his fingers and summoned someone that Ryan knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not her!\" Ryan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person Dark Ryan summoned looked like Jenny. With dark hair and a pitch black dress. <br>\r\nThe two of them smiled and stood back to back, they then quickly took out pistols and were about to shoot Arthur.</span></div></div>",

The bullets were fired and Ryan was about to yell in horror.<br>\r\nHowever Arthur blocked all the bullets in quick and fluid motion. Ryan could just about make out the bullets falling harmlessly to the rocky path. Dark Ryan and Dark Jenny's guns were dropped and Jenny vanished, her purpose done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur laughed and said \"Really thought you could kill me with a gun huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Ryan smiled and dashed forward. Normal Ryan lept back up and entered his lai stance.<br>\r\nArthur and Ryan's swords clashed with the right arm of Dark Ryan. Who then grinned and formed a barrier of evil intent as a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heroes lept back, wondering thier next move. \"That's one bad dark side!\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. Maybe the two of us can send him packing?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear it kid.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a combinded slash attack? Like a perfect x or something like that?\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so classic kid. We might as well casue I don't see no other option.\" Ryan said in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heroes then did a quick fist bump and got ready. If anyone had told Ryan two years or so ago that this was where his life was going to head. That he was to travel to Asia to learn how to fight, to join a school for magic and those who hunted the evil casters. Not to mention fight alongside a kid to fight his Dark side in the center of the earth. Well he would think that person was a nut job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late to think about that now.\" Ryan thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So full power?\" Arthur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. How about just under that?\" Ryan found himself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough pal. So how are we going to open him up?\" Arthur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hit him. I've fought him enough times to know that he loves pain. Too much and he'll run.\" Ryan told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two charged thier blades up with a large amount of energy. Dark Ryan started laughing and just stood there, daring them.<br>\r\nRyan and Arthur then sped forward, Ryan was a red blur and Arthur was blue. They dashed right past Dark Ryan with perfect form.<br>\r\nThey both sheathed thier blades, a colored trail following them that went right past Dark Ryan. He moved in the air like he was being slashed by a powerful blade. He finally vanished in a cloud of dark smoke, a laugh was his last heard sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew again that's one bad dark side you got.\" Arthur said wiping his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan said nothing, he sheathed his blade and pointed off to the distance. \"That's the book!\" he yelled.<br>\r\nThere it was, covered by a sliver bubble was the book of Merlin.</span></div></div>",

She was 16, English and he knew who it was. \"JENNY!!!!\" Ryan yelled out as he flung the helicopter door open and lept out of it, stumbling a little as he did so. He rushed towards her and embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think I was going to let you have a nice holiday in the sun without me?\" his girlfriend asked him.<br>\r\nRyan said nothing, Jenny was his moral chain. His reason for fighting, it wasn't about truth and justice for Ryan. It was Jenny that he fought for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan then noticed other people coming out to the helipad \"Chon! Light! Amy! Charlie!\" he said as he made his way to them with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved the day?\" Chong asked with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needn't have done that Ryan, I would have gladly done it for you.\" Light Killer said with a nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know one day you're gonna fight something that's as stubborn as you are, but that'd be rare.\" Amy said with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are the bad guys gonna learn that they can't beat you?\" Charlie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan could only give a sigh, he had to admit. Sometimes it did feel good to be the man who saved the day, if only sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ryan, the witch council leaders and science council will want to talk with you. Same with me.\" Juan said as he motioned for Ryan to follow him.</span></div></div>",

So smile would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed and nodded, turning to the crowd. Smiling and waving as best he could in his semi-wrecked body limit.<br>\r\nChon could tell Ryan was hurt, the blind man often had several injuries himself alongside the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Carlson limbed a little as he approached Elvira, who was applauding him and Juan for their efforts in preventing the destruction that the space station could have inflicted upon the earth. \"Mr Carlson you achieve the impossible yet again, it seems like nothing can destroy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hard to get rid of.\" Ryan responded, motioning to the enchanted katana that was strapped to his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amen Brother, I had my doubts about you. But I think they are safely dashed, guess we picked right for this op.\" Juan said with a pat on Ryan's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt earned a wince from Ryan, he motioned to his lowed body and lo and behold. A rib was jutting out his body ever so slightly, earning an annoyed grunt from the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to get that looked at.\" Light muttered to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded and responded with \"I'm not bleeding out the mouth so I reckon I'm alright for now, Madam witch I'd like to hurry this ceremony up if that's okay.\" making a motion to his rib with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded and said \"Very well.\" She then turned to the crowd and said \"Ladies and gentleman, we have gathered here to celebrate the victory achieved for justice. Juan will you please step forward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan did so and Elvira pinned a medal to his chest \"For your heroic actions in the face of adversity we, the witch council and science council bestow the medal of light. The highest honour that can be awarded, congrats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan bowed and made his way to a seat in the crowd, Ryan moved forward an Elvira delivered the same speech with the same medal. She made sure to place it on the side of the chest that didn't have the rib jutting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira muttered to a medic witch with \"Please ensure Mr Carlson gets the finest medical treatment available, we may need him fighting fit in case of the fallout of this incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood madam witch, come with me Mister hero.\" the medic witch said, Jenny glowered a little in response to the words Mister hero. But Ryan motioned for his team to follow him, he was alone this one time. But he knew that each member of the team would take a bullet for each other.</span></div></div>",

Only he sighed seeing Elvira Strange waiting for him near a long black limousine. \"We need to talk, Mr. Carlson.\" Seriously, she said. \"I fear I have another mission for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Ryan stepped into the limo with Elvira following. \"What is this mission?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have reason to believe that Juan Smith is attempting to make his own version of your fantastic Katana sword.\" Handing Ryan a set of papers, Elvira said. \"Only he intends to trap his dark personality inside the sword, freeing himself from all evil thoughts and temptations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Startled, Ryan asked. \"Certainly Juan knows better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juan is only half the person he once was.\" With an air of sadness, Elvira said. \"Before he was forced to split himself to save his sister, his power would have surprised you.\" She sighed. \"If Juan succeeds, he will fall completely into madness much like the original Dr Jekyll when he created Mr. Hyde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he fails?\" Morbidly curious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira frowned. \"Then Christaun will born and it will be permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Christina know of this?\" Worried, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are keeping Christina in a safe house to further prevent this from happening.\" Serious, Elvira replied. \"However you know better than most that distance will not be much of a factor when powerful magic and mad science are involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What must I do?\" Serious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have three chances to stop this, Ryan.\" In a dark tone, Elvira said. \"Juan can be stopped by one of three methods. Prevent him from forging the sword which will require both magic and mad science; stop him from enchanting the sword with an infusion curse and event, again needed magic and mad science; or infuse Juan with his dark persona so he will be whole again and not need the sword at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither one will be easy.\" Sighing, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use whoever or whatever you must to stop Juan from destroying himself.\" Opening the limousine door, Elvira said. \"We all need the lighter and darker halves of ourselves to make us whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and left the limo. After it drove off, he turned to Jenny who ran up to him with a concerned look on her face. \"Ryan, are you okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Managing a smile, Ryan replied. \"I just got another mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed. \"So soon?\" Wincing, she asked. \"You just got out of the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about.\" shaking his head, Ryan said. \"It seems as if Juan is tired of his darker self and wants to seal it away.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He kept his senses sharp, not wanting to take the chance that Ryan was nothing more than a strict amateur. <i>\"That Harrison guy has too gentle of a heart.\"</i> with a frown he thought. <i>\"He most likely gave that Ryan character the job to allow him a chance to prove himself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving swiftly in the form of the dark shadows, Jan ran along the ceiling, avoiding the cameras that all pointed towards the floor below, showing up as nothing but a 'glitch' in the security system. After all, the space station was over fifty years old and abandoned for nearly ten, such things were bound to wear down. <i>\"The fist computer station is just ahead.\"</i> maintaining his focus, Jan thought. <i>\"Time to make some noise so that Ryan can do his job.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Jan saw his twin sister being dragged out of the first computer station room. She was hurt, not seriously but enough to make her unable to give much resistance. \"Take her to interrogation!\" barked a familiar voice. \"I will get all the answers we need out of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That voice...\"</i> his eyes widening, Jan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a large robotic humanoid entered the hall, causing Jan's blood to boil.

Only it warped his mind, turning him psychotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Phobos!\"</b> screaming, Jan roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mechanical man turned in time to see a powerful blast hit him.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You may play one of the following characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan (Jan, for short.) A fourteen year old boy with dust blond hair and hazel eyes. He is very talented in either Mad Science or Sorcery. (You decide which.) He loves to play tricks on his twin sister, just to drive her crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina (Chris, for short.) A fourteen year old girl with shoulder length dust blond hair and ocean blue eyes. She is very talented in either Mad Science or Sorcery. (You decide which.) She loves to play tricks on her brother, just to annoy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon Smith (Father) 35 years old. A tall, muscular man with hazel eyes and crew cut blond hair. He seemingly has no knowledge of the twin's talents, even though he keeps a 'sharp' eye on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira Smith (Mother) 34 years old. She is an older version of Chris. She also seemingly has no knowledge of the twin's talents, she also keeps close watch on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are options to play other characters (to make things interesting) just remember the theme of the story, a talented brother and sister discover a war between witches and mad scientists. The character you choose or create must have a sibling. Back to the main option...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan and Chris have two best friends, Hank Patton and Sarah Reed. (both are 13 and live next door.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Dr. Lucy Reed (Sarah's mother) is the Smith family's doctor and childhood friend of both Simon and Elvira, her husband died of mysterious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Emily Patton are both explorers and adventurers and leave for weeks, if not months at a time, leaving Hank in Lucy's care. He and Sarah see each other as brother and sister. There had been many talks of adopting him due to his parents' apparent lack of responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may add new characters as long as they work with the plot of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan and Chris are constantly trying to out wit the other with their magical or technological high jinks, while keeping their parents from finding out. Occasionally, they playfully challenge each other to a 'friendly' duel,  Most end in a stalemate, which keeps them after each other, sibling rivalry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two work very hard to help protect the other's secret from both their parents and the outside world. That is until, one day, the brother or sister, (or both), discovers that someone is trying to draw his(or her) sibling into an ancient war between witches and mad scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre the two siblings destined to fight each other in combat? Will one try to save the other? Will the two join forces and try to escape the war? Or will something completely unexpected happen?  Your choices will decide their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No sudden killing of the two main characters or their parents, I ask that if you do kill off one or both siblings that you work up to it first. Other characters, OK, this is a war, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Transformations of any kind are welcome, in fact, I encourage them!  Gender change, shrinking, age regression, whatever, GO FOR IT! Just bear in mind the talents of the two children, they MUST be able to change themselves back... eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. NO sibling on sibling or underage sex of any kind!! It will be deleted immediately!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. PLEASE be a little descriptive in any battle scenes that might occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. New Characters are welcome. Create friends, neighbors, teachers. They can be witches, mad scientists, normal people, etc. Just please, NO characters from Anime... Keep this original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Try to write chapters that are at least four lines long or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. HAVE FUN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Credit to Runner, the creator of 'The Witch' for allowing the use of his story as a crossover.
