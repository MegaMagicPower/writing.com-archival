It was his turn to get lunch for their meal break back at the scrapyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking to his truck, he decided to stop by Pop\u2019s Stand that was just in the middle of the street for a quick read of comics. He approached the stand to see an old gray tom manning it while reading the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pops!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya, Chance! Lunch duty today, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, just checking on any new issues of Catillac and Tail Tussle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t gotten those yet, but I do have gotten something new that might interest you.\u201d he said as he went under the counter and brought out a box labeled Purlin\u2019s Magic Panels with a wizard\u2019s hat and wand with sparkles decorating the company\u2019s name.<br>\r\n\u201cThese just came in earlier this week, just didn\u2019t have room to display them until recent. They recently popped up in the market too.\u201d<br>\r\nHe used a box cutter to open the top and revealed the contents, then spreading them on the counter. Comics galore from superheroes to fantasy to sci-fi to more genres were laid out in plastic sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith them in plastic sleeves, you can\u2019t take them and read them for free you know.\u201d Pops said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d Chance grumbled. Though there were many interesting options to choose from and he can afford at least one for just $3.99.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind/genre of comic book did he get?</span></div></div>",

The cover showed an extravagant white stone castle with banners and flags with guardsmen on the walls and towers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChance opted for that one and paid Pops the money. After crossing the street, he hopped into his white pick up, setting the lunch on the floor of the passenger side. He then plopped the comic book down on the seat next to him. But then again thought that taking a peek into it for a few minutes wouldn't hurt. He took the comic out of the package but as he began to open it, something strange happened. After opening the cover page, automatically the pages began to flip wildly and a bright light began to emit from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled and shock, Chance tried to escape but it was too late as he felt himself getting sucked in and fully engulfed by the light. And then he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he comes to, where is he?</span></div></div>",

Two larger chairs were located at both ends of the table. He looked down to see a wide spread of food from end to end on gold and silver platters and bowls of fruit containing apples, grapes, cherries etc. There were plenty of cooked meat from ham, roast turkey, chicken, fish, and then some. Some deserts such as pies and tarts with fruit fillings, apples, peaches, blueberries, etc. Baskets of rolls and breads with bowls lied next to cooked casseroles and stews with mixed veggies of carrots, peas, and potatoes. Silver goblets held drinks from milk to wine as well. It was a feast fit for a king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to get up and leave to see anyway he can get back, but a grumbling stomach disagreed with him since he haven't eaten lunch yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a bite won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he eat?</span></div></div>",

After crossing the street, he hopped into his white pick up, setting the lunch on the floor of the passenger side. He then plopped the comic book down on the seat next to him.

After opening the cover page, automatically the pages began to flip wildly and a bright light began to emit from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled and shock, Chance tried to escape but it was too late as he felt himself getting sucked in and fully engulfed by the light.
