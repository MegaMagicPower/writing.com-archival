Their ability to produce and manipulate chakra allows them to be devastating on the battle field. However, as kunoichi strive for as large chakra reserves as possible, their added weight and girth makes them just as large targets, less agile and unfit for stealth operations. So, while a properly train kunoichi could say wipe out half a block with the right jutsu, she would lack a subtle edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinobi are need for scouting, information gathering, tracking and most importantly, defending a kunoichi. Kunoichi are powerful but could be overwhelmed through sheer numbers or attacks from multiple angles. The shinobi's duty is to 'stem the tide' and keep the situations under control, allowing the kunoichi the leverage to  use their chakra. However, as the shinobi lack chakra, they do not have the level of destructive capacity that kunoichi can boast. To make up for this, shinobi are trained for stamina. weapons usage, speed, hand-to-hand and inflitration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, shinobi and kunoichi work together to cover one another's weaknesses. Truly skilled kunoichi or shinobi can handle enemies without the need of their opposite such as Kage of hidden villages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the most common arrangement is for a shinobi and a kunoichi to be paired together and taught by an older, more experienced pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Today was suppose to be a day used to review what they had learned so they would be prepared for the Graduation Exam in a few days time. But, it wasn't. Or at least it hadn't been for him. He had been rather tired today due to him staying up so late practicing his clone justu. Because of that he had made the biggest mistake of his life... He had fallen asleep in class. Normally that wasn't such a bad thing as all he had to worry about was Iruka-sensei yelling at him or tossing a chalkboard eraser at him. Today however was the start of when Kunoichi-to-be were allowed to start laying claim to any <i>'one'</i> male student in their graduating class. So when he had awoken he found a sealing collar around his neck, this showed that one of the girls in class had claimed him as their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth Naruto had nothing to worry about... if said Kunoichi failed her exam that is. If he failed and it was made known to said Kunoichi then he would basically be labeled as nothing more than a piece of property. That was something Naruto was greatly frightened about. At least as a claimed Shinobi he could go out on missions and act as battlefield support, as a failed Shinobi the best thing in life that he could look forward to was to be used and treated as nothing but a sperm donor to get his new Kunoichi mistress pregnant and helping bring about the next generation of possible ninja. In the end though, he would have little to no rights and would only have enough protection by law to be kept safe from severe abuse, neglect or death by his Kunoichi\u2019s hand. Other than that, just about anything was considered fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had hoped to be a <i>\u2018free\u2019</i> Shinobi or an un-claimed Shinobi fighting to protect his home and trying to gain the respect of the village Kunoichi but, with his new collar on that route was no longer possible. Sighing he idly scratched at his collar wondering whose name was engraved in to it. When he had awoken from his unintentional nap he had simply found the collar around his neck and a note telling him to wait for her on top of the Hokage monument. Thinking on it he couldn't help but wish he had been born a girl. True he didn't want all the massive amounts of fat Kunoichi had and it was also true that being a boy would let him blend in a crowd of civilians better but, still... He hung his head and sighed again feeling sorry for himself. A tap to his shoulder startled him, making him jump slightly before turning towards the source. It was undoubtedly his Kunoichi and turning around confirmed it as he saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Earlier today she had collared her secret crush, thus insuring they would be together. She was currently celebrating her success with a few cinnamon rolls. She felt slightly bad about having stolen his dream from him but, it was his own fault for falling asleep in class, that\u2019s not even mentioning how cute and defenseless he had looked at the time. In truth she hadn't noticed what she was doing till after the sealing collar had locked firmly around his neck. She hoped she could make it up to him later but first she had to finish her little celebratory snack. Taking a small bite the chunky girl <i>\u2018mmm\u2019</i>ed in pleasure at the taste of her cinnamon sugared treat. Her mind conjured up the image of her beloved Naruto covered from head to toe in cinnamon sugar and she couldn\u2019t help but blush at the implications of such a thought. Shaking her head she tried to remove the naughty thoughts from her head for a time before continuing to eat her snack, a small part of her hoping that such a scene would come to fruition. She idly smiled at the thought just as her taste buds were assaulted by the wonderful taste of her treat once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*Present time*</b></i><br>\r\nThis was the defining moment of their future. Naruto had just turned around and spotted her. How he reacted to seeing her as his Kunoichi would set the tone for their relationship. Whether they could be happy together and make their new lives work or if she would be forced to exert her authority over him and possible lock him up in a small room and being used as a simple stress relief would all come down to his reaction to seeing her as his Kunoichi/owner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It surely showed in her figure... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was one of the largest girls in the class. This was mainly due with her trying to outdo Sakura. As such, her bloated, pale flesh tested the confines of her clothing. Ino possessed a very apple like figure with her belly being the most prominent feature on her. The orb of flesh was slightly bigger than a basketball, stretching the bandages that tried to cover it and causing parts of it bulge through them. Her chest was also notable; two round doughy orbs that rest on Ino's large gut. Her thighs jutted out from her body in an attempt to support the large bubble butt that stuck out from behind her. Her arms looked as though they were large, flexible marshmallows and had stretched her elbow warmers to the limit. Lastly was Ino's face. She had two large and puffy cheeks with a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped as he started at the person who was going to practically decide his fate.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shinobi can use just a small amount of Chakra. While the Kunoichi have some of the most powerful techniques in the entire world, the Shinobi have a little bit of backbone in society as they are the ideal defense for some of the more immobile of Kunoichi.<br>\r\nShinobi can do several of the things that a Kunoichi cannot do, such as stealth and defense, while Kunoichi are the exact opposite. Although the Shinobi chakra reserve is barely above average, the Kunoichi can use chakra transfer techniques to aid them in a dire situation. However, there are some techniques the Shinobi don\u2019t need the Kunoichi for.<br>\r\nIf someone has a naturally high chakra reserve, like the Senju\u2019s and the Uzumaki\u2019s, then they can be on par with a rookie Kunoichi. But a jinchuuriki, that is a whole different scale, what with the power of a tailed beast, a being of pure chakra, linked to the Shinobi. Some of the techniques a shinobi can use is the shadow clone jutsu, summoning jutsu, rasengan, senjutsu, weak nature transformations, Puppet usage, Eight Gates release, Super Beast drawings, and more.<br>\r\nThere are forbidden ways to improve chakra reserves, like the curse marks. Another way that is somewhat not illegal, but considered amoral sometimes is body augmentations, such examples include the White Zetsu and even the first hokage, who was considered a god after his death. Another example of improved chakra reserves is the kekkei genkai, especially a dojutsu, allowing shinobi to be equal to a rookie Kunoichi.<br>\r\nThere are some examples who don\u2019t even need Kunoichi for battle. This includes the Inuzuka clan and their dogs, the Aburame clan and their insects, the Nara clan and their shadows, the Akimichi clan with naturally portly builds, and possibly others.<br>\r\nBut there are those that can fight well without their opposites, and these are the Kage. But during the academy days, teams of two are made for the up and coming ninja of the world. Teams can have as many as a single member to 4 members. But, the teams aren\u2019t usually made of just genin of a single village. Such examples in the past are young ANBU prodigies with random genin, genin from Sunagakure and Konohagakure. But a somewhat common tradition done is the merging of teams, mostly for missions only, due to the fact that the ninja teams are to be together...Forever.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was nervous, because despite being the largest girl in her class, she was the worst when it came to anything not having anything to do with direct combat, like tracking or laying down traps. This was due to the teachers negligence, because she was hated by a big majority of the village, reason being the Kyuubi being sealed into her stomach on the day she was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason she was any good at combat compared to her peers was because of her higher weight and her naturally great stamina. Finally it was her turn as she was called into another room for testing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room there was a scale, a mirror, a few training dummies and a measuring tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allright Naruko, first let's get your measurements and after that we get to the practical part of the exams. Don't worry, I know you can do it. \" Iruki reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko stripped down to her underwear, the only thing covering her bountiful body being a orange bra and orange panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Naruko stepped onto the scale, watching herself in the mirror. First her pudgy feet, then her chubby calves, her knees, which were nearly hidden from sight by her thunder tighs, her wide hips, her big, basketball sized ass cheeks, her belly which hung a few inches below her crotch, split into two rolls, her love handles which formed a big muffin top, concealing her panties, her big, bouncy, F, borderline G-cup breasts, her soft arms which were as thick as a thin persons thighs and lastly her pudgy face with a double chin concealing part of her amply padded neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down again and read the numbers the scale was showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree, four, two. 342 pounds. She weighed in at three hundred and forty pounds. The minimum required weight for a Kunoichi was 200 pounds, so she easily passed that part of the test. In fact, if it was only the weight that was required to be promoted, she would already be a Chunin, the minimum weight for being one being 300 pounds. But sadly for Naruko she would have to get every single mark to pass and become genin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stepping of the scale, she waddled over to the training dummies. She at first didn't know what to do, but after a few moments Iruki instructed her to push one as hard as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko did so without question and used pressed with all her might. She wasn't surprised when the dummy broke, as she knew that her strength was directly proportional to her weight. The bigger she was, the stronger she would be. <br>\r\nStrangely, only she had this ability, almost like it was some kind of bloodline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed this part of the test also, getting perfect grades for her exam, but because of her low marks in the rest of the year she was still placed dead last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruki congratulated her and wished her good luck when she handed Naruko her new headband, which signified that she was a Kunoichi of the leaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly heavy footsteps could be heard coming closer, causing Naruko to stop eating and look at the door with the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened, all they saw was a big, round stomach, wide enough to nearly get its owner stuck in the doorframe. When the owner of this enormous stomach walked in, the rest of her body was revealed. Perky DD-cup breasts were resting on a belly bigger than Sayuri's, tree trunk legs supporting the enormous bulk of the woman's upper body, chubby hands caressing her belly. Her face was adorned by a pair of chubby cheeks and a double chin, a third one already being on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kasumi Hatake, meet me on the roof in 15 minutes.\" the now revealed Kasumi told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left the room again, the three teenage girls following her, their eyes set on the juicy butt of the older woman. When they arrived on the roof Kasumi sat down on a bench which creaked under her weight and motioned for the girls to sit down on one opposite of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoujo went to sit down in the middle, Naruko and Sayuri taking their seats on either side of her, causing the thin girl to be squished between them. Naruko liked the feeling of having her teammate so close, deciding that Choujo would sit between her and Sayuri from now on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi began to speak: \"Allright, let's introduce ourself. My name is Kasumi Hatake, Jounin, 506 pounds. I like stuff and I dislike some other things. My dreams, well I had one last night. Your turn, skinny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoujo went red at being called skinny, but remembered her mother telling her to not be angry about it. \"I'm Choujo Akimichi, Genin, 130 pounds. I like my family and friends and I hate being called skinny. My dream for the future is proving that even a skinny Kunoichi can become powerful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext went Sayuri:\"My name is Sayuri Uchiha, Genin, 271 pounds. I like tomatoes and I dislike, no I hate one woman. I don't have a dream for the future, no, I have an ambition. I will kill that woman, even if it is the last thing I do. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last it was Naruko's turn to introduce herself:\" I'm Naruko Uzumaki, Genin, 347 pounds. I like any kind of food, especially Ramen. I dislike the time it takes to cook food, I only like to eat it. My dream for the future is to be Hokage and be the strongest Kunoichi who ever lived. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are an interesting bunch. We will meet at training ground 7 at 8 o'clock tomorrow to see if you are ready to become Genin. We will have a test to see if you are cut out to be the village's Kunoichi.\" Without bothering to answer any questions Kasumi left the roof top and the three girls were left standing there. </span></div></div>",

You will have to get these bells from me before lunch. If you are not able to get a bell, you will be sent back to the Academy. \" Kasumi told them while holding up two bells.\" As you can see, there are only 2 bells for three of you. This means that one of you will have to go back to the Academy regardless what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was becoming nervous and thought about possible ways to get a bell, but then something Iruki told her a few years ago came to mind. There are always three members in a genin cell, never two, so this must be a test about how willing everyone was to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Naruko, Sayuri and Choujo vanished into the trees, where Naruko immediately began to search for her teammates. She found Choujo easily enough and was also able to persuade her to help her, and after a few minutes of looking she found Sayuri too, who was stuck in the ground up to her neck. Naruko and Choujo worked to get her out of the ground and when Sayuri was finally freed Naruko told her about her assumptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn, I don't need the likes of you, I'm an Uchiha el-\"SLAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko had just bitch slapped Sayuri, looking absolutely furious:\" Now listen to me and listen good, you are nothing but a selfish bitch who got everything she has handed to her on a silver platter! You claim to be alone, despite always having someone to talk to. The first few years of my live no one even noticed that I existed. You want to avenge your family, but you don't want help doing it. No one can do everything alone, no one can live without friends! We are a team now, so get out of that phase, because if you aren't able to become a socially acceptable person, then I will make sure you become one and belive me, you don't want that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri was clearly shocked, no one had ever talked to her like that. She was looking back at her life and realized what a spoiled brat she had become, never having to work for anything in her life. She vowed to become a better teammate, and maybe even a friend to Naruko and Choujo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they made a plan. Naruko and Sayuri would distract Kasumi while Choujo would sneak in and steal the bells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko and Sayuri went into position, the two plump beauties watching their target intensely. When it was time to attack they stormed out of the treeline, engaging Kasumi in close quarters. While the obese Jonin was distracted by the two fat genin, Choujo managed to steal the bells without Kasumi noticing. When she called out that she had the bells, the older woman made the two girls stop fighting and then told them that only 2 may pass, as there are only two bells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruko simply went to Sayuri with one bell and said :\" We will share this one, there are no rules against that, are there? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Kasumi asked. All three nodded. \"Then I must sadly inform you that you all... Pass. Missions start tomorrow.\" </span></div></div>",

In this time Sayuri had been warming up to her teammates, even going so far as to invite Naruko and Choujo to live with them at the empty Uchiha compound. Naruko accepted immediately, but Choujo had to convince her mother to let her go. Now the team sat in the living room, Naruko and Sayuri eating and Choujo making sure that their plates were never empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Akimichi had revealed herself to be a FA, when one night she sneaked into Naruko's room, wanting to fondle the blonde beauties body. When Naruko woke up, she was shocked, but moving quicker than someone would expect from someone of her stature she grabbed Choujo and pinned her down beneath her, slowly closing the gap between their lips. It had been an amazing feeling for the both of them, feeling their soft lips connected like this, Naruko taking control of the kiss after a few moments, exploring the mouth of the far thinner girl with her tongue. Both of them moaned, causing Sayuri to wake up and catch them in the act of undressing each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of stopping them, she simply decided to join them. The next morning Choujo woke up surrounded by a quarter ton of women. After that night their relationship had flourished, surprising Kasumi, as she had expected the team to barely hold together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir relationship also brought another change, but this one was in the waistline of Sayuri and Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko had gained nearly 50 pounds, bringing her close to 400 pounds. Her breasts were now a solid GG-Cup, her belly hang a few inches more over her crotch and her ass expanded until it looked like she had two beach balls stuck in the back of her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri, having received more attention from Choujo had gained 70 pounds, essentially ballooning her up to 350 pounds. She was happy to note that her breasts had finally grown, bringing her to a C-bordering D-cup. But most of the new weight went to her previously small in comparison bottom. Her ass ballooned from volleyball size to basketball size, causing her to sit an inch or two higher than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoujo hadn't changed much, only having gained a moderate layer of pudge to her belly, not really noticeable if you didn't see a photo for comparison of before and after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished eating they</span></div></div>",

Choujo wanted to join them, but they would no doubt be hungry again after showering, so she began preparing more food. Naruko and Sayuri  made their way to the bathroom, where they stripped themselves of their clothes and went into the shower together. They were lucky that they were in the house of a ninja clan, because the cubicle that was the shower was bigger than a normal one. Still, it was a tight fit, there being almost no room for movement. Just the way they liked it. Naruko's belly and breasts were mashed against Sayuri's, their libs touching as soon as the water started running. For the first few minutes of the shower they just made out, until finally they started *cleaning* each others bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stepped out of the shower you could still see an afterglow on their faces. They used towels to dry their bodies of and when Naruko went to leave the bathroom she felt something smacking her ass. She turned around to Sayuri, already knowing the devilish grin the other obese girl had on her face. She grinned and then left through the door, going to her room to get some new clothes. She picked out a black tank top that showed nearly all of her cleavage, her boobs threatening to spill out at the front and didn't cover her entire belly, the lower roll hanging free and blue jeans which she had bought a few pounds ago and fit quite snuggly across her big butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went downstairs into the kitchen, Sayuri already getting stuffed by Choujo. Choujo wore nothing but her panties and a bra, leaving nothing of her F-cup breasts and her bubble butt to the imagination. Sayuri meanwhile wore a white blouse which strained to contain her belly and red leggings, stretching tight over her tighs and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko sat down at the table, the civilian style chair threatening to break underneath her great weight. She began shoveling food into her mouth again, this time more carefully as she didn't want to ruin her new clothes. She had eaten more than ever, nearly three times more than Sayuri, which was already more than thrice the amount of a genin. A whole civilian family could have been sated with that amount for two weeks, and Naruko devoured it in one meal.. The beautiful blonde let out a series of belches and farts, causing her entire body to jiggle. After her stomach had calmed down, she went to stand up, but before she could do that she saw one last muffin on the table. She grabbed it, and the second she had it in her mouth the chair broke underneath her. After getting of the floor, she was stared at in amazement by Choujo and Sayuri, both  stopping what they were doing to come over and play with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three stopped fondling each other, they went out to</span></div></div>",

Naruto was especially happy on this sunny day because he had finally saved enough for a trip to his favorite food stand Ichiraku Ramen. It had been a long time since he had visited the ramen bar, and the thought of the tasty meal made his mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Whoa!\" he said as he stood in front of a bar much larger then he remembered. Naruto realized that the one modest bar must have been rebuilt as a full blown restaurant after Pain attacked the city. He excitedly hurried into the restaurant and chose his usual spot upfront on the counter, rather than one of the many populated tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto!\u201d said the restaurants head chef Teuchi, waving to Naruto . \u201cI\u2019m a little busy right now but I can definitely make time for my number one customer.\u201d  He said ladling some broth and noodles into a bowl and handing it to one of his waiters. \u201cIt just seems like we\u2019re swamped theses day\u2019s you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a lot of business is better than no business right?

Watching the chef return to the kitchen Naruto sat back down on the stool and looked around the new restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was unusual about the restaurant, but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it.  Teuchi wasn\u2019t lying the place was packed, but it seemed to be predominately women! And not just that but they were eating quite large size meals too, some bigger than what he himself usually got! Unusual enough but at least more people were supporting Ichiraku Ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then noticed that another customer had walked in it was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Keeping his voice to a whisper he said \" I meant chunkier\u2026 fatter. I don't think a single female diner here weighs less than 81kg (180 lbs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had to admit that a lot of the patrons of the restaurant did look a little on the thicker side, but didn\u2019t see what the big deal was, in fact he had to admit he thought the girls of the restaurant looked pretty sexy with the extra weight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat!\u201d Naruto said loudly cracking up into a laugh, \u201cThat's what you were so worked up about? You really had me going there Shikamaru! Listen when things are peaceful between the nations like this, of course the people of the land are going to prosper you know?\u201d Naruto said patting his friend on the back roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if that wasn't just half the problem Naruto,\u201d Shikamaru continued unfazed.  \u201cListen growth like this is unnatural just alone, but with the fact that it seems to be just the women, and the fact that all the men and women of Konoha act like they haven\u2019t noticed, means something is up.  It's like they\u2019re under a city wide genjutsu and don\u2019t realize it! It could be bad news if someone were affecting the people of Konoha unconsciously, who knows what someone could be doing. Are you listening? He asked to Naruto who was showing that he was losing interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan!  You can be real paranoid sometimes Shikamaru. I think you should relax and stop over thinking this. I happen to think it's great!\" he said with a big smile. Shikamaru realized he wasn't going to get a different reaction from Naruto then what he got from everyone else he had talked to in the village and decided to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me if you find out anything, o.k. Naruto?\" Shikamaru said, and with that left the restaurant but not before lighting a cigarette on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders up Naruto!\" said the chef and placed a large bowl of ramen before Naruto before rushing back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" said the ninja and dug into the large bowl if ramen with his usual fervor. So concentrated on his meal was he, that he failed to notice the next customer enter the restaurant. The female's form shadowed over Naruto and his dinner and took a long inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat smells great!\u201d said the voice emphatically. \u201cI'd like two off what he's having!\" she told the chef, who gave a slight look of shock but then a nod as a sign of acknowledgment. Sitting down where Shikamaru had been moments ago, Naruto was surprised to see it was.</span></div></div>",

Sakura's chubby fingers fumbled with the buttons on her top, acting as a last resort to hold back a huge belly which gurgled with fervor as the delectable aroma that filled the noodlehouse also filled her nostrils. Her pink hair framed chubby cheeks, smiling as she noticed whose order she was parroting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" she said happilly, \"I almost didn't see you there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe addressed ninja could see why, Naruto could barely see Sakura's head past the most swollen part of his teammate's anatomy. \"H-Hiya Sakura!\" he stuttered, seemingly unable to pry his sight from Sakura's huge knockers; luckilly enough for him, Sakura couldn't quite see where his gaze was directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired kunoichi lowered her bulk onto a seat next to her blonde companion and continued to smile at him. \"It's like I haven't seen you much at all since the village was rebuilt!\" she subconciously pulled down on her top slightly, \"How's your training going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, turning from the bloated ninja to giggle to himself over just how awesome he was becoming. \"Hehe, amazing of course~!!\" his grin so wide that he was forced to squinch his eyes, \"How's yours been?\" Sakura giggled herself, \"Fine, Tsunade-sama's been pretty easy on me lately.\" brushed a pink strand of hair from her face, \"Even so, I still don't have that much time to myself as I'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched his teammate lug her flabby leg over the other one to form a delicately placed folded position, it seemed to be quite a struggle for her to work those thunderthighs of hers comfortabley. \"To do what?\" Naruto asked, leaning back into the conversation, \"I mean, all I ever hear you talk about it how much you train!\" Sakura grimmaced as she locked Naruto in a quick noogie, inadvertantly giving Naruto a faceful of her boob \"<b>I do more than that!</b>\" she rasped as she released her spikey haired punchingbag, \"I mean like, hang out with our friends, go to the bookstore, go out to eat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyebrow twitched slightly at that comment, taking in the sight that was his newly obese peermember. She didn't look too terrible, all the charm that was Sakura was still definately there. Big green doe eyes, cute face, same attitiude... meaning that if he <i>was</i> stupid enough to say anything it was likely that his skull could get crushed. For his own health, Naruto held his uncharacteristically decided to hold his tounge....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh'yeah, eating out a lot...\" he slipped, \"...oops.\"</span></div></div>",

When Naruto opened his eyes the chubby pink haired kunoichi was just being served her hefty order and had picked up her chopsticks. \u201cShe must not have heard that last bit, thank goodness\u201d Naruto thought to himself and heaved a sigh of relief. He readjusted himself on the stool, and sitting up he gained a better view of the appetite his former squad mate possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura licked her pink lips; she was just about drooling before digging into her first bowl of ramen. Sakura bent her heft over the counter, just keeping from sticking her head entirely in the bowl. Naruto\u2019s eye twitched, he was taken aback by the quite out of character way the usually polite Sakura was feverously tearing into this meal like she hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time. No one else in the restaurant seemed to have a problem with her eating.  \u201cI guess Sakura\u2019s picked up some eating habits from Tsunade baa-chan.\u201d He really didn\u2019t want to point it out to her but with the quite noticeable way she was eating he had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Sakura\u2026\u201d he began, but Sakura was unresponsive.  Naruto watched as Sakura\u2019s slightly jiggly arms, quickly brought the next mouthful of beef and noodles to her ready mouth. Naruto continued anyways watching as she swallowed another large mouthful. \u201cI know the ramen here\u2019s delicious and all but if you eat that fast, you don\u2019t even taste it. You\u2019re gonna get sick you know?\u201d Sakura remained ambivalent to Naruto\u2019s suggestions, and continued feasting.  Naruto shrugged and decided to enjoy his own meal. <br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\nNearly halfway through his own bowl, Naruto saw Sakura raised her head up from her bowl and gave a large sigh of contentment.  Naruto stared bug eyed as he saw she\u2019d completely finished her first bowl.  <br>\r\n\u201cHey, Naruto\u2026\u201d she said bring her arms to a stretch above her head, giving her protruding pot belly a push.  A sight Naruto didn\u2019t completely fail to notice, as her slightly larger belly thrust outward from under Sakura\u2019s top and her breasts wiggle under her to tight top. \u201cThat was really good!\u201d I\u2019m glad I ordered two! Sakura said grinning, she gave an Inner Sakura esq. \u201cHell yeah!\u201d before digging into her second bowl. <br>\r\n --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything else you two?\u201d asked the chef from behind the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your largest glass of milk please!\u201d Sakura ordered towards the cook pushing her now empty seconded bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Naruto asked to Sakura unbelievingly. Milk after ramen, just the thought made his stomach turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hardly been able to keep this stuff in stock!\u201d  The restaurant hand explained to Naruto. \u201cThe weird part is that it\u2019s the same milk the town\u2019s brought in for years, but lately it seems that\u2019s all anyone in town here is drinking.\u201d He said as he poured Sakura a near overflowing large cup of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have some too then!\u201d Naruto said wanting to see what the big deal is about holding his own cup out. Naruto took a sip of the odorless beverage.  It tasted just like the plain milk he had at home. \u201cThanks, but I really can\u2019t taste what\u2019s so great about it\u2026\u201d Naruto said placing the drink down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone has different tastes I suppose. You would be the oddball out of the whole town who didn\u2019t like this stuff.\u201d Sakura said as she shrugged and sipped her own drink. The meager sip turned into an easygoing gulp, and then a grand guzzle. As Sakura slurped faster, the milk began spilling out of the sides of her filled mouth, and trickled against her stout red cheeks and emerging double chin. As the creamy liquid rolled down her throat and began pooling in her tummy Sakura\u2019s body began responding to the addictive milk.  Naruto could only stare and gawking as Sakura\u2019s sizeable stomach continued gave a lurch outward. Sakura without thinking one handedly lifted up her top (which was now even tighter then when she entered), and undid the bottom button letting loose her soft looking belly. Her belly gushed out and heftily pushed down the waistband of her shorts as it ballooned rounder. Sakura set down her cup and pointed to Naruto\u2019s wordlessly, with a hungry look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026sure\u2026Sakura you can have it\u2026\u201d Naruto managed to squeak out, before the oversized babe took it from his hands, and began to slurp it down. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhoa she\u2019s gonna blow!\u201d Naruto thought as her already bloated belly pressed outwards. Now with every fattening swallow Sakura\u2019s body bulged and swelled. He watched her huge hips grow, the luscious cushions pooling with fat bringing her shorts to the near tearing point. Her belly packed it grew tighter as it lengthened outward. If Sakura was bigger than him before, Naruto was now completely outclassed by at least one hundred pounds. Sakura wiped her mouth and gave a tremendous Aaaaaaah as her remarkable belly popped off the top button of her shorts with a ping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat really hit the spot\u201d Sakura said as she leaned back and patted the swollen belly, echoing a hollow smack as she did so. And still no one in the restaurant seemed to be aware of the fact that she had bulked up so big.  Naruto unbelievably watched this, and remembered what Shikamaru had told him earlier. Naruto realized it was something in the milk supply making all these girls growing! And wait hadn\u2019t he drank it too! Had he been affected by it? He still looked the same, and Shikamaru had said it was only the girls growing, but didn\u2019t he something else about people acting under genjustu? He couldn\u2019t consider now, as he was busy gazing at Sakura\u2019s warm inviting belly. He really liked the way the now larger Sakura had filled out, in fact sitting so close to her, Sakura was looking quite sexy to Naruto. His head began swimming with conflicting feelings of deep affection and urgency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 Sakura\u2026\u201d he said light headedly.  \u201cI think there\u2019s something in the milk. I...got...to tell...Shikamaru\u2026\u201d He said getting up from the countertop, and heading to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto are you really going right now?\u201d Sakura asked. \u201cI thought we were catching up. There\u2019s still a lot more we could do tonight you know\u2026\u201d She said seductively and patted the stool next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was wrapped in emotions as his brain told him to tell someone about the milk as soon as possible, but his other \u201cbrain\u201d was telling him that things would be O.K. nobody was getting hurt, besides how many other chances like this would he get anyways\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally decided to himself\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides she seems really cute now doesn't she?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood there quietly listening to both sides of his internal arugment and looking at Sakura, with the jiggly breasts, her full rather plush looking stomach, her thick yet smooth legs, her cute pudgy toes and her round cherubic face, and as he kept looking at Sakura the voice that told him to stop worrying started getting louder and louder, until finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, she's not worried so why should I be. If she's happy I should be happy for her, and she is alot cuter now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh, sorry Sakura-chan, just thinking a little, and I'd really like to spend some more time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yatta!\" Cheers Sakura with a little skip, causing all of her to jiggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then Naruto we've got a lot of ground to cover and little time to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then grabbs Naruto by the arm and starts to pull him along, and despite looking fairly out of shape Sakura was as strong if not stronger than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after leaving Ichiraku, and walking down the street Naruto can't help but notice Shikamaru was right.

I'll buy!\" Naruto grinned. Sakura just couldn't say no to an offer like that. As she bounded out the door, her massive breasts and belly flopped up and down, nearly threatening to slap her in the face. She was quick to get out of breath, but Naruto made sure to slow down when necessary. He wanted to make sure they had a great evening together. Although his feelings kind of waned along with Sakura's physical fitness, he still saw Sakura as his friend, so she deserved some good treatment regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura spent the entire evening out, going from restaurant to restaurant. While Naruto tried to keep his food intake at a minimum, Sakura was stuffing her face without an ounce of concern for modesty. Meat, fruits, vegetables, pastas, she gobbled it all down. Her big, heavy belly started to turn a shade of bright pink as it became more and more taut. She took a deep swig of milk from her glass; as several droplets trickled down her double-chin, her breasts started to expand further. With each pop her zipper went down another notch. Naruto nearly choked on his noodles as Sakura's tit-flesh filled her top. Her breasts were already larger than her own head, and it seemed they were intending to also outgrow her stomach. Sakura placed her free hand onto her belly and fondled the fatty blubber. A shredding rip from down below signified the end of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow...Sakura is getting huge...' Naruto thought with a faint blush, not realizing he had just taken a sip of the milk himself. It was the milk that had made Sakura huge, but for men, it had a little extra effect instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooh...so good!\" Sakura shouted at the top of her lungs. Several gluttonous beauties nearby bobbed their heads in agreement. Sakura picked up the pace until her hands were barely visible, whipping back and forth between her mouth and the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he was spurred on by Sakura's own gluttony, Naruto started eating faster as well. The changes started almost immediately afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's hair stretched and flattened, turning silky like a woman's hair. His face became softer, smoother, prettier. Naruto experienced severe internal alterations, yet he felt no pain from them, as the inner-body functions that made him a man disintegrated and were replaced with new organs. Naruto's chest billowed outward as his, or rather her, new tits filled with several pounds worth of milk. Her jumpsuit was forced open, like a great log slamming into a castle's gates, as a big, jiggly gut emerged. Her stomach pooched down her waistband, past her lap, and over her ankles. Likewise, her ankles were puffy underneath a thick layer of fat surrounding them, and the chair creaked beneath the blonde's porcine legs. Her butt bulged and sagged at the same time, with ample amounts of pudge seeping over the chair edges. Her breasts had ripped through her clothes and spread across the table, knocking over plates and glass cups. She just kept growing fatter and fatter, until finally, she stopped at a soft, flabby, adorable 300 pounds. Naruto had become Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey! You're looking good!\" Sakura winked at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko blushed, playfully tugging at her hair as her double-chin rolled down her neck. \"You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I do! Looking sexy and healthy, just like a woman should!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko blushed even harder; she was finding herself suddenly attracted to this obese and confident Sakura again. She might like this 'gaining weight' thing after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who like many of the girls in the village seems to have been enjoying the strange milk with gusto. Like Sakura, Ino had a round face plush arms and a larger chest, but on the whole Ino 'filled out' a little differently. She had what could be described as a pear shaped figure, with a big stomach, a very wide backside, and two thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno finally reaches the other two doubling over to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ino!

Naruko and the others were all excited and eager to try on the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they were in the tamer section of the store, Ino and Sakura were dragging Naruko's hefty body over towards the adult section. It was filled with more risque outfits. At first Naruko seemed apprehensive, but after seeing how many panties, bras, and even cosplay clothes they had she cared a bit less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was especially aroused when she noticed that Sakura and Ino were stripping with piles of clothes they collected nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you two gonna go to a changing booth?\" Naruko asked. The two rotund kunoichi just laughed, their bodies wobbling as they chuckled. Sakura bent over, showing off her massive, soft ass cheeks and her lacy pink underwear seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko, there aren't changing rooms back here. There's almost never enough room inside them anyway.\" Sakura said as she then unhooked her bra to reveal her large breasts. Both of them were engorged with fat and swaying about freely. After a few moments she changed into a pink dress with a cleavage window and a short miniskirt that left her rear and panties on full display as long as she was in motion. The sight of it left Naruko in a tizzy, but Sakura didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, why don't we start getting you some clothes too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, some sexy ones.\" Ino said as she put on her new clothing, it was a pair of high heeled sandals, short shorts, and a V neck top that showed plenty of her corpulent cleavage and left her large belly out on display. The Chubby, cherubic blonde and her pink, pudgy partner then left the fat foxy female behind as they went around for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Naruko began to worry about what exactly the girls might bring her, but after a few moments they returned with another pile of clothes. They pushed them at Naruko and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We picked these ones out especially for you. Now put them on while we try on our other clothes and we'll tell you our thoughts.\" Ino said as she undressed again and squeezed into an outfit that had tight leggings with bat imprints on them. They hugged her hammy thighs tightly and a top that barely left any of her breasts unexposed. Putting on batwing hair decorations Ino smiled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko got out of her trance long enough to try on several outfits. One of which was a tight blue suit that he'd seen a space bounty hunter wear in a videogame once. It was like a second skin and felt comfortable. Naruko decided she definitely wanted this one, especially considering how it was pressed against her ass. She let out a little \"eep\" as she felt Ino grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, this is definitely a keeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Sakura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm. Well she needs to try on this little number first.\u201d Sakura said after chaning into a pair of thigh highs with black, semi-clear pants. The top covered her lower bod, but left almost all of her ass exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko could feel herself getting wet just looking at it when Sakura handed her a fishnet bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis doubles as a top.\u201d Sakura said as she slowly put it on Naruko and then put her hands under her breasts. And felt them up. \u201cOooh, and it seems it has other uses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you-\u201c Naruko began when she felt Saura us her medical ninjutsu on her boobs. Naruko felt odd, when she began to lactate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve altered the hormone levels in your body so we can have some real fun. The truth is Naruko, that Ino and I were into you and haven\u2019t really had the chance to ask. Do you want to be with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding? Hell yeah!\u201d Naruko shouted, holding up her fishnetted, milky breasts, she then offered them to the rotund ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sakura smiled and pulled Ino over. The two began to grope the foxy lady\u2019s ass as they suckled from her breasts, licking her nipples and getting her moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that\u2026.</span></div></div>",

It was the Dango Shop, a store she had become very familiar with as of late. Its sign resembled three dumplings that had the name printed onto them. The many delicious sweets and treats served in there were a heavy temptation that the blonde would often be unable to refuse. A small drop of drool had begun to form near the corner of her mouth when a loud roar erupted from her hefty belly. She blushed a bit after realizing just how noisy it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we could afford to make one or two little stops\u2026\u201d Sakura teased, placing a hand on her friend\u2019s gurgling gut. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, perhaps we\u2019ll just have to get a certain fatty some treats to stuff herself with.\u201d The pink haired girl giggled as she saw Naruko\u2019s face light up with excitement. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about paying for it, I\u2019ll foot the bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh thank you thank you thank you~\u201d She gave Sakura a big bear hug, her arms barely able to wrap around her fellow ninja\u2019s frame. The three girls made their way into the restaurant and found themselves a table with chairs large enough to support their rather fat asses. They looked along the wall at the various menus printed onto it and then ordered their treats which were quickly served to them. As their server left the room, sounds of pleasure began to fill the air from a nearby table. They looked over and saw a pair of figures that they were able to easily recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at that nearby table were two of their fellow ninja, Anko and Tenten. The two had recently become a couple and were enjoying a meal at Anko\u2019s favorite restaurant in the village. The girl with the spiked ponytail was dressed about the same as she normally was with her tan overcoat, orange miniskirt and mesh body suit which ran from her neck to her thighs. However, her recent gluttony had caused her weight to skyrocket, leaving her body suit a bit tight and riding up her thighs a bit while leaving her coat more and more open. Tenten, while not quite as fat as her lover, had also put on some weight, wearing a slightly looser outfit of a t-shirt and skirt to let her pudgy middle and thick thighs breathe all while still wearing her hair in those signature buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were heavily invested in a make out session with Tenten on top. Their lips were locked as they moaned with great pleasure. Their bellies and busts met, fat pressed against fat, leaving virtually no gap between the two of them. Having not seen the trio step inside earlier, they had assumed the shop was empty, leaving them with the perfect opportunity to pleasure each other. After another minute or so of frenching, a wolf whistle broke their concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Tenten turned around, her hands still groping her lover\u2019s breasts. Seeing three familiar faces, she let out a sigh of relief. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Anko asked. Tenten crawled off of the girl, giving her a chance to sit up. \u201cWell if it isn\u2019t you three. What brings you three here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone was a bit hungry.\u201d Ino replied, pinching one of Naruko\u2019s many belly rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t blame her, just passing this place makes my stomach go crazy.\u201d Anko chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the experience in the clothing store, the blonde ninja smiled and made her way over to the pair. \u201cPerhaps you guys would like to wash your sweets down with a little milk~?\u201d Naruko cupped her large breasts, giving the two girls an invitation for some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds pretty good to me.\u201d Tenten grinned. Anko nodded in reply, her mouth full of dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko began to unzip her suit, revealing the very same fishnet top she had bought from Sizable Shinobi. Her nipples were fairly hard and poked through one of the gaps in the fishnet. Before she could act, a familiar pair of hands grabbed her breasts and gave them a nice squeeze, sending a surge of jutsu through them. Before long, the blonde could feel her body begin to change. Her body began to swell, leaving her already tight outfit growing increasingly tighter. Naruko\u2019s massive gut began to make its way towards her knees while her lower half nearly exploded with fat. A third chin now adorned her chubby face. Last but not least, her breasts had nearly tripled in size, her nipples leaking milk while generous amounts of titflesh poked through the fishnet. On top of it all, a feeling of lust began to grow throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sakura~ Wh\u2026What did you do to me~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI messed with your body chemistry a bit more.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYour boobs were a bit empty after our little session, remember? They needed a bit of a refill, but I couldn\u2019t do it without adjusting a couple other things too. Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll shrink back down\u2026eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, Anko and Tenten\u2019s lips were already sucking milk from her massive jugs. Naruko could only cry out in ecstasy as the milk flowed through her nipples while the two girls groped and massaged nearly every inch of her doughy body. Every tug at her pink, tender nipples sent another shockwave of pleasure throughout her massive body. They weren\u2019t the only thing leaking either. A small trickling could be seen escaping from her pussy, showing off just how much she was enjoying the whole experience. Sakura and Ino just sat at their table, happily enjoying both their anmitsu and the show taking place before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again sucked dry, Naruko laid there in a sweaty heap of pleasure as she slowly recovered from her second time being double teamed in one day. Anko and Tenten had similarly satisfied looks on their faces, their bellies looking a bit rounder than when things had started. Sakura walked over and picked the blonde up off the floor, helping her to her feet. \u201cC\u2019mon fatty, you\u2019ve had your fun. We need to get back to the Academy, remember?\u201d She zipped the skintight outfit up, just barely manage to get the zipper past Naruko\u2019s massively swollen melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d She sighed. Sakura and Ino waved goodbye to Anko and Tenten and made their way out the door. Naruko waddled closely behind them, though she had a bit of trouble trying to fit through the doorway. As they traveled towards the Academy, Sakura\u2019s manipulation began to slowly wear off, leaving the gluttonous ninja back at her original size by the time they had made it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just go see what the Hokage wants with us.\u201d Ino said, leading the trio into the tower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a huge buffet that had replaced her entire desk. The Kage was without a doubt the absolute largest woman in all the leaf. At a staggering five hundred pounds, majority of it in her behemoth bosom situated above her plump paunch. As she stood, her massive breasts jiggling in a ridiculous manner. As she stood, filled out and fat laden, the blonde quadruple chinned woman began to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah girls, you brought Naruko, and just in time. I was starting to worry you wouldn't make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sorry Lady Tsunade, we ran into a bit of trouble a bit back.\" Ino lied, \"But we're here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good. I need to take Naruko and get her initiated. Shizune will be helping. Tsunade said, grabbing Naruko's weighty wrist. \"You girls need to go to my library and help find some books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, the two kunoichi went on the way, as instructed by their elder while Naruko was led away by both Tsunade and Shizune. Sakura and Ino winked at one another as they knew what \"initiation\" would entail. It didn't take long for them to make it to the library, where ie was all quiet and deserted, leaving only the girls there. Feeling especially playful, Ino grabbed Sakura's backside and began to jiggle her soft supple flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Being naughty Ino-piglet?\" Sakura asked turning and jiggling Ino's big, round belly. The blonde giggled, accidentally snorting as Sakura tickled her. \"Come on, why don't we have a bit of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, this is a library billboard-belly. We need to keep quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will.\" Sakura said,, making the \"shh\" noise and pinning Ino down as they stripped one another gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Naruko was standing in the Hokae's office, being felt up as Tsunade and Shizune slowly and carefully use Chakra to fetten her and make her breasts grow larger, producing large amounts of milk and fattening her up, to degrees which Sakura and Ino only dreamed. AS Naruko grew larger and fatter until she was nearly a ton and her belly and breasts took up most the room she began to get nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Grandma Tsunade, if I'm this big, will you be able to fix me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After initiation sweetie, we promise.\" Tsunade snickered. Naruko was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this initiation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly, Initiation is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a particularly cruel smile on her face as she came by and stroked Naruko's massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade, I'm surprised you kept your promise. I have to thank you for making Naruko so lovely for me before I got here. Now we can finally induct her into our organization.\" Hinata said, smiling as she kissed Naruko on the cheeks. The blonde blushed before starting to feel aroused. Hinara climbed on to her, stripping her jacket until she was wearing nothing but a fishnet bra and her lavender panties. Naruko was aroused, but curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, we're inducting you into the Leaf's lovely ladies organization, a little group we came up with for only the most beautiful and bountiful kunoichi.\" The chubby Byakugan user said, \"I'm the founder, and I'm glad that you decided to seek membership. Initiation involves a bit of fun coming from myself and the others.\" Hinata said, activating her eyes, using them, she would be able to see all of Naruko' sensitive and egregious zones. Using her gentle palms, teeming with chakara. As she groped Naruko's nipples, the foxy blonde howled with pleasure, her eyes reddening as the Nine Tails' chakara began to fill her. Hinata smiled, since this would make her job easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroping the whole breast now, Hinata began redirecting the near-endless Chakara and made Naruko grow larger. She was gettng fatter and bustier, the breasts growing as big as a person's body as the hormone balance jutsu made her produce and retain milk. It kept on going and going as Hinata grinded against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Hinata, shall we relieve her?\" Tsunade asked, watching, now changed into her own undergarmentss, as was Shizune. Hinata smirked and began to kiss Naruko deeply, pressing against her still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Lady Tsunade, first thing to do is make me just as large...You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Tsunade said as she used her Chakara manipulation to make Hinata grow fatter and more rotund. She was moaning as she felt pleasured by it all. The sensations penetrated her flesh and made her shiver with excitement. She could feel Tsunade's touch, almost as gifted as her own on Naruko's chubby body. Shizune was assisting Tsunade up to the point when  Hinata was just as big with her own massive pair of breasts, leaking milk. It was by then that Sakura and Ino came back , carrying their books before promptly dropping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is pretty hot.\"   Ino said, blushing. Her hair was let down still from her little love session with Sakura. Looking at them and winking, Tsunade spoke to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, about time. Care to help us out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. How Lady Tsunade?\" Sakura asked, wide eyed and eager, as well as dripping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink with us.\" Tsunade said, sipping from one of Hinata's engorged breasts, Shizune taking the other. Eager, the two younger girls did the same with NAruko as she made out with Hinata. Both the near immobile fat girls were aroused by their nipples being sucked and relieved of their milk, which in turn made the drinkers breasts grow. For a time it went on like that until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a massive pair of boobs that put some prize watermelons to shame, and an almost equally big backside.

'Ah! So heavy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the weight on top of him, to discover a beet red face. \"Hinata!?\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-a, s-sorry Naruto-kun!.\" Hinata stuttered, and hurried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't worry Hinata.\" Once Hinata was off him, Naruto got up and took a good look at Hinata. He should have expected it, but he couldn't help but to be surprised when he saw Hinata's new girth. She looked at least as heavy as Sakura did before drinking that milk. Her face, already a bit round and plump by normal standards, had filled out, forming two very chubby cheeks and a medium-sized double chin. Unlike Sakura, whose biggest feature was her belly (although all her body had fattened up a whole lot), Hinata's weight seemed to be distributed between her breasts and her hips and butt, giving her a thick hourglass figure. She was wearing her usual thick jacket, but it was strained to its limits by her ample bosom and chubby midsection, and the bottom of her jiggly belly and sizable love handles could be seen poking from under it. Her hips had doubled in width, and she was now the owner of a prominent bubble butt that jiggled with every step. Her legs were stuffed into her pants like two hams, and it one had to wonder how her thick thighs still fit inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had been rendered speechless. He didn't know if it was the milk or not, but right now he found Hinata at least as attractive as he found Sakura, probably more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-naruto-kun, a-are you a-alright?\" Hinata asked with her usual stuttering, snapping naruto out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? Oh, yes! I'm fine, I'm fine. How about you Hinata? How have you been?\" Naruto asked, trying hard to keep his eyes on Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, eh, m-me? I-I've been f-fine.\" She said blushing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice... Hey, do you know anything about why everyone seems to be drinking so much milk?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I-I don't know- I mean, it-it is really g-good.

At first, he had thought maybe half a pint would do, but Hinata brought two gallons of the stuff. While in the store, he noticed all of the beautiful, fat women, all buying the milk. More than a few of them also sported smiling men, who happily carried the milk for their bulging goddesses, just as Naruto did for Hinata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait to get back to his apartment to start drinking the milk straight from the gallon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Hinata,\" he said as playfully as he could, \"don't start the party yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" she said, lowering the milk from her face, \"i-it's just s-so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached the apartment.

It was Sakura's job to clean Tsunade breasts as Shizune prepared the milk. As much as Sakura would have loved to suckle on what was left of Tsunade's breast milk, she did not want Tsunade's breasts becoming chapped. After she toweled off each breasts, she generally applied the balm, earning another moan from Tsunade, who loved having her large, sensitive breasts fondled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(At Naruto's Apartment...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it morning or night?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everywhere were moldy dishes and dirty clothes, weapons left on the counter and scrolls across the floor. She couldn't leave Naruto in such conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly got dressed and got to work, organizing his weapons and scrolls, cleaning his dishes and taking the overflowing trash out. She dusted and swept, doing her best to be as quiet as possible so as to not wake Naruto, who slept on, curled into a fetal roll on his couch. Every once in a while, she would just sit and watch him sleep, happy that she could give him that peaceful sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished, just as it was getting dark. Her new girth hadn't slowed her down, though her back did hurt from the new weight of her heavy breasts. She had finished Naruto's milk and had even gone out to buy more. Even though she wouldn't have noticed either way, this time, she barely gained any weight at all; it had all gone to replenishing the milk in her breasts, which were now so swollen and sore that she was sorely tempted to wake Naruto. Thankfully, she did not have to disturb him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slowly opened his eyes, forgetting the last time he had ever felt so warm and safe, even in his own home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" he heard a soft voice, a kind voice. His eyes opened slightly faster, almost as if he feared that if he were not fast enough, it would disappear and he would be all alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hinata, standing above him by the couch. For a moment, he was embarrassed that he would call for his mother in front of her, especially after how he had...fallen asleep...suckling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh Gods, Hinata-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Naruto,\" she said, her smile as soft as her voice. \"Are you hungry or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, too relieved to think until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go potty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped himself after he said it! How could he say that in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut again, Hinata just smiled and helped him off of the couch and to the bathroom. He felt unsteady, oddly. Just unstable enough to warrant her extra attention, he guessed. Maybe he had slept for just a little too long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was patient, however. When he was done, they returned to the couch. Of course he noticed how <i>full</i> her breasts looked, even under her shirt. And of course she noticed his hungry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't...\" yes he was. Her milk had been so sweet, so good. But, this wasn't right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Naruto,\" she was already taking off her shirt. \"You can have as much as you want.\"</span></div></div>",

As it was filling she took a large orange towel off the door hanger and pulled a bottle of shampoo out from under the sink. Turning her attention back to the now filled tub she tested the water and concluding it was perfect turned the water off. Hinata stood up and made her way back to her baby when she saw she was eye level with the top of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's strange? Either I grew taller or this door has always been this low.' Hinata thought. Shrugging it off, she ducked under the door frame and walked to the couch with a smiling blonde rubbing his swollen milk filled belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, honey. It's time for your bath.\" She told him. Naruto tried to stand up but found he didn't have the energy to do so. He began to thrash his legs around in frustration when he felt a pair of arms lifting him up. Holding him bridal style, Hinata rocked him in her arms and kissed his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey, Mama's got you.\" Hinata said as Naruto started to calm down. He was so happy in Hinata's arms that neither had realized that she had just picked him up and held him as if he weighed less than a feather. Taking him into the bathroom, Hinata set him down and proceeded to remove his clothes. She wasn't even embarrassed when she took off his boxers and held his naked body in her arms. Easing him into the warm water, Hinata grabbed a bar of soap and started scrubbing his body. Naruto began to splash the water like a little kid causing Hinata to giggle. She then shampooed his hair and washed all the suds off of him. Once her baby was all clean Hinata pulled the cork and the tub started to drain. She lifted Naruto out of the tub and dried him off. Wrapping him in the large towel, Hinata lifted him up in her arms again and exited the bathroom. She set him down and walked over to his dresser and pulled out a fresh pair of boxers, a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt. As she dressed him, she saw the T-shirt was slightly relieving his plump belly. Giving it a soft pat, it replied with a hungry growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like somebody is ready for his dinner.\" Hinata said as she poked his noes making him giggle. Hinata proceeded to remove her shirt and bra, freeing her slightly larger breasts. She picked Naruto up and guided his mouth to her swollen nipple. As soon as Naruto felt Hinata's nipple in his mouth, his mind blacked out as he instinctively began to suckle. He let out a soft moan as he felt her warm milk go down his throat and into his still swollen stomach. As he drank, his t-shirt began to move up as his stomach was filled with more milk. Hinata rocked him in her arms as he continued to drink. She began to hum him a lullaby and walked over to his bed. Feeling him biting her nipple wanting more milk from her now dry breast, she gently guided him over to her other breast where he began to drink again. When Naruto had drained her other breast, he released her nipple and moved closer to his new mother. Hinata lifted him over her shoulder and began to pat his back causing him to let out a soft burp before snoring. Hinata smiled and looked at her sleeping son. A grin was on his face as he sucked his thumb and causing her to make a mental note to go to the store and get some baby supplies. She looked at his now massively swollen belly slosh back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone is going to be a very big boy one day.\" Hinata whispered. 'Especially someone with your appetite.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a kiss on his belly, Hinata laid him down on his bed and tucked him in. Running her hand over his head, Hinata smiled and kissed his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Naruto.\" She said and turned off the lamp. Stretching, she walked over to the fridge and pulled out a gallon of milk and drink the it all. She then headed over to the couch and laid down herself, not even caring that her feet were hanging over the end. Unknown to everyone this was only the beginning.</span></div></div>",

Then you and me will go shopping to get everything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's cries slowed to little upset hiccupping sounds as his mama cradled him in her soft, strong arms her comforting warmth and scent filling his senses as her soft gentle voice flowed from her into his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let's get you out of those cold messy clothes and into a nice warm bath, would you like that sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could only nod at this point, as his mama tended to his every need, first she stripped him of his clammy wet clothes while she ran the bath, before setting him in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now dearie you stay there for a little while, and mama will get those wet sheets off your bed, then we'll finish your bath, get you into some nice clean clothes, feed you your breakfast then you and me will get you all the special stuff you need to make sure this doesn't happen again okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Naruto sniffled feeling a lot better but still rather upset about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting Naruto's soiled clothes and sheets in the wash, Hinata returned to finish bathing her little sweetie, once he was all fresh and clean she then dressed him in a fresh new set of clothes, clean underwear, an orange t-shirt what was a little to small for he rapidly plumping baby, and a set of grey sweat pants that also seemed to be getting on the tight side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay honey, let's get you fed what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nods happily as his mama opens her shirt to give him access to her once more full breasts.

Naruto went back to perfecting his skills, so unbeknownst to him, Hinata and several other kunoichi had joined a strange new society for girls. It seemed that those girls had been putting on weight since Naruto left, and Hinata was one of the biggest gainers. She pretty much looked like Yukino from Real Drive, complete with a new ponytail, only with different bangs and she was about 30 lbs. heavier. At 180 lbs., Hinata's face was round, full, and sporting a double chin. Her chest and belly both got quite doughy and jiggled a little as she walked. As for Hinata's limbs, they resembled stuffed sausages, as did the fingers and toes. Hinata's plump new body was dressed in a simple purple dress with thin sleeves, reaching down to around her knees. Naruto was shocked at her gain, but was still glad to see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Hinata!\" Naruto tried to hide his shock, and luckily for him, did it well.

This being came to be known as Kaguya Otsutsuki.<br>\r\nIn awe of her power, humanity came to worship the titan as a goddess and surrendered to her will.<br>\r\nKaguya would eventually sire two sons, one of which would grow to one day become  konown as the sage of six paths ,founder of the shinobi world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya  ruled as a benevolent deity for many years. But in time however, her heart grew dark from corruption, believing herself as the ultimate good. Any who strayed from the path she laid out were delt with harshly.<br>\r\nHer sons, no longer willing to stand by and watch their mother's tyranny, stepped forth to oppose her. As titans themselves, they possessed divine powers comparable to their mother's which meant only they could stand up to her. Mountains crumbled, oceans boiled, the very sky and Heavens were torn asunder under the weight of their blows and reality itself was warped and bent before their might.<br>\r\nRealizing that they could not kill her, the brothers performed a Jutsu that ripped the lion's share of her power from her and transformed her into the very moon itself. The stolen power was then split into nine pieces and scattered to the far corners of the world. With their task complete, the brothers parted ways  with one traveling to the moon to watch over their  imprisoned mother and traveling the world to spread the teachings of ninshu in the hopes that it would act as a medium from which true understanding and unity between all of humanity could be forged. <br>\r\nThe sage's efforts,  admirable though they may have been, were for not as many discovered it could be used as a weapon.People came to learn that through ninjutsu Chakra could be used to harness the very forces of nature and even warp reality. Humans also came to learn that, as a side effect, chakra stores manifest themselves as extreme levels of muscular growth and physical mass. The end result was a world where strength is everything, the bigger and  stronger you were the better position you were in to succeed.  In this world, many train day in a day out to get as big as possible.<br>\r\nSome for the power it brings, some for the sake of their family's welfare , and others  for the incredible pleasure that the growth  gives to the recipient. Many strive for great gains in order to emulate the titans for many still worship them to this day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow, in this land of giants, new legends are about to be born<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From his golden blond hair, deep perfect blue eyes, and bright smile to him confident and determined, if worried at the moment, attitude, deceptively concealed by his frail form. Even his odd whisker marks on the tanned skin of his checks just looked so cute to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was already well on her way to being an amazonian goddess. Like all the other girls, she towered over her male peers, if a bit more than most girls. And like the other girls, her form was positively rippling with huge powerful muscles, perfectly proportioned to complement her feminemity. Her short, silky blue-black hair framed her pale milky face and her white, pearl-like eyes. When she was younger, she had had an overwhelming shy streak. However as her muscles grew, so too did her confidence, and now she was a sweet, strong, gentle girl. And yet, when she was around Naruto, her shyness would remanifest in the form of a red blush and a slight stutter. But she just couldn't help herself, Naruto was just so cute and perfect to her that feelings of affection, possesion, and even tinges of love had welled up in her from the very moment she first saw him. And these feeling had only grown stronger with time.</span></div></div>",

This grin quickly vanished when a pain shot through his arm and he looked at Hinata's face and noticed she bore no outward sign of pain or discomfort, if anything she looked amused at his attempt to deal some damage to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was not one to give up easily, he pulled his fist back and through another punch, this time landing on Hinata's chest.  It was the same result, Naruto with a hurting hand and Hinata watching while holding in a giggle.  Naruto kept at it, punch as fast and as hard as he could at the muscular, raven-haired heiress.  If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, then Naruto was surely that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto was letting lose with his flury of attacks, Hinata was experiencing quite a different reaction than what the boy was hoping for.  These attacks might have hurt a person of regular strength, but Hinata was a heavily muscled amazoness.  In truth, these punches were starting to turn her on.  It was understandable to her, the person she had a crush on for the longest time was touching her over and over again in a manner that tickled her.  She felt a heat begin to grow within her lower area and she knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was beginning to wear down and threw another haymaker at Hinata's body.  Instead of the meaty thwack he was expecting, he felt a tight grip close on his wrist.  Hinata had caught his punch and he could not escape her grasp.  He attacked with his other hand, but that too was caught by the girl.  Hinata brought both arms over Naruto's head before placing them in one hand and lifting him off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Naruto.\"  Hinata spoke breathily.  \"You should have realized from the beginning that there was nothing you could do that would hurt me.  You should have stopped as soon as your first few attacks failed.  Now you've gotten me all excited.\"  Hinata began to stroke the blondes cheek with her free hand, her fingers gliding over his whisker marks, fingers he knew held incredible strength.  \"Now,\" she continued, \"I need an outlet for my giddyness and your it.\"  She finished talking brought the boy closer, loving the power she held over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed his nose between her incredible cleavage, her pectoral muscles bouncing beneath the skin, giving Naruto's face a tit massage.  Naruto blushed an atomic red and he was starting to become arroused by Hinata's display of dominance.</span></div></div>",

First of all you attack wildly with no real thought towards defense.  We also need to work on your technique as well because a haymaker has too low a chance of hitting.  Now when you are ready we can start again.\"  The young ninja in training nodded at his sparring partner and slowly stood and taking another fighting stance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he slowly made his way towards the towering amazon, each step bringing him closer to the feminine powerhouse.  He threw out his first attack which was stopped by Hinata's hand.  The strength of her grip sent pain shooting up Naruto's arm and he tried pull away but simply did not have the strength necessary to escape Hinata's grasp.  Veins began to surface as the muscles of Hinata's forearms began to flex, slowly putting more power into the grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is another thing you should know Naruto, if you can make your opponent submit to you without wasting energy it is easier than fighting for an extended period.

I\u2019d take you to a beautiful mansion, where you would be safe, and be mine and mine alone. But, I can\u2019t do that, can I? That life, even though it would be best for you, just wouldn\u2019t be for you. You live to push yourself to try harder, to work to accomplish your impossible dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata laughed again. \u201cAnd therein lies the irony of it all. I defeated you, completely and utterly, without even trying, while you put your all into it, just like everything else you do. But you\u2019re really the strong one. You have the strength to dream of impossible dreams, while I don\u2019t even have enough strength to tell you how much I care for you. If you were anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t even be having this problem. I\u2019d simply tell you that you belonged to me, and then I\u2019d take you away. But, you\u2019re too stubborn, too strong for that. You belong to no one but yourself and your dreams. All I can do is be cruel to be kind. When we spar, I have to beat you, to prepare you for the path you have chosen. If I were to just let you win, then I would just insult you, and set you up to lose a fight you can\u2019t afford to lose. Because you follow your heart and your dreams, no matter where they lead, or what anyone else says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope that one day, you\u2019ll dream of being with me,\u201d Hinata whispered as she gazed upon the boy who had effortlessly and unwittingly captured her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where does Hinata leave him?</span></div></div>",

The memories of the fight flooded back into his mind and he blushed as he recalled how the Hyuuga heiress had rendered him unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head to rid himself of that thought and went back to figuring out where he was.  He realized by looking at the decor that he was definitely in a girl's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did Hinata bring me back to her house after we sparred?' he wondered.  He looked down and noticed for the first time since he awoke that he wasn't wearing anything more than his underwear.  Naruto was shocked.

The young ninja trainee performed a full body blush at that thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was fretting over whether Hinata took a peek in the cookie jar he failed to notice someone enter the room.

The Hyuga girl looked at Naruto who was short as 4'11 feet tall along with being scrawny while wearing a over large orange jumpsuit to hide it, but she could see what made her sister like him such as the bright blond hair and the deep blue ocean eyes plus he was cute. Of course next to her and Hinata the boy was tiny what with her older sister standing a towering 6'2 with massive but still feminine muscles long well toned legs a chiseled six pack defined arms and 44 E cup breasts , while Hanabi for her age was quite developed at 5'7 with proportionate muscle's and a nice sized chest of 42 D cup she hoped to be a match for her sisters figure one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she got a devious idea in her head \" Hmm that does sound interesting but what are the stakes?\" said the 12 year old girl ( I moved around their ages a bit Hanabi is 12 while Naruto and Hinata are 13) in sly voice that flew right over the boy head. Naruto's face scrunched in confusion \" Stakes?\" asked the confused Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger girl smirked slightly she had the boy right where she wanted him \" Yes stakes it's to make the match that much more interesting like if you beat me you get something you want and if I beat you I get something from you.\" as she said this the blond male had a look of thought across his face. Jumping On this chance to finish the trap she set \" And I just know the right ones of you beat me I have to listen to what you say with in the law and if i defeat you listen to what I say, the loser must fallow orders of the winner until they release them so what do you think?\". A shadow of doubt crossed the boy mind see this Hanabi used the trump card \" Unless you're scared of losing and admit that your weak.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made all logic fly out the window \" I am not scared and I am stronger then you so i accept.\" before Naruto could gather his bearings he tackled by a blue haired blur, the two rolled around on the floor for a few seconds before the attacker over powered Naruto by pushing him on his back and pinning his arms to the floor while his head had something on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally get his bearings the blond looked up at what trapping him to see a pair of muscular thighs that are hugged by a tight black pair of pants on either side holding his head in place, looking past the legs to see his arms being held down by the person's legs. The young teen looked upward to see who it was as he did this he saw the thighs along with the rounded hips and the crouch in the black form fitting pants, going past that he spotted a six pack leading up to a full chest that stood out with the dark blue spandex sleeveless top that showed off the full figure the female had the top was so tight enough that her nipples showed. His captor bent at the waist revealing that the top showed a decent amount of cleavage and that the person who pinned him was Hanabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to free himself the boy shouted at his captor \" What the hell are you doing!\" all he got was a smile that sent shivers down his spine \" Oh I am just wrestling Naruto what else?\" she said in a innocent voice. This made Naruto anrgy \" What but we never said start!\" the reply he got was along with her lowering her upper body so her face was close enough for him to feel her breath and that her bust rested on his chest made him blush \" Oh but when you said that you accepted it was when we started.\" Hanabi then kissed Naruto on his lips rending him speechless making her giggle.

Naruto could feel a pressure directly on his kneecap and realized that he was a hair's breadth away from getting his leg broken. Naruto made more clones that were quick to leap to their creator's defense, brazenly pummeling Hanabi's face and tugging at her arms to free Naruto before something terrible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of the beating and the incessant pestering of the clones freed Naruto as several of them dragged Naruto away. In a burst of strength, Hanabi stood up, throwing away Kage Bunshin, one in each hand, picking up another one and headbutting it into oblivion and punching the last that tried to attack her in the face, turning it to smoke. After disposing of her multiple attackers, she glared playfully at the real Naruto and his seven remaining clones. The clones looked at each other warily but they all had Naruto's original grit to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then sharply exhaled when Hanabi slammed a knee right into his belly. Grabbing the doubled-over Naruto around the waist, Hanabi flipped him up onto her shoulders and jumped into the air, slamming Naruto directly onto the ground head, neck, and back first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from being powerbombed on the floor overwhelmed Naruto's senses as he almost couldn't feel himself trying to move for a bit. When he got feeling back in his limbs though, he wasn't about to let Hinata's younger sister just step on him like he was a bug. Naruto clutched at Hanabi's leg with one hand as he formed a blue sphere of rapidly moving energy in his other hand, \"Rasengan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi let out an intense howl of pain when Naruto slammed the Rasengan into the side of her knee, the force of which forced Hanabi to do a full flip through the air thrice speedily before landing on her face on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly crawled and then stood up to run away now that he had his opening and turned back to see Hanabi looking at him from her place belly down on the ground, eyes gleaming as she rolled over and sat up, her right leg clearly dislocated at the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a  feisty one, Naruto. Ho...I'm gonna REALLY enjoy my victory romp with you!\" she said lustfully, making Naruto pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi lined her own leg up and slammed her hands against both sides of it to audibly pop it back into place, Naruto had to fight back the urge to gulp, \"Fuck\" Naruto squeaked, seeing Hanabi beginning to stand back up, \"Fine! I'll just knock you out now then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe created five clones that surrounded Hanabi again as she stood up, with all of the Narutos attempting a rising kick, but it was like trying to kick a small car off of the ground as they barely got Hanabi to lift up to her tiptoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild, spinning arm attack once again rid Hanabi of Naruto's clones, but Naruto himself ducked, retaliating quickly with a hard uppercut to the ribs that got Hanabi to grunt from the cleanly landed, technically sound shot and followed up with a stomp-kicked at the knee that he knew he had just dislocated moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi dropped to one knee, grabbing Naruto around his neck with both hands. The mammoth Hyuga heiress lifted him off of the ground and began strangling Naruto with his bare hands, \"Close your eyes and go to sleep, my little one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started kicking away wildly, but Hanabi's reach was scary and Naruto could barely reach her body with the tip of his toes as he tried in vain to pry his opponent's hands away from his throat. Naruto couldn't even make choking or coughing noises as his blood buildup started turning the whites of his eyes red as blood vessels were feeling the strain due to the blood pressure building in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi then bent down and grabbed Naruto by the back of his waist from behind before bridging her own body back and slamming Naruto's back, head, and neck into the ground, then seamlessly rolled through and picked Naruto back up before slamming his back down across her knee, flung Naruto into the air and jumped with him, catching him and held him upside down with her arms around his waist and driving him into the ground with an improvised spinning piledriver. Hanabi pulsated her thighs and glutes in powerful surges of rippling muscle. Each wave brought made Naruto's sight go darker until, finally, he passed out. <br>\r\nReleasing her thighs grip on his head, Hanabi let Naruto flop like a rag doll onto the floor. The novice kunoichi easily lifted his body up and threw it over her shoulder, walking nonchalantly until she reached her bed. She dropped the blond softly on the mattress, grinning and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsciousness returned to Naruto some time later, a weight on his body. And what he saw made him wish he could pass out again: Hanabi was nose-to-nose with him, smiling sweetly and eyeing him with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won, Naruto. You know what THAT means...I get to have a nice victory treat, namely you!\" Hanabi said with delight.</span></div></div>",

She tossed the remnants aside, and ran one thick fingered hand down his chest and stomach.  Her fingers dancing along his skin, stroking it and giving both nipples a small, but slightly painful, pinch.  Naruto moaned loudly, but was abruptly silenced by the young Hyuuga girl's lips and tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dominating him in every sense of the word.  Total control was hers, and Naruto was unable to resist no matter how hard he pushed and squirmed against her grip.  When Hanabi grabbed the back of his head with one big, meaty hand, he knew that there was no escape for him.  He would have to try and reason his way out of this, no matter how unlikely that it would work.  When the Hyuuga girl pulled away for air, he made his attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanabi, you can't do this,\" Naruto pleaded with his muscular captoress, \"this is wrong!\" he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, his pleas fell on deaf ears.  Hanabi showed no signs of backing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, Naruto.  I beat you fair and square.  As the loser, you are obligated to obey my wishes, and I...want...YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne strong hand slipped into the waistband of his pants, and with a swift pull, tore them, and his boxers, from the boy.  This gave her an excellent view of his now erect dick, as it swayed in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Hanabi continued, \"it looks like this part of you doesn't have any objections.\"  Grasping the phallus softly in her hand, the pale-eyed muscle girl gave it a few test strokes, accompanied by her blowing gently on the tip.  However, the girl did not like her toy's rebellious attitude, and felt tat a little punishment was in order.</span></div></div>",

He tried to cover himself with his hands but, Hinata would have none of that as she used her other arm to pull his jacket and shirt off over his head. She used the opportunity this gave her to hold his arms over his head. \"Now we can finally have some 'real' fun! You'll enjoy this to Naruto. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto never got the chance to respond as he soon found himself with his back against the ground and his arms pinned above his head with a horny Hinata laying on top of him, not enough to hurt him but, he wouldn't be getting free anytime soon. Naruto couldn't help but wonder how things had gone this far. Hinata had never taken things this far with him before. True she had stripped him down to his boxers before and cuddled his near naked self but, she had never done this before and it made him both fear what she planned for their 'fun' and anticipate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's purring soon caught his attention as she placed a small kiss on his lips. \"Now what should we do together? Hmmm, well I guess I could go for a nice tall glass of Naruto.\" She said emphasizing this statement by reaching down and giving his dick a gentle squeeze. \"Or, maybe I should strip down too. We could have a little 69 fun before we enjoy a good round of sex!\" The last part caused Naruto's eyes to widen as he heard her say sex. <i>'Sex! She wants sex? Now?!?'</i> He thought in slight fear. Once an amazon had their way with a boy once, they tended to quickly make it a once every night thing. Naruto wasn't sure if his small body would be able to handle every night sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. How should we have our fun?\"</span></div></div>",

She lightly patted Naruto's butt.  Well, light to her, Naruto would be felling the bruises from this for a day or so.  \"Why don't you take his back?\"  Ino smiled and moved close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno and Sakura slowly embraced each other, their massive breasts flattening slightly.  Each one grabbed the other one's arms.  They giggled innocently as they began undulating on an imaginary see-saw, as Sakura went up, Ino dropped a few inches.  The act was very pleasurable for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not, however, pleasurable for the boy trapped between them.  Naruto violently squirmed against the she-muscles holding him strong. Their bind today only held his torso and arms, leaving him to kick the amazon bodies.  This had about as much affect on them as his punches earlier.  With each set of movements, Naruto felt like the grip was getting tighter.  Each breath was becoming that much harder.  He thought he had a few broken ribs, which was a new sensation to the struggling boy.  But he wouldn't let himself cry, not from this play.  She would be angry if he did.  Naruto didn't want to anger her as she was one of the few adults who treated him like a person, if a very weak one who needed tending to, and this tending to generally meant not crying or breaking down while being played with.  She was still better than the male adults who just treated Naruto like trash for some reason he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Ino let out low moans as their hips touched each other.  They loved watching Naruto struggle for breath and laughed at the little face grunting and trying to pry his way to victory.  Then Sakura felt it first, a blink of the eye before Ino did.  They halted their undulating and touched their cheek, Sakura her right and Ino her left.  Sakura could see something in a tree behind Ino if she craned her neck, but it was Ino who felt real fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was disconcerting to many how someone so large could walk through eggshells and never make a sound.  It was impressive for an adult male shinobi.  It was considered scary by the woman now standing behind Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anko!?\" Ino whispered out.  She looked above Sakura's head to the fifteen foot tall amazon, one of the tallest in the entire village.  Her arms, legs, and torso were covered in fishnet clothing which left little to hide about her muscles.  Her frame was impressive and dominating, but her eyes stared coldly at the two girls.  Sakura was scared to move.  She had heard rumors about what Anko has done to her enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, now!\" the mighty kunochi demanded.  Ino and Sakura seperated and Sakura gently gave Anko her Naruto.  Naruto's eyes were closed and his breathing light.  The giant woman stroked Naruto's chest, arms, back, and other parts of his body.  She then turned to Sakura and Ino.  \"Dominating the boys and men in this village is not wrong.  It builds character for the guys and teaches the girls how far they can go without breaking the boys.  We build a strength from this bond of dominating and submission.  We need the men and boys as much as they need us.  You should know from the cocky bitch in class who thought they could dominate their male teachers that their smaller size doesn't mean they are less dangerous to us.  But, breaking bones is not play.  It is not fun.  And you will be punished for the three broken ribs you have given Naruto.  Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-but we weren't doing anything out of the ordinary,\" Ino began, \"We were just doing our normal fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know.  I was watching the whole ordeal.  But Naruto was played with by some girls on his way to the academy.  He was still recovering when you squished him,\" Anko replied.  \"His chest was already bruised and ripe for breaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it shouldn't be just our fault,\" Sakura injected.  This earned her a dark chuckle from Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong!\" Anko answered, still chuckling.  \"You broke Naruto, so you must pay.\"</span></div></div>",

The boy had no parents , no guardian and no friends to help him but she remembered his mother Kushina Uzumaki who was one of the mightiest woman of them all. Kushina died with her husband when she helped take down the kyuubi and she regretted her sacrifice to be with her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anko finished Naruto wounds the Hokage came as she felt the Tsunade's huge bare feet stomp the ground causing a small earthquake. Lady Tsunade became Hokage right after the 4th's death and she was considered the biggest woman in the world. Tsunade barely had any cloths on to hide her bulging muscle she was pretty much naked but she did had something to cover her nipples and she only had underwear on but she didn't care how she looked and everybody understood that cloths wear not possible to make for her size and when the young kunoichi grow up they have a hard time finding the right cloths as well. Lady Tsunade cared for little Naruto but she couldn't have permission from the council to adopt him so she watched him as close as she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anko, what happened ?\" asked the Queen of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto got bullied again, Ino and Sakura did it.\" said Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Naruto to the Hospital Anko. I'll handle the two brats !! Said Tsunade cracking her knuckles. Now Tsunade was HUGE ! If you lived in a second floor apartment, her head would be out your window. She has a hard time doing papper work in her office as her back can touch the ceiling and she has to sit on the floor and her big fingers have a hard time holding a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko nodded and took Naruto to the Hospital.</span></div></div>",

Naruto also saw her stomach sported a six-pack abs, her legs looked lean but he could tell there was more muscle in her legs too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, she may not have looked like a bulky bodybuilder, but she had muscles where it counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had short, black hair and distinctly pearl pink eyes that were accentuated by her eyelashes running upwards at the corners with no visible pupil or iris, so it looked like she had an off-color Byakugan.

Koharu stood at a small seven feet tall as she looked up at Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hokage, what brings you before us today?\" she asked as neither man looked up from the papers before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto was attacked again and played with, resulting in three broken right-side ribs,\" Tsunade replied, \"I want to use this as justification to take him under my protection and raise him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question,\" Danzo said, \"If any of our enemies found out who the boy's heritage is it would bring him in grave danger.  You personally caring for him would raise too many questions.\"  Tsunade gritted her teeth.  That was always his excuse.  And the other two always agreed with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what he can do for this village is meaningless if he is killed by pubescent girls who are drawn to his hidden power!\" Tsunade shot back.  \"His mother and my grandmother before her were great forces of power in this world, using the Kyuubi's power to enhance the strength of women in the village.  Unless Naruto is protected, he will die before he can do anything for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point that as Hokage you are protecting a child who is of no blood relation to you and would draw attention to him still stands,\" Danzo replied in his calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danzo is correct,\" Koharu said.  Tsunade tightened her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then permit Anko Mitarashi to adopt him,\" Tsunade said.  \"She will be able to protect him and train him properly.  She was the one to bring him before me today.\"  The Elders exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a reasonable action,\" Homura said, \"We will not fight it.\"  Tsunade nodded and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shizune,\" Anko said softly as the just shorter medical ninja put her hand over Naruto's chest.  If Shizune wished, she could crush Naruto's body but instead, she was sending healing energies through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I treat so many boys for minor things as the girls play with them, but for Sakura and Ino to do this to Naruto,\" Shizune said as she felt herself get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  If I don't get to them, Lady Tsunade will take them down a peg or two,\" Anko said.  Shizune pulled her hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still needs bed rest in a safe place,\" Shizune said.  Anko nodded before turning around quickly.  A man much smaller than her seemed to appear out of no where.  His face was covered by the typical ANBU mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A message from Lady Tsunade,\" he said, opening the scroll before Anko.  Her eyes scanned the paper and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would work,\" Shizune said as Anko looked at the still resting Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later for some dango,\" Anko said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short distance away in a house in the woods, Anko entered her home.  She smiled at the snake decorations around her home.  \"Welcome home Naruto,\" Anko whispered as she took him to the guest room.  She laid him down in the bed and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time passed and Naruto slowly came around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what happened?\" Naruto muttered.  His eyes fell on the snake paintings in the room.  \"Okay, where am I?\"  A wonderful scent came to nose.  Someone was making some food.  His tiny gut grumbled and told him what it wanted.  Slowly, he slipped out of bed and followed his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, wonderful,\" came Anko's voice as Naruto neared the kitchen.  \"Just needs a bit more curry.\"  Naruto glanced inside and saw</span></div></div>",

Anko walked towards Naruto and picked him up and laid him on the big chair that was made just for giant amazon and it had a books stacked on top of it that way Naruto can sit down while eating his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade gave me permission for me to adopt you.

I love Naruto. Because I couldn't adopt him and because he didn't have a mother I couldnt ask this from his mother so I had to wait until he was old enough, but now is the perfect opertunitie for this.\" Tsunade said as she took Naruto from Anko again to breastfeed him once more. \"Here Naruto-kun this is from your future wife.\" She said letting Naruto suck at her <b>giant</b> mountain of fleash called her breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko however wasn't convinsed at all and as quickly as she could she took Naruto back to breastfeed him <i>again</i>.\"Oh no hokage-sama. I wil not let just any woman be with my adorable little son and I know the 'Clan Restoration Act' wil be placed on him, but I'm not just going to decide like that. Besides, I am going to be his first wife. It isn't against the law, I checked it before I went home.\" Anko finnished with pride in her voice. \"However...\" She began as she put her free hand on her chin, putting her in a thinking pose. \"Having the strongest kunoichi alive as my daughter inlaw sounds very tempting.\" Anko said as she remained in thinking pose with everybody else sweatdropping, because she was acting to much like a mother already. Than again she did care a hole lot for Naruto,  because she always took took care of him whenever he was in trouble and nursed him to health if needed whenever it was needed and that was also the reason she was chosen to be Naruto's mother, she was perfect for the job. \"Ok hokage-sama I've got an idea. You can date my son, but to do so you must live with us and whenever your here you must listen to everything I say. This does not apply for outside, but I wil have the final desision if any other girl wants to date my cute little Naruto-kun and that also means that your going to help me in finding the perfect girls/woman for him to marry after us.\" Anko finnished while pushing Naruto further into her giant breast while breastfeeding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Said the hokage with a happy smile, because she was thinking she could finally date her Naruto-kun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am also in love with him and I want to be his girlfriend to!!!\" Shizune suddenly yelled out loud. Anko looked at her and smiled with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. My son will have the strongest woman in the world as his wife's. You can date my son under the same deal as hokage-sama, but you both will still have to train for him to keep being the strongest wife's. Undestand?\" Anko said as Tsunade and Shizune nodded head. \"Good. Now lets seal the deal with a kiss from my cute little son.\" The purple haired amazone said as she took Naruto from her breast and brought him in a searing kiss, almost covering his entire face with her lips. Not that Naruto minded, he loved it that three of the strongest kunoichi are in love with him and he happely tried to kiss back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted a few minutes and when Anko was done she gave Naruto to Shizune to kiss, much to Tsunade's dissapointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune's kiss was the same as Anko's and when she was done kissing him she gave him to Tsunade who eagerly took him and started kissing him. Her kiss covert Naruto's entire face and most of his upper body and when she was finally done kissing him she put him in her vally of a cleavage an huged her breast together (wich was hard because she could barely reach the front of her breasts) so would sit comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko was smilling at her future daughters in law and thaught on wat to do next and then it hid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to...</span></div></div>",

Slowly her head turns only to come face to face with a pair of massive thighs that were each significantly thicker than she was! Ino then looked upwards , having to crane her neck up in the process, to get a better look at the newcomer. Ino noted that the thighs were attached to two monstrously powerful legs that were taller than she was and curved up into hips that were beyond child bearing and extended outward past the rest of the Amazon's frame by two feet before tapering off into a relatively thin wast. Though the girl was facing ino, it was apparent from what could be seen from the front the this individual sported a rear large enough that a man's whole body could fit in a single cheek. The thighs from before seemed to stretch endlessly before converging into a thick mound that was obviously the mystery girls pussy. Ino also noted that the Massive girl's lower half was clad in a pair of almost perfectly form fitting sweat shorts that left very little to the imagination. Higher up, a  highly developed and glistening six pack that could grind steel into dust could be seen on the girl's abdomen. Any attempts at seeing  this behemoth's face were thwarted by a pair of medicine ball sized breasts held aloft by massive pectorals wrapped in a to tight tube top. To the girl's side were  two gloriously massive arms thicker and stronger than a man's entire body linked to tire sized shoulders and ended in strong yet feminine hands which were currently at rest upon bountiful hips. Though ino couldn't see her face, there was no questioning who this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was  none other than Hinata Hyuga.<br>\r\n Naruto's self proclaimed girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Broke out into a cold sweat for she assuredly incurred the the Hyuga heiresses wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it was no mystery that the pale eyed kunoichi had a thing for everyone's favorite blonde boy-toy. Years ago Hinata was very shy and introverted,having difficulty even making eye contact with anyone. This was a source of constant grief for her. One day when she was being harassed by some of the other kids , Naruto  came to her defense and chased them away. They had a heart to heart with naruto imploring her to be more confident and true to her feelings. Hinata took his words to heart and admired him ever since. Hinata's feelings  of admiration eventually blossomed into a full blown crush leading her to vow to train harder than anyone else so she may one day return the favor aswell as ensure that no one could take her beloved Naruto from her. Now years later, <br>\r\nWhere most female students her age stood somewhere between  six to eight feet tall Hinata stood at sixteen feet of raw power and sexuality. She was the biggest and strongest kunoichi of her age group bar none. Hinata very early made sure that everyone knew Naruto was hers and was therefore  offlimits to every other girl (without her and naruto's permission at least). A few girls objected ofcourse but Hinata made thorough (and painful) examples of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you can imagine her surprise and ire when she spots ino bullying her (nonconsensual) boyfriend on her way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hiya Hinata w-w-w-what  b-brings you here?\" Ino stuttered nervously as she desperately tried to think of a way out of her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata  proceeded to bend down very slowly to add in that extra intimidation factor.<br>\r\nShe looked ino in the eyes with a too large smile on her face which did nothing to conceal the barely restrained anger in her own pale ones.<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing I was just taking a stroll through the field on my way to the academy like I usually do when I noticed you were have a rather....<i>physically intimate</i> altercation  with <b>MY NARUTO</b>?\" Hinata punctuated those last two words for added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was sweating bullets at this point. She had to choose her next words very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we weren't doing anything funny naruto was just..... helping me with training!! Yeah that's it\" Ino prayed that the  colossus before her would buy her half baked excuse all the while knowing that it was a long shot(to say the least).she had to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrriiiigght\" Hinata answered not buying the smaller girl's obvious bullshit for a second <br>\r\n\"Then if you don't mind I'd like to have naruto back please and thank you.\"<br>\r\n Hinata put out her hand, gesturing for the smaller girl to hand over the object of her affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno  immediately placed the half  conscious boy in the rather frightening girl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno briefly marveled at how the seemed no more than a doll in the giantess's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata  stood back up at her full towering height. She looked lovingly at her precious  cargo before giving him a kiss that engulfed his face before  placing him between her mammoth cleavage. Hinata looked down upon ino who was now visibly cowering before. Hinata felt a wave of satisfaction at that sight. The knowledge that this upstart and others like her knew who was in charge just by looking at her filled with  pleasure that bordered on erotic. <br>\r\n\"W-well I'll be heading to school now\". Ino dashed away as fast as her sculpted legs would carry her. While Ino was still in ear shot Hinata shouted \"Oh and don't worry  I'll be sure to remember to thank properly for  helping Naruto train\". At that moment  she could have sworn that the blond haired girl sprinted just a bit faster.<br>\r\n Hinata with (nonconsensual)boyfriend in tow, continued her stroll towards the academy<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The large woman shifted him so he was sitting on one hand as she pulled out some dango to eat with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Sensei?\" Naruto asked, looking at one of the tallest women in the village.  She stood over fifteen feet tall, three feet taller than the average Kunoichi topped off at.  Anko smiled at the small boy.  To her, Naruto looked just over 18 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cam to get you for some training,\" she said gently.  Naruto gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal or team training?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team work,\" Anko said as she climbed down the tree.  Naruto nodded.  Since physically few male ninja could ever stop one of the Amazon Kunochi, men had the role of support, casting genjutsu, doing some healing, or more covert actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had just passed the graduation exam as he had mastered a jutsu only high-level female jounin used, his classic Shadow Clone Jutsu.  He had sought it out because of Mitsuki's lies like before, telling him how he could pass even if he wasn't good at the other three sections.  While this was impressive, he was still failing at the other styles men typically did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Naruto said as he was being held close to Anko's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to say, mastering the Shadow Clone Jutsu is really impressive,\" Anko said, \"But why did you pick such an offensive jutsu?\"  Naruto looked to the great Kage mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wanted to be like the 4th Hokage, who had the respect of not just the men but the women as well.  With his skill and power, he could beat even the strongest of Kunoichi!  He wasn't their play toy.\"  Anko nodded, recalling the reports Iruka gave on how the class girls saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with me, you will get experience fighting strong Kunochi but remember the 4th didn't just stand alone.  He had his comrades, men and women, who helped him out,\" Anko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Sensei,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And if you use the power of the Kyuubi right, you could end up even stronger,</i>\" Anko thought as she reached the training area.  Naruto looked around for his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun!\" came a familiar feminine voice.  Naruto turned to see Sakura, standing just under seven feet tall, smiling down at the boy.  \"You're almost late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got lost looking at the clouds,\" Naruto said, earning a grin from Anko.  She privately wondered if Naruto had met Kakashi at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for number three,\" Anko said, looking around.  \"There's the third team member.\"  Naruto and Sakura turned to see ...</span></div></div>",

Shoulders slumped the blonde-haired boy walked towards the gates of Konoha.  He just knew that this mission was going to suck, especially since he was showing a group of kunoichi around the village.  For some reason Naruto could never figure out he was always attracting female ninja to him,  usually in a bad way.  From the moment they met the boy they seemed to want to keep him as a toy they could play with.  He couldn't remeber the number of times he was used to play house (usually as the baby) or dress up with the muscular female inhabitants of Konohagakure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto soon arrived at the large entrance gate and met with the guard at the check-in station.  The ninja stationed there only gave Naruto a sad smile before handing him his some money for expenses and left him with a \"Good luck kid, you're going to need it.\"  The guard then left to get the honored guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard soon returned with four large figures in tow.  Each one of them was female and extremely muscular.  On the guard's left was a fair skinned blond with a large chest, standing next to her was a dark-skinned girl with yellow eyes and red hair pulled back with a bandana made from her forehead protector.  To the guard's right was a girl with dirty-blonde hair tied back in a braid, standing next to her was an older, white-haired woman with dark skin and her hair pulled back into a bun except for two bangs framing her face.  They were all over 6' tall and displayed muscles that Naruto could not help but be intimidated by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard ninja spoke, \"Naruto, these women are who you will be escorting through the village.  To my left is Samui and Karui, and to my right is Yuugito Nii and Mabui.  I have already given you money so why don't you show these ladies a nice meal.\"  The guard then bowed to the women and returned to his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked over the amazons nervously.  He just knew he was going to regret ever getting in trouble with the village after this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W..well, I guess I should take you somewhere to eat first.\"</span></div></div>",

Now, if this had been a normal school that was attended by civilians this wouldn't be a big deal, just a lecture and some visual aids.  Naruto's school, however, was a school of ninja, and they were given a more hands on approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the shared belief of the higher ups that being given first hand sexual experience was beneficial for all propective ninja.  The students were paired up and made to explore different sexual experiences, from felatio to intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the males were looking forward to it, being horny young men with surging urges.  Naruto was not.  He had, for some reason or other, become the center of attention of many young kunoichi.

That completes the pairing up for today.\u201d Naruto blinked wondering why he didn\u2019t hear his partners name only to realize that he had let himself to get so lost in his fear that he had completely missed it. <i>\u2018SHIT!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW!?!\u2019</i> The blond shook in fright as he realized that he was in deep now, not listening to the name of your first time could be taken as a BIG insult. <i>\u2018Kami (God) please let it be someone I know.\u2019</i> The teacher simply continued on as he was not aware of the blonds\u2019 current plight. \u201cSeeing as how this is your first day of this it has been decided that you will be given the rest of today and tomorrow as a freebie. So use this time to get to know your partner as you will be sharing you first time with them and feeling comfortable around each other is important. And so with that you are dismissed.\u201d The class quickly rose from their seats and began greeting their partners before making their way out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sweating bullets as he looked around. His eyes taking in every girl that hadn\u2019t meet up with their partner yet. His eyes however stopped on three girls in particular. Sakura Haruno, Ino Yamanaka and Hinata Hyuga. These three girls all threw a small look towards the blond and that made him worry. Sakura and Ino were two of the tallest and most largely muscled girls of his class, not to mention two of the most aggressive girls. Most of the injuries he had obtained in class hadn\u2019t been from ninja training or even spars but, from one of the two mentioned girls using him as either a stress relief aka: punching bag, or turning him into a practice dummy for some of their more painful and crippling grapples and holds when practicing Taijustu. Most of the males and even some of the girls feared them and their anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata on the other hand was someone Naruto could not only deal with but, do so happily as unlike Ino or Sakura, Hinata always tried to minimize the pain her <i>\u2018practice dummy</i>\u2019 endured. Hinata had in truth become something of an idol among the boys. Most of the male body in class had a crush on the kind and gentle girl, Naruto included. When standing he just came to about shoulder level with her, meaning that she had to look down to meet his gaze, unless he was too busy looking straight ahead, eyeing her well developing chest. Were Sakura and Ino were tall pillars of muscle, Hinata was more toned, though you\u2019d never see it as she tended to cover most of her body with baggy clothing. Naruto had once gotten a glimpse of what was under her baggy jacket and pants, it had been an accident mind you but, he had still gotten a good look. He had seen that Hinata had a more hourglass figure with skin that looked so soft and creamy in color that he had wanted to touch it and see if it was really as soft as it looked. As for her muscles, you would definitely see them moving under her soft skin but, they didn\u2019t bulge out like most. Looking back on the image Naruto would happily say that she looked like she\u2019d have the same strength as all the other girls while still maintaining a soft gentle outer appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto would have continued on in his thoughts and comparisons if not for a finger poke to his side bringing him back to the present.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata smiled in an almost wicked fashion. She had looked over the rules and laws of this <i>\u2018random\u2019</i> drawing and had found a few loopholes that she had been able to use to her advantage. The fact that she had a good deal of political leverage that she could use was also a nice bonus. Now because of her maneuvering she had been able to secure Naruto as her first time. <i>\u2018And if all goes well he will be my only\u2019</i> thought the young heiress. Things were already in motion and by the time came for them to switch to someone else it would already be too late. <i>\u2018Once everything is done I won\u2019t have to worry about letting any other boy touching me in such a manner. And if people push it by making Naruto do such things with another girl then to bad for them as it will only mean that Naruto will have two girls to satisfy that day rather than just me.\u2019 </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she smirked as she glanced over at the blond boy she had fallen in love with. Seeing him looking around in an almost panicked manner let her know that he had been too consumed in his thoughts to hear that he had been paired with her. This time a gentle smile graced her face as she stood. She slowly made her way towards him, her toned muscles hidden from view as she took her time walking toward him. She wanted to savor this moment and burn it into her memory. Gently poking him in the side she saw him jump slightly before turning his eyes towards her. The moment she saw those big beautiful blue eyes look at her she had to resist the urge to grab him and start covering his face in kisses or suffocate him with her firm and perky C-cup breast as she hugged him. <i>\u2018I have plenty of time. All the rest of today for him to relax and all of tomorrow to enjoy him in privacy.\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello Narut-to.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was nervous. After they had been dismissed from class Hinata had suggested that they walk around the village and get to know each other. He had to admit that he was a bit surprised as most of the others were likely going straight to the physical introductions with each other but, he felt better knowing that Hinata seemed to actually what to get to know him first. They had spent the last two hours just talking and learning about each other and Naruto had truthfully been enjoying his time with Hinata. After so long though Hinata had asked to be excused so she could grab a quick snack for them. This left Naruto in his current nerve racking situation. He was sitting on a bench nearby the bakery Hinata had gone into. The problem was that the bakery was in a more heavily populated area and Naruto had noticed a change in how some of the villagers had started looking at him. Oh yeah, there were still glares and looks that said how much they wanted him to just disappear but, others aka the females of Konoha were now looking at him with a different emotion, Lust! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Great. As if I wasn\u2019t nervous enough as it was with what\u2019s to come but, now I have to watch out for these other women trying to grab me for some fun. I may have wanted attention but, not this kind of attention.\u2019</i> Complained the boy inside his head. Turned out that male shinobi were considered fair game to those of the opposite sex once they finished their first day in the academies\u2019 Sex ED class, and being only academy students they didn\u2019t get much say in it should a girl grab them for some fun. \u201cI guess this is why most pairs skip strait to the sex.\u201d He muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kept his eyes peeled, on consent lookout and ready to bolt should any of the groups of girls nearby start moving towards him. <i>\u2018I hope Hinata is nearly done getting whatever it was she wanted to get in the bakery. I don\u2019t know how much more my nerves can handle.\u2019</i> As much as he was praying for her to finish soon and return to him he had no disillusions about it actually happening as the bakery was rather packed at the moment. Plus, Naruto felt that any luck he may have had was spent on getting Hinata as his first time, so yeah, he wasn\u2019t expecting any miracles anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove that his luck had turned to shit Naruto spotted two women breaking off from their little group off to his right. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, with the shortest being about 5\u20197\u201d bringing her to be a full foot taller than him and the other one was a couple of inches taller than her friend. The taller one had long strait black hair that went down to her shoulder blades and jade green eyes and lightly tanned skin. The shorter one had wavy brown hair that went down to mid-back, her eyes were a hazel brown and her skin was slightly darker then Naruto\u2019s. Any male would agree that they were beautiful with their full and shapely bodies but, this isn\u2019t what Naruto was focused on. The thing that caught his eye was the bottom half of an ANBU tat on their upper arms and that they were both dressed in standard ANBU black pants and shirt with dark gray armguards and chest armor. He saw no mask so they weren\u2019t on duty and couldn\u2019t pull their ANBU rank on him to make him cooperate but, they still out ranked him by simply being full fledged Kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking he looked around for an escape path but, found that the other women in the area had practically surrounded him leaving him no escape path. The knowledge that he could do nothing to stop these girls from dragging him away and using him to please themselves made him feel like crying in despair but, he wouldn\u2019t do that. No. He was a boy that would soon be a man, though it seemed that manhood was going to come about sooner than he had thought. He suddenly went completely ridged as an arm wrapped around his neck from behind in a gentle embrace. A face leaned down next to his and nuzzled his cheek. \u201cShall we go Naruto?\u201d his captor kindly asked. Turning his head he saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto glanced nervously towards Hinata, who was walking a bit in front of him in the academy hallway. He couldn't help but let his eyes wander a little. His gaze traveled from top to bottom and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dark as night colored hair looked soft and silky to the touch, it made him wish to run his fingers through it. Her neck was the same creamy-white as always. Despite her time training under the hot sun. Naruto felt the soft complexion suited her perfectly. He imagined what she would look like in a thin nightgown under the open night sky and full moon. Such beauty could only belong to a goddess, of that he was certain. A goddess that he would be sharing a bed with, a goddess that he would be giving his innocence too in order to become a man. <i>'No pressure.'</i> He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts returned to the here and now as he continued letting his eyes feast upon the image of this sexy amazonian. Her shoulders, while not broad like his would one day be, were held in a way that nearly screamed powerful. Her arms and upper body were concealed from view by her bulky tan jacket; something that he felt some disappointment from but, he had already gotten that accidental peek at her body a few months before at the hot springs, so he realized that he shouldn't be complaining. He knew that under the annoying obstruction known as a jacket, lay a body that was both strong and curvy. Her muscles might be smaller then most kunoichi's but, she had proven that she was just as if not even stronger then her classmates. With her more compact form, Hinata had shown that she was also very agile and, much to the boys enjoyment, very flexible. Naruto himself had had a small nosebleed when he saw just how flexible she was, not that the other boys had been any better. It was actually a bit mystifying to see a kunoichi her age with a build more like the civilian women had, rather then the large bulky covered in hard muscle build most had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about Hinata's upper body, he couldn't help but, remember her rather sizable breasts. Most kunoichi lost some if not most of their breast in exchange for their massive muscles. Hinata however didn't seem to suffer this problem most likely due to her smaller muscle size. Naruto wasn't focused on that though, he was thinking more along the lines of how would they feel if he touched them. Would she like it? Would she tell him not to do it again? He didn't know but, he was feeling rather eager to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his viewing brought Naruto to something that he hadn't made note of before. Her bottom. It was memorizing as he watched her full round butt rock ever so slightly from side to side with each step. He made note of her hips, which added to the rocking, no swaying motion of her bottom. He had this terrible urge to reach out and grab it, to feel her soft, yet likely firm, butt in his hands. He had to stop himself a few time from reaching out and doing just that. Quickly, he adverted his gaze from her wonderful rump to her strong and shapely legs. Yet again he found himself annoyed at an article of clothing though the pants could do only so much to hide her butt, it was apparently able to do a lot better at hiding her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was so deep in his thoughts and observations of his soon to be first time, that he was caught completely off guard when Hinata turned around suddenly and he felt himself being grabbed by the front of his jacket. His mind went fuzzy for a moment when his back was slammed against the academy hallways wall. He quickly became aware of something gently pressing against his front, just hard enough to prevent him from sliding down and touching the floor. The next thing he became aware of was the sweet scent of lavender and lilacs so close to him, as well as a sound that seemed much like purring. Last, thing he became aware of was the feeling of two soft orbs pressing against his chest and the hot breath caressing his lips in small bursts. Blinking his eyes clear revealed the kind but, now somewhat lustful gaze of Hinata looking back at him, their faces only inches away from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto\" she called in a husky yet playful voice, \"I can feel your eyes looking me over. You wouldn't happen to be having dirty thoughts about me, now would you?\" She questioned. Naruto felt extremely nervous as Hinata had yet, to stop purring. She was also pressing her body against him while moving it in a slow and arousing manner across his chest; her lips moved so close that they were brushing against his, tempting him. \"I, I, um...\" For all his courage and all his reluctance to be in this Sex Ed class, he couldn't keep the thought of her lips out of his head long enough to give a proper answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Naruto! You naughty boy!\" She said in a accusing tone that was clearly false before moving to whisper into his ear, her voice filled with both excitement and lust. \"It seems I'm going to have to '<i>Punish'</i> you.\" The way she said punish made his body react in typical male fashion. Hinata jumped slightly when she felt something poke her. Realizing what it was however, she grabbed the tent in his pants with a free hand and commented about how he was such a big boy, her face only lightly red as she blushed.</span></div></div>",

Standing at eight feet tall she sported a musculature that put Male body builders to shame while still being feminine. Upon her barreled  chest sat a pair of melons larger than her head which rose and fell in time with her breathing.  Her body was supported by a pair of legs that reminded Naruto of pillars of chiseled Marble. A closer look at her attire revealed a set of perfectly solid washboard abs.  Indeed she was a fine specimen.  The very image of an Amazonian beauty. In fact she would be considered quite desirable if it weren't for the fact that  she was a brute with a short temper.  Naruto  couldn't believe how cruel fate could be. Of all the girls he could have been paired with he had to end up with the one that routinely man handles him! <br>\r\nNaruto looked up, having to crane his neck somewhat painfully in order to look his soon to be fuck buddy in the eyes. He could only wonder what was to become of him tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sakura was taking a moment to appraise  her match up. She was somewhat annoyed. She was hoping to be paired up with the stoic and brooding Sasuke with his good looks, incredible talent, and his cool headed attitude which complemented his air of mystique. However, it would seem that it just wasn't in the cards she briefly lamented. But it wasn't all bad. She got to be paired up with her favorite playmate. There was something about the short  blonde that was just irresistible and all of the other girls agreed. These days you can't seem to find him without being harassed by someone. Be it one of his female classmates, senior kunoichi, or even random strangers!<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, she could see the boy standing  before her trembling with a nervous look in his eyes. She always found it cute whenever he did this. <br>\r\nSakura then gave the blonde a rather wstutsmile Before making to address him.<br>\r\n\u201cHiya  Naruto!\u201d she greeted him with a unnervingly chipper tone. <br>\r\n\" So it looks like we're going to partners huh.\u201d  Sakura bent over slightly with both hand on the small of her back, rocking back and forth ever so playfully on the balls of her feet.<br>\r\n\u201c Y-yeah I guess \u201c Naruto muttered somewhat under his breath.   \u201cWhat is she playing at?\u201d Naruto thought  to himself. Usually Sakura would give a brief  description of what she was going to do with him today and get right on it. But today, especially considering the current subject matter, she's being rather friendly, unnervingly so even! This made him wary about what she had planned.<br>\r\nSakura continued the give Naruto that smile. \u201cSince we're about to get to know each other in one of the most intimate ways possible I figured it would be best if we tried to make this as enjoyable as  possible.\u201d She emphasized the word \u201cenjoyable\u201d with an almost sluttery tone. This somehow made Naruto even more worried then before while also making him quite aroused, though he'd never say out loud. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat d-do you have in mind S-Sakura chan?\u201d Naruto stuttered. <br>\r\nSakura then gave him a playful grin. \u201c I was thinking that we could\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now this would normally mean that Naruto was living a happy life and for the most part he is, except the fact that his mother happens to have the most chakra amongst the Kunoichi even more than Tsunade and so is the strongest in the village along with being the current Hokage. How this is a problem is the fact that his mom is extremely clingy and wants to make sure that Naruto is always by her side at all times and being a boy means he can't really stop her either. This means that she doesn't want him to become a ninja which would mean that he would be required to go on missions and be away from her. They argued for some time about his choice but Naruto wouldn't relent since he inherited her stubbornness so she compromised by saying that Naruto would be personally trained by her to make sure he survives his missions and comes back to her safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After he agreed to the deal they started his training and Naruto at that point wished he didn't agreed. The training was essentially Kushina utterly destroying him in their homes underground wrestling ring which meant he was forced to endure the beat down as his mother twisted him in submission moves or slamming him with power moves. After every session he was always lying on his back spread eagled and knocked out while his mother goes off to workout on the machines in their gym till he wakes up. <br>\r\nWhen he does wake up he notices his mom standing above him with this flushed almost erotic expression on her face which freaks Naruto out since he is starting to believe that his mother is not only clingy to him but also gets sexually aroused from utterly dominating him in their spars. Now Naruto would be lying to himself in saying that he wasn't turned on either from being dominated and the fact that his mother is possibly the most beautiful woman in the village didn't help. You see unlike the other Kunoichi who become larger and larger with the more chakra they have, Kushina decided to go a different path so instead of being extremely huge like Tsunade she used seals to be able to control how big she became. Which resulted in her current appearance which was that of a 7 and a half foot Amazon goddess, her muscles were big but were toned allowing her to keep a femanine look with her breast being a large f-cup size which were strong but were also soft at the same time. Though despite being smaller that doesn't mean she is weaker in fact she maybe even stronger than if she became extremely huge instead since all of the muscle mass she should have got was instead compressed and condensed to her smaller frame making the strength of her muscles even stronger. To him there was no doubt in his mind that she is able to pull off the strong but sexy look perfectly but it's because it's his mother that is making him aroused that caused him to act the way he is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He doesn't know how to feel after all he was actually sexually aroused by his own mom and doesn't know how to handle it. Unfortunately he has another schedule training session with his mother in a few minutes and if he doesn't show up on time his mother will come look for him and drag him back home where she will be even more punishing in there session than usual. He sighed and got up and prepared to get going or risk his mom come looking him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He learned, to his horror, that mating season was a week away and he had completely  forgotten about it! <br>\r\nWhy he would be worried about such a thing is simple. In this world of shinobi chakra has the side effect of making women grow very large and insanely strong to the point where most men can't possibly compete. The other reason is that at some point in humanity's history the human female has evolved to periodically enter a state of  heightened fertility and vastly increased sexual appetite due to hormonal triggers. The side effects of all of those hormones flooding their systems are a loss of inhibition , heightened aggression, and all rational  thought becoming compromised .<br>\r\nWhat all of this added up to was that once a year  every woman essentially would become wild sex crazed beasts the think only of satiating their insatiable lust. And to top it all off, this entire ordeal will last for two,three,even four months. <br>\r\nNormally everyone in the village  would have prepared for this event months in advance but Naruto had been so concerned about passing His graduation exam that it completely left his mind and now he has had to scramble in order to make up for lost time.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Naruto reached into his left pocket and pulled out a crumpled  up wad of paper and unfolded it. It was a list of the remaining supplies  he had to acquire before his make shift bunker was ready. He prayed he could get everything in time, he has heard stories of men being caught out in the open during mating season and being violated by berserk women, many of them being fucked to the point of dehydration or until they just broke, and even the ones who survived have had to deal with the aftermath  of  the entire ordeal , these thoughts sent shivers down the Blondes spine. <br>\r\nRealizing  that he wasting time just lying around Naruto proceeded to continue on his quest  at getting  supplies, he did not want to be out in the open when this whole thing began. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Other than that, there was a shelf area for food and hygiene products, along with reusable dishes for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking one last look behind him, to make sure that no one saw him or his bunker and making sure that the cost was clear, Naruto then carried all of his supplies into the bunker, but then suddenly a net from underneath him quickly sprang up and ensnared the surprised Uzumaki boy, Naruto seeing he was inside the net he began to struggle to get loose as he knew what this meant, someone knew where his hiding place was and he was now struggling with more vigor to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Naruto struggled, he then heard a sound that he was hoping to avoid hearing for this whole season...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even in his current predicament Naruto couldn't help but stare at the colossal Beauty before him.<br>\r\nStanding at nearly Thirteen feet tall she struck a rather  Imposing figure , further exaggerated by her massive muscles and ridiculous hourglass figure  that took up his entire field of vision from within the net. The first thing  he noticed about her was  the fact that she was in her underwear and only her underwear. It was a rather plain set all things considered , it was just an ordinary white bra with a pair of white panties. However they were stretched across her immense curves to the point that they left nothing to the imagination. The second thing he noticed was  that her face( once she bent over enough to see it without being obstructed by her boobs) the visage of manic , nigh animalistic lust and sexual hunger typical of all women  during this time of year. The last thing he noticed was the smell. It was a dense  musky cocktail of pheromones and her own arousal so thick he felt himself  gagging on it! He could also feel himself, to his horror,  getting painfully Hard  as a result. <br>\r\nNaruto gulped audibly. \u201cThis is it\u201d Naruto thought to himself \u201cthis is how I die\".  Naruto redoubled his efforts to break free, thrashing about in the net. <br>\r\nMeanwhile  Hinata  looked upon her captive  as one would a piece of meat, hungry to indulge herself and satiate the burning ball of need within her core.<br>\r\nNormally Hinata is a very shy and reserved girl, not really wanting to stand out of the crowd despite being bigger than most girls her age, but not today. Today she finds herself deep in the throes of heat, her system being bombarded by  hardy mixture of hormones that ramped up her sex drive and sexual instincts to the point that they override all rational thought.  <br>\r\nOne of Hinata\u2019s hands   went to  her left breast  to rub it down  while the other went down the front  of her panties to do the same to her thumb sized clit.  Hinata  moaned loudly as she masturbated right in front of Naruto, causing him to pause.  The boy looked on in morbid fascination ,and arousal, as the giant before him jilled off with reckless abandon, too consumed by lust to care who saw her.<br>\r\nOne thing  Naruto has noticed about his classmate is that, for reasons he did not understand, she was always  the first person to gun for him at the start of the season as well as ( without fail) the first person to find him whenever he slips ups, a fact he is currently kicking himself for forgetting.  As Naruto  watched his would be captor she  decided to speak. <br>\r\n \u201cN-Naruto * haaaa* kun\u201c  Hinata gasped. \u201c I-I-I want you sooooooo\u2026bad!\"  The colossal kunoichi  began to speed up her menstruations, her panties becoming absolutely drenched with her juices, some of which streaked down her tree trunk thighs.  <br>\r\nThe musk returned again even stronger than before. Naruto's eyes began to water, he'd swear he could  taste the pheromones at this point. To make matters worse, the smell was having interesting effects on his body, filling him with his own powerful surge of arousal. He had to fight back the urge to cum for he knew from experience that it would only make his situation worse.<br>\r\nSuddenly and without warning, the white eyed giantess reached out with one powerful  hand and lifted it and its occupant up into the air and  brought it to her face.<br>\r\nNaruto was really  panicking now.  The heat addled teen was getting  ready to take him back to her home or even ravish him right on the spot! He had to do something.<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hinata chan don't do this!\u201d Naruto pleaded, hoping to reach what rationality she had left in her.<br>\r\n\u201cY-You don't really  want to do this! It\u2019s the heat talking!!\u201d Naruto shouted with even more urgency.<br>\r\nHe was getting really desperate now. He could  still recall the horror stories of men being caught by women  in heat and being raped endlessly, sometimes even to the point of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hinata was panting  even harder now that the object of her desires was so close.<br>\r\nHowever for the briefest of moments some deep part of her hormone clouded mind registered her prisoners words.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked down  past her mountainous bosom  at the cowering boy in the net and just stood there and stared at him for what felt like an eternity. Suddenly recollection and awareness  sparked in her mind as lucidity returned her as though someone turned lights on in her head.<br>\r\nShe recoiled in  horror  at what she had done and immediately dropped the  poor boy on his rear.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Naruto  are you okay!?\u201d Hinata shouted, worry  seeping through her voice <br>\r\nNaruto  groaned as he rubbed his bottom in pain but was overall just glad that his gambit payed off. <br>\r\n\u201cH-Here let me get you out of this.\u201d Hinata  knelt down and proceeded  to rip the net open as though it were soggy  wax paper and then ,with a single hand, effortlessly pulled the boy up on his feet , startling him in the process.  <br>\r\n\u201cThanks  for getting me out.\" Naruto  sighed with relief.  \u201c I thought I was a goner for sure that time.\u201d The aspiring  ninja had plenty of close calls over the years but this was the closest one yet.<br>\r\n\u201c I'm just glad you snapped out of it when you did\" Naruto said while smiling up at his former captor.<br>\r\nHe had had to really  crane his neck just to meet the Heiress's gaze, she was quite  large for her age even by most female standards.<br>\r\nThe girl in question  looked  down at the boy with a mixture of guilt and shame.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I hate this!\u201d Hinata  shouted in frustration as she placed  both hands on her face.<br>\r\n\u201c It's like this every year! Every woman loses control over all of their faculties and hunt down their friends ,family,and even  complete strangers Just to feed this Stuipid insatiable lust we're all cursed with and the only thing men can do is run and hide!\u201d Hinata  was starting to get emotional at this point. She couldn't deal with the absurd unfairness of it all.<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn't help that not only am I one of the hardest I'm also the first person that goes crazy and ahead of schedule at that!\u201d Hinata was whimpering at this point, overcome with emotion.<br>\r\n Hinata looked down at the boy with glistening eyes. \u201cThe worst part about all this.\u201d Her voice  hitched in her throat. \u201c I  know that I\u2019m the one who harasses you the most and there's nothing I can do to stop it!\u201d  It was then  that damn finally broke and the girl began to cry. <br>\r\nShe wondered why things were the way they were, why everyone had to live like this. I just wasn't  fair!<br>\r\nHinata was sobbing openly now and Naruto could only look on with pity.<br>\r\nThe blonde reached up as high as could , which  was her outer thigh just below her hip, and placed  a hand on the distraught girl.  She looked down  to find her crush smiling up her.<br>\r\n\u201c It's okay Hinata I\u2019m not mad.\u201d Naruto  said in an attempt  to cheer the crying Amazon up.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry about.\u201d <br>\r\nHe meant it to. He knew that the women couldn't help the way they get around this time of year so he harbored no hard feelings or resentments toward them despite the rough housing.<br>\r\nHinata paused her waterworks to give the boy an incredulous look.<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d asked Hinata , shocked at how forgiving the boy was.<br>\r\n\u201cI've hunted you down, Chased you across the countryside, broken into your home and molested you, and now I've restrained you against your will and compromised your only sanctuary from this nightmare. I almost RAPED you!\u201d Hinata  emphasized that last statement. She was completely befuddled by how anyone in his position would so willing to console someone who has actively hounded him across  the region and endangered his well being on and annual basis. <br>\r\nAll the boy did was shrug his shoulders in response. \u201c It is what it is.\u201d He said almost wistfully.<br>\r\n\u201c You're a girl. It's been this way for as long as anyone can remember and feeling  sorry about it isn't going to change that.\u201d Naruto  took a second to readjust his clothes and smooth out any wrinkles.<br>\r\nHe looked meaningfully into Hinata's eyes. \u201c I'm not going  to judge someone for something they literally can't control. \u201d he'd be a hypocrite otherwise Naruto mused to himself. <br>\r\nNaruto smirked up at her.  \u201cBesides. I've yet to be caught during the season and I have yet to start now!\u201d he boastfully exclaimed, showing the girl his spirit has not been  dampened in the slightest.<br>\r\nHinata  stopped  crying  at this point, though  she still sniffled here and there, and smiled at her friend, touched by his attempt make her feel better. She was amazed at the boy's ability to bounce back from trying situations. It was one of the reasons she fell in love with him she remembered.<br>\r\nHinata wiped the tears from her eyes. \u201c T-Thank you Naruto-kun.\u201d Hinata said with emotion filling her breast. They basked in the moment for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was  at this moment Hinata  was overcome by an intense spike arousal, causing her to double over.<br>\r\nShe fell to her knees with a loud thud, causing the ground beneath her to shatter under her mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hands went to her crotch, clamping down on her aching pussy as a white hot ball of need filled her core to the brim, growing stronger and stronger by the moment.<br>\r\nNaruto rushed to the Amazonian teen's side. \u201c H-Hinata?\u201d Naruto said with visible worry etched on his face. <br>\r\nHinata  met the boy's  gaze, Her own face baring a bizarre mixture of  terror and arousal. \u201cN-N-Naruto m-my heat.\u201d Hinata clenched her eyes shut and scrunched her face with visible strain as she felt her  nethers spasm with pleasure, her already soaked panties becoming further drenched from her own love juice. <br>\r\n\u201c I-Its come back even stronger! I-I can feel it overtaking me.\u201d Hinata shuddered when  she noticed just how good he smelled. <br>\r\nShe gave  Naruto a pleading look. \u201c O-Oh god p-please run!  Run before it's to late!\u201d Hinata  begged, moaning as she did.<br>\r\nNaruto was torn. He knew he should escape but he also didn't want to leave his friend to suffer alone like this.  Naruto took a moment to  consider his options. <br>\r\nEventually  he came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly one of the Tentens had quickly grabbed the blonde Uzumaki and then lifted him over her head and began to rapidly spin him around at an extremely fast speed, then she threw Naruto only to be caught by another Tenten and she then threw him onto the floor with a smile on her face, then she had Naruto crouched forward and had him tuck his legs in until he looked like a ball and then the Tenten kicked him in his butt sent him flying again, only to be caught by the last Tenten and she then threw Naruto back onto the floor and then began to simply lay herself down right on top of him, making sure that Naruto got to feel the front of her body all over, Naruto was now blushing immensely as he felt Tenten's large breasts and muscles right on top of his small body and he felt all of her muscles against his body and her breasts where in his face, Naruto even felt himself get an erection from this, much to his shame and Tenten's joyful pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she stood up and dispelled her clones. \"Have to admit, you're a durable little thing, Naruto....perfect!\" she chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT! Tenten! Please...don't! Let me go! I-I mean...it's not even...you know...time yet!\" Naruto begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.

As Tenten had her chosen mate at her mercy, she was using her powerful legs around his neck and squeezing him with a vice like grip as she watched Naruto pointlessly attempt to break free from her legs, she saw that he was running out of air as she saw her legs wear him out as he was now tapping against her thighs with any force behind them until he had fully passed out from the lack of air and exhaustion was when Tenten had FINALLY released him from her legs and claimed her prize, a true fighter to the end, she was happy to have claimed Naruto as her mate. But just before she went back into the village, Tenten looked at Naruto's bunker and crushed it under her foot before she carried her mate back to the village, Naruto's bunker would no longer be of any use to any male who was ever smart enough to come out of the village anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto awoke he found himself...</span></div></div>",

Before you even open your eyes the first thing that comes back to you is the ability to hear. Where before it would be some kind of droning white noise, the noise begins to clear and become more and more coherent and less echoey until it is fully restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point your sense of feeling comes back and you try to move. It is only at that point when you try and fail due to the recent rebooting of your motor skills that you become aware that your eyes are fully open and that the reason you could not see was because you were readjusting your eyes to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fate that met one Naruto Uzumaki upon his reawakening. With a groan, the world came back. He felt dizzy from his encounter with Tenten in the forest outside of the village and he then noticed that he was in some kind of room. He was about to try to escape when he saw that nobody was in the room with him, until he noticed that he couldn't move his arms and legs and that was when he saw that he was now laying on his back on a cold metal table with leather straps already wrapped around both of his wrists and ankles and were already tightened. With no other choice, Naruto decided to have a look around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looked like a operating room, so Naruto had guessed that he was in the hospital as he saw that there was only one way in/or out, the double doors and Naruto also saw some smaller tables covered in sheets which he could guess had surgical equipment underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he saw some scrolls in the room and brush cases and ink bottles, '<i>So... I'm either in the Hospital or in the Sealing chamber of the T&amp;I building... but the <b>REAL</b> question is... why am I here?</i>' Naruto thought to himself as this didn't seem to make any since to him, Tenten had him in her grasp and yet she's nowhere to be around and he's all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrapped to a table sure, but still Naruto could think of a way to escape if he could free his arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Naruto felt everything shake and he already knew what that meant, a female was coming, so deciding to pretend to be still asleep, Naruto closed his eyes and acted like he was asleep as he then heard the doors open and he heard the sounds of giant feet walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tenten entered the room, she wasn't alone as she was followed by Tsunade's apprentice Shizune who was taller than Tenten by a couple of feet but she had more muscle mass compared to the younger girl and when they both entered the room Naruto was in they noticed that Naruto was still asleep... or that's what he wanted them to think, as both Shizune and Tenten both knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNudging the younger girl, Shizune grinned. Going over and picking up some of the dry brushes used for sealing. Going over to Naruto, the short haired medic looked down at him fondly before passing one of the brushes to Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten looked confused until Shizune put her own brush to Naruto's side and moved it up and down along his ribs. Naruto jerked in reaction to the stimuli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes meeting, the two kunoichi grinned at one another and they both took their brushes to Naruto's sides, going up and down from waist to pit and back over and over again as their soon-to-be little guinea pig struggled...this was getting fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a while, but eventually, Naruto couldn't take anymore tickling and soon he burst into a laughing fit as the two women continued to tickle him for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after Naruto's tickle torture was over, Shizune then looked over Naruto, \"Now that your fully \"awake\" now Naruto-Kun, I believe you want some questions answered, well lucky for you I'm in control of my body for now... so I'll try to explain everything as best as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, the mating season brings a lot of risks and issues for both sides. The issues the males have during mating season is that they are afraid of the women who come searching for men to mate with and they flee and/or hide for their lives as to not get captured and killed by the women during the months the mating season takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor women, the human female has evolved to periodically enter a state of heightened fertility and vastly increased sexual appetite due to hormonal triggers. The side effects of all of those hormones flooding their systems are a loss of inhibition , heightened aggression, and all rational thought becoming compromised. What all of this added up to was that once a year every woman essentially would become wild sex crazed beasts the think only of satiating their insatiable lust. And to top it all off, this entire ordeal will last for two, three, even four months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, he knew all of this already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to fix those issues. To reduce the dangers. So I enlisted Tenten's help. Luckily, she had already caught you. We are sorry about how you were brought here by the way...but we need you to carry out some...experiments for us.\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Naruto yelped, \"You're gonna experiment on me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some seals, Naruto-kun.\" Shizune clarified, \"The first seal is a way to either enlarge or reduce muscle mass at will as a way of making the males last longer since they aren't getting crushed by such hulking women. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the second seal enhances a male's durability, meaning that women can have more fun with men without holding anything back and all the males would need is a good rest, and maybe a good meal and bath, after having their \"mating\" sessions and they'll be fresh and ready to go at it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...I get it, but...\" Naruto trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skeptical. I Don't blame you, Naruto-kun. So...which seal are you up to helping us with first?\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had to have a moment to think this over, he knew this could help everyone, but for some reason deep down inside him, these two seals that Shizune was planning on using on him sounded too good to be true... but he knew he had to pick one either way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then looked at both Shizune and Tenten who were waiting anxiously for his choice, but they didn't have to wait for much longer as Naruto looked at them both, \"I'll test the...\"</span></div></div>",

He felt that making sure that men being to endure an encounter with a woman in heat at all was the most important thing that should be taken care of first.<br>\r\nThe Blonde ninja had always dreamed of what it would be like to be able to get intimate with a girl during this time of year without  having to worry about getting crushed under their sheer mass or getting snapped like a twig when said partner forgets her strength in the heat of the moment.<br>\r\nIf this experiment worked, no man would ever need fear the mating season again! and most importantly, he would essentially have access to an endless smorgasbord of towering bountiful beauties who are all chomping at the bit to bed any and every guy they lay their eyes on.<br>\r\nThe very thought almost caused the hyper active ninja to drool , he already had an idea of the girls he wanted to get with first .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune gave the boy a knowing smile at his response, guessing accurately what  his intentions were.<br>\r\n\u201cI see someone's enthusiastic.\u201d The  Hokage's aid said with a degree of smugness in her voice.<br>\r\nShe would then explain the procedure to the boy in great detail. The jutsu utilized a very experimental and unbelievably powerful application of Yin-Yang release to essentially negate the reality of the target sustaining any damage or trauma whatsoever. This was made possible through extensive research on the properties of the  Uchiha clan's Dou jutsu alongside the exploitation of many different techniques pulled  straight from the forbidden archives which gave them the ability to \u201cmacgyver\u201d the entire process.<br>\r\nit's execution was the very soul of simplicity. All one had to do was form the necessary hand signs and channel some chakra. The  tricky part was making all the different components mesh together in the way you wanted and how you wanted it. One miscalculation in how everything was balanced could result in the opposite effect taking hold or worse, in the target\u2019s complete erasure from existence.<br>\r\nFortunately for our ramen loving hero, the sannin apprentice had tested the seals extensively for any and every kind of bug or glitch  that could potentially crop up.<br>\r\n With all the preparations taken care of it was Time preform the experiment.<br>\r\n\u201c Alright everyone.  Moment of truth.\u201d Shizune turned to face the  aspiring ninja. <br>\r\n\u201cYou ready Naruto kun?\u201d she asked the boy with a look that said this was his only chance to back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply nodded in affirmation, he wasn't about to pass up the chance this good.<br>\r\nThe Jonin woman smiled at the daring young man and got into a stance.<br>\r\n \u201c this might tingle a bit\". <br>\r\nThe towering woman proceeded to weave a series of hand signs faster than an untrained eye could hope to perceive before ending in a praying posture. <br>\r\nA few moments passed by with nothing notable happening, Naruto wondered if something  went wrong.<br>\r\nHis fears were put to rest when  he saw the attendant's body become wreathed in a brilliant green glow that illuminated everything in the room. <br>\r\n The elder kunoichi then had both of her massive hands hover over her test subject's body for a few moments before pulling them back , with the glow dissipating immediately after.<br>\r\nShizune opened her eyes  and let out a sigh. \u201c there! That should do it!\u201d the sannin\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9  stated happily.<br>\r\nThis left the young man confused. \u201c Wait. That was it?\u201d Naruto asked incredulously as he was released  from his  restraints, he rubbed his wrists from the soreness of having been bound so tight. <br>\r\nThe Medical ninja just nodded her head in response. \u201c Yep! That's all there is to it! What? Were you expecting something different.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched the back of his head. \u201c Well I just thought\u2026 It would be, you know...... more grandiose with the way you described it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune simply shrugged and started rummaging through a bag she bought with her and pulled out a stethoscope. The  instrument elicited a shiver from the blonde genin as it pressed against his bare skin.<br>\r\n  Satisfied with whatever she was looking for, she grabbed the boy wrist and lifted his arm as though to study it for anything that was amiss. Naruto briefly noted, with a gulp, how the older woman's hand was large enough to completely  wrap around his entire forearm effortlessly.<br>\r\nThis continued poking and prodding went on for several minutes until the attendant decided to stop and pull out a significantly scaled up clipboard.<br>\r\n\"How do you feel right now? Any pain? Do you feel stronger?\u201d the serious minded woman asked in a professional and clinical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his shoulders to work out any kinks he may have gotten when he was dragged in here against his will.<br>\r\n\u201cI don't feel like I've gotten any tougher\u201d the orange clade genin looked down at his hands when he said this. \u201c if anything, I feel the same as I always have.\u201d<br>\r\nShizune was writing down every word the young man was saying on her clipboard, responding with an \u201cI see.\u201d To his observations.<br>\r\nNaruto jumped up to his feet and started performing some rather athletic maneuvers in order to test his body for any changes, though he couldn't see anything different with it.<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we see if it worked?\u201d Naruto asked as he finished testing his body.<br>\r\nIt was then that Tenten got up from where she was sitting  and approached  her classmate with a rather mischievous glint in her eyes that set alarm bells off in the boy's mind. <br>\r\nThe hulking girl grinned a menacing grin before stating her plan.<br>\r\n\u201c There's really only one way to find out now is there?\u201d<br>\r\n  In that  moment, the towering kunoichi pulled a summoning scroll from out of nowhere and activated it's power, releasing a large puff of smoke that fill the room. <br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, the girl could be seen carrying a comically oversized hammer with a head several times larger the orange clad ninja's entire body in her hands, a look of sadistic glee appeared on the bun haired girl's face.<br>\r\nNaruto's face paled at the sight, for he immediately knew what the girl's intentions were and began to plead for mercy.<br>\r\n\u201cN-Now let's talk abo-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTOO LATE!!\u201d the weapon smith shouted before swinging the \u00fcber mallet directly into his body at full force, causing the boy's body to crash through the walls of the building until he was flung bodily outside and physically embed into the pavement.<br>\r\nShizune scolded the younger kunoichi Harshly before appearing before Naruto's side in a burst of speed.<br>\r\nWith one arm, the Amazonian woman pulled the boy up to his feet.<br>\r\n\u201c Oh my gods! Naruto are you ok!?\u201d Shizune shouted in concern for the boy's health.<br>\r\nTo everyone ,especially Naruto's, surprise he was completely unscathed! It was as though he was never hit in the first place.<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! It actually worked!\u201d wonder and astonishment filled him to the brim as countless new possibilities played out in his mind.<br>\r\nShizune  breathed out a sigh of relief when she saw the boy's energetic response before turning around to give The weapon specialist a very harsh glare.<br>\r\nTenten for her part had the decency to look a embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry. I got a little carried away.\u201d The younger kunoichi apologized sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later and everyone was back in the building.<br>\r\nShizune, after putting the young man through a couple more tests, felt satisfied with the results and prepared to move on to the next phase of the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we now that the durability seal works, what should we test next?\u201d the medical ninja inquired from the blonde shinobi. <br>\r\nNaruto pondered on his next course of action\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it had shown, his trainings were each more intense than the last and he had already given up on wearing shirts, stripped down to only tight shorts for that matter, nothing was able to contain his muscular body and he would rather flaunt it than try to cover, after all he was loving it: he may not be the most powerfull ninja around but he sure was among the buffest now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising his partner had stopped, Akamaru started running back towards Kiba. For some reason, Akamaru had been affected with similar muscle growth, Shizune said that it was unheard of, but seeing the bond the Inuzuka clan had with its dogs, she said their growths must be syncronized, so they paid no mind to the behemoth of a dog Akamaru had become to continue transporting Kiba`s 300 lbs weight on his broad back. Seeing his friend a bit ahead, Akamaru slowed down and laid in a tree`s shadow to watch and discover why he had halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pushed away the sweat cascating down his brow with the back of his hand and, as he noticed the large vein snaking down his bicep, he took the oportunity to flex a little, first making the mountain of his right bicep hulk up in shreded twin peaks, excited in seeing his size, he joined his left arm in an outstanding 25+ inches double bicep flex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe venture that followed could only be described as an intense session of self adoration, alpha induced muscle show, with Kiba flexing every muscle group, to the top of his thick shoulders in an explosive crab position to his lower muscle groups, which were perhaps even more bulky and shreded than his upper half, his hairy quads engorged from the training rolling to his movements and tensing over and over, shining with sweat and lower still, his calves, which normally were the doom of muscle builders, were the size of veiny softballs. Even his shorts seemed about to burst its manly contents onto the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Kiba breathed deeply and finished in yet another double bicep pose, grinning triumphally he opened his eyes again and saw that he had attracted quite a large crowd of drooling and flustered girls and some boys. One of these amazed boys was Rock Lee, who even thought was maybe as huge as Kiba, he relutanctly noticed, seemed to not notice this, the naive teen was still fully dressed in his stretchy skin-tight dark green bodysuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Large biceps flexed from long arms leading to huge boulder shoulder. Thick traps connected those to a swollen neck. Below huge pecs rose and fell with every breath as 8 pack abs flexed along with it. A small waist connected that to huge thighs almost as thick as the waist themselves. Large calves swollen with veins and muscle led to huge size 14 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, this Naruto was no mere boy. He was a man in the prime of his life. And what a prime, for between these massive thighs was a cock that could only be called monstrous. 16 inches of thick musky man meat stood straight ahead from his body. Veins swollen along its form feeding it blood so it could stand as a monument to sex. Regular women would flee in fear of this towering behemoth, it was a good thing that ninja women could handle it easily with chakra empowering them even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't always like this though. At one point he could even have been called shrimpy. However, a secret jutsu he had created had turned a normal fit young man into a towering behemoth of lust and muscle. The ero kami no jutsu he had called it for it gradually turned men into studly beasts that could only be called sex gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had created at after the end of the war, no longer content with just being fit. He wanted to be huge, but knew it would take years and chakra tended to make you slimmer. Instead he had gone to Chouji and, grateful for all he had done during the war, Chouji taught him the basics for the Akimichi's jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it, he was able to change it to create a permanent way to increase a man's size and strength. He had used himself as an experiment confident that his healing factor would take care of any mishaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first week, results started showing. Abs tightened, biceps grew, dick grew bigger. He was living a man's fantasy and decided to share it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe taught all his friends: Chouji first since he gave him the basics to create the jutsu in the first place, Sasuke, Shikamaru, Kiba, Kakashi, every guy he knew.</span></div></div>",

Of course when you looked this good even you'd want to fuck yourself. And what do you know, Naruto could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForming the crossing seal of his most useful technique Naruto created a shadow clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother very muscular, well hung stud appeared in a flash of smoke. Just as muscular and just as sexy as his master. They kissed each other, one sex god to another, before the clone started moving down. His kisses were like sparks of fire as they went from neck to pecs before stopping at Naruto's nipples. With one hand, he groped a pec while his mouth grazed the other's nipple. His other hand went from muscle to muscle, groping and feeling up each huge muscle. From his muscular back, to his tight abs, his big booty, to his bigger than his head thighs, his hand roamed. The clone moved on from Naruto's pecs to his delicious abs. He traced each block, salty as sweat moved down his body. But the real prize was under even these masterpieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto only pointed to his throbbing cock and spoke one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone got done on his knees and worshipped the huge cock. He drew his tongue along the many veins of the cock, tracing them in saliva while giving occasional long licks up the bottom of the cock. He struggled a bit with the over developed head but sucked and licked it with passion. Strong, thick fingers massaged what parts of the cock he could reach, his fingers barely fitting around the massive meat stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh\" Naruto groaned. \"Now lay down.\" The clone lowered himself down on the floor. Slowly so that Naruto could move with him and keep the cock in his mouth. Naruto twisted around the clone's face until he was facing the clone's body. He took another few seconds appreciating the sight of a blond, handsome, muscular stud servicing his cock. His throat being stretched by his over developed endowment. Sweat traveling a sexy path down huge pectorals into a set of ripped 8 pack abs before traveling down onto a copy of his own pride and joy. Naruto's was just as hard as he was. The clone enjoying servicing the sex god as much as he enjoyed being serviced. Naruto decided to reward it, and himself since he would get its memories, by going down on it as well.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey moved with power and force against each other, two hulking hunks 69'ing. After a few minutes of cock sucking, they blew large loads on each other. Their bara bodies painting their chests white with seed. Still their mega cocks stayed hard, ready to go another round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then prepared the clone for an assfucking of a lifetime, after all, he wouldn't want him to pop just as he started. A bottle of lube prepared on a nightstand was opened and fingers were coated in it swiftly. One by one, fingers were added to the clone's ass stretching it out to even hope of being able to survive his huge cock. When the clone was stretched out enough and Naruto's cock given a generous amount of lube, Naruto slowly entered between the globes that had become his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, fuck yeah.\" Even with the lube it is a tight fit, but that just makes it better. The tight warm heat surrounds Naruto's cock and he loses all control. He starts fucking the clone wildly, 16 inches quickly moving in and out of the big booty,.His abs and thighs flexing with each powerful thrust. Almost 10 minutes of brutal fucking later, Naruto finally cums as the clone fades into smoke. It had only lasted enough to let him cum again, not able to handle the power of his thrust and the force of the orgasm. With it the pleasure the clone experienced, comes rushing into his head. He lazily lays down onto to the bed, riding the waves of pleasure the memories bring.</span></div></div>",

He loved the salty mix of his spunk and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he had to get cleaned up and head out for his date with Hinata. He'd unloaded his balls so he would be able to focus on the date with her. He went into the bathroom and turned on the warm water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere came the negative part of being such a hulking hunk. He had to enter the shower carefully, it wasn't really meant for someone with his build in mind. He'd been thinking of getting it replaced soon anyways. Another negative was that he couldn't reach portions of his back. It was too wide and his arms couldn't bend far enough to reach parts. He had to create a clone just to wash it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up he got dressed in his new looser jumpsuit before heading out to meet Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he meet her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And if there were some hungry, lustful looks mixed in as well; he didn't mind those at all. In fact he gave a little flex of his arm and grinned at the nosebleeds he caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pulled the curtain to Ichiraku and found Hinata waiting for him by his favorite seat. She was wearing a more sultry version of her own sweater and pants combo. Netting over her cleavage gave people a peak while her pants framed her butt nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Naruto-kun.\" She greeted and hugged him. Well, tried. His bulk meant she could barely touch his back, not that she was complaining. Her shyness had died down after they'd started dating.

Anyways, what can I get you two lovebirds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'd like 5 bowls of miso and 10 bowls of pork.\" Naruto ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And I'd like 3 bowls of chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for their food, they talked about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto had swelled in size from the ero kami justu, other things had swelled too. His lust for one, he seemed to get horny far too easily and often. His cock was practically hard half time, good thing for the henge. He also was getting turned on by both women and men. He had realized he now appreciated the beauty in power and the loveliness of strength. He realized he was bisexual not long after he had gained 100 pounds of muscle and was appreciating seeing men transform under his jutsu. He still appreciated women though, the hypnotic jiggle of breasts and the beauty of a gorgeous face turned him on just as well as a masculine face with hard pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that had swelled was his ego, a dark seed of narcissism planted itself in the man and grew as he transformed into a hulking beast of muscle. He was getting arrogant and even a little bit cocky, but who could blame him. He was the hero of the shinobi world and now had a body to match his power. His own body turned him on and when he was alone his lust grew until he could stand it no more and had to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto gazed at the results of his jutsu in the mirror, a simple flex from his right arm started his private show for one. His left arm started tracing his body. Going from his flexed bicep to the thick tricep up into his huge cannonball shoulders. As he moved onto his huge pecs, his flexed arm moved to the side of his head, blocking most of his vision to the side. He opened up and licked from the top of his armpit to what part of his bicep he could reach. The feeling of the powerful muscle underneath driving him wild with lust. His left had groped and tweaked his nipple, the sensitive nub sending tingles through his body. He flexed his chest and watched as his pecs flexed and danced. He moved onto his abs and felt them up in various ways. He traced the individual blocks, he ran his fingers up them, he even traced his obliques and the striations they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a single finger up his huge cock, the rough calluses providing delicious friction. Still it wasn't yet time, he knew it would be even better if he worshipped his legs too. He hadn't paid as much attention to them as he had his upper body. His thighs were so thick, they made his waist look even smaller in comparison. They forced him to change his way of walking as they scarped against each other when moving otherwise. Something he appreciated was how it forced his cock forward with its sheer size taking up the space between. He'd had more than one pair of pants be torn apart by these new pair of legs. He massaged them, feeling them flex and harden into diamonds as they bulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calves were just as impressive. As slim as the rest of him once upon a time, they grew and grew until trying to get them into pants became a fool's errand. These calves had turned into to full grown bulls, almost looking like his biceps attached to his legs. His hands moved down here too, the massage turning into a full on grope. His feet were huge now. They grew with his height, providing a stable platform to handle all the extra weight. He hadn't noticed them before the change, but their new size and thickness made finding new shoes a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow appreciating his full muscular appeal, he fug into his nightstand and grabbed some oil. He spread it on his fingers and applied it around his groin. His abs and thighs popped and shined under the oil, the light reflecting and deepening his natural tan. His hips stood out in sharp relief, the lines pointing like an arrow to the true prize below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he moved onto his cock. All that, the flexing, the muscle worship, all foreplay for his titanic dick. It bulged bright red and seemingly as hard as steel. His oiled hands moved sensuously up and down his cock. Its massive super thick 16 inches ensuring even with his bigger hands there would always be more cockflesh to worship and adore. His muscles flexed bigger and stronger as his hands went up and down it.His speed picked up, but still it wasn't enough for Naruto. His overdeveloped libido craved more, so even his legs got into the action. He started thrusting into the air, desperate for more pleasure. It never seemed enough. He kept fucking his hands, the mirror showing a beast consumed with lust desperate for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after 10 minutes of this he could take no more and came onto his body and the mirror. He stumbled back until his legs met bed and he tumbled onto his back. His release left him drained of energy, so he simply lay there.</span></div></div>",

The Genin (low ranking ninja) had formed their groups a couple weeks back, and had been living very busy lives consisting of eating, sleeping, training, and completing missions  Due to their low ranking, the missions were typically basic labor, and only contained combat on occasion.  Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura were assigned to Kakashi, a group called \"Team 7\".  Sasuke and Naruto had arrived early for the daily meeting, Sakura was the last of the three to arrive, something pretty rare.  Naruto felt a deep rivalry for Sasuke, and Sasuke was the typical quiet cold type, so the two of them were often left in awkward silence when alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sakura had arrived.  Thanks to the pleasant weather, the female ninja wore a sleeveless top, and shorts.  She hopped over with a cheery smile, more energetic than usual.  Both Naruto and Sasuke's mouths dropped slightly, no wonder she was full of energy, Sakura was looking ripped!  All three of the young ninja were lacking in the muscular definition department, but Sakura was always dead last.  Now the exact opposite was true, Sakura's bare arms looked as toned as some of the 18 year old guys in the village, and her legs looked even stronger.  Feeling a little shamed, both Naruto and Sasuke managed quiet \"Hi\"s, trying to avoid any conversation that could bring up Sakura's new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the group's instructor arrived, and even he held his silence about the girl's body.  While Kakashi was much more muscular than her, he couldn't help but feel unnerved at the girl's physique.  It was greater than that of any of the other Genin.  The group were assigned to plow a farmer's rather expansive fields; luckily chakra was allowed.  Sakura's muscles bulged, and appeared even greater when gorged with blood.  After a hard day's work, the group began to head home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, Sasuke interrupted Naruto on his walk home.  \"Hey.  Let's go get some Raman, we've got stuff to talk about\" he said quietly.  Naruto was envious of the boy, but he accepted.  On their way to the Raman bar, the two boys noticed something, all of the other genin girls their age that had any skin showing were pretty ripped.  Some more than others, Sakura being one of the strongest they've seen, but it was surprising none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the bar with their soups, the duo kept their voices low.  \"Do you know what this is about Naruto?\" Sasuke asked, staring at his soup.  \"Uhhh not really!  But thanks for the Raman!\" Naruto said between gulps, downing the bowl.  \"It's about Sakura, and all the other girls\" the dark haired boy explained.  \"Oh yeah!  Sakura was really hot today!  She's been working out hard!\" Naruto said excitedly, and more loudly than Sasuke liked.  \"Keep it down Naruto.  Listen.  We're doing the exact same work as her, and yet her body looks much more muscular than mine, let alone yours\" he explained coldly.  \"Hey! What're you - \" Naruto began to yell out, but Sasuke quickly put a silencing Jutsu on him.  \"Shut up.\" he asserted.  \"Listen.  Keep your eyes open for what is making these girls so strong.  I'd hate to share their secret with you, but we need to figure this out, and together our chances will be greater\".  Naruto was getting a little aroused at thinking of Sakura's bulging arms during today's work, but realized that he'd love to have that for himself \"Ok\" he managed to muffle, and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do we progress this next?</span></div></div>",

Naruto was up late, thinking of Sakura's great shape, and imagining all of the girls in the village getting stronger.  Sasuke on the other hand was worried that he wouldn't be able to compete with Sakura, let alone any girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay came, and the genin of team 7 met up again.  Naruto and Sasuke arrived early, both with minds full of what to say to one another on the subject of the villages amazons.  Unfortunately both boys felt nervous to talk about the situation at all, and remained silent.  Sakura arrived, wearing a sleeveless top and short shorts again.  Her arms bulged even greater thanks to yesterday's physically demanding work.  \"Hey guys!\" she said enthusiastically with a smile.  Both boys uttered a quiet \"hey\".  \"Great day today, huh?  I hope we have a fun mission!  Yesterday's was a great workout though, I'm feeling stronger from it already!\" and with this Sakura flexed her right arm, and an impressive, ripped bicep rose up.  \"Wow Sakura!   You're getting really strong!  Can I feel your arm?\" Naruto asked with a huge grin on his face.  \"Uhhh...  I guess\" Sakura replied, letting the boy grab her arm.  \"It's really hard Sasuke! Check it out!\" Naruto announced, secretly feeling very aroused from feeling Sakura's arm.  \"I'll pass...\" Sasuke replied.  \"Shit.  How is Sakura getting so strong so fast?  I have to stop this or find a way to get even stronger.\" he thought to himself, feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi arrived, and announced they'd be doing more physical labor.  The group groaned, but their instructor teasingly told them it was apparently great exercise, pointing out Sakura's physique.  A sweat drop ran down the back of Sasuke's neck.  Naruto and Sakura laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the mission, Sasuke followed Naruto back home.  \"Mind if I come in?\" the dark haired boy asked his rival \"Sure, what's up?\" Naruto replied as the two stepped inside.  \"It's about Sakura.\" Sasuke said bluntly.  \"Yeah, she's getting really hot!\" Naruto said with a huge grin.  \"I just wish I could impress her\" he continued with a tinge of sadness.  Sasuke face-palmed.  He began to voice his concerns \"Look, I'm glad you find her 'upgrades' attractive, but this is going on with all of the genin, and none of the other girls in this village.\"  Naruto quickly interrupted \"This is like a dream come true!\" he yelled out \"Listen!\" Sasuke raised his voice, Naruto quickly grew silent.  \"We need to find a way to either become stronger, or make them weaker.  I suggest we seek out advice from someone knowledgeable about gaining strength.  A male.  And we should also hit up the library\"  Naruto nodded \"I won't help you make the girls weaker Sasuke, but I'll definitely look for ways to get stronger!\"  With this the two planned to meet up the next day, Saturday, a day they had off from completing missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do the two search?</span></div></div>",

I normally wouldn't believe something out of a book like this, but it also mentions entire generations of people randomly being born with an increased amount of this chakra in their body, which becomes more prominent upon puberty.  It also speaks of people with this Chakra living much longer, and continuing to be able to put on muscle their whole life.  This must be what happened, and now we can catch up!\" Sasuke said with excitement, a rare event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, the book says it only unlocks the Chakra and then encourages it to grow, increasing the development. It won't do anything for you or me because we don't have the special Chakra,\" Sasuke continued, his excitement dying down and giving way to his normal attitude. \"Still, the field of medical jutsu is extensive. I'm a bit surprised that we found even this on our first day. The fact that the technique exists at all is encouraging, especially since it's in such an old book.

He felt a chuckle come on imaging Sakura becoming even stronger then she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pink-haired crush expanding bigger, stronger, curvier\u2026he almost lost it then and there, which would have resulted in his body crashing onto the streets below as he leapt rooftop to rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part he got a hold of himself remembering that Sasuke most likely had something planned. That raven-haired jerk\u2019s probably thinking up a way to stop or reverse the muscle growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one should be above the Uchiha in power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto muttered out in annoyance believing that must be what was running through Sasuke\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo he couldn\u2019t allow that to happen much less to Sakura who he cared so much for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting that jerk Sasuke ruin Sakura\u2019s chance of being really strong maybe the strongest girl in the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing he had noticed was that Sakura did seem to have the edge so to speak as far as the girls went. There was a lot that were already developing a stronger build or were already looking pretty fit but Sakura seem to be a head above\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was in her genes and her family was blessed or maybe Sakura herself had lucked out? The passage didn\u2019t seem to mention anything about one person being stronger then the rest\u2026so who knows what the reason was in any case he held to his resolve that he had to ensure Sakura wasn\u2019t tainted by any of Sasuke\u2019s methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later he landed at top of the Haruno rooftop, gently of course so as to not alert anyone inside of his presence. He was a goofball yes but at least had some common sense when it came to some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick recall of the jutsu was all he needed although just to be safe he had written it down on a spare sheet of paper while Sasuke wasn\u2019t looking. Sneaking over to a window Naruto spied Sakura come in not sure if wither or not she was alone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did his best to fight off another chuckle Sakura was beautifully sculpted far beyond her years. No way could he allow Sasuke to prevent her from getting any stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Sakura stroked away at any loose ends in her hair, there was a part of her that pushed for it to be cut down to a more manageable level but always dismissed the thought, unaware that her blonde teammate was just outside her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had to do this secretly\u2026then again what if he just came out and told Sakura what Sasuke was potentially planning? Maybe she\u2019d give him a chance and stop gushing over the same boy that was trying to impede on her muscle growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard choice but regardless he had to make one soon.</span></div></div>",

Naruto nodded to himself, set on his course of action and prepared the technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to pause and lower his hands as another thought occurred to him. While the research that he did was sound and he'd even had Sasuke double check it so he knew the technique worked perfectly and was safe, that didn't mean that he was fully proficient in it. What if he screwed it up when he tried it? When a technique goes wrong there are two forms in which it can happen. The first is if the technique is done properly but the chakra isn't of the right amount or is improperly focused. That causes the technique to still technically \"work\" but it will just be a pathetic shadow of what it should be, only having a small fraction of the effect it was intended to have. The second is much worse, when the technique is improperly performed and all the energy that was put into it is released, causing it to literally blow up in the user's face. The amount that would go into this technique wasn't near enough to be dangerous, but it would still cause a lot of noise and smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither outcome was good for Naruto. If the first happened then he'd feel like an idiot for screwing up a technique in front of his crush, even if she wasn't watching. And the second would lead to Sakura coming out and really hitting him for making such noise outside her house. And as much as Naruto admired Sakura's strength, the thought of her hitting him like she used to was rather terrifying now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he couldn't just use the technique on Sakura right away, even secretly. He needed to practice the technique so that it would be perfect when he surprised Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away from Sakura's house and left. For now he needed to practice and for that he needs a test subject. But where to find one, after all, not everyone has that special chakra needed fro the jutsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused on a roof to consider this. 'Well, Sakura has the chakra while Sasuke and I don't. Does that mean that only girls have it?' Naruto reasoned to himself. Deciding that that was as good a place to start as any, Naruto left to find . . .</span></div></div>",

I mean it makes you confident, strong, and\u2026pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a hard blush come on after that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura simply crossed her arms around her slightly bigger chest laughing slightly as she swayed her head side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026but you\u2019re not going to woo me over just like that, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha I didn\u2019t think so, Sakura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough the two shared a brief laugh together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I think I might have something that you\u2019ll still like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter not be one of your stupid pointless jutsus\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey come on\u2026\u201d he pouted in false fashion causing her to point at him with a bit of a warning glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then went on to explain the jutsu he and Sasuke had found and because he felt she should know he added in how Sasuke was potentially looking to use to stop the numerous growths around the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to feel about that last part. Naruto was a lot of things to a lot of people but he wasn\u2019t a liar or at least wasn\u2019t known as one (most thought his dream of becoming Hokage was just crazy talk not a flat-out lie) and it was true the Uchiha clan did pride themselves on their strength\u2026of course that was prior to that \u201cincident\u201d even still however Sasuke was a Uchiha\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo she decided to push those thoughts aside and instead focus on the here and now.</span></div></div>",

Sakura then proceeded to complete push ups very quickly and easily.  \"18..19..20..\"  Suddenly the girl stopped \"You know.  Lately push ups simply haven't been cutting it\"  with that statement, Sakura put one hand behind her back and entered a one-handed push up position.  She started to complete these too at a very fast pace.  \"23...24...25...\"  she counted out loud, and her face began to turn red.

With that, Sakura flexed her right arm, and a large, solid bicep, significantly larger than earlier appeared.  \"Guess you're Jutsu did work Naruto!\"  Sakura yelled out in excitement.  Soon a nearly evil grin took over the girl's face, she began to think to herself \"And now I'm going to become the strongest in the village, and show that Ino who's boss!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

Now watch this!\"  With this statement, Sakura grabbed onto a nearby pull up bar with her right hand.

With a feminine grunt, Sakura managed to pull herself up, and then repeat the process again, this time with less effort.  She continued to pull herself up, her arm swelling slightly larger every time, until after 15 repetitions.  Sakura started to laugh at how quickly she could gain muscle, and gave her left arm 15 repetitions as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Sakura's display of power, Naruto had to sit down to prevent himself from fainting.  Sakura giggled with glee and flexed her now baseball sized biceps for him.  \"This was with one session!  Imagine how much stronger I can get.

All she was wearing was a tight black bra and workout shorts.

Naruto felt himself begin to sweat from arousal and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright champ, I want you to punch my stomach as hard as possible!\"  Sakura exclaimed with a huge grin on her face.  \"Uh..

Before he could even open his mouth, she reassured him \"Yes, I'm ready, hit me with your best shot!\".  With this statement, Naruto raised his right arm and slugged her in the stomach.  A loud smacking noise occurred and Sakura winced a little \"Come on wimp! Harder!\"  the girl yelled out, trying to hide her pain.  Naruto collected himself and hit her at nearly full force.  The noise was louder, and it hurt more, but Sakura was persistent \"I said harder!  Don't hold back!\" she yelled in his face.  A bit of anger overcame Naruto and he hit her full force.  Sakura smiled as she felt the pain \"Again!\"  she yelled \"Keep doing it!\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she commanded, Naruto began to wail on her midsection.  With every single hit the slapping sound grew louder, and Sakura felt less pain.  After a dozen punches, both young adults realized that Sakura's abs were getting harder from the pressure, and she began to moan in pleasure with every hit.  After a few dozen hits, Sakura could barely feel it at all, and Naruto's knuckles were on the verge of bleeding.  The boy stopped, and collapsed to catch his breath.  \"Looks like the hidden leaf village is about to have a new strongest!\"  Sakura said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what?</span></div></div>",

He had some difficulty looking past his enormous pecs, but he could recognize that head of bright red hair. His beautiful wife, Kushina Uzumaki, had decided to wake him up with one of her lovely blow jobs. She had trouble fitting his huge cock in her mouth, but that wasn't going to stop her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 500 pounds of solid ripped muscle, Minato Namikaze was the current result of a breeding program started long long ago to build a powerful and dominating warrior, a Shinobi. A shinobi was a soldier who could dominate a battlefield and force weaker men to surrender in fear. As the Hokage, Minato was the current strongest shinobi of the land of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shinobi's life was one of battle and strife. To prepare them, they went through vigorous training from a young age to grow up into powerful alpha males. Their muscles were enormous compared to civilians and they were said to have the strength to destroy mountains. While a bit exaggerated, there was no denying that they were giant muscle gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato himself stood at 7 feet tall and almost 4 ft wide in muscle. His neck was super thick, his traps almost swallowing it in muscle. His voice was low and husky. His shoulders could be compared to cannon balls in size. His arms were even bigger. A swollen basketball sized muscle for a bicep and an equally impressive tricep led to thick forearms that tapered into a thick boned wrist. His hands were enormous mitts with long, strong fingers. His pecs made it impossible to see his own body looking down with their size. A set of 10 pack washboard abs made a cobblestone path from his chest to his thin 32 inch waist. A bubble butt that hypnotized men and women alike swung to and fro when he walked. His legs were his favorite though. He was known as the yellow flash, for his speed on the battlefield made it look like he was simply a yellow flash passing through. He loved his speed and it showed in his legs. His thighs were enormous, comparable in thickness to the enormous trees native to Konoha. His calves were almost as big as the animal in size. His feet were almost flippers in size. Of course his body fat was low, he loved running and he made himself as hairless as he could to increase his speed. He made an exception for his head hair as his wife enjoyed running her hands through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as it was a breeding program, a shinobi must be a virile stud in the bedroom as well. Shinobi were big dicked and balled, had large orgasms and produced sperm quickly. Minato's dick was 14 inches long and almost 3 inches thick. The veins on it pushed it past 3 inches. His wife couldn't handle all of it at first, but eventually she managed through determination and obsession until it was the only cock she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake big boy\" Kushina asked as she felt Minato stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, how about a quickie before the boys wake up.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was proud of his baby boys. Naruto and Menma had just become genin and were almost 6 feet tall. At 16 years old, his twins were growing up to be fine young men. Naruto favored his biceps and wanted to take after him as the hokage and Menma favored his abs and wanted to be a  famous seduction type ninja. Naruto was dating the hyuuga heiress Hinata and Menma was currently dating the daughter of a doctor and a fitness trainer Sakura Haruno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one\" she smiles coyly as she licks up his cock. She starts to move up his muscled body, his musk filing her mind and her pussy practically dripping wet. She loved what came next. Minato caressed her body with surprising gentleness for a man so large. His deft hands quickly moved to her pussy and started preparing it for what was to come. It needed little time, already used to the ram about to batter its door. His cock slowly stretched the cunt's opening, the head thick and wet from her ministrations. When the head went in is when he stopped playing nice. With the speed he was known for he started pounding away at her pussy. Kushina screamed, any pain from the experienced long since turned to pleasure. His muscles rippled and flexed he drove his behemoth cock into her again and again and again. His sweat was a potent aphrodisiac on its own and Kushina could only cling to him and worship the muscle god that was her husband as orgasm after orgasm hits her like waves on the beach. Through it all, as her pussy squeezes and clamps at his cock Minato continues fucking her with power and speed. They make love with passion and lust, until he can't take it anymore and cums. Kushina almost passes out as the outpour of cum fills her with warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato heads to the shower and prepares to start his day. Where does he go?</span></div></div>",

They hadn't been at breakfast so they liked left earlier while he was in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was working on his chest with Menma acting as his spotter and support. Their shirts were off, their well built bodies on display. Naruto was slightly bulkier than menma, his biceps and chest visibly thicker. Menma had definition though. His abs were more defined and his hips were narrower, making the his v just as prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sons were strong maybe they could act as a decent spotter for him. Well, maybe working together, and maybe if he kept it light. With how much he lifted, even his powerful kids would be tested by just looking at a decent workout for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato waited for his sons to finish up before calling out. \"Naruto, Menma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad!\" \"Morning!\" He smiled at his children, their cheerful dispositions brightened up his days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of doing a quick workout before heading off to work. Think you two could act as my spotters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know-\" \"Of course we'll do it.\" Menma was hesitant, but Naruto was always a daddy's boy. He'd never deny Minato and Minato wouldn't deny him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll keep it light enough for you two to keep up. I'll help you a little after I'm done. I am doing legs today.\" Menma agreed shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato shed his upper robe, clad only his the loose lower robe. Once he reached the 500 pound mark, most available clothing wouldn't fit him. He wore mainly loose flowing robes while in the village, but on the battlefield all he wore was some yellow armored underwear. His muscles were too big for conventional armor and so thick they blocked most weapons anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to a leg press machine and waited as his sons practically piled weights on both sides. When the machine's bar seemed to bend under the weight, they stopped and Minato started pumping up the machine. It would seem ridiculous to an outsider how many times and how fast he moved the weight, but Minato kept doing it. Doing sets of 100, he barely felt any burn, his powerful legs handling the massive weights with ease. He enjoyed the sights of his sons looking at the power he had in awe, his ego loving the looks of envy and idolization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minato wasn't afraid to admit he was a bit nacissistic, he loved it when others looked at him like a god among men. The looks his sons were giving him may have played a part in why he chose them. His body was his pride, but he had his favorite parts. His legs and the power within in them was one. His huge cock was the other. No matter who gave him those looks he wasn't ashamed he got a little turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his sets finished, he went to one machine after another. The weights piled and the bars bent with the amount needed to give him anything close to a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he helped his sons with their lifting. Naruto was focusing on his chest and trying to keep his chest pumped and thick while evenly developed. Menma was working on his arms. He wanted them to get bigger and harder. Minato gave them a few tips and reminded them to take their supplements to help them grow.</span></div></div>",

The life she lived now wasn't something she could have predicted, but she loved it all the same. Konoha was prosperous, and even though she wasn't a native she loved it all the same. She had 2 darling boys who were growing into strong, studly ninjas. Lastly and perhaps best of all, she had a wonderful, loving, handsome, muscular, hung husband. She had also discovered she had a muscle fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking of her godly husband, she lightly ran her fingers on the edge of her well worn pussy. She had met Minato when he was just a young boy who dreamt of becoming hokage. He'd joined the shinobi program as early as he could while she had been in the kunoichi program. As men could build muscle and strength easily, shinobis had become the main fighting force while kunoichi focused on being spies and assassins. He had been nowhere near as big as he was now, but he had just the right mix of strength, skill, speed, determination, and luck to be assigned to the legendary warrior Jiriaya. Jiraiya was known for his strength, skill, and stamina; both on the battlefield and in the bedroom. He was legendary for having many lovers across the Elemental Nations and for satisfying hundreds of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a boy, Minato hadn't been very big. In comparison to some of the others he had looked almost scrawny in comparison. What he was though was defined.  His muscles hadn't been as big as the other boys, but he was strong. His muscles had stood out with high definition and he had little fat to mar his frame. His biceps had been a measly 14 inches, but were perfectly formed balls. His forearms were veiny and thick with muscular strength. His pecs were smallish squares, but with visible striations. His six pack was cut deep with feathery obliques surrounding it. A downright anemic waist led to thick, incredibly defined thighs and large, defined calves.  His leaner figure and good looks had led some to believe he would become a seduction type shinobi; shinobi who infiltrated other villages and seduced women into either defecting, committing treason, or just selling their service to wealthy people who wanted to experience the sexual dominance of a shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Jiraiya, Minato had grown at an astounding rate. He had seen something in Minato that he liked and had decided to make him his successor. Jiraiya put him under heavy training with many secret and powerful supplements designed to make him grow bigger and faster. Others would have faltered or given up under the harsh training, but Minato persevered and learned all he could. When he wasn't training his body, he was learning how to fight or how to love. For he was also learning from Jiriaya the secrets of sex and how to become a legendary lover such as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina had seen him a few times over the years and watched him grow from a boy to a man to a masterpiece forged from gods. He seemed to grow bigger and harder each time she saw him. By the time he was 18, he was 6'6\" with a physique that demanded attention from all who saw it. He had large 24 inch biceps with thick strong triceps. His forearms had stayed highly defined while doubling in size. His hands had grown large with long thick fingers that hid the tremendous dexterity he had with his fingers. His thick boulder shoulders connected to large traps that framed his neck. His pecs were large and super thick, heavy brown nipple peaked through any clothes he had while his cleavage was a few fingers deep. His 8 pack abs naturally drew eyes downward and were strong bricks. His obliques were still defined, but were now connected to a magnificent muscular back. The thick muscles made even simple motions a work of art when displayed on the canvas of his back. Some perverted women even had a hobby of watching him train just to see sweat run down his back. His ass while not as big as now was still a respectable thick booty. A full body tan left him gleaming like a bronze god when he sweat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis legs however were another story all together. Huge and super thick, they almost looked out of place even on his studly body. But Minao loved his legs most of all and trained it to grow biggest. Jiraiya let him as proper fucking techiniques required strong legs and it helped him stay fast even with all the extra muscle. His calves were bulls and thick enough that they were as big as his old waist. His feet were large and thick but defined, having grown in order to support all the extra weight. Kushina knew he loved his legs. He loved it when she worshiped his legs with licks, gropes, and oil massages. Kushina started fingering herself harder as she remembered her studly husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that they had started dating. They had met at Konoha's hot springs in the mixed bathing area. They'd felt a powerful attraction to each other and decided to have a one night stand. She left with him and lost her virginity that night. A muscle worship session led to making out and then brutal fucking that Jiraiya had taught Minato to leave her begging for more. She had struggled with his cock at first, his immense size almost too much for her pussy, but Jiraiya had taught him well and she took it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fisting herself now, the sensuous memory making her wish for his huge cock again even after he fucked her this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had started dating the week after and while Jiraiya had been disappointed by him tying himself down, he was glad his student had found love. They had the twins a few years later when Minato had been crowned hokage.</span></div></div>",

All night he had been  enraptured with a strange  vision which he wasn't sure whether it was a  dream or a nightmare. He was in the middle of his home village in the middle of the night and Darkened humanoid silhouettes surrounded him on all sides, possessing distinctly male and female features. All of them, to his embarrassment, were engaged in all manner of very intimate activities. But this wasn't  the weird part. No, the weird part was that all of the silhouettes were HUGE! More than huge, they were gigantic! The silhouettes, masculine and feminine alike, possessed unbelievably muscular frames with stupendously exaggerated sexual characteristics that towered over the buildings, most of which only came up to their waists or knees! Stranger still, he was eye level with  the giants!! He himself had grown to a monstrous size similar to the shadowy  beings  before him, he also noticed, to his growing horror, that he was stark naked. The blond ninja's hands flew to his crotch in a futile attempt at covering his shame, his cock having also grown to such ridiculous proportions that it was more like a third leg.  Naruto was completely at a loss of what to make of this situation. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he thought this, the silhouettes continued to sexually ravage each other in every conceivable way possible.  One male shaped silhouette was going to town on another,  aggressively plowing its massive tool deep in between the bulbous ass of its all too willing recipient while another one was getting spit roasted by two particularly burly participants. Naruto also saw , two his shock, one substantially large  feminine silhouette being serviced by four relatively smaller lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for the Blonde shinobi to take in. As he beheld the spectacle around him, he could feel himself get painfully erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was  once again stunned, horrified, and maybe even a little aroused by  what he witnessed.<br>\r\nHis cock swelled to inhuman proportions, becoming as thick as his profound torso and much longer than he was tall, and his balls swelled, most likely with cum, until they nearly  touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe level of arousal he felt at that moment was like nothing he ever felt before. It was beyond comprehension! So great was the sense of pure need that it actually caused him physical pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried desperately to get himself off to no avail! Even with his mighty hands, before the immense girth  of his penis, he  might as well have been a fly beating against the hide of an elephant, all the while his towering cock throbbed and pulsed  unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was becoming desperate, the sensations coming from his phallus assaulted his brain relentlessly , further compounded by the incredible tightness within his hyper engorged testicles, teasing him with the promise of blissful relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to whimper, never before had he been forced to endure an onslaught of this nature. It wasn't fair! What did he do to deserve such delectable torment The need continued to grow, eeliciting an audible moan of pleasure from the hyper active ninja. The boy was starting to reach his breaking point. He begged and pleaded for someone, anyone, to  release him from his suffering!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNaruto\u2026.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blonde shinobi\u2019s eyes shot wide open, his situation momentarily forgotten, as he wildly spun his head around searching for the source of the voice he just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho said that? Where did it come from? And most importantly, why did it sound so familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught movement in the corner of his eye  and went to face it only to stop dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant hand, bigger than even he was,  swept out of the darkness and  closed in on him! In a panic, Naruto made a mad dash away from the behemoth appendage, his  giant meat log and medicine ball sized testicles impeding his movement, but was too slow,  and was snatched up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggled heroically against his restraints. But, try as he might, he simply could not break his captor's gentle yet invincible grip.  He could only watch helplessly as he was carried through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gauged his surroundings and  noticed that the hand was attached to a truly massive and beefy arm which itself was attached to a silhouette of incomparable scale. The titanic being before him was clearly female , if it's colossal breasts were anything to go by. It  lay on its side with a leisurely and seductive posture, it was equal parts inviting and intimidating if he was being honest with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that troubled him the most was the fact that what little he could make out of its features were so very familiar  but for the life of him he just couldn't figure out why. The mysterious Titaness brought  the hapless boy closer her face, as though to appraise her catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped hard, the being seemed to radiate lust and\u2026.oh god\u2026..the smell! It was a heady musk that reeked of sex. The young shinobi felt his  cock throb even harder than before, eliciting a needy whimper from his lips.  He wasn't sure if he saw it right but he thought he saw the colossal silhouette smile at him. <br>\r\nThe titanic being brought him even closer to its face before parting its lips. Naruto was sweating buckets in  anticipation for whatever the oversexed behemoth had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in a blinding burst of speed, the Titaness shoved his oversized cock deep into her mouth and began lick the shaft as though it  were a delectable piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer pleasure Naruto felt at that moment nearly broke his mind, he was visibly screaming and moaning in ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gargantuan  being  slurped and licked at its captive's tool, it's rough tongue rubbing and twisting aggressively around his cock, it's soft lips slid tantalizingly up and down the shaft.<br>\r\nTime seemed to move at a crawl from the Blonde boy's  perspective, the constant bombardment of sensations   seemingly reduced his mind to jelly. He was sure the end was close but the mysterious seducer was far from done,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the sex hungry behemoth shoved its unwilling lover's cock down its throat all the way to the hilt. The boy released a strangled cry as the sensations were magnified a thousand fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being had quickened  its pace to  speeds that were nigh unfathomable even by the very high standards of the shinobi world.  This only served to multiply the feeling even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't take much more of this assault, he feared that his mind would shatter before the sexual beast that had ensnared him was done.  Thankfully, mercifully. He could himself start to  get closer to release. Over and over again did the hulking sex monster ravage his dick and over again could he feel the vibrations as it moan and giggled around his shaft.

The \"Vampire\" seal, which he had thankfully thought to add a paralysis matrix in to, so that the target couldn't struggle. He had had a clone apply it to himself just last night, and he was now looking for his team-mate so that he could offer it to her as well. After all, what easier way to drag Sasuke back than if he was so weak he couldn't lift himself up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a few minutes, he found her just leaving the hospital after her shift. Once there, he walked up to her, \"Hey Sakura-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see him, she smiled. \"Hey Naruto, whats up? You seem to be in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant grin on his face, he responded, \"I am. I just finished a seal I have been working one that is going to give us a big advantage in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, since she didn't know he did seal work, \"Really? What's it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allows the user to steal the strength of their opponent.\" Pride, leaking in to his voice. \"I was going to offer you the chance to have it too.

To assist in this endeavor, new and incredibly powerful jutsu and medicine had been developed to insure not only successful pregnancies but the health and safety of the populus aswell. They work by strengthening the bodies of whoever they're used on to incredible levels increasing physical size, strength, fertility, stamina, and vitality far beyond what would normally be possible aswell as integrate a multitude of contingencies and fail safes against complications. They also increase sexual appetite by a substantial margin and as a side effect, raises ones ability to amass vast amounts of chakra. The effect this had on society at large was (to say the least) great. The way people  handled and processed relationships had changed in order to conform to the new social dynamics that came about as a result. New laws  <br>\r\n had been made to deal with the potential conflicts that would arise. New organizations had been created to enforce this new mandate aswell as make it easier for the population to do their duty as citizens. And of course the ways that war is waged have been changed to take into account how people's bodies are affected by the changes even finding ways to weaponize them. The culture of the world has altered to become one where public displays of promiscuity and polyamory are of the norm and where power (both physical and sexual) is everything.</span></div></div>",

To combat this, the U.E.N have invented a revolutionary form of ninja tech in the  form of a bio organic implant/ artificial organ  that is  is surgically grafted to the hosts chakra network where, theoretically, it can then magnify their innate chakra reserves to inconceivable levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did reach a bit of a snag in their research however. They have come understand that, other than a rare few exceptions, the human body as it is now simply cannot handle  such sudden and drastic increases in power, being unable to adapt fast enough before basically exploding in a rather spectacular fashion. Their solution to this problem was to add another component to the implant that strengthens and expands the hosts body and increases its capacities and potential in direct proportion to the exponential growth of their chakra reserves. This had the side effect of turning anyone equipped with this technology towering walking behemoths of nigh unassailable strength and power. With their vast army of titanic warrior demigods in hand, humanity is poised to conquer the very heavens themselves!</span></div></div>",

As well as certain sects of men attempting uprisings agaisnt the matriarchal government, they however were easily dealt with by the eight to ten feet tall kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow where does our story in this universe start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the story begins at ninja academy, right when the girls start going through their hyper puberty, and really start drawing the attention of the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps a ninja squad sent on a mission ready to show their stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, it was just a normal peaceful day in Kanoha and we could see the average day of a the older ninja giantesses?

To keep the village military functioning in the future each boy was paired with a female of the same class to be trained as partners.<br>\r\nNaruto, while still the vessel for the fox, was just like every other boy in the village.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaving the relative safety of his home was always something that he found difficult, now however, he couldn\u2019t wait to leave and meet his partner. Since the Kyuubi\u2019s attack 12 years ago things in the village had changed greatly. Mostly in how his generations team setup went. The males of the village had found that in exchange for shrinking to such a small size, their bodies had become much more durable and resilient. Which in truth, was a good thing as many boys would have been killed by the time they reached the age of ten otherwise. Naruto was one such boy as he had been bullied for most of his short life. The things done to him had included; being stepped on, smeared into the ground under someone\u2019s foot, being stomped on, crushed, beaten, burned, dropped from great heights (at least in his eyes), and he had even been threatened to be eaten alive by one of the more cruel kunoichi in-training. As said, he would have been dead if not for the strengthened body all males seemed to have now, thankfully, Naruto normally was able to walk away from most of his <i>\u2018incidents\u2019</i> with only some broken bones and bruises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was thankful that his partner didn\u2019t seem to wish to hurt him or not willingly. She had sat on top of him more than once during his academy days but, she never seemed to be trying to hurt him. Everything that had happened to him at her hands had been a complete accident, or that\u2019s what she said. Shaking the thoughts from his mind, Naruto was able to reach the meeting spot for his team in a record breaking 10 minutes. Pretty good considering how far he lived from here as well as his height difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw that the kunoichi of his team had already arrived. Due to the change in how things in leaf were done. Girls were encouraged to enter the ninja academy as a team now consisted of three kunoichi and their male partners. Some girls would find themselves with more than one male partner. It was chosen thru a series of chakra test. Why? Well no one real knew, or at least they never gave him a real answer. Looking towards the three girls he made a run towards his. They were Ino Yamanaka, Sakura Haruno and Hinata Hyuga. Naruto allowed himself a moment to look them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was a fair-skinned girl of average height with green/blue eyes. Her most noticeable trait in her appearance is her long, platinum blonde hair, which is always seen in a high-ponytail that reaches down to her waist with bangs covering the right side of her face. She was often found wearing a pair of small silver hoop-earrings and purple, fairly revealing clothing. She wore a short purple vest like blouse with a raised collar, a skirt that was cut off on the sides and bandage on her stomach and legs. Purple and white elbow warmers could be seen around her arms, and her forehead protector was wrapped around her waist as a belt. Personality wise, she was constantly thinking about boys and her appearance, hence why she was always on some diet or another. She was very confident, kind in her own manner, and rather outspoken. She was certainly not afraid to speak her mind. Naruto had found that though she was relatively cheerful she tended to be rather bossy at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura however was quite different in her appearance. First off she had bright pink hair, then there was the large green eyes, and fair skin. Sakura was often bullied due to her rather large forehead hence her nickname of \"Billboard Brow\", due to this she wore her bangs over her forehead in an attempt to cover it, though Ino encouraged her to wear her hair back. A red qipao dress or a body-hugging one-piece Chinese dress for women, with white circular designs, with or without short sleeves, with a zipper, tight dark green shorts, and a forehead protector which she used to accentuate her face, completed the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Ino, who could be loud and bossy, Sakura was naturally hot-headed and irritable, and because of that, she tended to hit people out of anger but, most of the time, she is relatively kind, cheerful, and rational, if a bit fan-girly at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his eyes rested on the timid form of one Hinata Hyuga. Naruto would be hard pressed to not admit that Hinata was quite cute. Her dark blue hair, brushed back to a small tuff much like a swan\u2019s tail and two long bangs framing her face, made him think of a clear night sky, and the white eyes of her clan held just a tinge of lavender making them seem gentle and kind rather than the cold impassive look most of her clan had. They made him think of the full moon, gently bathing the world in its pale light. These traits, plus the creamy white skin and shy look always upon her face, made her look like a porcelain china doll but, he knew that she was stronger than most thought. She was dressed in a baggy tan jacket with white fur tuffs at the ends and a yellow circle on the outside of her jackets arms with a red tear-like flame design. Her Konoha forehead protector hung around her neck. Her pants a dark blue and standard blue ninja sandals as well as white bandages on her right thigh with a kunai case and ninja pouch over her the left side of her bum, completed her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was shy, serene, and very polite girl. Hinata was referred to as the kindest and most soft spoken girl you would ever find in Konoha. Naruto knew that she disliked competing and fighting others, mostly out of the fact that she didn\u2019t want to hurt someone. Sadly Hinata\u2019s lack of self-confidence was her only big problem but, she made up for it by being a very hard worker. Over the years he had seen that Hinata was incredibly empathetic and was rather easy to gain the trust of, if you were sincere with her. He had noticed her desire to be acknowledged and how she generally, opts to think carefully before acting. For all of these traits Hinata had his respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the girls he is happy to see that his partner noticed him and was already in the process of picking him up. After being lifted closer to head level Naruto gave his partner a happy greeting. \u201cGood morning, \u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is his partner?</span></div></div>",

It had taken every ounce of restraint training she had to not grab the boy and start jumping for joy in the middle of the classroom. From the very day she'd met him, Hinata knew there was something special about him and over time had realized that she had developed a not so small crush on him. The fact that they had quite a few embarrassing moments during the academy years and still got along so well together only served to reinforce it further. And thou she would never admit to it without dam good reason, she had found some enjoyment during a few of those embarrassing moments. That however, was neither here nor there. So, seeing the blond boy of her dreams come running up to her, she quickly grabbed hold of him and brought him to face level, it wouldn't do to make him feel lesser then her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Hinata!\" Her excited blond partner greeted. \"G-good morning Naruto.\" That was another thing that Hinata enjoyed. With her and Naruto spending some time together during the academy, Hinatas' stutter had slowly vanished. Now it only showed itself when surprised or slightly overwhelmed, and having Naruto near her for so long was still slightly overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bout time you got here moron!\" Hearing this Hinata couldn't help but frown. Kiba Inuzuka and his dog partner Akamaru made themselves known. Seeing as how Akamaru was bigger than Kiba he tended to ride his puppy around. Hinata didn't dislike the Inuzuka but, she really disapproved of how he could think insulting someone was a proper greeting. <i>'I'll punish him a little later.'</i> Kiba was different from most of her class. Where most had found a partner rather easily, Kiba did not and had been simple placed on a <i>'random'</i> team, under a <i>'random'</i> kunoichi. Hinata was certain it was anything but, random and that she was chosen due to her being one of the few girls in class that could deal with him and didn't abuse her power over him. <i>'Doesn't mean I won't punish him later for his comments towards <b>\"MY\"</b> Naruto.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush covered her cheeks at how she had just claimed Naruto as hers in her mind. She closed her eyes and brought a hand to her cheek as she imagined how life might turn out should they ever get to being romantic with each other.  She was sadly shaken from her romantic fantasy by an elbow to the ribs, curtsey of one platinum blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing the blond a glance Hinata easily noticed the subtle gestures she was giving and couldn't help but, griminess at what she was implying.  Quickly looking towards Naruto, who had jumped down to Kiba and started arguing with him, before she turned back to Ino. \"Ino I can't do that! How could you even suggest it after what happened?\" whispered the shy girl. \"The dog-boy is getting on my last nerve Hinata and it's only morning. He was put under you even if he isn't classed as your partner, so do something about him will ya! Besides, it's not like those other boys were hurt, they all came out of you just fine.\" stated the irritated blond girl. \"You know if I had had the choice I never would have done that.\" Hinata shot back. \"Besides, look what happened. The teacher was fired and I was left going through two days of the worst case of bloating and indigestion I've ever had, so no thanks.\" \"You can't say you didn't enjoy it even a little Hinata. Remember? Naruto worked so hard to make sure you would be alright and was fussing over you the whole time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata would admit that while being the center of Narutos attention had been wonderful, she hadn't been able to enjoy it much as she had been too busy making sure he never found out why she had been in such condition. \"Come on Hinata. So the teacher made you swallow a jar full of small boys saying it was punishment for them and perfectly normal, only to find she was lying through her teeth and doing it to you simply for the kicks but, you can't let us suffer for it by letting the mutt run around with no restraint.\" as if to simply prove her point Hinata heard a shriek and saw Kiba on Akamaru being chased by Sakura who looked like she had just had her foot peed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Hinata realized that she would need to punish Kiba and Akamaru for that and really didn't feel like finding out if she could swallow the puppy just to punish Kiba. \"There has to be a different way Ino.\" The blond was just about to say something but, was stopped by a puff of smoke as their current sensei appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smoke didn't last very long and quickly parted to reveal a fairly tall and light-skinned young woman possessing a slender build. She had untamed, shoulder-length black hair and very unique crimson colored eyes. Unlike some women that wear large amounts of make-up this woman only used a bit of red lipstick and purple eye shadow to help accent her features. She wore a dress of something that seemed to resemble bandages with a pattern on it similar to those of rose thorns. Under this was what appeared to be a red mesh armor blouse with only the right sleeve being visible. There were bandages on her hands and upper thighs while the Konoha forehead protector rested firmly on her forehead. A pair of regular shinobi sandals completed her appearance. This woman was Kurenai Y\u016bhi, Konoha's foremost genjustu user, sometimes called 'The Mistress of Illusions'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai was quick to give a warm smile to her students. \"Good morning girls.\" She acknowledged the various greetings her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s gave before getting strait to the heart of the matter. \"Now girls, I hope you three are ready for our training session cause if not I just might need to ask my friend Anko to pay us a visit.\" She watch in amusement as the three tried and failed to suppress a shiver at the idea of training with that woman. They had all been introduced to the sadistic snake charmer only a day or two ago. Kurenai still found it odd though that Hinata seemed the most able to get along with her out of the three. Banishing the thought from her mind she decided it was time to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls. Now as you may know due to the whole boys shrinking thing we've had to make changes to the ninja system that we use. As such this is the first time that a team like this has been formed. Normally you would have been separated into teams of three and then your j\u014dnin sensei would give you a test that had a 66% fail rate.\" She stopped and looked at how the faces of her students had gone pale. She almost felt like grinning at how much fun she was going to have with teasing them from here on. \"Calm down girls. Like I said that is what we use to do for <i>'normal'</i> team selection. This however is anything but a normal team. As such this is team setup is being used as an experiment. If things go well then this will be the base from which we will perform all our team setups.\" And with that said their training began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-------Hours later------</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to say that I am rather impressed with how well things went.\" And she was. Kurenai of course did notice flaws that would need correcting, the most pressing of all being Ino and Sakura's constant fighting and Kiba's alpha-of-the-pack mentality. Besides that, she had noticed some areas of improvement and ingenuity. The most surprising of all coming from Hinata and her partner Naruto. Apparently, Naruto was able to do the impossible and create a solid transformation. Most transformations where illusions that couldn't interact with their surroundings without breaking or dispelling. Naruto however had transformed into a variety of different things and had surprised her yet again when he used Shadow clones. She had read that he could perform the jutsu but, hadn't fully believed it until she saw the boy spamming out clones like it was as easy as breathing. And if that hadn't been enough, Naruto then started using the transformation jutsu in combination with his clones allowing him to transform into things that his size would normally restrict him from. It had been quite the sight, seeing Hinata swing around a full length katana like it was as light as a feather, only for the blade to suddenly change into a set of brass knuckles, then into, of all things, an umbrella. Those where just some of the things he did. With that boy working together with Hinata, she may have the most amazing team in years. <i>'That is of course if I can train them properly'</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dismissed her team, only telling them to return here at the same time tomorrow before seemingly shimmering out of sight. With their sensei gone the team slowly separated and made their ways home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto Uzumaki was a prankster, there was no denying that but, all of his jokes up until now had been harmless. This time he had a new idea for a prank and it was all the fault of that pervy sage. You see Jariya had let slip that Uzumakis\u2019 were feared for their natural talent in seals, so Naruto decided to try and learn some things about the art of sealing. Problem with this was that sealing was an art that required patience, not something the blond boy had much of. So, what happened shouldn\u2019t come as to much of a surprise. Naruto had made a seal that in his belief would, once activated, cover the victim in various make-ups and or embarrassing things. He bought an ink well and placed a generous some of his blood into the ink, then after mixing the blood and ink he flooded it with chakra before, starting to craft his seal. Now if only he had actually studied how seals work he wouldn\u2019t be in the mess he got himself into. But you need to know what happened don\u2019t you\u2026 so here is what happened.<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\nPlacing the scroll on the shelf Naruto took a step back to admire the fruit of his hard work and study. The scroll wasn\u2019t anything special, just a normal scroll with an added orange border and small swirl design in the center to help add some flare and caught someone\u2019s attention. He was currently in the one place no one would ever expect to find him, the Library.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a small snicker he stopped only long enough to hear the soft steps of a person approaching and quickly hid behind a bookshelf. He heard the voice of someone familiar, soft and gentle when they wondered out loud what the odd scroll that caught their attention contained. Naruto, instead of snickering about the prank about to go off, was too busy trying to remember who that voice belonged to. He pushed it to the back of his mind when he heard the loud poof of the scroll going off, and the started gasp of surprise. Jumping out to laugh at the misfortune of his victim, the joy quickly passed when he saw Hinata\u2019s back to him. He watched in a moment of fascination as Hinata shakily flopped to the ground, resting herself on her folded legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching to apologize, as he hadn\u2019t wanted to catch the only kind girl in his life with an embarrassing prank, he quickly stopped when he caught sight of something he knew she didn\u2019t have before. Moving to her side to get a better look, while trying to comfort the seemingly shocked and trembling girl. He put his hand on her shoulder only for her to \u2018eep\u2019 in surprise before turning her head to look at him. He saw many emotions in her wide lavender eyes. Shock, Fear, Disbelief, and confusion were only some of the more easily recognized ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-naru-uto?!? Wha-at j-just hap-pened?\u201d the shy girl ask in a pleading manner.  She was obviously scared of the answer he would give. Naruto for his part, gave Hinata a quick once over to see if anything other than the obvious had happened to the girl in front of him. Seeing nothing he moved his eyes to what he was, for some reason, hoping was just a genjustu. Hinata\u2019s tan jacket had snapped open at the bottom, the zipper reconnecting just under where Hinata\u2019s breast should be. Pushing that thought from his mind he continued to take in the shy girls change. The dark blue shirt and the mesh under shirt were both pulled out, stretching to cover the girls\u2019 large circular middle. The shirts didn\u2019t even reach her now out-y bellybutton, and only covered the top forth of her large belly. Her belly drew his attention, the skin was a creamy white and looked both soft to the touch and pulled tight, he noted that it lacked any kind of marks or pronounced blood vessels that would have been normally found on such a belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the pale-cream skin as it moved with Hinata\u2019s breathing, Naruto found himself with an overwhelming urge to touch the large mass in front of him. Gingerly, he reached out and ran a finger over it, inciting an embarrassed moan from Hinata showing that she liked the touch. Taking confidence in her reaction, Naruto placed his whole hand gently upon the sphere of creamy-white and gently ran his hand across it, getting another low moan from the now red faced Hinata, for it. <i>\u2018Its\u2019 warm\u2019</i> he thought, <i>\u2018So warm, and soft, yet firm to the touch. And what is this odd warmth I feel in side myself??? Growing and spreading\u2026 It feels nice!\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had started he didn\u2019t wish to stop. He wanted to remain here, to continue to run his hand over her soft skin, to hear her low moan of approval, to feel this warmth that crept though him, but he knew he needed to bring her to Tsunade and find out what happed. So with a small sigh he removed his hand, earning a small disappointed sounding moan from Hinata. He gave a small smile for some reason at how red her face was and the pleading look in her eyes to continue. Quickly looking away from those pleading eyes and pouting lips before he did something he knew he shouldn\u2019t, but really wanted to do, he shoved the \u2018dirty\u2019 thoughts to the back of his mind.  Standing he looked over the size of her belly and if he had to guess, he\u2019d bet he could cram a small 5 month old inside of her, give or take\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped her up and steadied her on his body before starting the hopefully short trek to the Hokage\u2019s office in silence. Thou he did note how Hinata seemed to cling to him as they walked, or waddled in her case, and would sometimes glance at him with this dreamy look on her face, while her hand would rub the pale belly she now sported. He promised to talk to her later about that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shizune was having an odd day. When she had first arrived at the tower she had expected to have too wake Lady Tsunade and then proceed to get her to do some of the paper work covering her desk. But, to her shock she found Tsunade wide awake and already hard at work. Next Shizune had gotten reports that someone had managed to get into the ANBU HQ and had covered the inside of every one of the masks with a thin layer of sneezing powder. She of course had a good idea of who did it but, with no way to prove it they couldn\u2019t do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the weirdest thing thus far had happened during her lunch break where Might Guy was once again challenging Kakashi to a contest. That in its self was normal the odd thing was that Jiraiya was there and had decided to declare the challenge that they would both do. All she knew was that Kakashi and Guy were now on the run from every angry female that had been at the best separate bath hot springs in Konoha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself Shizune wondered if the new mixed bath hot springs that had opened up just a few miles out of the village would be safer than the ones inside. It was now mid-afternoon and Lady Tsunade was meeting Jiraiya so they could lay out the ground work of what the Toad sage would be teaching Naruto. Shizune paused in signing her next paper when she saw an unusual sight. Coming up the stairs was a girl that was being carried bridal style by a certain blond haired boy. She only rolled her eyes at seeing Naruto fall to the ground panting after gently setting the girl down on a nearby couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune looked the girl over as she panicked and struggled to stand back up so she could help the panting blond off the floor. Everything about the girl screamed Hinata Hyuga but, their seemed to be something\u2026 off, about her. Shizune just couldn\u2019t seem to place what. She was so deep in thought that she didn\u2019t notice the girl walk/waddle up to her desk, some minutes later, and ask to see Lady Tsunade until Naruto joined her and almost yelled the request right in her face. After telling them to go sit back down and wait as well as using the intercoms flashing button method to inform Tsunade of needing her attention, Shizune simply waited till her mentor noticed the light flashing on her identical intercom. While waiting though, Shizune kept watch over the pair sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally noticed the rather large stomach the Hinata looking girl sported and kept a close eye on her. Shizune saw how the girl would glance at Naruto and blush every few moments or how she would let her hand start rubbing her stomach only to shudder and stop. Shizune had at first thought that the girl was in pain but, was proven wrong when the girl let out a low moan of pleasure when her hand gently brushed against her belly. Shizune also noticed how the girl got rather red in the face while looking over at Naruto with an odd gleam in her eye. The girl leaned against Naruto and rested her head on his shoulder. Obviously something was up as Naruto started to blush and sit strait and ridged, whether this was from how close the girl had gotten or from something she may have whispered to him Shizune didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention went back to the intercom when she heard the sound of her teachers\u2019 voice on the other end. \u201cYes, Shizune?\u201d \u201cNaruto and\u2026 Hinata Hyuga are here to speak with you. Naruto says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d Shizune heard only silence from the other end as she awaited instruction from her friend and mentor. After a few minutes she was about to repeat the message but, stopped at hearing a reply. \u201cSend them in, Shizune.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had red lines that ran down from his eyes to the bottom of his jaw and wore a horned forehead protector with the kanji for <i>'Oil'</i>. The man wore a green short shirt kimono and matching pants; under which he wore mesh armor that showed out of the sleeves and legs of his outfit. His outfit was completed with hand guards, a simple black belt, traditional Japanese geta (wooden sandals), a red cloak with two simple yellow circles. This was Jiraiya, the Toad Sage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you Jiraiya that it is just too dangerous. What if he loses control or the Akatsuki find some way to suppress the fox\u2019s power. Naruto would then be left defenseless or raging as some kind of pissed off animal. No, You Jiraiya, need to teach him other things first then he can work on gaining control of the fox in small doses.\u201d Argued the busty blond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a fairly tall, light-skinned woman with light golden-amber eyes and straight blonde hair. Her hair is waist-length with shoulder-length bangs framing both sides of her face while tied into two loose ponytails in back. She held a violet rhombus mark on her forehead. Her body was a slender yet noticeably curvaceous frame with a rather large bust of 106 centimeters in circumference. She wore a grass-green robe with the kanji for <i>\u2018gamble\u2019</i> written in black on the back, inside a red circle. Underneath she had on a grey, kimono-style blouse with no sleeves, held closed by a broad, dark bluish-grey obi that matches her pants. Her blouse was closed quite low, revealing her sizeable cleavage. Wearing open-toed sandals with high heels and red polish on both her fingernails and toenails with a touch of a soft pink lipstick completed the look. This was Tsunade, the Fifth Hokage and first female kage of the lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few moments to calm themselves from their heated debate Tsunade noticed the blinking lens on her intercom. Motioning to Jiraiya to <i>\u2018hold on for a moment\u2019</i> she pressed the button to connect the line to her assistant Shizune. \u201cYes, Shizune?\u201d \u201cNaruto and\u2026 Hinata Hyuga are here to speak with you. Naruto says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d That surprised her, Naruto didn\u2019t normally just sit and wait to be let in but, he did know how to follow protocol when he felt it was needed. Giving a quick look to Jiraiya she saw him already moving to stand behind her, though slightly off to the side. Tsunade took that as a \u2018go ahead\u2019 and promptly told Shizune to let them in. Though she didn\u2019t like how Shizune paused at Hinata\u2019s name she figured there was a good reason for it, she just didn\u2019t expect the one she got.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking in to the Hokage\u2019s room with Hinata had to be the most nerve racking moment of his short life, that or it was the wait outside the room. Naruto couldn\u2019t help but feel scared of how the \u2018Old Lady\u2019 as he called her, would react to seeing what he had done to Hinata. <i>\u2018What did I do to her anyway? She has been acting a little weird, even compared to what little I know of her.\u2019</i> That thought almost made him stop moving. <i>\u2018What do I know about her? Other then she is odd, a girl, seems to always be sick, and that she\u2019s kind, I don\u2019t really know anything about her\u2026\u2019</i> Glancing towards the bloated girl as she waddled next to him, clinging to his arm while leaning on him for support. <i>\u2018I\u2019ll have to change that. She is one of my friends; I can\u2019t simply call her that and know nothing about her.\u2019</i> Returning his eyes forward he nodded to himself as he mentally promised that if he lived through this that he would spend some time with her so he could learn more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the room the pair saw Tsunade sitting behind her desk with Jiraiya standing behind and off to the side of her. Gulping, Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, worry what the Perverted Hermit would do when he found out about him trying out a new seal without his knowing. <i>\u2018A seal that is the cause of all this.\u2019</i> He reminded himself. He saw how their eyes glanced at Hinata, or her stomach only for their gaze to shot back at him, their eyes now holding a harder look to them as suspicion was clearly shown on their faces. Letting the door close behind them and now standing in front of Tsunade\u2019s desk Naruto was about to open his mouth and speak before he was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata, I don\u2019t know what sort of genjustu you are using or have on you to cause such an odd change of appearance but, I\u2019d appreciate it if you dropped it.\u201d The busty blond women stated. Hinata merely shifted her footing nervously as she didn\u2019t know how to explain what had happened to her. \u201cTsunade, something is\u2026 off, about this. Call me crazy but, I don\u2019t think that is a genjustu.\u201d Commented the sage. \u201cAll right, you\u2019re crazy. Now that that is out of the way\u2026\u201d pointedly ignoring the twitch in Jiraiya\u2019s eye. \u201cBrat. What is it that is so important that you felt it was urgent enough to interrupt an important meeting for?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to mention that it was about him or that they were both thankful for the distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Naruto began to explain what had happened. Starting from how Jiraiya had let the fact that Uzumaki\u2019s were known for their mastery of seal arts slip out, too him making the scroll and seal, down all the way to bringing Hinata to the tower. The fact that they were so quite afterwards did not bode well in his opinion. Naruto had taken a moment during the telling of his story to help Hinata to a small rectangular cushioned seat placed against the wall, as it had no sides on it to lean against. Personally, he had found the slightly confused look on her face rather cute, though she did seem thankful to be able to sit back down. Now Naruto was standing in the middle of the room with no one to hide behind should Tsunade try to kill him with her fist. Oddly, it was Jiraiya that spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let me get this straight. You thought it a good idea to craft your own seal, without any formal training or otherwise in the art, then proceeded to leave it out with the whole point being for someone to find it and make it activate. And that,\u201d pointing to Hinata whose face was covered with a light blush, \u201cIs what happened as the outcome. Is that the gist of it Naruto?\u201d Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, shiver in fright as he nodded, the sages voice was calm but, devoid of any of his normal cheer. Jiraiya rubbed his chin with a small <i>\u2018hmm\u2019</i> and started to casually walk between Naruto and Hinata. Looking towards the blushing girl as she tried pull the edge of her jacket down to cover more of her stomach, though this failed, the sage <i>\u2018hmm\u2019</i>ed again and looked back at Naruto. His next <i>\u2018hmm\u2019 </i>was followed by a chuckle with held no humor to it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sank into himself as he readied himself for a tongue lashing, and boy did he get one as Jiraiya suddenly exploded in rage and anger mix with a great deal of disappointment. Hinata could only watch in horror and worry for Naruto\u2019s safety as Jiraiya grabbed him by the collar of his jumpsuit and forced to look his teacher in the eye as Jiraiya laid out a can of \u2018verbal whoop ass\u2019 upon the clearly terrified boy. The man went on and on, going so far as to name some of the worst possible outcomes that could have happened, the outcomes ranged anywhere to Hinata\u2019s death, both quick and horridly bloody, to the destruction of the village as a whole. Jiraiya then went on to listing everything that Naruto had done wrong when setting up to making the seal going all the way down to how he had put his chakra into the ink. It took some time but, the sage finally ran out of steam and let the boy down. He asked if Naruto had the scroll with him while Tsunade had already begun checking Hinata over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still shaking in fright of his teachers\u2019 angry rant, as well as how he was still coming to terms with how badly his idea could have backfired, it took Naruto a few moments to remember where the scroll was. His eyes widened in fear as he remembered that he had simple left the scroll on the floor of the library. The shaking of his body increased as he spoke, \u201cI-I left it in the Library. I was too busy panicking about what happened to Hinata.\u201d Naruto cringed in fear at seeing Jiraiya\u2019s eye twitch in response. He was grateful to see the man simply sigh at his response rather then start lecturing him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s attention turned to Tsunade when he heard her call for an ANBU to recover the scroll. He didn\u2019t even see the ANBU appear or vanish, only sign that they had been there was a small popping sound as the ninja shun-shined to the library. He watched how Tsunade suddenly stood and motioned for Jiraiya to follow, both of them walking to the end of the office near the windows. They were clearly talking but, for some reason he couldn\u2019t hear them. Shaking it off for the moment Naruto walked towards a red-faced and heavily breathing Hinata and proceed to sit next to her. He shot her a questioning glance which only grew as she leaned into him and held him close. Worried he wrapped his arm around the large stomached girl and asked her if she was okay.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAfter a few calming breathes Hinata slowly nodded leaving her face buried in blond boys jacket. She didn\u2019t know what else to do. When she heard some of the things that Jiraiya had listed off that could have happened to her she had been terrified, only to feel relief at knowing that it didn\u2019t happen. This however only made her scared as she started to wonder what the seal in Naruto\u2019s scroll did do. Everything had revolved around her belly as she didn\u2019t see any other physical changes. She realized that she had yet to even try using her Byakugan to look herself over but, she knew it was because she was frightened at what she might see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of fear and to help herself to calm down, Hinata blocked out anything that didn\u2019t have to do with Naruto himself and how he was letting her hug him. Taking a deep breath she inhaled his scent, calming her greatly as she started to snuggle into him. <i>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t give this moment up for anything.\u2019</i> The girl said to herself. And with that Hinata allowed her mind to wander, the thoughts of what their children would be like, if they ever had any, oddly being the most prominent.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nQuickly casting a genjustu to keep anyone from hearing them, Jiraiya stood next to his old teammate and friend. \u201cSo Hime (princess), what did you find?\u201d He watched how she sighed and grumbled about not having any sake before telling him what little she could figure out. \u201cI don\u2019t know Jiraiya, I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen something like this. What I do know is that the cause of her expanded stomach is chakra. Naruto\u2019s chakra to be precise but, that\u2019s not all. There is enough chakra inside her that if I could make it solid, we could replace the entire Hokage Monument and still have some left over.\u201d Jiraiya blinked, completely stupefied. \u201cTsunade, your saying that there is enough chakra inside that girl\u2019s stomach that we could replace the largest monument in Konoha with it and still have some left. And to top it all off, it didn\u2019t kill her, only expanded her stomach to that size\u2026 Maybe you should lay down for a bit, you\u2019re starting to sound crazier than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade gave an irritated huff before continuing. \u201cJiraiya, I\u2019m not only telling you that that girl has more chakra then the majority of the village combined, somehow compressed inside of her, I\u2019m also telling you that it isn\u2019t inside her stomach.\u201d Seeing the confusion on Jiraiya\u2019s face Tsunade told him. \u201cHer womb you pervert, her womb! That is where all that chakra has gathered and it seems to be doing something. Hinata\u2019s body is compressing the chakra in and on to its self but, some of her own chakra appears to be mixing with it. She and the chakra seem to be connecting with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sage simply thought on this info for a few moments before asking, \u201cSo she now has a second source of chakra like Naruto?\u201d He got a shake of her head as an answer before she tried to explain further. \u201cNo, she is going through a change. I couldn\u2019t see too well into her womb but, I did get a look at how her body is changing. Her hormonal levels are acting much like most women in the beginning stages of pregnancies.\u201d \u201cWHAT!?!\u201d The Sage yelled in shock, \u201cNaruto got her pregnant!?!\u201d Tsunade tried to force down a smirk but, failed. She was already thinking of a way to <i>\u2018punish\u2019</i> Naruto for this stupid act as well as keep Hinata safe and away from prying eyes. <i>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t due to have her be seen by the villagers just yet.\u2019</i> She thought. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, yes. Naruto has somehow caused Hinata to become pregnant through chakra, though no real living children are forming yet. I theorize that the chakra will continue to mix with Hinata\u2019s. After which it will compress even further till real human embryos have formed.\u201d A small evil smile formed on her lips. \u201cAnd I do remember seeing what looked like multiple points of concentration of the chakra, I\u2019d bet that Hinata will be having a lot of kids.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jiraiya wasn\u2019t sure how to take this news. His student had done the impossible and gotten a girl pregnant using only chakra and a seal. To top it off the girl just so happened to be the heiress of the Hyuga clan and a girl that, if he had heard right, was head-over-heels in love with the moron. Whether that was good or bad he didn\u2019t know, what he did know was that the girl would not be likely to survive the birthing process and even if she did, her father was likely to kill Naruto for what he had done as well as kick the girl out onto the streets. That he knew was bad. Before he could say anything though the ANBU member returned with the scroll. Breaking the genjustu Jiraiya saw something that he hoped wouldn\u2019t cause any problems in the future. The ANBU currently handing the scroll to him was a women, a Y\u016bgao Uzuki to be exact if the straight purple violet hair reaching down to her waist and the porcelain mask resembling a cat with three red stripes- one vertical stripe on the forehead and one horizontal stripe on each cheek was, anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya really hoped that the seal in scroll was of the one shot variety or else Naruto might end up in an even harder to manage situation.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata looked up at the ANBU that appeared and watched as the masked women handed Jiraiya the still open scroll, never letting the other go the whole time. After the ANBU vanished Jiraiya placed the scroll on Tsunades desk and started going over the seal design. \u201cTsunade, before I forget you may want to call that girl back in later and give her a look over. What happened to Hinata is bad enough without it possibly happening to one of your ANBU too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata saw Tsunade and felt Naruto go stiff for a few seconds at the statement. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the idea of Naruto getting another talking to about why he shouldn\u2019t get their villages ANBU in the same condition as her. She stopped however at a thought, <i>\u2018Just what sort of condition am I in?\u2019</i> With that Hinata tilted her head slightly in thought and returned to focusing on her thoughts while still cuddling Naruto for as long as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was returned to the present when she felt Naruto\u2019s cheek press against the top of her head, a small huff of boredom making her giggle lightly as she felt him idly start to play with her hair. Feeling his finger brushing through her hair made her feel special, that this was a moment between them that couldn\u2019t be shared with another. She blushed lightly, greatly enjoying the attention and hoping that they would have many more moments like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahaaa!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sound of the Toad Sage yelling in triumph startled them both casing them to jump and look over towards the hermit, both of them wide-eyed and blushing. Tsunade was the only one to notice the blush and smiled. \u201cSo Jiraiya, what did you figure out?\u201d The pervert started to cackle like a mad man. \u201cNothing. I learned Nothing, HAAhAha!\u201d Naruto and Hinata sweat dropped at hearing this while Tsunade got annoyed. Thankfully it was Naruto who decided to speak up. \u201cBut, Pervy Sage, I thought that you were some kind of seal master?\u201d \u201cBrat! How many times do I need to tell you don\u2019t call me that!?!\u201d demanded the old hermit. \u201cBesides it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t take this seal apart, no it\u2019s that the designs have no connections to each other. It\u2019s just a bunch of ink lines thrown together. I can\u2019t even figure out how this thing could even work, it should have simply collapsed on its self with no adverse effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence descended upon them for a few minutes before Tsunade spoke. \u201cSo what can we do?\u201d \u201cNothing my dear, nothing but, ride this out till it ends. I think that we will gain more insight to what happened by simply observing Hinata over time.\u201d Though an understandable course of action it was clearly not one any of them wanted to follow. \u201cW-what d-do we do Lady Tsunade?\u201d Everyone looked to the shy girl in surprise as this was the first time she had spoken this whole time, though the gaze switched to Tsunade shortly after, all awaiting orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few moments to think Tsunade used the best option open to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t have this getting out, not right now and to top things off everyone already knows that Naruto and Jiraiya are suppose to be leaving for nearly three years in a few days. There is also the fact that we need to keep an eye on Hinata in case something happens. So, for now Naruto you and Hinata are going to go into hiding and will be staying at a small house hidden at the Hokage Monument.\u201d Pausing she saw the looks from both Hinata and Jiraiya, blushing red and in awe, and a perverted suggestive look, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJiraiya I want you to try to break that seal and understand its secrets and if it turns out that what I think is happening to Hinata is indeed happening then you need to devise a seal that will put off the end results for as long as possible. Naruto, You caused this, as such you will be taking care of Hinata and waiting on her hand-and-foot. If she needs you to do something for her then you will do it. Understand.\u201d She leveled a glare at the blond boy just daring him to refuse; she was a bit surprised to see him merely nod in understanding but, shook it off pretty quick. \u201cHinata I want you take it easy, ok?\u201d getting a nod Tsunade told Jiraiya to bring them to what would act as their home for now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud sigh escaped the Toad Sage as his mind went over everything that happened so far. All-in-all Jiraiya would like to think things had gone rather well, all things considered. When Jiraiya had first Shunshined (Body-Flicker) then to the old home of his late student and his wife, something strange had happened to the pregnant girl. Hinata had suddenly started moaning, quite loudly at that. Looking to her to figure out what had caused such an odd outburst from the normally shy girl, the Sage and his apprentice noticed something unusual going on with her large, protruding belly. The two had stood there in shocked silence as they watched lumps and bulges rise and fall from within her bulging belly and said bulges moved across her bellys taunt skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya, being the amazing ninja that he is, quickly grabbed the girl flickered back to Tsunade's office; unintentionally leaving a panicking Naruto behind. Thankfully, they returned before the boy could get any bright ideas of hoofing it back to the Kages Tower. He did find the explanation that Tsunade gave rather weird but, then again he wasn't the Med-nin between them, so he could only go with what she told him. Apparently Hinata's body was trying to balance out the massive concentration of Naruto's chakra inside of her by leaking some of her own chakra into it. This process would normally cause the foreign chakra to be broken down or slowly assimilated into her own reserves but, somehow her body was confusing itself and instead of breaking down the chakra, her body was mixing some of hers with it while slowly compressing it. Tsunade theorized that the chakras, being fundamental to the creation and sustaining of life, where effectively filling in for a sperm and egg cell. She believed that once Hinata's body had mixed enough of their chakras together and compressed the combined chakra enough, it would become <i>'evolve'</i> for lack of a better word, into embryos. These embryos would then grow as any baby would inside their mother. Thankfully it would take a while for the chakras to compress enough for that to happen. Jiraiya couldn't help but find some amusement in the fact that Hinata's baby belly would need to shrink down to normal non-pregnant size before slowly growing back out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That boy is going to have his hands full.'</i>, thought the Sage. Seeing as how Naruto was the one to cause this to the poor girl, it only seemed fair that the boy take responsibility and care for the girl as she went through this. <i>'And oddly enough the boy doesn't seem to mind catering to her in the slightest.'</i> He allowed his mind to continue going over what had happened so far. He had given them a tour showing the living area, the kitchen, the dinning room with a back door and porch out back. The second floor had the Master bedroom as well as two more, one of which was clearly a nursery which would have been Naruto's had his parents not died that night. There was a library filled with enough scrolls to take a lifetime simply to read them all and of course the study where Minato had kept all his business and Hokage related things. Jiraiya was just glad that the two hadn't thought to try the blood seals that protected that material. He had however stressed to never try entering the basement without him as it held so much security that it was easily the most well protected place in the whole Land of Fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Naruto to make some clones he had them start cleaning the place out before showing the kids a rather unique training feature that the Fourth had made. A set of wooden logs positioned in a close triangle formation. While they didn't look all that special at first, they were in fact masterpieces of F\u016binjutsu or sealing arts. Naruto of course had doubted him so he had the boy take a crack at them, only to soon find himself laying sprawled out on the ground with a black eye, bruised body and a broken pride. Hinata had been quick to start fretting over the boy where as Jiraiya just laughed his ass off at his poor apprentice. The training logs where made in a way that allowed then to react and fight back. One never knew when or where one of the longer poles would shoot out of the log, meaning you needed to always be aware of what was happening or you'd get your ass handed to you. On top of that one could up the level of difficulty by fighting two or even all three of the logs at a time. They could even be made to use seals hidden in hollow areas to replicate the use of jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting Naruto get his ass handed to him a few more times, Jiraiya told Hinata she could go back inside as the clones should be finished cleaning. He did have Naruto make a few more clones though, these ones being ordered to pamper her. Jiraiya then took Naruto to a nearby wind and water mill that through the amazing power of F\u016binjutsu, could produce more then enough power for the house. It took about an hour for him to show Naruto how to care for the mill and the seals it used, thankfully when given an in depth explanation and details on a seal the boy seemed to memorize it perfectly and left Jiraiya feel safe in letting him do this on his own, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look inside, he saw quite the sight as a number of Naruto clones where surrounding the gravid girl giving nearly her whole body a massage as she sat in one of the padded recliner seats. The girl seemed to be enjoying it if the blissful expression was anything to go by. Then again, in Jiraiya's experience, most girls loved having a man massage their feet, and when you through in the hands, shoulders at the same time then they just tended to melt right into your hands. And if Jiraiya's eyes whereby deceiving him, then the clones seemed to be enjoying the excuse to get their hands on her just as much as she enjoyed what they where doing. He chuckled as he wondered what Naruto's reaction would be once those clones dispelled and he received all the memories. He had already told them that he'd bring about a months worth of supplies over in the morning after bringing in some Ichiraku ramen for dinner. And so with a smile on his face the great Toad Sage slipped away into the night.</span></div></div>",

Looking towards her due to her rather odd outburst, they noticed something other then\u00a0her hands resting on her large, protruding belly. Her belly was moving, lumps and bulges rising and falling from within her as the bulges moved across her bellys taunt skin. The three ninjas could only stand there, watching in stunned silence as the red faced heiress moaned in pleasure as her\u00a0hands rubbed her oddly moving belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the girl half moan half yell was what snapped them out of their stupor. They saw the girl taking deep, heavy breaths while leaning her back against the wall. Her glazed over eyes, far off smile and a dampness spreading from the middle of her pants legs told the elder two that the young heiress had just orgasmed. Paying it no mind, Tsunade moved over to the young girl, who was still trying to recover herself from her sexual high while another was starting to build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a medical justu to check the girls still bulging belly only to cut the chakra from it moments after. <i>'It felt as if the chakra inside of her was trying to \"eat\" mine. Hmmm...'</i> Turning towards her male companions Tsunade began to explain what she had found. \"Well, we thankfully don't need to worry...\" sadly a certain blond-haired boy decided to innterupt her. \"WHAT?!? What do you mean <i>'we don't need to worry'</i>? Old lady that,\" pointing towards the still panting young Hyuga girl \"is not normal, even I know that! Just listen to her, something is...\" He never got the chance to finish as Jiraiya bopped him on the head, ending the boys sentence. \"Brat, just shut up and listen to her. If Tsunade says there's nothing to worry about then there is nothing to worry about. Now let her finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jiraiya, now as I was saying, we don't need to worry. The odd movement of her belly is from the chakra inside of her. Her body seems to be releasing some of her own chakra into the large mass of consentrated chakra the scroll forced into her. The mass of chakra is at this time <i>'mixing'</i> the chakras together in order to keep a stable balance. It should cease it's odd movements once it has become stable.\" It took a great deal of will to ignore the moans, gasps and cries as the young girl became more and more aroused and suffered her second orgasim while explaining things to the two males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought entered the busty women's minds and couldn't help but, grin. \"Naruto, I think I know a way to help little Hinata here.\" \"Really! How?\" Tsunade nearly burst out in a fit of giggles at how easy he was making it. \"Simple, just go and sit next to her, maybe you can put your arm around her like before and give her some comfort.\" said the busty blond in a teasing tone. She saw the blush and didn't even give him a chance to respond as she gave him a small shove towards the obviously highly aroused girl. She then brought Jiraiya to the other side of the room and placed the same genjustu over them as before, fully knowing that she was risking the boys virginity with her actions but, it would make for wonderful blackmail to hold over his head next time Naruto called her old.</span></div></div>",

He had just completed his morning training with Kakashi and was going home for lunch and a short nap before heading out for his afternoon sparing. He wasn't thinking of anything in particular: a little bit of what he would have for lunch, of how Kakashi always seemed to be one-step ahead of him, of his usual dark thoughts of revenge and violence. No thought was defined, however; they all hung in a haze in his mind. It was perhaps this haze that kept him from noticing the scroll that sat innocently on the road. Or perhaps it was the shabbiness of the parchment, the poor ink, but whatever it was that kept his normally sharp eyes from seeing it, Sasuke stepped onto the scroll-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if someone had punched him very hard in the gut. He let out a sharp intake of breath, clutching his belly before falling to his knees. That was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately activated his Sharigan, scanning the deserted street for hidden enemies. But, as I already mentioned, the street was deserted. He couldn't feel any chakra-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, there was something-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped, knocking himself off balance and onto his rear, when he felt his arm touch something as he moved it to his side. He almost wanted to scream, he almost did scream, when he saw the white, hard mound that now sat where his previously toned and muscled stomach muscle had. He tried to stand, almost as if to run away from <i>it</i>, but just kept slipping back down. Finally, he was able to right himself on his wobbly legs, one hand on his hip and the other resting on his now bulging middle. His mind, once focusing on nothing in particular, was racing with a million thoughts. What could he do?</span></div></div>",

Sasuke himself, quite ignorant of the situation, only noticed the Hokage's blank stare and, well, the quiet air of impending doom that was spread thin through-out the room. Without quite thinking, Naruto got up from his seat. Sasuke, also without thinking, gratefully sat down. The extra weight he now carried was becoming a hindrance. It was hard to balance, to stay upright when all he wanted to do was fall forward. He felt tired, hungry, and all that eased his mind was rubbing his large, <i>moving</i> belly.

It had been a simple C-rank. Drive out some bandits that were causing problems around a small out of the way village. Naruto had dealt with the bandits rather easily and after he gathered up all the loot they had hidden around their camp. However, he had come across a worn out scroll in the bandit leaders\u2019 stash. Looking it over quickly he decided to pocket it for further study, it did have a justu of some sort written on it. He was now walking down the village roads towards a training ground to practice when he decided to take another look over the scroll. Stopping in surprise when he found a warning that the justu in the scroll only worked on women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that sucks! How am I suppose to know if this even works then?\u201d He muttered out loud. \u201cUm,..\u201d went a feminine voice behind him and on instinct Naruto spun around, hand reaching for his kunai, only to stop when he saw the blushing face of one Hinata Hyuga. The small squeak she made showed he had surprised her, whether in how fast he reacted or that he had actually heard her he didn\u2019t know. Loosening his stance he smiled at her and rubbed the back of his head with a small chuckle to help her relax. He had learned quite a bit on his two and a half year trip after all, info gathering and friendly greetings being just some of these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata, you scared me for a moment. Hehe, how are you?\u201d Smile never really leaving his face, but then why should it? He was getting to talk to a cute girl who was also a friend of his. His friendliness only seemed to make the girl nervous, though she did smile and giggle at his obvious attempt to play off the reflex. \u201cI-I\u2019m wel-ll Naruto-kun. H-h-how are you?\u201d She had asked mentally yelling at herself for the stuttering. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good, was just on my way to the training grounds to practice a justu scroll I found but, after looking it over it seems to be a bust.\u201d His smile dropped at the last part, remembering the disappointment he felt at the restriction on the justu. Hinatas\u2019 interest how ever was peeked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFor the next few minutes the two simply talked with Hinata eventually finding out that the justu he had said it only worked on girls. Now Hinata maybe very shy but, she was very curious too, so mustering all the courage she could she offered to help Naruto practice the justu. Excited but, still wanting to be careful he told her that he didn\u2019t know what the justu did and that it could hurt her. Now knowing this he asked if she still wanted to try. Hinata only thought it over for a moment before saying she\u2019d still help him. Resisting the urge to hug the daylights out of the girl he simply smiled, grabbed her hand an practically dragged the flustered girl to the training grounds, yipping and hollering the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey simply studied the scroll or the parts they could make out for about an hour, trading ideas and theories of what the justu would do. They did see near the bottom of the description a note that said there were ten levels that could come about based on the amount of chakra used, and sure enough there were ten stamp like marks in two lines of five neatly nestled between the description of the justu and the images of the hand seals used for it. From what they could gather about the justu, you could press the scroll against the women target in question and the stamp that corresponded to the level affecting them would glow. Meaning that after Naruto used the justu he could press the scroll to Hinata\u2019s body and the justu level he used would glow as one of the stamps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 20 minutes Naruto practiced the hand seals and the chakra flow needed for the justu. Hinata however, was slightly worried about the fragmented parts that from what she figured said something about effects able to last 8 months to a full 12 month cycle. This info plus the fact it can only be used on females was starting to bother her but, this was her chance to train with Naruto so she stubbornly ignored the feeling and decided to get ready to defend herself on the off chance the justu would hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so let it be known that the justu was used with no sign of it effecting Hinata, at least not right away. Thinking the justu had failed Hinata was about to tell him to try again till she suddenly fell to the ground clutching her middle. Naruto didn\u2019t let the shock keep him rooted to the spot for long, as he was already next to the Hyuga princess by the time she started gasping in pain while clutching her stomach. He yelled to her in an attempt to get her to focus on him rather then, the pain. This ceased however when he saw her arms being pushed away by seemingly, her own jacket, however, he was rendered speechless as he saw the round like shape under her jacket revealed itself as an orb of pale-creamy skin. He snapped out of it only to be shocked again as he heard a sudden popping sound. Looking to the source he was stunned seeing a smaller bump near the front of the creamy colored orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth seemed to come to a stop if Hinata\u2019s sudden gasps of relief were anything to go by. Naruto watched stunned stupid as Hinata slowly recomposed herself enough to stare at the large orb. Hinata slowly brought her hands to the sphere and touched it with the palm of her hand. The moment her hand made contact she gasped loudly, a look of shocked pleasure on her face as it was quickly covered in a cherry-red blush. She didn\u2019t notice Naruto jump slightly at the gasp nor how his face suddenly went red as she closed her eyes, shuddering and moaning in obvious pleasure at the sensation. Naruto\u2019s mind however picked back up as he watch the shy girl give off oddly arousing sounds as she rub the mass in front of her as it laid nestled between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to figure out what happened to no avail on till his mind, which was trying to fill itself with some rather perverted and naughty thoughts, absently referred to the mass in front of his now slightly aroused friend as her stomach that he finally able to understand what had happened. Refusing to believe the idea so quickly Naruto tried to focus his chakra to break the genjustu, only nothing happened. Frightened he tried biting his lip, the pain did nothing. Now with one last option he reached over to Hinata\u2019s \u2018stomach\u2019 and prepared himself to try breaking image by using touch. Whatever he expected to find was not there, instead he felt Hinata\u2019s taunt skin under his fingers, the pulling caused by her breathing, the shudders brought on from his touching the stretched nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a lump in his throat and pushing down a blush, from both the thoughts going through his head and the moans of the now panting and seemingly needy heiress, Naruto could only register one clear none-lust induced thought, \u2018We need to see Granny Tsunade.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(End Flashback)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, leading to where their currently pace down the village streets towards the Hokage\u2019s office, where Naruto hoped beyond hope, that Tsunade would be able to prove his conclusion wrong. Thinking on it, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like Hinata in a possibly romantic, get married and have kids together, sort of way, it was just that he didn\u2019t know the first thing about being a father. The fact that he and Hinata hadn\u2019t even got on a date together could also cause some friction in such a relation, but if it came down to it he would stay by her side to help raise any kids they had. Blushing at the implied thought of Hinata as his wife he snuck another quick glance her way, she was obviously getting tired from walking as she was. Spying a nearby bench, he stopped walking and put his hands on Hinata\u2019s shoulders, causing the poor girl to jump slightly at the sudden contact shifting her focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her to keep her from falling he motioned to the bench in answer to the questioning look she gave him. \u201cLet's sit down for a little.\u201d Seeing the grateful smile on her face he helped her waddle over to the bench and sit down. Hinata did so with a happy sigh of relief. Watching her move her feet around he figured carrying that much weight around from one side of the village to the other had caused some pain. So being the nice and impulsive person he is he told Hinata to lie down on the bench. While she moved he removed his jacket and folded it up, placing it on one side of the bench, helping her to rest her head on it like a pillow then taking her feet and placing them on his lap. He merely smiled at the questioning looks he was getting from her as he tried to remove Hinata\u2019s sandals, however, she protested to this and tried to stop him by sitting up, something that failed miserable do to her \u2018pregnant\u2019 belly. Naruto however proceeded to remove her sandals despite her protest. Upon removal of the sandals he calmly took hold of one foot and began to massage her feet, something meet with instant approval. They stayed like this for a good half-hour before reluctantly, in Hinata\u2019s case, resuming their trek to the Hokage\u2019s office which they would reach thankfully in about 20 minutes if they didn\u2019t run in to someone they knew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, their greatest challenge was what came after stepping though the large wooden double doors. Stairs. Evil, EVIL STAIRS. Naruto had, to Hinata\u2019s great relief and embarrassment, carried the shy girl up the stairs as carefully and quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*15 minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was tired; there was just no other way to say it. Carrying his stomach expanded friend up nearly 5 flights of stairs had been both backbreaking and exhausting. However, he refused to show it, especially when Hinata had been fretting over him since the first step. Speaking of said girl she was now worriedly hovering next to him, her cheeks a faint pink while her right hand sat in front of her mouth, blocking the worried frown from view. But it was her eyes that he noted were most active, as they dashed left to right obviously looking for any excuse she could to get him to sit and rest, even if only for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes locked with hers when she turned them to look at him once more. The emotions swirling about in her lavender gaze. Naruto merely gave a small smile, hoping it would show that he was fine. And so with seeing the admittedly reluctant nod they continued walking side-by-side towards the expertly carve large double doors of the Hokage\u2019s office. Stopping only to speak with Shizune to see if they could speak to Lady Tsunade. The reaction they got, though expected still surprised them.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nShizune was having a typical day. She had arrived early, as was the norm. and proceeded to sort the mission request they had got recently as well as gather to beginnings of her Masters paperwork that she would need to organize, sign or void. Then as normal she had to fight with said Master and Leader of Leaf village just to get her to sign a single document. Then came a quick lunch followed by dragging in more papers for Tsunade to look over. Now that she seemed to finally have some peace she gets a visit from Naruto and Hinata asking to see Tsunade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if Naruto had simply rushed thru and busted down the door only to start complaining, which would follow by an argument and a flying blond missile, courtesy of one tick-off old lady, then it would still be an average day. But, Naruto actually comes walking up to her desk and 'asks' permission to speak to the Hokage wasn\u2019t weird and nerve racking enough, he brings a girl that looks an awfully lot like Hinata with him. The kicker to this now no-longer normal day\u2026 the girl is pregnant, heavily so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this it took a few moments to simply go through the motions but, was able to inform them that Tsunade was in a important meeting with one of her high ranking ANBU and asked the two to simply take a seat on one of the couches, hopefully without staring to intently at the mostly covered belly that stuck out in front of the young Hyuga. Watching as they proceeded to take a seat the now frayed-minded burnet could only think of four exasperatingly familiar words to describe what she was feeling. \u2018I need a drink!\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could see why the ANBU before her was so shaken. <i>'She definitely didn\u2019t look like that a few hours ago.\u2019</i> Mentally Tsunade pulled up what she remembered of this particular ANBU from earlier this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ANBU was female, as one could tell by her figure. She was about a head shorter then Naruto, her poise perfect as one would expect from a member of her clan.  Her midnight dark hair fell gracefully down to about her mid-back. Her body was the sort that turned the heads of men and most women would kill to have, the grace in which she moved with only added to her beauty. She wore the standard black pants and long shirt, with the standard ANBU armor consisting of; one chest plate, two armguards with extensions to cover the top of her hands, a set of shin-guards and a simple Ninjato blade strapped to her back just under the ends of her hair. The only non-standard to her attire was the color of her armor which was all black with a dull-dark red on the edges and her ninja sandals and kunai holster, both of which were black. Turning her gaze upward, Tsunades\u2019 eyes settled on her white mask with the look of a grinning wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Yes. That was only a few hours ago, and now look at her... She\u2019s barely 2 years older than Naruto and now has to deal with something like this\u2026sigh\u2026 Though Hinata might have it even harder than this one.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing for what seemed like the umpteenth time since this meeting with Wolf started Tsunade turned her gaze back to the mask once more. \u201cTake that thing off, would you.\u201d She muttered. Wolf, though slightly shocked, proceed to, admittedly shakily, do as her leader commanded of her. Removing the mask revealed the pale cream skin and white eye of the Hyuuga clan. Her right eye was covered with a custom made eye-patch that required no bands to hold it in place and simply covered her eye, extending to cover the area that would show her pronounced veins when Byakugan was active. The patch had a custom made seal on the inside; it was meant to stop any chakra from passing thru, save for the bare minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Sad to know her right eyes \u201ccondition\u201d was caused by her own father trying to alter the Caged-Bird seal that was placed on her. Though, I guess he did succeed in some manner of speaking.\u2019</i> Deciding the young women before her had been left nervously standing in place long enough. Tsunade attempted to try and clarify what she had just heard. So with her voice of authority in place she began. \u201cWolf, no Tsubaki Hyuga, please tell me once more what you saw.\u201d<br>\r\nNodding the now named Tsubaki began to repeat her report of observing one Naruto Uzumaki. But when she got to the part of Naruto performing the unknown justu Tsunade cut in to get a better understand of what happened. \u201cTsubaki, your saying that Naruto Uzumaki preformed the justu with the intent of it affecting Hinata Hyuga, yes?\u201d getting a nod Tsunade continued. \u201cYou then explained how Hinata suddenly collapsed to the ground clutching her mid-section, and even how she seemed to be affected by the justu itself.\u201d She paused for just a moment but, when she continued Tsubaki could clearly hear the irritation in her leaders\u2019 voice. \u201cAll this and you have still yet to tell me why you seem to be in the same position as one Hinata Hyuga! SO, I suggest you tell me how you seemingly became pregnant yourself within the timeframe of 5 hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki, for all her ANBU training could only look down in shame as her leader finished her irritated rant. Looking down however, only made her feel even more shame with a bit of embarrassment thrown in to the mix. Her eye took in the image of the pale orb of flesh that now sat were her once firm, flat stomach had been. She couldn\u2019t even hide it from view, as it seemed to defiantly shove her normally semi-loose fitting black shirt aside as if to say, \u2018Here I am world! Look upon me in awe and amazement!\u2019 She had entered the Hokage\u2019s\u2019 office in a rush, huffing and puffing, her face bright red, though her mask had, thankfully, kept that hidden from view. She had even been forced to remove and leave behind her armor chest-plate to keep herself from, likely, snapping it in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunades\u2019 anger and irritation however, was squashed the moment she saw the defeated and utterly humiliated look cross the pregnant women\u2019s\u2019 face. Taking in her size with a practiced eye Tsunade concluded that Tsubaki would likely be carrying a set of large triplets or maybe a set of small quadruplets. <i>\u2018And from what she has told me, Hinata is even bigger! Oh, joy\u2026\u2019</i> She snapped from her thoughts just in time to barely catch the whispered explanation from the young girl. \u201c\u2026a pulse, mam.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Tsubaki take a deep breath before answering with a stronger voice, \u201cThe justu let off some sort of pulse, with Uzumaki at the center. I activated my Byakugan just in time to see it hit me. After the growing stopped, something I was forced to remove my chest-plate for, I panicked for a few moments before, calming myself and scanned the area around me with my Byakugan. The pulse, thankfully, didn\u2019t go much farther than my position, so it was easy to scan the entire radius of the justus\u2019 range and found no other females to be affected. As far as I could tell only Lady Hinata and myself were affected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well thank god for small miracles then! But, we still need to do something about Hinata and Tsubaki. Their clan will not take them returning like this very well. Hinata will likely be branded and Tsubaki might be banished from the Hyuga clan along with Hinata. Something needs to be done\u2026.\u2019</i> And so with that a plan started to form in Tsunades\u2019 mind. One that might give the brat a family and give the two girls of the Hyuga clan protection from their own traditions. <i>\u2018That brat better be thankful for this. Hmm, I wonder how he'll take being engaged to two girls?\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsubaki, tell me how do you feel about the idea of being able to keep your old friend, Hinata, safe and being able to live as part of a happy family with her?\u201d The blush and almost dreamy look on her face gave Tsunade all the answer she needed. <i>\u2018Good thing her files imply her to be bi-sexual, and I\u2019m sure she can come to love being a Mrs. Uzumaki just as much as she seems to love the soon-to-be Hinata Uzumaki.\u2019</i> And with a small grin she started to put her plan in to motion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Haishi silently activated his Byakugan and gave a quick look into the room his daughters were currently resting in. Seeing them sleeping peacefully and holding each other in their sleep helped him to feel a bit more at ease. In truth, the scene brought a small smile to his face as he witnessed his two little girls sharing an intimate moment. It only made him want to insure Hinata's safety and protection from the cursed Caged-Bird seal that some of the elders were still trying to push him into placing on her. Thinking to himself for a moment he nodded, his decision made. <i>'If this Uzumaki boy makes her so happy then he maybe the best chance I have to keep my little sunshine safe. And if need be I can always use this pregnancy as blackmail to make the boy take care of her.'</i> He thought. It wasn't his preferred method to keep Hinata safe but, it was better then marrying her off to some noble that she would be unhappy with, if not down right miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he quickly started making his way towards the front of the compound, ready to give the blonde idiot a good ass whipping. As such Haishi was not prepared for the sight he saw upon arriving. Neji stood at perfect attention as always but, was this time dragging some... Thing. Although it looked like Uzumaki, Haishi was sure that living people don't normally look like they've had their face smashed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neji what is this... Thing, that you have dragged into our home? I thought I told you to retrieve Uzumaki?\" Questioned the clan head. Neji just gave him a deadpanned look before saying, \"This is Uzumaki.\" Haishi moved closer to the body and inspected it. Feeling a bit childish Haishi nudged the boy with his foot a bit. \"What in the world did you do to him, Neji? I thought I asked you to return him alive.\" Neji merely cocked a brow in a 'really? Your not that stupid right?' sort of manner. \"He's not dead, Uncle.\" Neji reaffirmed his statement with a quick kick into Naruto's side, earning him a moan of pain and a few twitches. Satisfied, Haishi nodded and motioned for Neji to follow while dragging their 'guest' to his room. \"Again Neji, how did the boy end up like this? I know I said that I didn't care about how much you beat him senseless but, I didn't think you would go this far.\" \"Well Uncle, he was actually like this when I found him.\" This peeked Haishi's interest. \"Oh! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Flashback-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji was walking through the village streets thinking on how he could possibly find and catch Naruto Uzumaki when he was likely running and hiding for his life. A wise choice in Neji's own opinion. It was around this time that a loud noise was heard, oddly it sounded a lot like someone shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NNNAAARRRUUUTTTOOO!!! YOU IDIOT!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was soon followed by the sound of something breaking loudly as if it was being smashed by something with tremendous force. Recognizing the sounds of his villages kage, Neji turned towards the Hokages tower and saw an amazing sight. Naruto Uzumaki was flying bonelessly through the air only for gravity to reassert itself and pull the blonde back down. Neji watch in a mix of shock and fascination as Naruto hit the ground only to bounce and continue on. This repeated a good three more times with the blonde smashing into the ground before skidding across five feet of gravel with his face, only stopping inches from Neji's feet. Glancing around awkwardly for a moment before nudging him with his foot, Neji was able to confirm that the boy still lived. Neji gave a small prayer of thanks to whatever higher power caused this odd turn of events before grabbing the boy by one of his legs and started dragging the boy back to the Hyuga compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-End Flashback-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what happened Uncle,\" finished the boy as he literally threw Naruto into a chair before starting to tie up the blonde haired soon to-be-father of both Hyuga heiresses children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaishi blinked in dumbfounded awe before nodding and telling him to bring the boy to the room his daughters were in once he was done restraining him. Neji a nod in acknowledgement as Haishi walked out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's because he'd seen those very chakras almost every day since his daughters were born. Somehow the jutsu that ended up impregnating his two girls had rebounded in a completely unexpected fashion and gotten his daughters pregnant with each other's child as well as the Uzumaki boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments trying to wrap his mind around the fact that his two daughters were now pregnant with children from a boy as well as each other a thought occurred. Children between siblings were not a new thing, as interbreeding among the Hyuga clan had been more common then many would like to admit during the earlier days of Konoha and its founding. All though this was the first time two sisters had ever gotten each other pregnant. Still it was known that children born from such unions tended to have lots of problems, many of which the first signs of could usually be picked up via study of the fetuses chakra, even before medical scans were preformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in mind he carefully studied oddity that was a jutsu-made sibling born child for any abnormalities in its chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Hiashi find anything?</span></div></div>",

One of the prime ones were the B Corps. To Tsunade's surprise the Corps. was rather well off with plenty of volunteers and a good amount of experienced staff manning it. Given that, she'd looked less into changing the program and more of finding ways of improving it further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main issue Tsunade noticed was for the male volunteers. Men were not designed to carry and have children. That was obvious and had been overcome with medical ninjutsu. However, the process only really allowed for a man to carry to one to two children. Tsunade found that unacceptable. Bending her medical knowledge and expertise and then combining with the detailed procedures of the B Corps., Tsunade had come up with a possible solution. By carefully tapping into a man's chakra reserves, the B. Corps' various jutsus could be strengthened and reinforced, thus allowing for more children to be carried and supported. If she was correct, she could easily increase the number of from the paltry one or two to easily four or more! She could already see the possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next major hurdle came in the fact that this was all theory at the moment. As such, it needed to be tested and that required a subject. She needed someone with large chakra reserves, to make it safe as possible. She also needed the person to be in robust health, so that they could endure any possible complications and bounce back. The only person that the Fifth Hokage could think of that matched the description was one Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto had quite possibly, the largest chakra reserve in the village, his Uzumaki heritage made his body strong and he was even bolstered by the Kyuubi's healing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Tsunade had gone straight to Naruto. That...had been an interesting conversation. It made her want to down a barrel of sake just thinking about it. However, she had been able to get Naruto to agree through a combination of bribery (money and ramen), assurance that she'd monitor him herself and pointing out the fact that this would really help both her and the village. Naruto had eventually given in and agreed. Together they had scheduled for today to conduct the experiment at the hopsital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade made her last minute preparations and waited.

I've got everything ready to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage guided Naruto to a decent sized cot in the middle of the hospital room. The cot itself was positioned in the middle of a somewhat complicated sealing array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lay on the cot, Naruto.\" Tsunade instructed gently. \"And try to relax. I've got everything under control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a deep breath and sighed. \"Ok but shouldn't there be more doctors or nurses?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade raised a brow. \"Are you saying that I can't handle this myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held up his hands in a defensive gesture and shook his head rapidly. \"No!

Besides, no one has the same level of familiarity as I do with and I've even got several medics on standby just in case.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to finally calm the blond haired shinobi down and he took his place on the cot. Whatever happened next was mystery as, with a tap of her finger, Tsunade used a anesthetic technique to knock him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////// <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto awoke with a small start on the cot. The first thing he felt was a little...off. Not in a bad way, mind you, just different. He looked to his left to see Tsunade standing over him. Her hand was alight with green chakra and hovering just over his stomach. Tsunade quickly noticed her patient/test subject awake and gave him a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling, Naruto?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a few seconds to really consider. \"Fine. Just a little...strange, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded. \"That's normal. The procedure induces a lot of changes in your body. I'd be surprised if you weren't feeling anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd eveything go?\" Naruto stared at his stomach.

To resolve this problem, two special jutsus were created. The first was very difficult, as it gave men the ability to bear children. The second was a seal, that when activated, would speed up the growth of the fetus, shortening the span of the pregnancy to three months instead of 9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll ninja are required to have two children in their lifetime, and it is honor to do so.

It feels very calming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we train?\" Sasuke asked, even his voice a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll train, Sasuke, don't worry. It's only three months. You'll be back in shape in no time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the door opened to reveal a short little doctor. It was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were wheeled in wheel chairs, with the boys to the male ward and Sakura to the females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was shaking, just a little. It was only when they got to the room that he quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep you calm,\" the doctor said, we'll going to give you some medicine that will put you to sleep. When you wake up, there may be some discomfort, but everything should be fine. Now, it says here that Mr.Uchiha here is scheduled to have twins? And you Kakashi want triplets?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, figured I'd do it big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just nodded. It hadn't been his decision, however. Tsunade has assigned it to him given the size of his hips and his valuable Uchiha blood. Sakura was also scheduled for twins. </span></div></div>",

They were all told to rest and keep the training light, and eat a healthy diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Naruto, this was easier said than done. He stared at the salad Kakashi had brought over, his sensitive stomach turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just eat ramen when you're pregnant, Naruto. You're not going to gain enough weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi himself clearly had gained some weight; he wasn't wearing his vest, but instead just a black t-shirt and grey sweat-pants. Even Naruto could see that his normally flat belly stuck out just a little. Naruto gulped, but he nodded. He sat down, hesitant, and slowly began to eat the salad.Kakashi stood back, a smile under his mask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he ran to the bathroom. Naruto paled at the sound of retching, but kept eating. He had been waiting for morning sickness, but it hadn't come. He felt fine, if maybe just a little more tired than usual...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was not so lucky. He had spent the past few days either in bed or by the toilet. He was just thankful for when it stopped. He took in a shaky breath before slowly getting to his feet. If it kept up, he would have to go to the hospital, for the sake of the children. He smiled at the thought of his children. His right hand rested on his lower abdomen, where he could feel them already even at just a week. He loved them already, even if he would have to give them up. But he didn't want to think about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura yawned, feeling tired, even after the full night's sleep.

Umm\u2026\u201d Hinata however found that anything else she may have had to say to her big brother figure would be ignored as Neji had already started on his way back to the compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell isn\u2019t he just a barrel full of sunshine.\u201d Commented the pinket of the two, the sarcasm in her voice being made quite clear. \u201cS-sorry. Neji has a-always been l-like that.\u201dHinata apologized. Sakura however just waved it off and began walking towards Ino\u2019s at a slow pace. Getting the idea Hinata quickly waddled up beside her and kept an even pace despite the large baby-filled womb she sported. This slow pace allowed them to look around the village and realize that there were quite a few members of the village community who were either pregnant or carrying around their babies. The two girls couldn\u2019t help but beam at the knowledge that they too had new lives growing inside them. Sakura giggled in delight where as Hinata blush lightly and rubbed her belly, bright smiles on both of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the Yamanaka flower shop they knocked and were so usurerd in by Ino\u2019s mother towards the stairs. At the top of the steps Sakura took a look at Hinata and saw that the poor girl was rather breathless. In all honesty it wasn\u2019t that surprising seeing as how Hinata was a small girl and currently carrying around triplets inside her womb. Triplets that, though only a month along, were equal to three to four months or more in size due to the justu speeding up their growth. Suffice to say Hinata was carrying around a heavy load up the stairs. Sakura let the lavender eyed heiress catch her breath before moving to Ino\u2019s door and knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn\u2019t need to be told twice and quickly opened the door and walked in, Hinata fallowing shortly behind. Ino was currently lying on her bed, her face pointed towards the door while the sun shone through the window at her back. Sakura couldn\u2019t help but snort at this. \u201cSunning yourself Ino-pig? And here I thought only reptiles did that.\u201d Sakura was rather surprised when Ino simply yawned and calmly answered back with, \u201cYou\u2019ll understand when you get bigger Forehead, and then we will see who is mocking who. Right, Hinata?\u201d finished the blond as she winked a sleepy but, knowing look towards the shy girl. Hinata gave a small smile and light blush as a response. She was guilty of sunning herself and her belly on more than one occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura merely huffed but when she heard no response she grew slightly worried. \u201cHey Ino, You Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just really sleepy. I've felt like this all week. Shikamaru still has morning sickness but, Choji's fine, lucky jerk. Asuma-sensei says we need to exercise more for the babies but, how can we like this?!?\" Ino whined. Hinata merely nodded her head as she had had the same problem not too long ago, even now she would sometimes stop what she was doing and get lost in her own little world while rubbing her belly. Ino yawned again before asking how they and their teams were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all fine for the most part. Sasuke wasn't feeling too well and Naruto complains about his stomach sometimes but, all in all we seem pretty well off.\" Pinky started before turning to look at Hinata who seemed to be in her own little world. A small cough from Sakura snapped her out of it. \u201cOh, um. W-well Shino seems the s-same just a b-bit tired. K-Kiba however\u2026\u201d They saw how Hinata seemed to grimace at the thought of Kiba\u2019s condition. \u201cCome on Hinata. It can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u201d asked the blond. \u201cK-Kiba spends m-more time hanging over the t-toilet then anything. His m-morning sickness is pretty bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what about your sensei\u2019s?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi-sensei is going thru the pregnancy too.\" Both looked towards Hinata in question. \u201cK-Kurenai-sensei is to. I-I think she p-plans to keep t-this one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. How are you feeling about them?\" questioned the blond. Hinata grew slightly pink and ducked her head as she had an idea of what Ino meant, Sakura however, had a confused look on her face. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't they go over it with you? Sometimes people become attracted to the people whose babies they're carrying.\" The blond gave a glance towards Hinata and noticed her posture. \u201cHinata anything you want to say?\u201d The heiress in question gave the impression of being a deer in the headlights before quickly shaking her head side to side so fast the girls were worried she\u2019d get whiplash. \u201cYou sure Hinata?\u201d Ino teased. \u201cI mean it\u2019s not out of the ordinary for a young pregnant girl to fall for their sensei. I mean it\u2019s not like your carrying oh say\u2026 Naruto\u2019s babies. Right?\u201d Ino was having a lot of fun teasing the poor girl about her blond haired crush and the possible attraction towards her own female sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeewww\u2026 Ino don\u2019t even joke about that. I mean who would want to carry Naruto-baka\u2019s (idiot) kid?\u201d complained the pinket completely ruining the teasing moment. \u201cJeez Sakura, you don\u2019t need to act that disgusted about it. I mean you are his teammate. Besides, he can\u2019t be all that bad if Hinata likes him.\u201d Sakura grimaced \u201cThough it\u2019s true that he is my teammate that doesn\u2019t mean that I like him anymore than before. And what do you mean Hinata likes him? Hinata is to kind to just tell the baka off, she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u201d Ino was the only one to notice the change in demeanor of the sweet Hyuga and quickly grew scared. She had never seen an angry Hinata before and really didn\u2019t want to in her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura.\u201d Called the angered Hyuga in a voice that was far too sweet to match the malevolent aura surrounding her, something that Sakura only just caught on to. \u201cY-yes Hinata?\u201d asked the now scared pinket. \u201cShut up or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Stated the kind heiress; the gentle smile and sweet voice never leaving her as she threatened her crushes teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Ino decided to try and break the tension. \u201cHinata are you sure you\u2019re not carrying Naruto\u2019s babies?\u201d  Hinata blushed and lightly pat her belly. \u201cI-I\u2019m happy carrying Kurenai-sensei\u2019s b-baby.\u201d This however snapped Sakura out of her fearful mood and made her perk up in interest. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean her babies? Your carrying triplets aren\u2019t you?\u201d Hinata winced slightly as she realized she had miss-worded her sentence and she would pay the price right about\u2026 \u201cOoh!\u201d \u2026Now. \u201cHinata you didn\u2019t? I mean I never thought that someone in our age group would be able to pull it off\u2026\u201d rambled Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about Pig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?!? Jeez Sakura, for the supposedly smartest person in our class you are surprisingly uninformed.\u201d Scolded the blond. \u201cJust tell me Pig!\u201d Sakura growled while shaking her fist at Ino. The blond however just shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s called a Multi-donor pregnancy and is rather rare to find someone who will go through with it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Sakura who was now completely ignoring Hinata as the poor girl sat in a chair and sank in on herself, hoping to escape the questions that she knew would follow. \u201cA few reasons really. Multi-donor pregnancies or MDP\u2019s tend to take longer before birth due to the extra stress they put on the body. Plus you need at least two donors and there can be no relation between either donors or the girl getting the procedure. Another thing is that only females can do it as their bodies can naturally carry babies without justu. I\u2019m pretty sure there are some other things but, I can\u2019t seem to think of them right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls simply sat in silence for a short time before Sakura spoke back up. \u201cAnd you think that Hinata is doing this because of her slip of tongue and what I said?\u201d If that was all it took to convince Ino then Sakura was entitled to be rather skeptical. \u201cWell that and it would explain why she is so big as most MDP\u2019s tend to be larger for some reason then most normal pregnancies. It would also explain the whole \u2018I will kill you\u2019 thing from before as the ones who experience the greatest shifts in mood at random are those who do a MDP.\u201d Stated the blond with certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hinata\u201d asked Ino as both girls now turned towards the highly embarrassed Heiress. \u201cDid you do a Multi-Donor Pregnancy and if so are you using Naruto as the second father?\u201d Hinata knew that there was no turning back now, she had to answer or they would likely start blowing things out of proportion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hoped that Naruto didn\u2019t disapprove of her carrying his babies but, she had yet to hear anything back about it and was understandably starting to get worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Sakura near shouted as she shot up as if she had just realized something important. \u201cBy letter, did you mean a small scroll with real fancy writing in it and the symbol for <i>\u2018Motherhood\u2019</i> on the outside?\u201d When Hinata nodded Sakura planted her face in her hands and groaned. \u201cHinata I\u2019m sorry. We had no idea what that letter said.\u201d Confused by this Hinata asked for her to clarify what she meant. \u201cNaruto brought a scroll like that to us in hopes we could help him figure out what it said but, none of us could make out the fancy handwriting and were thus stumped. When we asked Kakashi-sensei, he read it over before eye smiling at us and told us that real ninja\u2019s won\u2019t have all the answers handed to them. And that we should try to figure it out by gathering info.\u201d Sakura paused for a moment, letting what she was saying sink in. \u201cAs you can see, that didn\u2019t work out as well as we had hoped.\u201d Hinata\u2019s shoulders sagged as she realized that Naruto didn\u2019t know about her being the soon-to-be mother of his two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there for a few moments before Ino sat up, a spark in her eyes telling all that she had an idea. \u201cSo let\u2019s just tell him!\u201d stated the blond as if it was the simplest thing in the world. Hinata however, disagreed. \u201cW-what? N-no, I, I can\u2019t.\u201d the shy heiress fearfully stuttered. Ino gave Hinata a look and simply sat there studying the young girl. She knew that Hinata wanted Naruto to know; else she would never have sent a letter herself to the blond boy. Thinking on it Ino realized that Hinata wasn\u2019t against telling Naruto, just that she feared doing it face to face. Understanding this Ino motioned Hinata to sit beside her on the bed, of which the young Hyuga did with confusion on her face. \u201cHinata why are you afraid to tell Naruto face-to-face?\u201d the blond gently probed. Hinata shrunk in on herself, wrapping herself around her baby filled belly. \u201cW-what if h-he does-sn\u2019t want to b-be a f-fat-ther? Wha-at if he\u2026\u201d Hinata didn\u2019t continue, simply curling in on herself dejectedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>\u2019What if he doesn\u2019t want you?\u2019</i> is what your trying to say, right?\u201d Hinata nodded. \u201cHinata, you need to remember that Naruto is an orphan. Now I don\u2019t know Naruto\u2019s view on it but, most orphans want a family. The idea that someone loves them being a big thing for them.\u201d Hinata considered this point for a moment before nodding. Even she knew that most orphans craved attention and love, especially the love of a family. But, there was still that other problem. \u201cB-but, what about\u2026\u201d she never got to finish as Ino interrupted her. \u201cHinata let me tell you right now that you are a beautiful young girl and if that baka can\u2019t see that then I\u2019ll happily pound it into him until he understands.\u201d Seeing Hinata slowly starting to relax Ino felt that it was best to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I think that when you meet with him you should wear something a bit\u2026 different, more flattering maybe. OH, I know! A nice dress should do the trick.\u201d Hinata however seemed a bit reluctant with the idea. \u201cA d-dress? W-why?\u201d Ino wrapped the shy girl in a one armed hug as she replied. \u201cHinata a dress is perfect for you. We can find one in a soft gentle color, something to complement your skin tone. I happen to know of one that would fit wonderfully. It should help to show off your curves and belly without showing too much skin. Not to mention your legs. Yummy!\u201d Ino was honestly getting a bit too into the idea as Hinata soon found out when Ino place a hand on her thigh and rubbed it, feeling her leg through the pants leg. \u201cOh my! Such strong legs, bet they look wonderfully toned and fit. If these babies don\u2019t make that baka start to drool in want for you then he\u2019s probably gay.\u201d The certainty in the blonds\u2019 voice grew only stronger as she continued to rub Hinata\u2019s legs, much to the poor girls\u2019 great embarrassment and oddly excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t kn-ow Ino.\u201d The shy heiress muttered. She sure didn\u2019t feel pretty, much less beautiful and thought that Ino was just saying things to make her feel better. \u201cHinata let me be strait up honest with you.\u201d Announced the blond before she brought her mouth to Hinata\u2019s ear and whispered something to her. Sakura watched as Hinata\u2019s face went such a bright red that it would make an apple turn green with envy, just before a small trickle of blood ran out of Hinata\u2019s nose and she fell back, completely out cold. Dumfounded, Sakura turned to Ino and asked what it was that she said to Hinata. Ino grinned before blushing lightly, \u201cJust telling her that if I was a lesbian I would have tried making hot passionate love to her already, due to how beautiful she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura couldn\u2019t help but, gape at that. \u201cYou\u2019re a lesbian? When?!? I thought you were after Sasuke?\u201d Ino snorted, looking almost insulted. \u201cNo I\u2019m not a lesbian but, I am a Yamanaka. As you know we work with mental justu and one of the requirements to do so successfully is to be of an open mind. If you took the time to ask around you\u2019d know that most Kunoichi in Konoha have at least one female friend/lover. Ninja tend to be rather open when it comes to sexual orientation.\u201d Ino noticed how Sakura seemed to be scooting away from her. \u201cOh please, you have nothing to worry about. If I\u2019m going to take a girl lover then they are going to have some curves sides the baby belly. Like Hinata!\u201d Ino says before groping the unconscious girl\u2019s breast \u201cWhen you get a set of knockers like these wonders <b>then</b> you can start worrying about me trying something.\u201d Sakura frowned at the jab at her body. <i>\u2018So my bodies not as curved as Hinata\u2019s. So what! That shouldn\u2019t make her the only one that gets to enjoy In\u2026\u2019 </i>Sakura caught herself and immediately backpedaled on her thoughts, not willing to believe that she had just been feeling jealous of Hinata getting another girls attention. She blamed the crazy hormones from her kids for such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head Sakura tried to get her mind back on track, while trying to keep the images of a pregnant Hinata and Ino making love out of her head. \u201cYou were saying something about telling Naruto?\u201d Ino look confused for a moment before sheepishly ceasing her groping of Hinata\u2019s breast and getting back to making plans. \u201cYeah, here is the idea. You know that tea shop, the <u><i>\u2018White Lotus Springs\u2019</i></u>?\u201d Ino asked hoping Sakura didn\u2019t know too much about some of their more\u2026 <i>\u2018unique\u2019</i> teas. This hope however, was dashed as Sakura narrowed her eyes at her. \u201cYou mean the one known for their sexual stimulating tea\u2019s on top of their more normal varieties? The shop that couples having trouble <i>\u2018getting off\u2019</i> go to for some <i>\u2018therapeutic teas\u2019</i>?\u201d Ino sweat dropped as she realized that Sakura did know about the shops less talked about side. The blond would admit that she was surprised that Sakura knew as most of the rookies aren\u2019t told till they have finished their first pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well, no point in trying to hide it now.\u2019</i> The blond thought. \u201cThe very one.\u201d Sakura nodded before continuing, \u201cAnd I guess that you plan to have them meet there, where Naruto will see Hinata in her dress and be told about how she is the mother of his two kids as well as the mother of her sensei\u2019s child.\u201d Seeing Ino nod Sakura continued \u201cWhere they will just so happen to get a sexual stimulating tea by <i>\u2018accident\u2019</i> and proceed to then have sex with each other, with us hoping that Naruto will remain with Hinata after as a way of staying faithful to her. Is that what you were planning?\u201d Ino noticed the accusing tone in her friends\u2019 voice but, brushed it off. \u201cActually, I was hoping that they would at least wait till they weren\u2019t in public to start doing the horizontal tango but, if they want everyone to see then that\u2019s their choice.\u201d The blond said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>OH YEAH!</b> Well let me tell you Ino that I\u2026\u201d she paused to see her blond friend starting to grow worried and mentally smirked \u201c\u2026 Whole Heartedly Approve! Now let\u2019s figure out a cover story for Hinata for when she <i>\u2018spends the night\u2019</i> with the baka blond.\u201d She finished, a grin on her face that nearly split it in half as she already had a few ideas on how to make this plan work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was nervous. Here she was, at the hospital awaiting the procedure that would make her a mother. Glancing to her sides she saw her teammates, Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame. Neither of them seemed to be taking this much better then herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed to herself in defeat. She didn\u2019t really want to be a mom just yet but, she didn\u2019t really get much of a choice. Out of all the Ninja to graduate from the academy only 9 normally passed the true test given by each sensei. Those nine were then separated out into teams of three, giving an average of three teams with each graduation. Those three teams were normally made to join this program sometime within 2 \u00bd years after graduating. This insured that each member would have at least one child who would join the ninja forces when they grew older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that is how things normally went. Hinata gave another small sigh as she remembered why they were being forced to do this so early. She didn\u2019t know why but, some of the higher members of Konoha\u2019s council had decided that Naruto would be forbidden from participating in this baby program and since this was done in teams, Team 7 would not be participating for the foreseeable future. Team 10 would have been next but, when Ch\u014dji got so nervous he ate himself into a food coma that pretty much excluded them. The fact that Ino would not have been likely to survive do to all her harmful dieting only reinforced this. So now it was up to Team 8 to provide enough babies\u2019s to equal out the loss of two teams. She was not looking forward to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth it wasn\u2019t really a bad thing for the Inuzuka and Aburame clans. Though they had clan status, their numbers were frightfully low. Out of the entire clans the Inuzuka had only 12 active shinobi members out of a clan of 20. The rest were too old, injured or too young to be counted among the active. The Aburame weren\u2019t much better off. They were a clan of 13 total, with only 8 active members. Compared to her clan of at least 60 members with over two-thirds of them being active members of the ninja forces, her teammates clans were more likely to be wiped out then hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was snapped from her thoughts by her sensei\u2019s voice. \u201cWell team, I hope you are ready. It\u2019s nearly time for us to start.\u201d Hinata was very thankful for her sensei joining them as sensei\u2019s didn\u2019t really need to do this. She took a deep breath to help herself relax. In most procedures teams would be given the genetic material of either their teammates or sensei. This however would not be true for teams composed of clans, like theirs. Because of this they were given a choice to either receive from their sensei or to be given the genetic info of someone of their choosing as long as they had it in storage, meaning they had to be ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to the doors as the doctor in charge of the procedure stepped in. \u201cWell everyone, I hope you are all doing well and we can get this done quickly without any issues. As I\u2019m sure all of you know we will be performing two different justu on each of you. One will of course get you pregnant with your previously chosen donor. The other however will have some different effects on you depending on your gender. For the boys it will simply insure you are able to carry the children till the birthing time, which for males is much sooner than the girls. Luck you as this means you will be joining us for a second time before the girls are anywhere ready to give birth.\u201d A small twisted grin could be seen upon the doctors\u2019 face showing that they found the misery of the two young boys amusing. \u201cThe ladies however will find themselves affected slightly differently. Seeing as how the female body is naturally capable of bearing child the second justu will instead allow you to carry far more children then you normally could without having to worry about popping from too many babies or those nasty stretch marks you would usually get. The down side is that you will be pregnant for a lot longer, one year at least.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor allowed them a few moments to ask any questions they had before going over the pregnancy plans. Hinata learned that Kiba was trying for a small litter but, would likely need to settle for twins, were as Shino was going to start of small with only one. During that time she used her Byakugan to take a quick peek at the list, just to make sure she was getting the babies of the person she wanted. Seeing that she would be having herself little Uzumakis\u2019, Hinata shutdown her eyes. She was rather embarrassed and honored when she found saw her sensei would be performing a multi-donor pregnancy with one child from Asuma Sarutobi and surprisingly a request for twins using her own donated genes. The doctor however was quick to snap her back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, Hinata Hyuga. It says here that\u2026 No that can\u2019t be right. Hyuga-san are you sure you want <b><i>\u2018that\u2019</i></b> boy as the father?\u201d Hinata was thankful that the doctor had worded the question without revealing who she wanted. \u201cY-yes Doctor-san, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She watched the doctor for any signs of distaste or hate but, saw only disinterest. \u201cVery well now it says you want to try for quintuplets but, even with the justu on you I personally believe your body will only be able to handle triplets. Will that be acceptable?\u201d the doctor asked. A small nod was given in answer. \u201cExcellent, now let us begin. We will need to put you under of course. Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll be awake and out of here within a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t the pregnancy but, it was part of the problem. As much as Hinata hated to admit to it, her panties just weren\u2019t cutting it anymore. She had always worn panties but, now that she was half way through the normal timeframe for her babies to grow she had found that her panties wouldn\u2019t fit her new shape anymore. She had gone out with Kurenai-sensei to a maternity store and was talked into buying some kind of camisole nightie with two sets of its matching panties, though they seemed more thong-like then anything. Hinata briefly looked back at the cami sitting on her folded futon.  It was a gorgeous black satin with a bust enhancing, not that she needed it being rather big for her age, underwire and a middle clasp to create lift and give her developing cleavage some support. The mesh coverage had an adjustable lace up the front allowing her to loosen or tighten it as needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment though she was standing in front of her full body mirror in nothing but, the panties turning from side to side while running her hands along her soft skin. She knew that she wasn\u2019t fat and she loved her growing unborn children dearly but, she couldn\u2019t help but worry what Naruto would think when he saw her. It was common practice to inform the donor of the gene\u2019s if someone chose them for the baby program. The standard time was around the three month mark for girls. As such Hinata knew that Naruto knew someone had asked to use his genes for the impregnation process but, due to the notice leaving out everything but, the gender of the receiver Naruto would have no idea that she was the mother-to-be of his kids. She couldn\u2019t help but, sigh at this fact as it would be up to her to tell him if she wished him to know. The fact that she intended to keep her children, rather than give them up to the Ninja child reserves center only made telling him that much more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018But that in of itself is the problem. I can\u2019t get anywhere near him or even think about him without acting oddly.\u2019</i> The young mother-to-be mourned to herself within the confines of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving started up near the beginning of her forth month, Hinata had started reacting oddly to Naruto. If she saw him walking around she would have this urge to hug him and not let go, or the more recent time she had been near him and had gotten a whiff of his scent, his natural odor and had wanted to bite him. What?!? She thought he smelled like cinnamon. Sometimes she would wake up during the night all hot and bothered, her breathing heavy and panting. She would lie back in bed and wish Naruto was there with her so she could\u2026 well she wasn\u2019t really sure what she would do to him but, something told her it would be naughty and adult rated. Her most resent encounter with her blond fantasy was little over a month ago. She hadn\u2019t even realized that she was running, as well as a four to five month pregnant thirteen year old could run, towards him till she was just about to jump on him from behind. Trying to stop herself had left her in an awkward position and caused her to fall over herself. Thankfully she managed to twist herself around and land on her bottom, well it was more of her tailbone so yeah, painful. Naruto had at least noticed and been kind enough to pick her up and help her back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very same day Naruto left on his first C-rank mission leaving Hinata to feel lonely and somewhat depressed, she had very much wanted to snuggle with the warm and vibrant blond. Now she had heard that he would be back either today or tomorrow and a part of her, spurred on by her unbalanced hormones, wanted to welcome him back in a way that would be memorable. That was what left her in her current dilemma. She wanted to wear something that wouldn\u2019t make think less of her but, would still proudly showoff her full belly. Hinata liked her baby belly, she had come to love rubbing her hands against it or to feel the warm sun gently caressing her taut skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in nothing but her panties she began to gently rub her belly. Due to the nature of the pregnancy she couldn\u2019t use her Byakugan to see how many she was carrying but, the doctors and medics had assured her she had either quadruplets or her requested quintuplets growing inside her. She was rather large for only six months but, she didn\u2019t really mind. In fact she was proud of her size but, even she worried what would happen to her if her pregnancy lasted longer than the standard one year. <i>\u2018Three years is the longest anyone was ever pregnant from these justu. As much as I love my kids I hope I don\u2019t have to lug them around for that long.\u2019</i> She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish sensei was here. She\u2019d have some ideas on what I could wear\u2026 and I\u2019d get to see my other two unborn.\u201d She said to herself while muttering the last part under her breath so only she would hear it. The fact that she was technically going to be a \u2018father\u2019 to two of the three babies Kurenai-sensei was carrying didn\u2019t bother her much to her own surprise. She felt honored that her sensei felt such a connection to her that she would want to \u2018officially\u2019 bring her into the family sort of speak. She was brought out of her own little world by a voice on the other side of her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister! Are you done yet? There are people\u2026\u201d Hanabi Hyuga, Hinata\u2019s little sister paused as she threw open the door only to look in and find her older sister in nothing but a pair of rather suggestive black panties. The moment of awkward silence was broken however by an \u201cEeep!\u201d as Hinata tried to cover herself with her hands in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHanabi! Don\u2019t you know to knock before coming in to someone else\u2019s room!?!\u201d Though she didn\u2019t yell, her voice was louder than its usual volume, the fact that she didn\u2019t stutter only made it more impressive. \u201cS-sorry, sister.\u201d The Hyuga munchkin stammered in surprise and shock before moving completely into her sisters\u2019 room and closing the door so no one else saw her sister nearly nude. \u201cSister, why are you so, um\u2026 under dressed? It\u2019s nearly noon.\u201d Hanabi quietly asked, her eyes roaming from Hinata\u2019s face down to the panties then back up, stopping on her older sisters\u2019 pregnant belly. While Hinata knew Hanabi was curious about pregnancy and that she was anxious to be pregnant like Hinata. The whole stuffing pillows and her stuffed dolls up the front of her shirt and following Hinata around sort of gave it away. But, something Hinata didn\u2019t know was that Hanabi was actually a bit jealous of the babies Hinata was carrying as they would get to meet and know their mother. Hanabi also knew that she would have to share her older sister/mother figure when the babies were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata waved her little sister over before sitting in seiza (folding their legs underneath their thighs, while resting the buttocks on the heels) as best as she could and wrapped the little girl in a comfortable one armed hug. \u201cI\u2019m still like this because I can\u2019t decide what to wear.\u201d Hinata freely admitted to her younger sister before looking to her belly and rubbing it with her other hand.  \u201cI want to show someone special to me that I\u2019m proud to be full of so many babies that will one day call me mother. But, I don\u2019t want this person to think poorly of me either. So I\u2019m at a loss as to what I should wear that will impress them but, not give them the wrong ideas, get it?\u201d Hinata watched as Hanabi furrowed her brow in thought for a few moments before huffing in annoyance. \u201cSounds stupid and complicated. Why can\u2019t you just wear what you normally do? Just because your old attire is getting tight around your belly that doesn\u2019t make you any less pretty. So why should you wear something you may not like?\u201d questioned Hanabi as she hugged her sister and gently rested her head against one of Hinata\u2019s bountiful breasts.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBefore Hinata could answer a knock was heard at her door. \u201cLady Hinata,\u201d one of the branch members most likely, a woman from the sounds of it. \u201cThere is a guest waiting to see you, do you wish for me to let them in?\u201d Hinata gave a look towards her sister, figuring out now why she had barged in earlier. Hanabi however, either didn\u2019t notice this or choose to ignore it as she busied herself by snuggling against Hinata\u2019s bosom and listened to her heart beat, much like she enjoyed doing when she was a toddler. \u201cN-no, thank you. I\u2019ll be with them in j-just a moment.\u201d She answered while channeling her chakra to activate her Byakugan to see who it was at the entrance.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had made her think that this would be a good idea. Hinata was currently sitting in a corner off to the side, watching as almost every member of the Rookie Nine partied. The party had been done as a thanks from the other teams as well as a congrats to team 8 for the successful pregnancies. In fact, the only member not in the private room at the Bar-BQ restaurant was Kiba and that was due to him still feeling rather under the weather. Hinata didn\u2019t understand how he could still be feeling the effects of pregnancy since he had his kids shortly after the five month mark, like Shino. As such this made the party more for her then the team as a whole but, Hinata felt better thinking it was for her teammates as well.<br>\r\nIdly Hinata tugged at her clothes. She still had on her new panties but, had quickly slipped into her now rather tight pants and much too small shirt. In exchange, she had been forced to forgo any bra, not that she had one that would fit her pregnancy enhanced bosom. Right now a small part of Hinata couldn\u2019t help but, blame Naruto for her current position. <i>\u2018Stupid wonderful blond with gorgeous eyes... Why did he have to invite me and look so adorable doing it?\u2019</i> She mentally ranted to herself. She used this as an excuse to look for the scrumptious blond, the term oddly making her hungry, just not for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally found said blond calmly walking towards her with two cups in hand and\u2026 <i>\u2018Wait. Towards ME!?!\u2019</i> Hinata started to panic as she realized that her crush and unknowing father of her children was walking straight towards her. <i>\u2018Oh, god! WHAT DO I DO? He\u2019s coming right towards and there\u2019s nothing to hide behind and, god does he have to look so HOT!?!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Hinata!\u201d greeted the blond, a genuine smile on his face. \u201cH-hello N-n-naruto.\u201d Greeted the pregnant heiress as she struggled to keep from fidgeting. <i>\u2018When did it get so hot in here?\u2019</i> she questioned herself while trying to look at the boy who brought her to this party.  \u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d he asked while offering one of the two cups \u201cDon\u2019t worry we made sure there was nothing that could hurt your babies in it.\u201d Hinata took the offered cup and thanked him before taking a sip; she hadn\u2019t realized how thirsty she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you enjoying yourself so far?\u201d Hinata noticed how his eyes moved towards her belly as he asked and realized he was asking about the babies, not the party. \u201cV-very much.\u201d She started her other hand moving to her belly and rubbing it. \u201cA-at first I was scared of this but, now I\u2019m really glad it happened. I j-just hope that they g-get to meet their f-father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to choose the father right? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hearing at least.\u201d Asked the curious blond. Hinata gave a nod and a small smile in response. \u201cWell, if you chose him then he must be a great guy or girl\u2026 I\u2019m sure the father would want to meet their kids.\u201d He stated with certainty not noticing the pleased and dreamy look she was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would continue this for the next few hours, never knowing that someone else\u2019s carefully laid plan had just been unknowingly ruined by the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Moments before</u></b><br>\r\nA blond girl standing nearby the punch quickly looked around herself trying not to draw anyone\u2019s attention as she set her plan to snag Sasuke for herself in motion. Ino Yamanaka pulled out a small vile with some kind of milky white liquid in it. She poured half into one of the cups of punch and the rest into another. <i>\u2018With this arousal mixture Sasuke will be mine by the end of the night. I knew this would be worth all the hard work to grow the proper plants without letting daddy find out.\u2019</i> The mixture was crafted with specially made plants grown by her family. Instead of a nearly instant arousal or a momentary delayed one, this mixture would release into the consumers bloodstream slowly over hours letting it build up so things seemed more natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno chuckled to herself only to yelp as someone tapped her shoulder. \u201cAAAAHHHH!\u201d turning she saw her heavy set teammate looking at her with a confused and startled expression. \u201cIno is everything ok?\u201d asked the genuinely worried boy. \u201cDamn it Ch\u014dji, DON\u2019T DO THAT!!!\u201d Ino would spend the next few minutes assuring her porky friend and teammate that everything was alright, before turning back to the cups and being unable to remember which ones held the mixture. She never noticed the blond boy walking away from the table with two cups of punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Hours Later</u></b><br>\r\nThe party had finally ended and with Naruto using some clones to clean up, everyone had made their exit. Hinata and Naruto however, where both feeling a bit odd and Naruto had offered to bring her to his place, which was closer, so they could rest and let whatever it was blow over. Neither had expected things to turn out like they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was breathing hard and leaning her back against one of the walls in Naruto\u2019s apartment. Naruto himself was hovering no more than a few inches away, his arms pressed firmly against the wall on either side of the flustered and rather horny heiress. Lust was taking hold of the two as Naruto leaned in closer to her, his lips just barely brushing hers. The moment she felt his lips brush against hers she pushed herself forward, claiming his lips in a kiss that quickly became heated and lustful. His hands traveled down until they rested against the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his pleasure clouded mind he had enough sense to step slightly to the side so he wasn\u2019t mashing himself against her belly as he pulled her closer. Hinata\u2019s hands took this moment to wander a little of their own. Brushing against chest as they move up before finding their target, his golden locks. Hinata happily indulged herself in running her fingers through his spiky sunshine hair even as she was forced to break their kiss so she could breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings simple continued to get even more out of hand from then on. Naruto\u2019s hands moving up and under her jacket and shirt, running over her heated skin making her moan in pleasure. She wasn\u2019t idle however, as she quickly returned the favor by unzipping his jacket and letting her hands travel down his shirt covered chest before reaching the bottom and moving back up under the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with this things could have been stop before they went as far as they did but, the moment Naruto went a bit too high and brushed against her bare breast any chance of things stopped ended. There would be some complaints filed the next day about all the noise the two made during their coupling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Very late that night/very early that morning</u></b><br>\r\nHe had no idea how long he simply lied there in his bed gazing out through the window at the night sky. It was a beautiful sight and yet, he found the image of the young pregnant heiress sleeping soundly in his bed even more captivating. That\u2019s why he tried to avoid looking at her. It only served to remind him that this night of pleasure and acceptance would likely never happen again. <i>\u2018After all who could possibly love me once they find out about Kyuubi being sealed inside me?\u2019</i> he thought bitterly. Though, even these thoughts couldn\u2019t stop him from remembering all that they had just done and the feelings such actions had made him feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He thought of how he had touched her, how he had felt as his fingers gently skimmed across her skin making her squeal and squirm in the most delightful of ways. He could remember the feel of her full bosom cupped in his hands, the taste of her skin when he ran his tongue over parts of her. He recalled the warm sensation that just seemed to burst inside his chest when he kissed her the first time and how that feeling seemed to quiver and grow every time their lips met after. He remembered how he had her screaming his name in pleasure on more than one occasion during the night. But most of all, he could still feel the phantom sensations of the feeling she gave him when she took him into herself, surrounded him might be a better way of putting it. Even now he longed for that feeling again, the warmth of her body as they connected, the feeling of her inner walls tightening to an almost vice like grip around him and how they moaned and yelled each other\u2019s name as they achieved completion. He couldn\u2019t stop from chuckling lightly as he recalled how she had started talking dirty to him about how she wanted him to coat her inner chambers in his essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small shake of the head before turning towards his bedmate. He couldn\u2019t help but, find her beautiful. Her skin a fair creamy-white while her short night colored hair was a bit messy due to their repeated activities. Naruto watched as the naked beauty shivered lightly before scooting closer to him, looking for the warmth that his body gave to repeal the slight night chill, one that the thin blanket draped up to the bottom of her breast did nothing against. He pulled the blanket up so as to cover his naked angel before gently bringing one arm around her and pulling her a bit closer. He let himself indulge in the moment by burying his face in her hair and taking a deep breath, enjoying the sensation of excitement and relaxation that her natural scent gave him. With it, he pushed the worries he had of her thinking their night together as a mistake to the back of his mind. He had no way of knowing if she would regret their night together in the morning or not but, he decided that he would simply enjoy the here and now while he still could. And with that Naruto wished his nighttime angel sweet dreams before drifting off into a pleasant sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was warm. She felt so warm that she didn\u2019t want to wake up. This wasn\u2019t to be however as a fluttering sensation from her belly started to rouse her. She curled up a bit more and tried to escape to that warmth she felt, the source feeling so close to her. Despite her attempts to avoid it, consciousness eventually took hold and with it a feeling of restlessness that wouldn\u2019t allow her to remain in bed. Quietly groaning to herself as she moved away from the warmth that held her she shivered gently as the cool morning air hit her. The moment her feet touched the cold floor however, she yelped in shock at the cold and only now noticed that she was naked. Blushing brightly at her nakedness she looked around her room for something to wear only to realize that she wasn\u2019t in her room. Hinata hurriedly searched for a way out only to see what she was sure would be the most shocking thing she\u2019d see all day. A crop of sun blond hair and the boy it belonged to resting on the bed that she had just vacated. <i>\u2018Naruto-kun!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried to remember what had lead to her sleeping naked in bed with an equally naked blond boy. Then the events of last night slowly started to come back to her. Her face light up so red that a cherry would be jealous but, she refused to faint as that could hurt her babies. She needed to get away from his naked body and think about what had happened. As she moved out of Naruto\u2019s bedroom she wondered what would happen with their relationship. Hinata didn\u2019t think that Naruto would suddenly start liking her just because they slept together. <i>\u2018Did we really do what I think we did?\u2019</i> she wondered. A dull pain struck her from between her legs and she realized that there was no denying what they had done. She could only hope that Naruto wouldn\u2019t think poorly of her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly growled, letting Hinata know she and her babies were hungry. She looked to her belly and rubbed it gently only to notice that she had completely forgotten to find some clothes before stepping out of Naruto\u2019s room. She blushed in a mix of embarrassment, shame and oddly excitement at the knowledge that she was walking around her crushes home stark naked. She didn\u2019t want to go back into his room out of fear he would wake but, she didn\u2019t want to be completely naked either. She was lucky to find something she could put on after a little looking. Sad to say it didn\u2019t really cover much though, as it was just a frilly pink apron that said \u201cKiss Me. I\u2019m Sexy!\u201d She had wondered why Naruto would have such a thing but, soon found a note on it that told her it had been a joke gift from Kakashi-sensei. Thankfully it was something clearly made for the ninja population of Konoha as she felt the seals in the fabric adjust the apron so it would fit around her belly without being too tight. She was still embarrassed at how it really didn\u2019t cover much and that her back was fully exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing her discomfort off as best as she could in favor of getting something to eat, Hinata looked in the fridge and was shocked at how bare it was. Despite this she still managed to find enough ingredients to make some Oyakodon. She hoped that he would like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished cooking Hinata put the large bowl of Oyakodon on the table before she started cleaning up the cooking area. She didn\u2019t want to leave a mess behind. She was so focused on finishing her cleaning and getting to the breakfast she had made that she didn\u2019t notice the presence of a person behind her until she was hugged from behind. \u201cEeeppp!\u201d she nearly turned and gave her attacker a hard gentle fist strike. The only thing that saved them was hearing a familiar voice whisper in her ear, \u201cSmells delicious.\u201d She froze at that as her heartbeat doubled. \u201cN-naru-uto?\u201d She felt her whole body flush as he kissed her neck before saying, \u201cGood morning beautiful. I see you have breakfast made already.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but shiver slightly as his hot breath brushed against her ear and his hands rubbed soft circles over her apron covered belly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m feeling kind of hungry myself. Think you can help me with that?\u201d he asked with a husky voice just before giving her ear a nibble. \u201cI-I made pl-lenty of\u2026\u201d she tried to stutter out before being interrupted by a soft chuckle from the blond. \u201cAs good as I\u2019m sure your cooking is, there\u2019s something else I was hoping to have this morning.\u201d His hands slipped under her apron and started rubbing her bare skin, exciting her greatly. She gave a small gasp as something poked her between her legs and Naruto\u2019s statement soon became clear. \u201cM-m-me?\u201d Her response was a growl as Naruto left butterfly kisses on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Naruto was awake and wanted\u2026 with her? Now? She turned her neck to look at him and saw that Naruto seemed a bit different. His eyes weren\u2019t the bright blue that she had come to know and love but, a darker shade of blue that sent excited tingles all over her body. The pupils she noticed seemed sharper, more animal like and blended in well with the dark blue surrounding it. In truth Hinata felt like she was looking into the deep depths of the ocean. It was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto brought her out of her gazing with a kiss to her lips. Shocked but not displeased Hinata hesitantly returned the kiss. She felt Naruto\u2019s body press harder against her and realized that at some point her apron had come undone. If that wasn\u2019t enough of a shock, she got another one when her brain made the connection that Naruto was naked! A small gasp escaped her as she felt Naruto brush his hands against the bottom of her breast. \u201cSo Hina?\u201d he asked as he nuzzled her cheek, \u201cWhat should be my breakfast? The food? Or maybe, You?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hinata prayed in her mind as the two started to get more and more fervent with their 'heavy petting'. That is until Hinata's stomach rumbled loudly again reminding the pregnant girl why she was in the kitchen in the first place. Hinata resists the urge to curse outloud mentally bemoaning her body for ruining the moment, but rather than that Naruto just gives a warm and gentle cuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems we'll have to wait before we can really get things started, but that doesn't mean breakfast can't be fun.\" Naruto leans close and gives Hanata a loving kiss on the cheek before gently leading her over to his dinning table. He set's her down on a chair, where she flinches a little as her naked buttoks touch the cold wood. Then Naruto with the oyakodon bowl in hand seats himself on another chair in front of her. Naruto gives Hinata another warm smile before using some chopsticks to scoop a bunch of noodles out of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Hinata do a favor and open wide.\" Naruto carefully lifts the noodles to Hinata's mouth, the young girl gets it immediately and does as he says, Naruto places the noodles into her open mouth, then Hinata slowly and carefully slurps the noodles up, the food tasting doubly delicious as the love of her life was feeding her, once the line of noodles were fully in her mouth Hinata swallows and gives off a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second Hina-chan!\" Comments Naruto as he set the bowl and chopsticks down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a little broth on your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really where?\" Asks Hinata as he cheeks start to turn red from embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" Whispers Naruto as he leans in and gives Hinata another mindnumblingly amazing kiss on the lips, his tounge slowly working its way around her mouth, as a shiver of pleasure runs up her spine. After a few seconds Naruto slowly pulls back and gives her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my turn.\" Hinata looks over at the bowl, and gets the idea, she then starts to return the favor, buy scoping a mouthfull of noodles into Naruto's mouth. Of course Naruto's slurping is a little less delicate sending little droplets of broth flying all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear now you've got broth all over your face.\" Comments Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Replies Naruto, just before Hinata presses her own lips to his, while one of her hands driffts to her pregnant tummy, as the babies sensing the mommies excitement start to kick and twist. And so it goes, the two feeding and kissing eachother back and forth until the bowl is completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well would you look at that, all gone. Now then how about some dessert?\" Asked Naruto with a suggestive waggle of his eyebrows. Hinata starts to breath rapidly her heart raced, her face turned bright red. 'This is really happening!' She cheered in her mind. But before the two could move to the bedroom, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gives off a frustrated growl, while Hinata lets out a panicked squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Naruto yells at the door his eyes turning dark red for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Who is it?\" Naruto yells at the door his irritation at the sudden interruption heard clearly in his voice while his eyes flashed a dark red for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Naruto, is that any way to talk to your wonderful and awesome sensei, who is currently the only reason a certain Jounin of Team 8 hasn't found you just yet?\" Drawled a lazy voice that could only belong to Naruto's sensei, Hatake Kakashi. Naruto gave annoyed huff at knowing his chances of getting rid of his sensei and having a nice morning round of <i>'pleasurable activities'</i> had practically hit rock bottom. Naruto had half a mind to simply ignore his sensei in favor of dealing with the rather obvious hard-on that he was sporting. The fact that he currently had a beautiful, naked and pregnant young girl in his apartment only strengthened that desire. Sadly, he knew that if he did ignore the door in favor of having fun, his sensei would just enter by some other means and would purposely embarrass them in some manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to look at the girl in his apartment, he couldn't help but, suddenly feel a great sense of appreciation for his sensei while enjoying the view of Hinata's backside as she tried to cover herself with the discarded apron. She must have felt his eyes on her rump as she suddenly spun around to face him with a massive blush on her face. He couldn't help but, find her attempts to cover herself rather cute. He did after all plan to strip her nude and have her screaming in passionate lovemaking again as soon as he got rid of his bothersome sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing another knock from the door and a subtle threat from the masked cyclops to simply enter on his own, Naruto sighed and yelled at him to wait a moment. Instead, Naruto walked over to his angel from last night and with a quick kiss told her to wait in his bedroom. He of course used to opportunity to grab her rump getting a startled squeak out of the girl before she rushed into the bedroom. Once, the bedroom door was firmly closed, Naruto went and opened up his apartment door, not caring in the slightest that he was still stark naked with a raging boner. If Kakashi was bothered by this, he sure made no sign of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun I take it?\" Joked the cyclops with his trademark eye-smile. \"I was about too, till you showed up. Can't this wait for like, a few hours or something?\", complained the boy. He wanted to get back to his naked angel already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly not.\", admitted the veteran ninja as he simply walked in, much to Naruto angered protests. The boys anger calmed somewhat as a seal suddenly appeared on his door from a jutsu his sensei had done without his knowing. \"Alright, I'll bit! What is this about that you need to use a privacy/silencing seal in my apartment?\" He would admit that having such a thing would be good a little later once he got back to Hinata. He didn't need to give his neighbors another reason to try busting down his door and killing him in his sleep. He'd had enough of those attempts some years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've clearly been busy with each other judging from smell alone.\", commented the man and causing a light blush to grace the boys cheeks. \"I know that this is going to sound weird and maybe even more then a little wrong, but I need to know everything that has happened between the two of you in the last 24 hours. Now before you start yelling at me, know that there is a reason behind this. No, it is not a perverse one but, one that pertains to your heritage as an Uzumaki.\" The last part caught Naruto's attention and after a little work Kakashi was able to pull the story of the last 24 hours out of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Well first, I'd like to say congratulations on getting yourself a girlfriend.\" As much as the praise from his sensei may have meant to him, it also reminded him that Hinata was still patiently waiting his return in the bedroom, making him rather anxious to get back to her. \"Second Naruto, I'd like to tell you a few things about the Uzumaki's and their customs in regards to sexual relationships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour and a half, Kakashi told him things about his clan that he had always wanted to know, and a few things that he didn't. First, he learned that he was son of a women named Kushina Uzumaki, the last known survivor of the Uzumaki clan from the Land of Whirlpool. After his little fit of not being told this sooner, Naruto learned a few surprising things about his clan. First, that where most Uzumaki were quite open about sexual relationships, this that held the burden of the Ky\u016bbi seemed to be a bit different. Most Uzumaki could enjoy intercourse with various partners but, one that held the burden of the fox tended to find themselves drawn to only one person after a certain age. This one person would be the only one that they would mate with and would by clan law, be considered married to them the moment they did so. As if to prove this fact, Kakashi asked Naruto to think of every women he had ever met and try to think of being intimate with them. Naruto didn't find it bad in the slightest that Hinata was the only girl that he could envision himself doing such a thing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto also learned that he would find himself much more aggressive in a number of things if it somehow involved Hinata, whither it involved mounting her and making her scream his name in ecstasy or protecting her from potential harm didn't matter. On a side note, he had also learned that Uzumaki tended to make great lovers as they had the stamina to go for nearly a week strait doing nothing but, making love to their mate. It sure explained why Naruto was still so raring to go after the night he shared with Hinata. He silently wondered if she would approve of spending a week just sleeping, eating and fucking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time for Kakashi to leave, though Naruto did manage to drag out a promise from the man to help keep Kurenai from freaking out about her students disappearance. With that done, he turned towards his bedroom door just as Hinata opened it and peeked out. \"N-naru-kun?\", called the bashful girl as she blushed, realizing that she had just called her crush and father of her children by a pet name. \"Yes, Hina.\" This only caused Hinata's blush to worsen as Hina, though part of her name, could on its own translate to 'beautiful'. \"I-I'm feeling kind of sticky. Could, could I use the s-s-shower, please?\" Hinata couldn't believe that she was actually asking to use the shower in her beloved apartment. A part of her both wondered and hoped he would join her, making her excited and causing the babies to wiggle around in her womb.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto had been quick to give Hinata an okay and as soon as he did Hinata half ran-half waddled to the bathroom, blushing the whole time as she could feel his hungry eyes follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was slightly disappointed to see that Hinata had put her panties back on; yet the sight of her fishcake patterned pantie covered tush still left the boy hungry with want as his eyes locked on to her backside. He felt almost mesmerized by slight swaying of Hinata's hips, as it made her ass look simply irresistible. The blonde Genin finally snapped out of his daze when he heard the sound of the shower being turned on. Naruto cursed to himself as he found he was harder than ever after watching Hinata and suddenly a wicked thought entered his mind and a sly grin spread on his face. Licking his lips in anticipation he quickly scurried towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hummed softly to herself, as the hot water of the shower splashed her body. Truth be told, the water didn't need to be that hot considering the heat the Hyuga girl was radiating at that moment. The sight of Naruto's naked, body and the reaction his body had at the mere sight of her earlier had already worked Hinata up. She groaned slightly as her hormonal thoughts demanded her to just leave the shower and march back into the bedroom with no other purpose than to ravish her beloved blond. A small part of her wondered if he would resist her advance and the thought of taking him anyway made her shiver at the odd sense of excitement and power the mere thought gave her. Shaking her head to drive away such sinful thoughts, Hinata sighed in frustration, as she ran her fingers through her wet hair, before she gasped in surprise, as she felt two familiar arms encircle her before pulling her back against a certain blonds body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na-Naru-kun.\u2026wh-what are you doing?\" Hinata stammered in both shock and excitement, before she bit her bottom lip in pleasure, from Naruto placing kisses on her sensitive neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought we could save time and conserve the water by showering together Hina-chan.\" Naruto answered in a husky voice, before his hands moved up to cup Hinata's breasts eliciting a throaty moan from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\u2026but...\" Hinata began to say in protest. She wanted this but she didn't want Naruto to think that she was desperate or something. Thankfully she didn't have to try fighting her desire for long as she suddenly found herself spun around with Naruto's lips crashing down upon her own silencing her, before he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much talking, more kissing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then kissed her once again and after a few seconds Hinata's arms wrapped around his neck and she pulled her body as close to his as she could without possible hurting the babies; even with her belly in the way she still managed to greatly deepen the kiss. As they were kissing with the spray of the shower still pelting the two lovers, Hinata felt something hard jabbing the underside of her round stomach. Reluctantly breaking the kiss, the Hyuga girl looked down and her breath caught in her throat when she saw it was Naruto's very large and pronounced...arousal that was poking her belly. Unconsciously licking her lips as she marveled at his piece, it never ceased to amaze Hinata no matter how many times she saw Naruto's impressive...attribute. From experience she had also found that it never failed to instantly ignite a fire within her. However, Hinata was snapped out of her thoughts when she felt Naruto's fingers graze the underside of her pronounce belly, heading strait for her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na-Naru-kun!\" Hinata moaned into the hand that she had brought up, as her head fell back and she reveled in the pleasure, when she suddenly felt him slip a finger inside of her and slowly pump it in and out. Hinata's cries were muffled by her hand, but Naruto figured he was doing something right, as the volume of her moans was steadily increasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Naruto reached up and grabbed Hinata's hand, pulling it away from her face so he could watch the cute faces she made as he added another finger into her and began moving his hand faster. Naruto growled with exhilaration from the look on Hinata's face at this action; her eyes seem to glaze over, before they rolled back into her head and her mouth opened, as if emitting a silent scream while her body actively thrust her hips against his hand. When Hinata felt Naruto add another finger to the wonderful ministrations he was doing to her, she nearly lost all control. She reached out and gripped one of Naruto's shoulders from the feeling of another finger and the increased speed of Naruto's hand pumping in and out of her was driving the Hyuga girl to the edge, as she felt her orgasm swiftly approaching. Suddenly, as if struck by a lightning bolt, Hinata threw her head back and screamed in delight, while her pussy clamped down on Naruto's fingers trapping them and he could only watch with satisfaction she rode out her orgasm, twisting and gyrating her hips on his hand as she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Hinata could even start to recover from the euphoric sexual haze Naruto had driven her to. She suddenly found herself turned around and pushed forward until her cheek was resting on the tiled wall of the shower in front of her, as was the top of her round belly. Hinata then felt Naruto start to bend her over, while stroking, cupping, and squeezing both of her ass cheeks, causing the cold of the tiles to lessen from her belly but now starting to feel her hard nipples press against the wall. Naruto was too busy to notice this as he looked down on what he considered the most beautiful, pristine, and hottest ass in all the world and felt himself harden even more; if such a thing was even possible. He began to tease Hinata a bit, as he thrust his dick through her ass cheeks enjoying the feeling of their softness surrounding his cock before pressing the tip of it at the entrance to her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the very horny Hyuga was not amused by her lovers teasing and was aching to be taken from behind by him. Pressing her hands against the tile wall in front of her for support, she suddenly pushed her ass out and impaled herself onto the object of her desire in one smooth stroke. A guttural moan erupted from Naruto, when Hinata did this and he pressed forward himself, until he was fully sheathed within her. Taking a moment to relish in this pleasurable feeling, Naruto slowly drew back causing Hinata to mewl in disappointment, before he slammed back into her and she screamed in ecstasy. Naruto then built up a piston-like rhythm and began pounding in and out of Hinata with ever-increasing speed, as Hinata shrieked with delight with every hard fast thrust she received.</span></div></div>",

Naruto however nearly stopped his massage and paled at hearing that. Thankfully, he managed to keep his hands working as he found a rather tight group of muscles in his lovers inner thigh. He nearly gave stupid looking smile as he took advantage of the excuse to touch her soft upper legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a no to the father till a later date. Like after I know how to escape a vengeful father with an all seeing eye... What about Kurenai? Shouldn't we tell her? It could give me an excuse to come by and see you during team training.

Thankfully, Hinata simply giggled as her boyfriend continued his amusing attempts to keep himself out of the doghouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru-kun don't worry. I know what you meant. It is rather difficult to do any real training when I'm so big. That's not even saying how hard things will be once I get even bigger.\" Hinata gave an exaggerated mournful sigh at the thought of becoming even more encumbered. In truth she was really looking forward to it. She had found she loved the feeling of new life growing inside of her and was already considering to go through her second time two or three years after she gave birth. She might even see if she could carry more then she was this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for Kurenai-sensei, I don't think it's really necessary to tell her as she likely already knows from your sensei telling her, or she will pick up on it when we meet for team practice.

I wouldn't be surprised if Shino's bugs pick up on it as well.\" She said before giving one of Naruto's more adventurous hands a playful smack.

Her father was away on business, but she was happy to have Neji and Hanabi. While Hinata was a bowl of sunshine, there was one dark cloud in the room. Neji glared at the empty spot in front of him, his hands resting on his large mound of a belly. He grumbled a word of thanks to his cousin when she handed him his egg white omelet, but didn't touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Neji?\" Hanabi asked. \"Is it the baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" he said, his hands gently rubbing his belly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was only slightly surprised to hear that her sensei was here to see her. Ever since the procedure at the hospital to get them pregnant, she and Kurenai-sensei had been spending a good bit of time together. This could stem from the fact that sensei was carrying Hinata's twins along with Asuma-sensei's child. Then again, Kurenai could just be spending more time with her in order to help Hinata along should any problems or concerns pop up. It was nice knowing she had someone with experience in pregnancy to turn to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kurenai-sensei. How are you?\" Asked the ever polite Hyuga as her teacher walked into the dining area. \"Hello Hinata. I'm doing well thanks, though I get this odd feeling that your twins will be giving me a hard time further down the road.\" Replied the older women with a small chuckle near the end. Hinata just seemed to beam at the mention of the twins growing inside her teacher. \"Well in all fairness sensei, if I remember right father said me and all my siblings gave mother a very hard time near the seven month mark. Something about not keeping still...\" Hinata giggled at the exasperated look on her sensei's face. The girl knew it was all in good fun. Besides, out of the two of them Hinata was carrying the greater number of children, so she would likely be the one suffering from over active children in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like something to eat sensei?\" Kurenai politely refused as she already had a light breakfast before sitting down at the table. \"Hinata I came here today for a very important reason. I'm sure you now about the Chunin Exams that are to be hosted here in Konoha, right?\" Seeing Hinata nod as she continued eating her breakfast, Kurenai continued. \"Now normally this isn't done but, there is some pressure to nominate the newest group of Genin for the exams. By this I mean your class.\" All the occupants stopped what they were doing upon hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but sensei! We aren't ready! Not to mention I'd still be pregnant while the exams happened.\" The young mother-to-be stated. \"True. However, something we need to consider is the fact that Shino and Kiba will not. Their pregnancies should end with about a month before the first exam. Due to how big you will likely get I doubt we will be able to take missions above D-rank by then. This will leave the boys with nothing to do but train, and you know how Kiba gets.\" Sighed Kurenai as she could already feel the headaches that boy would cause her. \"There is also the problem that we only know the doctors gave you at least three babies but, until they are further along we won't be able to tell if you actually got your requested quintuplets or not.\" Hinata flushed slightly at that as both Neji and Hanabi looked at her wide eyed. She hadn't told them that she wanted such a large number for her first time, especially with how large her belly would get in comparison to the rest of her small body. Kurenai however paid it no mind and continued. \"This however is all on top of us not knowing how long you will remain pregnant. You could give birth shortly after the first year of your pregnancy is over or you might remain like this up to three years before the doctors induce labor.\" Hinata dipped her head in defeat. It was quite obvious that they were being pushed to enter so they would get the experience while in their home village. It was practically a tradition to have Genin entered into at least one Chunin Exam before going through the baby program and allowed to keep the babies, a tradition that she was practically spitting on already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already have a method that is being discussed between the other rookie teams Jounin. I'm pretty sure you will enjoy what we have come up with so far.\" She said a glint of certainty in her gaze. Kurenai's expression then softened to something more understanding before she continued. \"However, if you feel better off not entering then tell me and I'll see what we can work out. For now I want you to take the next week to think over whether you will go to the Exam or not.\" Hinata merely nods, still trying to take in all of this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Hinata. I think you should seriously consider not participating in these exams.\u201d The cold voice of her older cousin cut through Hinata\u2019s thoughts like a red hot blade. Hinata couldn\u2019t help but, be saddened by this. Despite the fact that Neji seemed to be more tolerant of Hinata now that she was participating in the baby program, the truth was that the boy still had a grudge against her. She hoped that he wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt her babies just to spite her. \u201cYou are weak willed and you yourself know that you would be better suited as a house wife then a ninja.\u201d He continued. \u201cThere is also the need to think about the babies you are carrying and the harm that could come to them if you participate. I also doubt that the father would wish for his children to be put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Finished the older boy before standing. \u201cThe choice in the end however, is yours Lady Hinata.\u201d He thanked her for the meal before turning and walking out of the dining area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him big sister. He\u2019s just being a big jerk!\u201d Hanabi clearly didn\u2019t like how Neji was acting and neither did Kurenai. Kurenai decided to try and cheer the girl up, \u201cHinata don\u2019t listen to what he has to say. He maybe a \u2018mother\u2019 soon but, a boy can never match a girl as a mother because we have our maternal instincts. If you want to take the exam then I say go for it! Besides, it\u2019s less than three months away. No matter how many babies you have growing in you I doubt you will get overly massive by then.\u201d Hinata didn\u2019t seem completely convinced but, gave a small smile anyway only to giggle in surprise and shock as Hanabi used this moment to sneak a raspberry to her sisters belly. Kurenai smiled as she watched Hinata try to tickle Hanabi into submission before the little girl could get close enough to blow on her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai spent the next few hours simply spending time with the Hyuga sisters. The three of them enjoying their time chatting and answering the occasional question from Hanabi. Hinata would spend the rest of the week thinking over whether or not she wanted to risk entering the Exam.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For two days Hinata simply sat around or did light training while she thought about whether she wanted to enter the Chunin Exams or not. The fact of the matter was that this would likely be her only real chance to become Chunin. After all, once she got too big to perform as a ninja she would be sidelined. After that she would have her babies and she had every intention of raising them, so that would take up all of her time as well. She could always try for Chunin once her kids were older, maybe before she had to do her second pregnancy. However that would mean having to refresh her skills back to what they are now and get them up to expectable Chunin standards. Hinata wasn't to sure she could do that after spending who knows how long being a mother and simply taking care of her kids. There was also Naruto to consider and whether or not she would tell him anytime soon about the babies growing inside of her and the fact that he was the father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided she needed some advice Hinata turned to the only people she could speak to about this; outside of her sensei that is. She knew that boys where encouraged to remain physically active while going through their pregnancy. Hinata walked up to the Inuzuka household planning to speak with her two teammate, who she knew normally went for a walk around the village from Kiba's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door, Hinata quickly sidestepped before the door was knocked over by the rambunctious K-9s of the Inuzuka. Hinata had learned her lesson after the door fell on top of her the first time she came over. Seeing the face of the clan head and mother of her teammate, Tsume pointed her further inside. It was rather easy to find her teammates from there as she found Shino leaning against a wall nearby a partly open bathroom door. \"Good morning Shino-kun.\" Hinata hoped she wouldn't startle her clearly tired teammate and friend. Thankfully that didn't seem to be a problem as Shino seemed to know that she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hinata-san. How are you and your young?\" Asked the bug user, his normally monotone voice clearly weighed down and seemingly exhausted. Still she appreciated the concern. \"I'm well Shino-kun, as are the kids.\" She happily answered giving her much smaller belly a gentle pat. Being boys, their pregnancies where moving quite a bit faster then her own. Hinata had felt oddly jealous a few times about how much bigger the boys were then her. She had to remind herself a number of times that her teammates did not enjoy the large baby bellies they were lugging around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a look around and not finding Kiba she gave Shino a look. The boy simply pushed the bathroom door further open, revealing Kiba sitting in front of the toilet. With how his head leaned into the bowl however Hinata couldn't help but wonder if he had gotten his face stuck in the seat. \"He's been like this for the past half hour. Why you ask?\" He paused to push his glasses up a bit. \"It would seem that Kiba takes after his father in that he has rather violent morning sickness. He will likely be removed from the list for the baby program.\" He must have seen Hinata's downtrodden look as he quickly added, \"I have reason to believe that the rest of the team will be able to continue through the program if they so choose. Any member of the team that wishes to continue will merely need to sign a written form saying that they would be willing to continue providing children.\" He gave her a pointed look. \"There will be no issue if you choose to continue birthing children. Though they may try to make you carry more at a time in order to compensate for the loss of one 'mother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that it shouldn't but, she couldn't help but feel relieved at the knowledge that she could continue getting pregnant through the baby program. The idea that she would be required to hold more babies didn't bother her in the slightest, in fact she only got excited at the idea. It was odd really. Only a few short months ago she had been both scared and reluctant to become pregnant and now she could hardly wait to do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan to fully partake in motherhood, yes?\" Hinata nodded at the question before asking what they planned to do about their babies. \"Both Kiba and I plan to give ours to family members. I have a cousin who. Sadly lost her child a few years ago on a miss labeled mission. She has already agreed to it and is very excited to be able to raise a child again.\" He paused a moment wondering if he should continue. \"Kiba however has a distant Aunt from his late father\u2019s side who obtained an injury that left her sterile. He believes his pups will be well cared for by her.\" Hinata felt a mix of emotions at this. A part of her wished her teammates would keep their kids but, she knew that this was likely for the best. Besides, she figured that once Tenten had her kids their babies could be playmates. And once she got around to her second batch, Hanabi would likely be having her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there something you needed Hinata-san?\" Questioned the bug user. She blinked in confusion for a moment before realization hit her. \"Y-yes actually.\" She admitted suddenly feeling a bit shy about the topic. \"I need advice about...\" Though she trailed off at the end Shino seemed to know what she was talking about. \"You wish for advice before deciding whether or not to enter the Chunin Exams.\" Hinata wasn't surprised that Shino had read her so easily as that was just how he was, so she simply nodded and hoped he could help her with this like he normally did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The faculty of the Shinobi Academy had left for the day, all except two. One was the senior physician at the Academy, Eboshi-sensei. She had been absent from the Academy today, as she was also the Sandaime Hokage's personal physician. In his old age, he needed her assistance more than ever. Age was kind to no one, the God of Shinobi included. She had spent the day with him, giving him painkillers (for shinobi, arthritis is a royal PITA). She had left one of her junior assistants in charge at the Academy in her stead. The assistant in question was the other person present, because Eboshi was currently chewing the younger man out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How could you have been so careless?! I left specific instructions!\" The middle-aged woman was holding an empty syringe, waving it in the young man's face. \"And on TODAY, of all days! You've bungled it this time, Ryohei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eboshi's current cause for concern was the fact that today had been immunization day at the Academy. Young shinobi-in-training were often exposed to things they hadn't been prior to the Academy. While most things weren't of great concern, enough were that there was a scheduled day, twice a year (for each semester) in which young shinobi were immunized against various nasty viruses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem was that today, Ryohei had grabbed some of the wrong syringes. Rather than immunization shots, they were hormone enhancers for women. It was one of those syringes that now lay empty in Eboshi's fist. She had found it while packing up after him, and had recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Was it just one syringe that had been used, or multiple?</b></span></div></div>",

The fact that she wasn\u2019t reacting at all let him know that he was in deep shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHyuuga Hinata\u2026 <b>HYUUGA HINATA!!! </b>You\u2019re telling me that you gave the shy and self-concise Heiress to the most powerful clan within Konoha\u2019s walls a massive dose of hormone enhancer!?! <b>YOU DAFT FOOL!!! HER FATHER COULD BE BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS WITHIN HOURS NOW!!!</b>\u201d cutting her rant short Eboshi took deep breaths to try and calm herself and think thru what would likely happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018It\u2019s too late to do anything about it now that the enhancers are already inside her. Poor girl will be at least a full cup size larger then before by the time she wakes up tomorrow but, the fact that Hyuuga\u2019s most of all young ones, tend to have a stronger and longer lasting reaction then others doesn\u2019t help the poor girl. Not to mention she will likely go thru flashes of sexual urges for at least the next few months. Hopefully, she doesn\u2019t get near that blond boy she likes or it\u2019s going to be even worse, especially once the hormones get going, I doubt she will be able to stop herself around him.\u2019 Turning to the shaking assistant she gave a cold glare. \u201cHopefully this won\u2019t case her problems during her exams tomorrow. Let us hope the small amount of chakra she needs for her justu exam doesn\u2019t case any aggravated affects.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assistant of course just had to ask the dreaded question. \u201cEboshi-sensei, how would using any chakra cause any aggravation?\u201d Eboshi just sighed. \u201cChakra comes from every living cell in the body so if there is an enhancer in the body that affects hormonal levels, which can effect chakra itself, then it is safe to say the opposite is true as well. By using her chakra she \u2018could\u2019 aggravate the effects of the enhancer causing them to be even worse. During the test she may be hit by sudden\u2026 <i>\u2018urges\u2019</i>you could call it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *sigh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe was already <i>\u2018gifted\u2019</i>in terms of her transition from girl to young lady but, with the enhancers now in her puberty will be hitting her twice as hard. Chakra is directed without thought towards growing areas of the body or towards the hormones that cause the growth. Now his will be stronger and by forcing her chakra to move any other way will cause her body to try and compensate by drawing more towards those areas at times of rest. The human body also increases in terms of reserves of chakra as they age, that girl was just at the border of level 1.5 chakra levels now she will have level 2 reserves being shoved in to a body not able to hold more than level 1.5, this will happen within a couple of months. Likely she will start to suffer flashes of pain in her system around the Chunin Exams, which will cause her to instinctively try to flush it out and give off small burst of chakra to lessen the strain on her body. If I remember right she would normally go on a tracking team but, trackers don\u2019t use large amounts of chakra which will cause her more problems as trackers need to be fast but, stealthy. In truth she would now be better off going to a frontline fighter team, doing so though would cause the enhancer to become aggravated till it settles, which will all the chakra use she will be doing won\u2019t be for a while, likely some weeks after the Chunin Exams are over.\u201d Looking at her confused and stupefied assistant Eboshi realized she had started thinking out loud again, she\u2019d have to stop that soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018For another time. We need to inform the Hokage of this so he can inform her teachers.\u2019 And so with a heavy sigh she motioned for Ryohei to finish packing away their things while she walked towards the Kage Tower. \u2018I just hope she does get on that blond boys team. The last thing she needs is to tell her father she got herself pregnant because she couldn\u2019t resist jumping the bones of her crush.\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been told about these types of dreams but never had she been told they would be so <i>intense.</i>  Slipping out of bed, she got dressed but found her bra snugger than it was the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh no.  I'm already bigger than Sakura and Ino.  I don't want to be a freak,</i>\" Hinata thought as she pushed her flesh into the bra.  \"But Naruto's also seen as a freak,\" she muttered, \"Maybe we could be freaks together?\"  She unknowingly smiled at this idea. Once she was fully dressed, she left the house and went to the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried her hardest to keep an eye on Iruka-sensei but Naruto was just ten feet from her and her mind kept going back to that dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, to pass the exam, you need to preform a clone jutsu.  Come when your name is called,\" Iruka explained before calling the first student over.  The rest of the class began talking amongst themselves.  Many girls were eying Sasuke but Hinata's eyes never left Naruto.  Her mind was so focused, Iruka called her three times before she noticed and got up.  Her face was beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sensei!\" Hinata said as she ran down the stairs to the door.  None of the students had noticed her increased bust but Iruka, having been told about the likelihood of it from the Hokage-sama, did.  His well trained eyes noticed the strain her chest seemed to be putting the brazier through.  He led her to the exam room and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please do the Clone Jutsu,\" Iruka said as he and Mizuki watched.  Hinata put her hands together and released the jutsu and grew a little bit.  Trained ninja eyes once again saw a difference.  It helped that the two clones she produced reflected her previous bust size.  Their eyes could see it was only maybe an inch at most growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work.  You pass,\" Iruka said, \"Next up is Naruto.\"  Mizuki smiled and went to call the boy over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was sitting outside the classroom.  She had planned on leaving and go shopping for a larger bra but upon hearing Naruto was next, she stayed close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Byakugan!\" she whispered as her eyes activated.  She looked through the walls and watched as Naruto tried and failed.  She felt so sad for Naruto.  She wanted to be near him, to comfort him, to hold him close to her body, to her beautiful breasts, to have him suckle her breasts softly and rub them gently with his calloused hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata decided then and there to follow Naruto to see if he would be in need of her comfort.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Using her Byakugan, Hinata watched from afar as Naruto spoke with Mizuki. She was sadly too far to hear what they were talking about and with her focus continually returning to her dream from the previous night, only to start making more mental fantasies, she was hard pressed to use what little lip reading skills she had. Sadly, after focusing on Naruto\u2019s lips for a little longer then needed, Hinata found that she had lost sight of her blond-haired interest, while daydreaming on how they might feel pressed against her own. Panicking she tried to spot any sign of him or at least on which way he had gone. Failing to find anything, she deactivated her Byakugan and quickly went over what she had been able to make out of the conversation Naruto had had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Lets see, I think they were saying something about the Hokage but, what?\u2019</i> Thinking on the words she had read coming from their lips she remembered the words <i>\u201cScroll\u201d</i> <i>\u201cGraduate\u201d</i> and <i>\u201cKage Tower\u201d</i>. These words left her with the impression that Naruto had to do something in or around the Tower, so turning in the direction of the quickest route there she channeled her chakra to focus more towards her legs and began hopping off the roofs of the nearby houses. She never noticed how her bust would grow ever-so-slightly with every other chakra enhanced leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the Tower in record time, Hinata took a deep calming breath, only to flinch lightly at the pain her bra was starting to give her. The embarrassing idea of unhooking it came to mind only for her to force it back down; while some of her clan may do such things they only did so behind the walls of the compound, never when in public. Deciding that finding Naruto was more important than her bra at the moment, she activated her Byakugan and searched the Tower and its surrounding area. Not finding the bright-blue chakra of Naruto, something she noticed only he seemed to have, Hinata cut the chakra to her eyes and went to sit down on a nearby bench. She would periodically activate her eyes and do a quick scan for the blond, never paying the difficultly of breathing with her <i>\u2018slowly\u2019</i> tightening bra on, much mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>*Time skip- 3hours later*</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was slowly losing hope of Naruto coming, as she had been giving the surrounding area and the Tower itself, quick scans every five to ten minute intervals, and she had yet to see any sign of him. Taking in the current time, she knew her father was going to be furious with her when she returned, so with a heavy sigh she willed herself to do one last scan, before heading home to an angry father and a likely painful late night spar as punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerforming the hand seals and a quick mutter of her coveted doujustu\u2019s name, she began her last scan of the area for Naruto before gasping in surprise. <i>\u2018It\u2019s HIM! I\u2019d know that brighter than normal chakra anywhere, but what is he doing in the Kages\u2019 office?\u2019</i> Lets\u2019 just say she got her answer real quick as Naruto performed his, \u201cSexy Justu\u201d for the Hokage, before said man fell backwards and Naruto shot out of the open window. Standing quickly, she channeled her chakra downwards again while keeping her eyes active long enough to know his general direction. With that she shot off after the energetic blond, following him on the rooftops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five or ten minutes of running through both the village and the forest she saw Naruto land near an abandoned shack. Hinata stopped in the trees, while keeping him in just in sight of her normal vision; she had to release her Byakugan due to a lack of concentration caused by her now very difficult time breathing. <i>\u2018Finally, he stopped! Thank goodness, as I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go much farther.\u2019</i> Taking a few shallow gasps, as her bra is starting to really cut into her; she squatted on her tree branch hidden in the shadows. She could see Naruto but, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her, and so with that in mind she quickly removed her jacket and placed it neatly on the branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce certain her favorite jacket wouldn\u2019t fall off without her noticing, she gave a quick look around, gasping shallowly the whole time.<i> \u2018I need to hurry\u2026 vision starting to blur\u2026 getting\u2026 dark\u2026\u2019</i> Her thoughts were getting muddled do to the lack of oxygen, while she tried franticly to unhook the back of her bra. Losing the battle against the darkness of her vision she grabbed for a weapon and came up with a shuriken. No longer caring if she got hurt she tucked the star-bladed weapon under the front of her shirt and quickly cut the thin straining material between her two breasts. Freeing her growing and sensitive mounds from their confinement caused them to bounce and hit her hand, causing the shuriken to slice through her shirt and under-mesh armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata however didn\u2019t really care at this point as she was too busy gasping in relief at the air that quickly filled her lungs. She didn\u2019t even care that she dropped the bladed star from inside her shirt, or how the only sign of injury would be the sliced opening in her shirt, going from just under the half point of her breast, down to her belly button. She didn\u2019t even care that each breath caused her shirt to open just enough to reveal a teasing amount of creamy-white skin. No, all she cared about now was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward to grab her jacket, as she had fallen to a sitting position during her fight with the bra, she completely ignored how the shuriken had fallen just between her legs with one blade in the tree and another now just poking into her pants and panties. Grabbing her favored jacket she threw it around her shoulders before working said shoulders to loosen the now ruined bra while quickly unhooking the back. She let the two pieces of her lavender bra slide out of her shirt sleeves and fall to parts unknown, before slipping her arms into her jacket and releasing a small burst of chakra from around her shaping bottom. Doing so gave her the momentum to get to her feet, never knowing her now forgotten shuriken had sliced a perfectly placed opening in her dark blue pants and lavender panties. If she was to widen her stance when fighting or simply spread her legs a bit too much she would in-avertedly reveal her lower lips for anyone at the proper angle to see. The sudden cold from her movement coupled with her only thinking of blond crush didn\u2019t help to keep her <i>\u2018sacred spot\u2019</i> hidden, as the small arousal made her dream come up to the front of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Naruto practice whatever it was he had found in the scroll for the next hour didn\u2019t help keep her thoughts clean. Half-way through she had to bite down on her lower lip and actively keep herself from rubbing her thighs together. (Don\u2019t puberty suck?!?) She now had two options. She could go out and try to help him with whatever he was doing or she could stay where she was and hope she didn\u2019t give herself away. Though the arousal was wreaking havoc on Hinata\u2019s mind and morals, if she stepped out there was a good chance she would snap and give in to the burning need she felt building between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better yet, How did you find me?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the spot Hinata stuttered and panicked, her face turning a cherry red while desperately squeaking out how she had seen him look depressed and had wanted to cheer him up only to find him later jumping out of the Kage Tower. Naruto being the loveable dope that he is didn\u2019t even ask why she was out looking for him so late around the Tower; instead he simply smiled and nodded, clearly buying her excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Hinata, but there\u2019s no need.

Before Naruto could get over Hinata yelling she went into a sprint and charged straight at the young boy.  With chakra helping her feet move, Hinata covered the distance before Naruto could even blink.  But a palm strike to the chest from an unknown force and a slap to the back of Hinata making her crash into the ground avtered what ever Hinata was planning.  Though she did moan as the soft earth pressed against her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Naruto looked at his assailant.  \"Iruka-sensei?  How did you find me so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" Iruka began through clenched teeth, \"How can you be so stupid?  WHY the hell did you take that scroll?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  For the special exam!\" Naruto exclaimed, \"I've been practicing real hard.  I only had time to learn one move before Hinata and then you found me!\"  The blond boy laughed.  Iruka glanced back at the young Hyuuga.  Slowly she was sitting up.  Because of her landing as she did, her jacket's zipper was down showing the young girl's bouncy bosom. Her face was beet red as she tried to pull up the zipper but it failed.  He looked at Naruto and saw the signs of him working out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exam are you talking about?\" Iruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one Mizuki-sensei told me about,\" Naruto replied.  Iruka's eyes widened and pushed Naruto down on the ground.  Naruto was untouched but a large shurikan was now sticking out of Iruka's back.  Turning to the attacker, Iruka saw his colleague Mizuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuki!  What the hell is this all about?\" Iruka yelled, keeping his eyes trained on the traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Mizuki asked, \"When Naruto stole the sacred scroll, he ran into the Hyuuga heiress and killed her and then his beloved teacher before destroying the scroll it self in a great rage.  If only I had been here quicker I could have saved my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-But Mizuki-sensei, why?!\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto, you really are an idiot.  You know why no one in this village likes you?  You know why they hate you?  Even Iruka hates you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuki don't!\" Iruka called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me!\" Naruto yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because 12 years ago when the Kyuubi attacked and the 4th Hokage defeated that monster, he did so by turning it into you!  You are the demon-fox and no one wants to be near a monster!\"  The words echoed in Naruto's mind.  Tears came to his eyes.  He had to get out of there and so he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Hinata called, running after the boy.  The young girl did not see Mizuki throwing another shurikan at her.  Iruka raced to stop the girl from running into the blade.  Iruka was sure he got her to safety as the blade missed.  But in truth the blade did hit Hinata across the her ample chest and did not scratch it in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, return to the village and tell the Hokage what happened!\" Iruka ordered her before running off to save Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto's in danger!\" Hinata thought, \"I must protect him!\"  Standing up, the young girl found courage she did not know she had and activated her Byakugan and looked for her boy.  She did not care what he was, he was still precious to her.  She would make sure he knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka saw Naruto and smiled.  \"Naruto, hand me the scroll, we'll get out of here!\" Iruka called.  Sneering at Iruka, Naruto slammed into Iruka before the illusion vanished and Mizuki was revealed.  \"How the hell did you know I wasn't Iruka?\" Mizuki asked before seeing the illusion dispell around Naruto revealing Irkua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm him,\" Iruka said, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  You take the form of your parent's murderers?\" Mizuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  You're wrong, Naruto .. He may be a failure at many things, he may not eat right or clean his house, but he is not the Kyuubi!  He is his own person and going to make a great ninja one day!\" Iruka yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind a tree, cowering and crying Naruto heard his sensei's word.  Peering around, he saw Mizuki ready to throw another knife to kill Iruka.  Naruto felt angry.  Not a selfish anger but a deep, loving anger at this man who trick him and was about to kill his friend.  Without hesitation, Naruto raced into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki threw the knife but a yard in front of Iruka it was stopped by a blue-glowing boy in an orange jumpsuit.  Naruto stared down the traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON\"T YOU TOUCH MY FRIENDS!\" Naruto bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata came upon the battle and watched as Naruto put his hands together.  She nearly climaxed upon seeing nearly 50 Narutos all around the traitor Mizuki.  Before the confused traitor could act, the clones jumped on Mizuki and defeated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle was over, Mizuki laid beaten and Naruto was exhausted.  Rising slowly, Hinata saw Iruka present Naruto with his ninja brand to signify his passing the exam and becoming a full rank Genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage sighed.  It was a very troublesome night.  Not only had he fallen for Naruto's jutsu, an embaressment he would take to the grave, but now Naruto knew the truth of what happened.  As did that Hyuuga girl whose breasts were now enhanced.  But it seemed accelerated growth was not the only thing to befall them.  The blade had made contact with her skin, the Hokage knew that for certain.  But there was no scratch on them.  Perhaps she could do well on a attack team instead of a tracking team.  But should she be on Naruto's team, that is the question.</span></div></div>",

No bra she owned could fit her, so she went without one, at least until she could go shopping.  <i>Maybe Naruto would like a black lacy one?</i>\" she thought as she walked down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the academy, the anxious graduates waited for their assignments to be given out.

Naruto \u201cWhooped\u201d in joy at getting both Sakura and Hinata on his team, even though he was still a bit bummed about Sakura\u2019s earlier comment. Sakura slammed her head on the desk at being put on the same team as <i>\u2018The Annoying Loser that Just Won\u2019t Take a Hint\u2019</i> as she mental called him and relief that she at least had Hinata to help her beat the moron\u2019s head in (if only she knew). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata however was torn. She was ecstatic about being on Naruto\u2019s team, where as she was thinking on how to make Sakura\u2019s possible death look like an accident. Her thoughts of harming the pink-haired bitch, should she hurt <b>her</b> Naruto, sadly changed shortly after too ways she could rip off said blonds jumpsuit should she catch him alone. She was soon giggling to herself at all the naughty things she could do to him then. Yes, puberty was corrupting Hinata\u2019s innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the banging of Sakura\u2019s head, Naruto\u2019s cheers, and Hinata\u2019s oddly perverse sounding giggles, Iruka continued\u2026 \u201cYour Jounin sensei is, Hatake Kakashi.\" He quickly continued on after tell Naruto too politely; aka: big-head no justu; to shut up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where is he?!\" Naruto bellowed to the near empty classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Naruto,\" Sakura said firmly while her Inner Sakura agreed with the blond boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nice to just spend time alone, wouldn't you say?\" Hinata asked aloud but looking right at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know we should hang out and have some girl time Hinata,\" Sakura said, just missing the dark scowl on Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, then we can learn more about each other,\" Hinata said after she realized it would give her a better chance to remove Sakura from the equation.  Turning back to Naruto, he was fixing an eraser so it was wedged in the door and once Kakashi opened it, he would be hit.  This earned him approval from both Hinata and Inner Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen more minutes passed before the door finally opened and the white-haired man was hit by the eraser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh teacher, I'm sorry.  I tried to stop him,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Suck up</i>\" Hinata thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, my first impression is I don't like you guys,\" Kakashi said calmly, \"Now follow me.\"  Kakashi turned around and led Team 7 to the roof of the school.  Once everyone was seated, he looked at them with his one eye.  \"All right let's get some introductions,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to know?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Kakashi said as he put his hand to his mouth, \"Why not your likes and dislikes or dreams of the future or hobbies and stuff like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you tell us about yourself first?\" Naruto shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  My name is Hatake Kakashi.  I have no desire to tell you my likes or dislikes.  As for dreams, well I have some.  As for hobbies, I have a few as well,\" Kakashi said as his cheeks rose as though he was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all we learned...\" Naruto began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From that...\" Hinata added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was his name?\" Sakura finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you on the right start first,\" Kakashi said, looking at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,I'm Uzimaki Naruto and  I like insta-cup Ramen but what I like even more is going to the restautant Iruka sensei takes me to.  What I dislike is the 3 minutes I need to wait for Insta-cup to be done,\" Naruto began as Kakashi wondered if he talked about anything besides Ramen.  \"As for dreams, I want to be Hokage and have eneryone in the village acknowledge me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He has grown in a strange way,\" Kakashi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I already do,</i>\" Hinata thought as Kakashi turned to her.  \"My name is Hyuuga Hinata.  My likes are ...<sub>Naruto and my dream is to marry him.</sub>\" Hinata began with only Kakashi understanding the mumbling at the end.  \"My dislikes are how my clan is currently run.  I hope to change that.\"  Hinata knew her father would never allow her to wed a clanless ninja like Naruto, so she had to get strong enough to become the next leader so she could be with who she wanted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So the hormone is really affecting her mind and desires</i>,\" Kakashi thought as he nodded and looked at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Haruno Sakura.  My likes are .... My dreams are ...,\" Sakura began as she squeeled to herself, \" My dislike is Naruto!\"  No one but Kakashi sensed the murderous intent Hinata just shot Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Girls her age really are more interested in love than training.  Though Hinata's no different really,</i>\" Kakashi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now that that's done, on to your duties,\" Kakashi said as Naruto jumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what are our duties?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we'll do something just the four of us,\" Kakashi said,, \"Survival training.\"  This brought a look of confusion from the Genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But didn't we do enough of that in the academy?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is special.  I will be your opponent and ...\" Kakashi said before he started chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny Sensei?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... well.. iT's just when I tell you you are all going to flip,\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on tell us!\" Naruto said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of the 27 graduates, only 9 will be fully promoted to genin rank.  The rest are either sent back to the academy or tossed out completely.  So this training has a 66% failure rate!\" Kakashi said.  None of the team were amused by this.  \"Told you you would flip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the graduation exam we just did?!\" Naruto bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was to screen out the possible canidates for this,\" Kakashi said before getting up, \"Your test will happen on the training field.  Bring all your ninja tools if you want to survive.  Oh and don't eat breakfast unless you want to throw up.\"  Kakashi walked away from the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm going to fail!\" Naruto growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry Lover, I'll help you pass and get the hussy to fail,</i>\" Hinata thought as Naruto and Sakura left in their own directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning none of Team 7 was in the best of conditions.  Naruto spent much of the night unable to rest as he was filled with too much excitement and attacked a motionless Kakashi-doll.  Sakura was starving as she had only a light lunch and no dinner or breakfast, so she was running on empty.  Hinata did not go to bed until well passed midnight as she spent most of the night watching Naruto as he slept.  For some reason she enjoyed rubbing her large breasts and wanted Naruto to touch them.  Come the next morning none of her shirts fit her properly anymore.  Even her largest revealed her firm abs.  She could barely zip up her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully neither of her teammates were aware enough to notice the added growth, even as she practically shoved her chest in Naruto's face..  And an hour after the test should have started, Kakashi arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late,\" his students yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry a black cat came towards me so I had to take a different route,\" Kakashi said.  He put down a clock, setting it for noon and held up two bells.  \"The test is simple,\" Kakashi said, \"Steal these bells from me before noon and you get to eat lunch and you pass.  Fail to get a bell and you get tied to the stump, miss lunch, and you get dropped back to the academy.\"  The team looked at each other.  None of them wanted to miss lunch nor get dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If I get both, Naruto and I will be together!\"</i> Hinata thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh Kami, I don't want to miss being a Genin with Sasuke!</i>\" Sakura thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I will get the bell and become Hokage,</i>\" Naruto thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use any weapon you want,\" Kakashi continued, \"You won't win if you don't come at me with the intent to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sensei!\" Sakura yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Separate me from Naruto and I will kill you,</i>\" Hinata thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't even dodge an eraser!  We'll kill you!\" Naruto yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the real world, the dog who yells the loudest is the weakest,\" Kakashi replied, feeling a killing intent from Hinata again.  Both she and Naruto pulled out shurikans but found Kakashi behind them both holding their hands and their blades at each others throat.  \"I didn't say go.\"  Sakura blinked and jumped away.  None of them fe.lt as confident as they just were.  \"But at least you two were ready to kill me.  I guess I'm beginning to like you guys.\"  Kakashi chuckled a little and let the pair go.  \"Start!\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After saying \u201cStart\u201d Kakashi had vanished only to reappear in the same spot he had been in before Naruto and Hinata tried to attack him. He watched as Sakura had immediately disappeared into the woods but, could only shake his head at seeing Naruto and Hinata charge him. Imagine his surprise when Hinata suddenly used her chakra to push off strait into Naruto. He watched with surprise and mild amusement as the two pre-teens tumbled only for Hinata to regain her footing and grab the dizzy blond by the collar of his jumpsuit and with a quick application of chakra she jumped into the forest, the stunned blond still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding awkwardly for a moment Kakashi pondered if he should worry for Naruto\u2019s innocence. \u201cNaa, Hinata wouldn\u2019t risk her future for some \u2018sexy\u2019 time\u2026 At least I hope not\u2026\u201d So with a small shrug he pulled out his little orange book and began to read. <i>\u2018Hmm, Oh! Hitomi, you sly little minx\u2026\u2019</i> and with that Kakashi let himself drift into his own little world\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hitomi translates to: Beautiful virtue; pupil of the eye; \u201ccharity\" (hito) and \"beauty/beautiful\" (mi); \"one\" (hito) and \"beauty; beautiful\" (mi)</i><br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nHe had tried to keep up but, it all had happened so fast\u2026 One moment he\u2019s charging Kakashi\u2013sensei so he can beat him to a pulp and take a bell, getting one step closer to his dream. And the next moment he\u2019s knocked for a loop, tumbling on the ground as something heavy yet, oddly light crashes into him. Next thing he knows he\u2019s being pulled by the scruff of his jacket into the tree line and away from the bell he needs. Now he finds himself standing behind a tree, the person who grabbed him having one arm around his mid-section and pressing him against her. Yes, her. He could tell because of the hand covering his mouth held a\u2026 feminine softness to it. He noted the hand held a light scent of lavender and in truth, he liked it. He could feel himself relax a bit until his captor pushed against his back and whispered into his ear\u2026<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be following. So, we need to talk.\u201d She said as she pressed herself against her beloved blonds back. Oh, the things she wanted to do to him now that she had him in her grasp but, sadly they had a test to pass first, then she could see about tying him up and dragging in back to his place for a \u2018special\u2019 celebration after. \u201cWe should work together and get the bells. My eyes, your trickster nature, my gentle fist and you clones\u2026 together we could get the bells, eat lunch and be on our way\u2026 w-what do you think?... Naruto\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n\u201cw-what do you think?... Naruto\u2026\u201d he heard his captor say, the tone\u2026 almost\u2026 pleading him to say yes. <i>\u2018That voice, I know that voice\u2026\u2019</i> Taking a small step forward, he felt no resistance from the arm around him and so turned to face the person who had knocked him for a loop and dragged him off into the woods. \u201cHinata\u2026\u201d He looked her in the eyes and asked before he even knew what he was saying. \u201cYou\u2026 you really want to work\u2026 together!?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help it the idea that someone would want to work with him was\u2026 foreign to him. Yes, Hinata had been their when he found out about the fox but, still\u2026 she really want to\u2026 help him?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Naruto. I think we have the best chance by working together.\u201d The words held a level of sincerity and\u2026 hope\u2026 in them that he had a hard time thinking there could be any second motives behind her actions. \u201cBut, if that is true than, shouldn\u2019t we get Sakura to join us?\u201d he asked. The moment he saw the anger in her eyes he wanted to back away and hope she wouldn\u2019t hit him like said pink haired girl. He was rather surprised when she only spoke to him, her tone having shifted so it was slightly guarded. \u201cYou can send a Shadow Clone to ask if you want but, I doubt she will accept, I bet she might even hit you just for asking. Personally, I don\u2019t like her <b>at all</b>, but if you want to give her the chance then, so be it. We can figure out who gets a bell after we get them. Though, I\u2019d rather she just stay in the bushes and not show herself.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The anger and bitterness in Hinata\u2019s voice as she spoke of their teammate surprised him but, he felt it would be best to at least offer Sakura a chance so he quickly made a Shadow Clone and had it go in the direction Hinata told it to. In the mean time they talked about how to best get a bell from their sensei, with Naruto stopping in mid sentence at one point only to sigh in defeat and a little hurt. Hinata had seen it the whole thing, from the clone asking Sakura to join them to her berating and punching the blond clone, due to her Byakugan being active and had let Naruto know that she was there for him if he wanted. So with a small <i>\u2018Thank you\u2019</i> from the blond they began to set up for the plan.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nA certain pick-haired kunoichi was hiding in the underbrush behind a bush, lying on her stomach. She was supposed to be focused on her teacher but, she was too busy muttering to herself about how unfair it was that she and Hinata were on the same team as the blond idiot. \u201cStupid, Naruto. Who the hell does he think he is?... asking me to join him in some poorly thought out failed attempt to get a bell. Like Hinata would be so willing to work with a moron. Humph.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Sakura was a little more restrained and thoughtful due to what had happened and made her thoughts known.<u><i> \u201cBut, you have to admit. <b>If</b>\u2026 it worked than maybe things could have worked out for use. Though it was rather odd how he just puffed into smoke after being hit\u2026 I could have sworn we hit him\u2026 it couldn\u2019t have been an illusion, right?\u201d<br>\r\n</i></u><br>\r\nSakura continued with her thoughts only snapping from them when she heard a load and annoying voice yell, obviously trying to be intimidating. <i>\u2018Naruto you moron. A frontal attack with a bunch of clones won\u2019t work he\u2019s a Jounin for a reason.\u2019</i> Sakura menatly deadpanned with a shake of her head. The moment that she heard a grunt she looked back up, fully expecting to see Naruto\u2019s ass being handed to him on a silver platter, boy was she surprised.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nKakashi was still reading while keeping his sense sharp, waiting for anything that his students would throw at him. His body suddenly tensed for a moment and he knew that someone was attacking. Looking up as he heard a certain blond give a war-cry as he and his clones charged him strait on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi resisted the urge to sigh and shake his head at the obviously reckless charge he search through the clones with his right eye and tried to find the real Naruto. His eye widened slightly as a thought struck him, <i>\u2018I can\u2019t tell with is real!\u2019</i> By this time the horde of Naruto\u2019s was on top of him swinging punches and kicks wildly. He blocked as best as he could but, between only having one arm free, due to his book, and being taken slightly off guard, he was shocked even further by feeling multiple solid hits. <i>\u2018He knows \u201cShadow clones\u201d?!? Dam, than I need to get out of this now, before\u2026\u2019</i> He never finished his thought due to two fists driving hard into his stomach and moving upward, knocking the wind from his lungs. Grunting he brought his elbows down on to the heads of the two blonds, dispelling them and continued to move down into a roll forward, just missing the kick that came from behind him and the three kunai thrown from two other Naruto clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a moment Kakashi quickly took in his position. <i>'Open field, surrounded on all sides by, one, two, three\u2026 shit\u2026 thirty-five clones. Just how much chakra \u2018does\u2019 he have?\u2019</i> He put away his precious book and immediately ducked down, hand lashing out he grabbed the clones\u2019 leg that had tried to attack from behind with a swinging sidekick and thru it towards another clone that just started to move towards him on the left. He guarded with his right arm against a clone that had tried to punch him and shifted his weight to bring up his left leg, blocking a kick and avoiding the sweep from the second and third clone respectively.  Slamming down his raised foot on top of the sweeping clone and grabbing the two other clones heads in his hand, he smashed their foreheads together, causing three poofs as the clones were destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for another five minutes, with Kakashi noting how Naruto seemed to be getting better as time went on, only then something happened. He had just destroyed clone number 15 and 16, the former by stomp his head flat into the ground and the later, by kunai knife to the throat. Just as the puffs of smoke appeared, Kakashi thought he felt a gentle pressure brush his left calf but, he passed it off as another clone charged him with kunai and another threw shuriken stars at him. Destroying the clone with its own kunai and grabbing three of the shuriken from the air he tossed them back at the clone only for the stars to spread out and take out the clone that threw the stars and the ones next to it. At that time he felt another two gentle pressure brush his lower back and right triceps. This time Kakashi reacted by swinging a fist around behind him. He felt the side of his fist slam in to the side of his attackers head but, when he turned enough to see them, instead of Hinata as he had expected he saw a blond boy sailing through the air just before poofing into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Kakashi wasn\u2019t fast enough to stop the full hand strike to his right shoulder in time but, he did manage to bring his elbow around into his attackers\u2019 side by crouching slightly. He cringed at the sound of a rib snapping and thought that maybe he had use more strength then necessary, this was proven unfounded as Hinata poofed into nothing. <i>\u2018Does Hinata know the Shadow clone justu too?\u2019</i> he asked himself just before he faltered due to a kunai digging into his injured calf. Instead of blood thou, there was a small poof followed by another poof only a moment after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow hidden in the trees, Kakashi tried to catch his breath while watching the blond clones and surprisingly five Hinatas in the field. He needed to know which one was the real Hinata and which ones were fakes made by Naruto. He used what he knew of Hinata\u2019s hormone condition and glanced at each ones chest to see if there were any differences only to find none, all of the Hinatas looked completely alike.<i> \u2018If those are real Hinata shadow clones then, does it mean there won\u2019t be a difference until one dispels or is she simple growing slower for some reason? There is still the chance that they are just Naruto clones under a Transform justu. Hmm.\u2019</i> He likely would have continued thinking if not for suddenly ducking to avoid a gentle fist strike to the back and snapping out a hard kick before he realized it. As Hinata flew out of sight he heard a loud grunt just before the sound of something hard hitting a tree reached his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly moved forward, noting how the clones in the field all disappeared at once. Crouching on a tree branch Kakashi looked to the source of the noise only to find two of his would-be students but, what caught his attention was how they ended up. Naruto had clearly used his own body to take the brunt of the collision, both with the tree and the ground. Hinata was either out cold or to dazed to make sense of anything around her and was lying on top of Naruto, but not as one might think. No, Hinata was on top of the blond boy but, her chest was covering the blonds face, effectively smothering the blond in her full cushy nearly-grapefruit sized bosom. Being that they were close to the same height, if Hinata sat up it would look like see was straddling him. Kakashi, absentmindedly noted that it would be the perfect position if they were to suddenly try face to face anal-sex. Suffice to say Kakashi immediately gave himself a mental smack for even thinking of his two potential students doing such a thing. <i>'I blame my wonderful books for such thoughts. Besides Hinata would never try such a thing out in the open, not even with those \u2018urges\u2019 Eboshi-sensei said she was likely to experience, right?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched in amusement as Naruto seemed to come too, first. He couldn\u2019t help but, let out a perverted giggle as he watched Naruto use his hands to try and figure out what was smashed against his face. He went back and forth between perverted giggles and small chuckles as he watched how Naruto gave a small squeeze to the soft things on his face only to start panicking when he heard Hinata moan in approval. Hinata for the most part didn\u2019t seem to realize what was going on as she wrapped her arms around her chest and the squirming thing pressed against it. From Kakashi's view, it looked like Hinata was trying to suffocate Naruto to death in a valley of soft girl flesh or that he would become part of her breast if she just pressed his face into them enough. Giving one last giggle as Naruto\u2019s muffled shouts were drowned out by the still loopy Hinata\u2019s moans, Kakashi decided that this was something that they could work out on their own before, turning and bounding off in search of his last student hopeful. After all, it\u2019s not like Hinata or Naruto would really take advantage of the other, right? <i>'The silly Hokage and his worries were groundless.'</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura was lost. There was just no way to deny it any longer. She had gone after her sensei to try and get a bell but, now she was lost in the forest of trees. <i>\u2018Every tree looks the same, how am I suppose to find sensei and get a bell when I can\u2019t even find my way around the training grounds?.. I feel like I\u2019ve been running around in circles.\u2019</i> Thought the pinkette to herself. Stopping for a moment to catch her breath she hears an odd wheezing noise coming from the other side of some bushes to her left. Moving to take a look she finds herself regretting it immediately. She sees the broken and battered form of her beloved Sasuke Uchiha, his blood can be seen splattered everywhere; the trees, rocks and ground are covered in the red life giving fluids. And his body is the worst of all. Broken, twisted and mangled to the point of being almost unrecognizable with kunai knives jutting from his torso. His head turns toward her and wheezes for help causing blood to spill from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura\u2019s screams could be heard all the way back to the village.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well, I guess I should have expected that but, still\u2026 She could have at least tried checking for a genjustu.\u2019</i> Thought the one-eyed ninja as he looked upon the fainted form of his third student, one who was currently foaming at the mouth if what he was seeing things right.<i> \u2018I wonder how Hinata and Naruto are doing.\u2019</i> As if it had been waiting for that thought the memories of his clone that he left before looking for Sakura hit him. <i>\u2018Note to self: never try that genjustu on Hinata unless I want a super powered gentle fist strike to my necessary organs.\u2019</i> The memories told him that his clone had separated the two before placing a subtle genjustu on Hinata, similar to the one just used on Sakura. But, instead of screaming and fainting like their third member did, Hinata had snarled at him, Snarled! After which she proceeded to give his clone a firsthand look at why you should never piss off a Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the sky Kakashi judged that they still had 10 minutes left before the alarm went off. So, being the awesome ninja that he is, he vanished in a cloud of smoke and leaves only to reappear next to the three wooden stumps that the test had started near. He didn\u2019t even have time to pull out his book before he had to catch the shuriken stars thrown at him from the tree cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed at the realization that he could still hear something small and sharp moving quickly through the air. Ducking he heard the satisfying thunk of metal stars against the wood of the pole behind him. Giving a quick glance to the stump he counted three stars, the same number that he had caught only moments ago. Judging from how they had hit the wood, Kakashi quick calculated to position that they had been thrown from. Lazily coming to a stand he flicked his wrist and sent the shuriken speeding back from where they came, gaining a small yelp from his attacker. With the small smile he had covered by his mask Kakashi hopped to the right, dodging a fist before lashing out with his left hand. Kakashi\u2019s grin only widened at catching his only male student off guard by giving him a small shove, knocking the boy off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi proceeded to duck and weave between the boys\u2019 punches and kicks, always on the lookout for his deadly white-eyed shadow. Almost five minutes passed before Naruto seemingly got in a good hit, only for Kakashi to disappear and reappear behind him, crouching with the seal for Tiger at the ready. The sensei heard Hinata rushing at him to try and stop what she thought was a nin-justu but, even with her using chakra to speed herself up she was too slow. <br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nNaruto was ferocious. Instead of some justu his sensei had the nerve to give him a super powered butt poke. Not only was that painful as it was but, he had done it in front of Hinata, his teammate and friend making it all the more humiliating. To top it all off, he went flying thru the air holding his bum in pain and surprise, only to land in the water. Oh, yes. Naruto was going to get some payback. <i>\u2018I wonder if those old explosive tags I\u2019ve got are still any good?..\u2019</i> the thought made him chuckle, or chuckle as best as one could when under water.<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nKakashi was starting to feel a little worried. Naruto hadn\u2019t come up for air yet and he was currently running for his life. <i>\u2018Maybe if I beg, she\u2019ll let me live.\u2019</i> He thought just as he ducked under another gentle fist strike. Sadly, in his effort to stay away from the murderous Hyuga heiress he had lost track of his surroundings, this is why his back hitting the wooden pole caught him by surprise. His wide eye shot back to look at the girl in front of him and could only think of one word to sum up his current predicament, <i>\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a second later the chakra charged strike hit him dead center in the chest.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nKakashi watched the young, busty Hyuga girl strike where he had just been, and to say he was terrified would be putting it mildly. He had performed a seal-less Replacement Justu only moments before the pissed off girl slammed her chakra coated hand into his chest, and he was glad he did. <i>\u2018The illusion didn\u2019t even get a chance to dispel. The log I replaced myself with just\u2026 disintegrated\u2026 If she had hit me with that then\u2026 well they would have needed a new sensei.\u2019</i> Kakashi trembled slightly at knowing he had almost been killed by a genin, a piss off, busty young girl of a genin but, a genin none the less. <i>\u2018Maybe I should run and hide before she finds me again.\u2019</i> Nodding at the thought, he turned to leave only to have a kick placed right between his shoulder blades. Tumbling out of his bush, he turned to see a flash of orange just before it went \u2018pop\u2019. Springing to the side he managed to avoid being hit by Hinata\u2019s chakra strike and did something very unexpected. He turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis act made it so he could not see the confused/surprised expression she gave just before it was wiped from her face and she gave chase. A chase that ended at the edge of the river as she hadn\u2019t mastered the water walking exercise, yet. Kakashi however, was relieved that all he had to do now was dodge any weapons she might throw at him. <i>\u2018I think I\u2019ll just stay out here in the middle of the river for the last few minute of this test.\u2019</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata threw a kunai at him he shifted his footing to dodge but, as he did he noticed something wrong. Chancing a glance towards his feet after the knife missed him he saw the hands wrapped around his ankles and swore. Moments later covered from the neck down by blond-haired, orange wearing clones. Realizing that Naruto not only got him but, had even made sure to keep his arms from moving he felt both pride and panic well up inside him. <i>\u2018What\u2019s that sizzling sound?\u2019</i> Wide-eyed Kakashi struggled to get the clones off of him before the tag on back of multiple Naruto clones went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sensei\u2026\u201d the one on his back said with a cherry tone, making Kakashi think how it sounded almost creepy. \u201cI got a solution for your test\u2026 <b>FOR GOOD!</b>\u201d It sounded like the blond had finally lost it, or at least had a few screws come loose. Either way, the blonds\u2019 statement was followed by the tags on their backs going boom less than a second later.<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nSakura came running out of the trees to see the aftermath of the big explosion. The three wooden stumps were still there, bits and pieces of wood were thrown about the place, smoke could be seen coming from the center of the river and Hinata was at the edge of said river pulling out a soaked and tired looking Naruto. Just as she was about to move towards them and find out what happened, the sound of a timer reached her ears. Next thing she knew, she found herself tied to one of the poles, looking at a singed and tired looking Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think it\u2019s easy to see\u2026 that you all Fail.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell I think it\u2019s easy to see\u2026 that you all fail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi watched as Sakura winced while Naruto and Hinata\u2019s poster slumped slightly at the statement. Kakashi couldn\u2019t blame them; they had been the closest to ever pass his test only to fail. He wordlessly motioned for Hinata and Naruto to come have a seat near the logs that Sakura found herself tied to. \u201cWell, this has certainly been an interesting day.\u201d He paused to look over their glum faces and couldn\u2019t help but note how Hinata was sitting so close to Naruto. Kakashi brushed it off though as there were more important things. \u201cNow then, Hinata Naruto, I admit I am rather pleased with the two of you.\u201d He noticed how they both looked up with a bit of surprise and hope. \u201cYou worked together to try and take the bells nearly from the beginning and moved with better coordination then most would when fighting together for the first time. But, there is something I have to ask\u2026 Hinata were those clones of you on the field yours or Naruto\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata poked her fingers together idly, \u201cTh-they were Naruto Shadow c-clones with a transformation justu on them but, I\u2019d sometimes throw a clone out in to the crowd to try and keep you guessing.\u201d Stated the Hyuga heiress with only a slight stutter, Hinata idly made a mental note to ask Naruto to teach her shadow clone as it would make snagging him much easier later. Kakashi merely \u2018hmm\u2019ed in thought before giving a small nod to show he understood. \u201cThe two of you did well even though Naruto nearly tried to do it all on his own at the beginning. The two of you did so impressive that I will be recommending the two of you be put on the same team again after another year at the academy.\u201d He ignored the looks of broken hope on their faces even if it was harder then he thought it would be. \u201cI am however saddened to note that you didn\u2019t include your other team member in your plans, if you had you would have had a much better chance at getting the bells. Instead you left her to fend for herself against a superior opponent.\u201d Sakura however had something to say about that, \u201cBut sensei, you said we had to get a bell and there are only two bells but, three of us. That would have left one of us without a bell, yet you\u2019re talking as if we should have ignored that and\u2026\u201d Kakashi saw how she seemed to trail off at the end with a look of realization creeping on to her face. \u201cUse teamwork. Yes, Sakura teamwork was the answer something that Naruto and Hinata seemed to at least partially figure out. This test was never about the bells but, to see who among you could put aside your own wants for the betterment of the team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensei that doesn\u2019t seem very fair.\u201d He looked to the young heiress with a bored look. \u201cHinata we are ninja, we don\u2019t play fair. The fact that I even need to tell you this makes me wonder if you\u2019re really ready to be ninja.\u201d The lavender eyed girl merely shook her head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I\u2019m talking about sensei. I\u2019m talking about how Naruto did offer Sakura to join us in taking the bells but, instead she yelled at him. She demeaned her teammate and then physically attacked him simply because. If we are put on teams so we can work together then why would one team be composed of members that refuse any and all help just because it comes from one person in particular? It seems more like someone made this team simply so we would fail.\u201d Kakashi couldn\u2019t deny that she seemed to make a fair point but they were teammates now, whether they liked each other or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven still you are all a team now. This means that you need to find some way to work together or something terrible could happen in the field. For instance\u2026\u201d The kids jumped as their sensei suddenly vanished only to reappear behind them with Hinata thrown to the ground and a kunai knife at her throat. \u201cNaruto, Kill Sakura or Hinata dies!!!\u201d The blond stiffened, his eyes darting to the kunai in his hand, to Hinata\u2019s shocked face, to Sakura\u2019s fearful one. \u201cThis is the sort of thing you will face in a real mission...\u201d began Kakashi as he slowly released Hinata who quickly jumped to her feet and ducked behind Naruto. \u201cIn a real mission one mistake is all that is needed to get your whole team killed\u2026\u201d stated the masked ninja as he walked towards the large polished black stone. \u201cDo any of you know what this is?\u201d he didn\u2019t wait for a reply. \u201cThis is the memorial stone. It holds the names of all our greatest hero\u2019s engraved upon it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to start shouting about how he wanted his name carved upon the stone but, something about Kakashi\u2019s tone of voice made him hold his tongue. Instead he turned to his lavender eyed teammate and whispered \u201cHey, Hinata. What kind of Hero\u2019s are on that stone?\u201d The girl turned to look at her blond haired teammate, tears clinging to her eyes as she fought to hold them back, a look of sorrow easily seen on her face. \u201cThey are the hero\u2019s that died to keep us safe. Like my Uncle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right Hinata. Your Uncle Hizashi does have his name engraved into this stone for his part in saving our village from going to war with Kumo (village of Hidden Cloud)\u2026 *sigh* Alright team this is how things will work. I will give you one last chance to pass,\u201d stated the masked Jounin as he turned to face his team. \u201cNaruto and Hinata, you may eat but, Sakura gets nothing since she did nothing last time. After that you will have one last chance to pass my test.\u201d He quickly disappeared in a swirl of leaves, all the while wondering if they would pass this new test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note this chapter was to long and so I have cut it in to two parts. Sorry.*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata had been sitting and eating her box lunch for the past few minutes turning her sensei\u2019s words over in her head. <i>\u2018Something tells me that things aren\u2019t as they appear. But, how? Is this another test? And if so, how do we pass it?\u2019</i> She was brought out of her musings by the voice of her crush and source of her resent wet dreams. \u201cHey Hinata, is Kakashi nearby?\u201d She looked at him in confusion but, quickly used her eyes to look for her sensei. Not seeing him anywhere nearby she shook her head. Hinata watched as Naruto stood and started moving toward the pinket of the team. \u201cNaruto what are you doing?\u201d she asked not liking were this seemed to be going. \u201cSakura is obviously hungry and if Kakashi isn\u2019t here then how will he know if she eats?\u201d asked the blond with a big smile towards the heiress before turning back towards his pink haired teammate who was staring at him with a rather deadpan look. \u201cNow open up Sakura.\u201d He said while holding up a bite of his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe completely ignored the annoyed glare coming from said pinket and was oblivious to the murderous look Hinata was giving Sakura. <i>\u2018NOOO! The only one Naruto should feed like that is me! ME DAMN IT!!! If she eats even a single grain from his chopsticks I\u2019ll kill her and make it look like and accident. I SWEAR IT!!!\u2019</i> Hinata was not going to stand for this and moved quickly to stop Sakura from claiming an indirect kiss from <i>\u2018her\u2019 </i>Naruto. \u201cNaruto\u2026\u201d The blond turned his head toward Hinata showing she had his attention. \u201c\u2026maybe you should let me feed Sakura. You did a lot more work than me so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Seeing that he didn\u2019t seem completely convinced she pressed on not realizing that Sakura was silently thanking her as she would rather be feed by another girl then some boy who wasn\u2019t Sasuke. \u201cBesides Naruto I\u2019ve seen you during lunch and know that it will take more than one little box lunch to refill your energy. We need you working at full power if we hope to get a bell from Kakashi-sensei.\u201d Hinata watched as Naruto scrunched his face in thought making her want to squeal at how cute he looked and hug him. \u201cBut you fought him to so shouldn\u2019t you eat to?\u201d Hinata felt warm inside knowing that he was trying to think of her first but, she had to press on, a kiss from Naruto was at stake even if it was an indirect one. \u201cNaruto I will be fine I promise\u2026 besides if we pass then we can just go to that ramen stand you like to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded though it seemed a bit hesitant. That was fine as long as Naruto\u2019s lips, as well as the rest of him, was hers Hinata didn\u2019t care if he hesitated a bit. Moving to begin her torturous job of feeding her pink haired rival Hinata heard Sakura whisper a thank you for getting Naruto away from her. Hinata felt like smiling, if she wanted to stay away from Naruto then why not give her an added reason. \u201cSakura,\u201d she whispered earning a \u2018hmm\u2019 from said girl. \u201cIf I find you making any moves on MY Naruto\u2026\u201d Hinata moved closer to whisper in Sakura\u2019s ear \u201cI\u2019ll kill you myself and hide the body so well no one will ever find it. Do we understand each other?\u201d it wasn\u2019t a question and Sakura figured that out quite quickly as she hurriedly nodded, her face a pale white from fear. \u201cGood now open wide.\u201d<br>\r\n<b>-------</b><br>\r\n<i>\u2018What the hell just happened?\u2019</i> thought the blond. He had no idea. One moment he was eating as Hinata suggested he do and the next he topples over from a strong gust of wind. Looking towards the source he saw Kakashi-sensei looking rather peeved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DID I TELL YOU!?! One rule; that was all I gave you. Sakura would not get anything to eat and you can\u2019t even follow that ONE RULE!!!\u201d He gave a low growl that even at the distance they were at they could still hear it. \u201cI am the Jounin! I make the Laws AND YOU GENIN FOLLOW THEM!!! What do the three of you have to say for breaking the Laws I set for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Naruto couldn\u2019t help but feel angry at his sensei and so he did as he always does, he let his mouth move before thinking things through. \u201cSHUT UP YOU ONE EYED BASTERED! We are Team 7 and together we\u2019ll kick your ass from one side of Konoha to the other! Believe it!\u201d Kakashi merely blinked \u201cWell, are the rest of you going to allow an idiot to speak for you?\u201d he asked as if expecting them to refuse Naruto\u2019s statement. \u201cNaruto\u2019s not an idiot Kakashi-sensei and he\u2019s right. If you fail us for helping each other then we\u2019ll just have to kick ass.\u201d Stated the Hyuga heiress confidently, a fire a determination seemed to burn brightly. \u201cTheir right, Team 7 sticks together!\u201d proclaimed the still tied up Sakura, inner-Sakura agreeing with a battle cry, <i><b>\u2018Shannaro! KICK HIS ASS!!!\u2019</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that they were ready to fight as a team Kakashi said his piece. \u201cWell then. Congratulations, you pass.\u201d He said with an eye smile. \u201cW-what? We pass?\u201d asked the blond. \u201cThose who break the rules are scum but, those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum. That is the motto that I have come to live by and that is what I have taught you this day. Once again, Congratulations Team 7. You Pass!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was in heaven. She was in Narutos apartment and they had just finished a wonderful home cooked dinner made by her. After quickly cleaning, Hinata found Naruto in his bedroom. Simply relaxing on his bed. Hinata was quick to cuddle up to him. In response he wrapped his free arm around her waist and pulled her form closely against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reveled in the feeling of his warm, masculine body against hers. It just felt so right to be laying there with him. Here she was, in Naruto's apartment laying on his bed with him. And she intended it to stay that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was so comfortable that she had begun to doze off a little bit. She was awoken when she felt a kiss placed lovingly on her cheek by her love interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata opened her eyes and turned her head back towards him a bit, giving him her full attention. This earned her a small kiss on the lips, curtesy of one blond Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he did this, he let his hand sweep over the curve of her hip slowly. His hand trailed down her hips to her toned and curvaceous thigh, massaging gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear her breathing deepen and her hums of approval as his hands explored. He bent down and trailed kisses up her jawline and to her ear before taking the lobe into his mouth and sucking on it gently. Hinata gasped, not expecting the sudden jolt of pleasure that followed. She had never known how sensitive her ear was until he had done that, nor had she known it could be sensitive in that way to begin with. Naruto was showing her entirely new ways of feeling, and she loved each and every one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly pulled her onto her back, leaning over her to look at her face to face. He smiled sweetly at her, his bright blue eyes slightly darkened with lust. He bent down and connected his lips with hers, gently at first, but slowly deepening the kiss. She wrapped her arms around him as he pressed closer to her. His arm reached down and caressed her thigh again, lifting it and holding it against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, he prodded his tongue at her lower lip, seeking entrance. She immediately obliged, parting her lips for him to insert his tongue. He grazed his tongue gently over her teeth, seeking her own tongue to massage with his. He fully explored her mouth, claiming it as his own. After it became too much for them to handle anymore, they parted to catch their breath, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hinata could fully catch her breath, Naruto had already started up again, running his hands up and down her thighs and kissing her neck. He nipped at the spot between her neck and shoulder, causing her to arch her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Naruto-kun\u2026\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what I'm doing to you, Hime?\" he whispered huskily into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded, but that wasn't what Naruto wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it out loud, Hime. Tell me how you're feeling.\" he breathed into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I love it, Naruto-kun\u2026Please\u2026Keep going.\" she answered timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you want me to do to you.\" he said, his voice deep and filled with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" Naruto interrupted, licking from the bottom of her neck up to her earlobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahh, th-that's good.\" Hinata gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed his fingers up her stomach until they met with her full breasts. He slid his hand over one of them and squeezed lightly. Hinata tried to hold back a moan, but as he slowly began massaging her breast through her shirt and jacket but, it quickly became more and more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hold back, Hinata-hime. I want to see how I'm affecting you.\" he rasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reply, he moved to bring his knee over her, straddling her hips and pinning her to the bed. He brought his other hand to join the first, squeezing and playing with both of her breasts now, causing her to react loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Naruto-kun!\" Hinata exclaimed, both in surprise and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you like it when I do this?\" he asked, smiling down at her mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes, Naruto-kun!\" Hinata moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her answer, he bent down and began to kiss and suck on her neck and down to her shoulder, eliciting moans and gasps from Hinata. A deep red blush had long ago formed over her face, and she was no longer holding back her reactions. This only proved to be a giant turn-on for Naruto, who was having trouble keeping himself from ripping off her clothes and ravishing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naruto began to move his hands away from her breasts, to which Hinata whimpered in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, no\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Hime.\" he breathed into her ear. \"I think you're like this.\" She idly noticed him toss something to the side. Glancing down she found herself surprised that her tan jacket was now missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's hands trailed down until they reached the edge of her dark blue shirt, gripping it firmly. Hinata shuddered as she felt his fingers brush against her bare stomach. Naruto looked up at Hinata's face, searching for her approval to continue. She slightly nodded, signaling that he could proceed. He began to slowly inch her shirt up her toned stomach and over her ever growing breasts. She reached her arms over her head and he slid her shirt completely off, tossing it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and admired her full breasts closely, which were adorned with a lacy powder blue bra that seemed to be barely holding together as her breast tried to spill over. Hinata caught his gaze and, out of instinct, moved her arms to cover her chest. No matter how worked up she was, she was still a bit insecure about being nearly naked in front of someone, even if it was Naruto. His eyes caught her movements and his hands shot out and grabbed her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hina-chan, don't hide yourself from me.\" he smiled warmly, almost innocently. \"You're beautiful, you don't need to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it's embarrassing\u2026\" she argued, turning away from his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hime, look at me.\" Naruto coaxed and slowly, she turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched her cheek softly, leaning in and kissing her lightly on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to be embarrassed and hide from me, Hime. You're so beautiful, I never want to look away. I love you so much, please don't hide from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond with words, but Naruto felt her slowly relax her arms in his grip. He smiled at her lovingly, to which she returned his gaze. She brought her head up and kissed him timidly, slowly gaining some confidence and deepening the kiss. Naruto felt his tongue being drawn into her mouth once again to tangle with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon pulled away in favor of moving down towards her chest. His hands cupped her breasts and squeezed firmly, causing breathless moans from her. He leaned down and licked the space between the soft mounds, causing Hinata to arch her back in ecstasy. She was panting hard now, and didn't think she could handle much more of this. Then she felt his hand down at the waistband of her pants and panties, his fingers teasing the small tuft of pubic hair over her entrance. She couldn't help but, gasp and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" he asked huskily, waiting for her permission to slide them down her legs and expose her half naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel his erection throbbing and straining against his pants, poking her inner thigh. She no longer cared about the consequences or what ifs'. Hinata wanted Naruto. She wanted him to make her a women. She wanted to feel him inside of her. She wanted to see his face contort in the  pleasure and ecstasy that she could give him. But, most of all; she wanted to give herself to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto, you don't even need to ask.\" She panted out before grabbing his face a pulling him into a passionate kiss. Her unspoken message made quite clear. He ripped off the offending objects in one motion and just as she felt his fingers brush against her wet opening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEP! BEEP!<br>\r\nCRASH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sat up in her bed absolutely infuriated that her alarm woke her from her paradise. Her faced flushed red with both anger and embarrassment as Hinata slowly climbed out of bed. Ignoring how her panties were soaking wet she went about her morning routine, while absently trying to rein in her need to finish what the dream started. She hoped Naruto was at the meeting spot early as she planned to have him help relieve her of her built up needs. Whether he wanted to help her or not.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Hinata groaned in pleasure from the treatment of her blond-haired teammate\u2019s hands. It had been a tiring day of training and putting up with Hyuga decorum at home. Naruto had asked if there was a way he could help her. She had many ideas of how he could \u2018Help\u2019 her but, decided to stick with something small and seemingly innocent, a massage. She had of course removed her jacket, seeing as how it barely even fit her now due to the recent growth of her bosom. She had returned home after passing their test to be team 7, only to find that her jacket had nearly been split in half due to her increase in breast size. She had gotten into her room just in time for her zipper to shoot off and her jacket to split open around her chest, letting her breast spill out. She had been so happy her shirt was still large enough to cover her, though it stopped just above her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was enjoying Naruto\u2019s attention and his hands rubbing her shoulders and back through her thin shirt. She moaned and leaned back into Naruto just as his hands finished working out a rather stubborn knot in her mid-back. Sighing in pleasure as his arms wrapped around her waist in his shock, his hands brushing against the soft skin of her stomach. After a few moments of just sitting there she felt him lean in towards her ear and whisper to her. \u201cYou know. There are many more things these hands can do for you while nobody is here to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flirt-ish tone and implications caught Hinata off guard and caused her to stutter in her response. \u201cL-l-like what?\u201d she asked, a small blush gracing her cheeks at the thought of what she hoped he was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse your imagination,\u201d Naruto said as he rubbed a hand over Hinata\u2019s bare stomach before slipping it under her shirt and the other slipped a few fingers under the top of her pants and fiddled with the band of her panties. Hinata was happy she was facing the other way so that he couldn\u2019t see the blush or the hopeful look in her eyes at what he was suggesting. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d He stated as he began to take his hands out of the clothing\u2019s confines, only for Hinata to grab his hands and hold them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I w-want you-u t-t-to\u2026\u201d She stuttered, the hormones raging through her made her struggle to get the words out.<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more, just be my guide.\u201d He whispered into her ear. So Hinata grabbed Naruto\u2019s hands once more and slowly slide them onto her bare skin, shivers coursed through her body as she felt Naruto\u2019s fingertips gently glide over her soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to rub her stomach, Hinata mentally debated whether to go further with this or simply enjoy what she now had. Or she did, till Naruto leaned closer so that his mouth was right next to her ear. \u201cSurely you can think of somewhere better these hands could be making these movements,\u201d he whispered seductively. Hinata nearly \u2018eeped\u2019 at the thought. Still unsure, Hinata glanced around at their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were at an abandoned training ground that Naruto used when he wanted to work out in peace, she was the only person he had ever shown it to. Nobody would be able to find them much less see them should something more intimate happen. But, did that really mean it was okay? \u201cMy hands are yours to control, do with them as you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unspoken promise got Hinata much more enticed and decided to go as far as he would let her, so she slowly lifted his left hand higher and higher up her shirt, making sure not to go to fast. She did the same to his right hand, only bringing it lower rather than higher. She felt him gently kiss the skin of her neck; it felt cool to her burning body, sending shivers of pleasure through her as she bit her lip to keep herself from moaning out loud. She failed to hold it back though, when she felt him trailing little butterfly-soft kisses on her neck and shoulder in random directions, sometimes even nipping her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body seemed to have a mind of its\u2019 own as the moment she felt his fingers brush against the small tuff of hair above her sex she shrieked in pleasure, her hips bucking, her body unconsciously trying to get him were she felt the greatest need for his touch. At the same time his hand had finally reached the base of her breast, were she shrieked again and then moaned loudly at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensitive are we?\u201d Naruto said in more of a statement then a question. A small smirk graced his face while lifting his fingers before grabbing her hard perky nipple through her thin lace bra, tweaking them ever so slightly. Hinata threw back her head and moaned with abandon as her legs kicked out from under her, trying to push her up so his fingers would reach lower lips faster. She could feel a heat building inside her that needed to be unleashed. After what seemed almost like forever to her she felt his hand arrive at her entrance. Her moans turned to whimpers as she felt him simply trace her eager folds lightly with a finger. She whimpered more and bucked her hips to tell him to hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to try again she felt him nip her neck, just as he slide a finger into her, only to retract it a moment later earning a pained whine of disapproval. She didn\u2019t get very far before she felt it enter her again, she could feel her muscles clamp down on the appendage as if to demand it remain, once more it was removed. Hinata whimpered pitifully, a tear escaping her, she was so close she could feel the pressure inside her ready to burst out, yet he denied her that. Just as she was ready to start pleading, begging even, she felt him enter once more, deeper than the other times.  She felt him move to pull out only to stop before he exited and instead plunged it further in making her gasp. He continued to pump her while kissing her neck only for his lips to leave her skin. She could feel him breathe in to her ear just before he spoke, his lower finger never stopping its motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCum for me, my angel.\u201d He said just before is other hand grabbed her one of her full breast and gave it a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment her body arched itself as the pleasure became too much for her as the dam insider her seemed to burst open as she screamed his name to the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-naru-u-toooooo\u2026.\"<br>\r\n</i>---------------------<br>\r\nAwareness came to her slowly as she blinked the sun from her eyes. She turned fully expecting to see Naruto beside her, grinning a happy yet lustful grin at her. She was greatly disappointed when instead she found herself in her futon, alone. Becoming aware of the wet sticky feeling between her legs she realizes that she had had another of those dreams. Stretching she thought about this dream compared to the others she\u2019d had. \u2018This one felt so real. I could have sworn felt everything as if it was real.\u2019 Her other dreams had been wonderful, yes. Mostly the ones she\u2019d started having the past few days, as she tended to be much more intimate with Naruto in the most recent ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of bed, folding her futon and tossing it in to its storage space before entering her bathroom to shower. She stopped for a moment to look herself over in the full body mirror she had on the wall. She had on a thin-almost see though black veil nighty, which use to go down far enough to show only the very bottom of her panties. Now though it would only reach her bellybutton, much like her shirts. The reason for her being able to see her brand new black lace panties in all their wet glory was her breast. Turning this way and that, she kept her eyes on the mound of her chest. She didn\u2019t wear a bra when she slept so only her thin nighty was covering the mini-honeydew sized orbs of flesh from view. She cupped them through the thin fabric and pushed them up. She could only wonder if Naruto would ever try to feel them up on his own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed at the thought and went to turn on her shower. After stripping down she turned back to the mirror and struck a few sexy poses, most of them had her cupping her breast and playing with them, before quickly turning and jumping into the showers warm water, the blush having never left her face from the moment she had stripped down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The water clung to Hinata's smooth skin as she slipped out of the shower, the girl panting with both exertion and exhaustion from her efforts inside the tub. The allure of the dream had been too strong; she just hadn't been able to help herself.  Now, at least, she felt somewhat sated, the pulsing feeling between her legs fading to a dull ache as the last of her climax ran its course. Her face still flushed, the young ninja hastily toweled herself dry and darted back into her bedroom, ready at last to face the day ahead. She plucked another pair of lacy black panties from her drawer and worked the garment all the way up her legs, a satisfied sigh escaping her lips as they snapped taut around her hips.  A little tight, but only where she wanted them to be.  The girl's bra proved to be a bit more trouble, however.  Even though she'd just purchased the sexy little number a couple of days ago, Hinata was already struggling to fit her heavy bosom into the cups, forced to suck in a breath as she snapped the garment into place.  If this kept up much longer, she was going to need to ask her father for money, and she wasn't looking forward to that conversation.  ...Or was she?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, things that normally would have sent her stammering into the background had a strange kind of allure to them.  Rather than worrying about what her father would think, she was excited that she'd get to flaunt her newfound womanhood, something which even her prodigy of a little sister couldn't lay claim to.  Maybe one of these days she'd even get to put that uppity little bitch in her place.  Hinata smirked as she pulled on her top, the mesh failing to do much at all to restrain her chest; the fringe didn't even reach her belly button anymore, hanging just above that tantalizingly creamy stretch of skin.  <i>Looks like Sakura will just have to learn to deal with being upstaged.</i>  She laughed, a faint quiver setting her breasts a-bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray glance at the time interrupted the girl's amusement, impelling her to hurriedly pull on her pants and go grab some breakfast, lest she go hungry for today's training session.  Hinata was in such a rush that she didn't even notice that the bottoms of her britches no longer reached her ankles.<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you're going to need to run that past me again.\"  The Third Hokage glared across the room at Eboshi, the normally stern woman seeming just a little bit flustered to be on the receiving end of one of those looks.  \"What exactly do you mean by 'it's mutated'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... just what I said.\"  Eboshi began, starting to recover her composure as she pressed on.  \"We managed to get some blood-work done yesterday, with Lord Hiashi's permission, and based on what we've found, the hormone enhancer might be having a somewhat 'different' effect than we'd anticipated.\"  The medic-nin retrieved a file from a nearby desk, hastily flipping through the series of documents until she found what she was looking for.  \"I'd originally guessed that her body would attempt to rid itself of all of the excess chakra that it's producing, but instead it seems to be keeping it inside her system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has to be producing far more than she's capable of retaining though, so how exactly is that going to play out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where the whole 'mutation' situation comes in.  As things stand right now, Hinata Hyuuga has a class 1.5 chakra capacity.  The only way for her body to do what it's currently striving to is to increase the capacity of her reserves, which would normally be impossible, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...?\"  The Third Hokage prompted, leaning forward in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEboshi glanced down at the report, checking her work one last time in her head.  \"For a normal ninja, the amount of chakra which they produce never exceeds what they can support by more than a hair.  Because Hinata has so much more than she should, her nervous system is actually feeding it into the parts of her body which can most efficiently burn the energy off.  At her age, the prime candidate is her anterior pituitary gland.  In other words, she is producing an increased amount of growth hormones.  The more her body grows, the bigger her chakra reserves will get, and the more she'll be able to retain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Third Hokage was silent for a time, eyes drifting shut as Eboshi stood uncomfortably before him.  \"Assuming that I understand the science correctly, that means that this will eventually even out, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When her body is capable of sustaining her increased reserves, yes.  Until then, she's likely to get a lot more than a bigger chest and some more curves.  Taller, broader frame, improved reflexes, and I'd wager some increased confidence as well.  To anyone around her, it will just look like puberty was very, <i>very</i> kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi grunted and glanced out the window, sighing as he shook his head.  \"It's not ideal, but it doesn't seem like this is going to do any permanent damage.  To her or our reputation.  So let's try to keep this on the 'need to know' basis that it currently is.  Contact me immediately if anything changes.\"  Eboshi bowed and took her leave, the Third returning his attention to his crystal ball.  \"Naruto, my boy, you are in for it.\"  He muttered.  \"Enjoy it while you can.\"<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata slowed smoothly to a stop as she came upon the plaza, brushing her hair out of her face before she slipped from the trees, joining her two teammates.  Naruto was off to the side, working on his Shadow Clone technique, while Sakura was propped up against a nearby wall reading a book.  Though the feeling between her legs surged to life at the sight of her blond-haired beloved, she didn't want to interrupt his training; it was plain to see how important it was to him.  So she instead wound her way over to Sakura, leaning back against the adjacent side of the building as she spared a glance for the plain girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reading anything interesting?\" Hinata queried.  Sakura hurriedly snapped the book shut, shooting her a sheepish look as she let out a nervous laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just flower arrangement stuff.  You know, the usual.\"  The pink-haired girl paused and looked her up and down, a quiet whistle escaping from her lips.  \"Damn, Hinata.  I didn't know you had it in you to pull off a look like that.\"  The Hyuuga heiress opened her mouth to retort, then froze, giving Sakura a good look for perhaps the first time today.  Back when she had competition to worry about, Hinata had always lamented being the shortest girl in their class, assuming that Naruto would think less of her because of it.  Now it seemed as though she had a good couple of inches on the pink-haired hussy, Sakura noticeably shorter as they stood next to each other.  Instead of the intended ire, all that escaped the buxom girl's lips was a chuckle, a sardonic-looking grin gracing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just decided that it fits me.  Why hide what I've been given?\"  At that moment Hinata heard an excited cry and turned to see Naruto approaching, one of his big, stupid, attractive grins on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata!\"  The blond-haired boy came to a stop before her, and a shiver went through the girl's frame as she realized he was only as tall as her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Naruto.\"  She smiled, not a stutter in earshot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, good.  You're all here.\"  Kakashi's voice made them all jump, three pairs of eyes darting over to where the jounin lounged against a nearby lamppost.  His nose was knee-deep in a book, much as Sakura's had been until moments earlier, and Hinata couldn't help but feel a bit miffed that she hadn't really been able to talk to Naruto.  <i>Maybe there will be some time after training,</i> she thought, eyes covertly flicking back to the blond-haired genin.  The girl involuntarily licked her lips, a series of rather interesting images flashing through her head before she forced them away; the ache between her thighs, however, continued unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For today's training, I'm going to have you three work on your pathfinding skills.  I know you're primarily going to be a frontline team, but you're going to run into situations where a mission will depend upon your ability to track a target.  As such, I've arranged a little obstacle course for you.\"  Kakashi nodded towards the nearby woods.  \"You're each going to take a different path through that forest, avoiding and making note of the traps that you find.  When you get to the other side, you'll find a map that has a specific location marked off on it - there's an item located there which I want you to bring me.  You'll use your combined knowledge of the terrain in order to chart your path, and once you've safely retrieved this object you'll bring it back here.  Oh, and as a warning,\" the jounin glanced back at his squad, \"any traps you happen to set off on your way over /will/ be reset before you reenter the forest.  Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's hand shot up almost instantly, Kakashi's single eyebrow raising in answer.  \"What types of traps will we encounter in there, sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'd tell you that, do you Sakura?  It would ruin the fun.\"  Hinata could swear she saw the ninja's lips turn up into a smile beneath his mask.  \"I will tell you that I spent all afternoon yesterday designing this little course, so it's going to be a lot more than the conventional tricks.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired girl nodded, her complexion almost as pale as she'd once claimed Hinata's was.  <i>Probably more, really.</i>  The Hyuuga heiress raised her hand next, a little surprised that Naruto hadn't jumped in with a question of his own.  \"Are there any restrictions to what techniques we can use to analyze the forest, sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question, Hinata.\"  The formerly shy girl beamed.  \"No.  You can even use your Byakugan if you want, though you might find it to be... less helpful than you'd hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned, chewing on her lower lip a little before nodding.  She should have expected that a jounin as seasoned as Kakashi would know all about her family's Kekkai Genkai.  This wasn't going to be as easy as it seemed.  Their sensei now turned his attention to the final member of their team, fixing his eye on him.  \"Any questions from you, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blinked, seeming to come back to reality.  \"Err, kind of, sensei.  Is it okay that I already started?\"  Hinata blinked, a reaction mirrored by both Sakura and Kakashi, the latter seeming to catch on to what the boy meant after a couple of moments.  \"Ah, you've already sent some clones in, haven't you?\"  Naruto gave him a bashful grin, his smile so cute that she just wanted to- no, not now.  After training.  After.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I applaud the initiative Naruto, but you really need to learn patience.  Since you've already started without us though... Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one instant, Kakashi stood before them, and in the next, the man was gone.  The beat after that, all three of the genin broke out into a run towards the forest, eyes glancing every which way.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata paused beside the massive oak, taking a few nice, deep breaths as she took in the area.  Kakashi hadn't been kidding when he said the traps would be inventive:  shrouds of sticks covered in chakra, quicksand, and something which she could only call a cage of wind.  Her Byakugan had proven useful for avoiding most of what he'd set up, but what had caught her had caught her good.  Surprisingly enough though, she found that she was barely even winded from her mad dash through the woods; without the traps the hike could have almost been called pleasant.  Even her stamina, once her weakest area, had greatly improved over the past few weeks, it seemed.  If this kept up, soon she'd have no weaknesses at all.  <i>That's what I'll need if I want to be a woman worthy of Naruto.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if in response to her thoughts, she suddenly felt her teammate's chakra drawing closer.  At an abnormally rapid pace.  The girl peeked out from behind the tree to see Naruto running from... some kind of construct made out of wood and stone.  A golem?  She had no time to be impressed by the skill involved in the thing's creation, since it and its genin target were headed right towards her.  Hinata made a split second decision, reaching out and grabbing one of Naruto's hands, pulling the boy behind the tree with her.  \"Be quiet, Naruto!\"  She hissed.  \"It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hinata?\"  The boy stuttered, quickly shaking off the shock of her intervention and whispering back at her.   \"The thing that was chasing me.  Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Hopefully it won't-\"  Hinata heard a few of the branches above start to snap, grabbing her teammate and throwing them both to the side, the pair up and running before the thing's hands finished chopping through the tree.  \"This way, Naruto!\"  The girl picked a path winding back the way she'd come, leading him around the un-triggered traps and slipping behind another tree.  \"We should have lost it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head, the sound of increasingly loud footsteps filling the air.  \"It doesn't track by sight, Hinata.  I already tried hiding from it, and it still found me.  I... think it's following our chakra.\"  Hinata grimaced and tugged the boy away from the tree again, leading him even further down her path, the sound of crunching wood audible from behind them.  \"We can't run forever, Hinata.  We're going to have to fight this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i>  She did love the boy, but there were times that he could get a little ahead of himself.  \"Naruto, it would kill us!  Trust me, there's a better way.\"  Naruto cast a skeptical look at her as she dragged him behind a huge rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Hinata, we can't hide anymore - it's not working!\"  He tried to work his way free of her grasp, but she pulled him close to her, another shiver running through her form as she glanced down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, listen to me.  I can get the construct off our tail if you'll just... hold... still...!\"  The blond-haired boy was struggling in her grasp, trying to pull free as the golem's steps slowly drew closer.  Hinata grunted and tightened her grip, trying to get him to stay in place just long enough so that she could... there!  The girl activated her Byakugan and drove a pair of her fingers into the side of Naruto's neck, temporarily shutting down his chakra network.  His eyes opened wide with shock, his eyelids suddenly drooping as he collapsed into her arms.  \"I'm sorry, Naruto.\"  She just couldn't let him fight that monstrosity.  The construct's steps were still drawing closer, so Hinata sighed, raised her fingers, and jabbed them into the side of her own neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Naruto, she didn't pass out.  This very situation had been a regular occurrence during her in-house training with her sister, and it had been nowhere near as gentle.  The clomp of the thing's feet stopped, suddenly bereft of a target to lock on to.  Hinata hugged the shorter boy that much more tightly, surprised that she wasn't having any trouble keeping him upright.  <i>I know I've been getting stronger, but I didn't think I was /this/ strong.</i>  The girl glanced down at her teammate and felt her cheeks flush; the way Naruto had been standing meant that he'd fallen face first into her chest.  That sensation at her core now burned, even stronger than it had been this morning.  She needed... release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, carefully, Hinata shifted most of Naruto's weight onto her right arm, letting out a grunt of exertion as she slipped her left hand inside her pants.  She wasted no time, rubbing herself forcefully as she stared at Naruto's head, imagining that he'd willingly shoved his face where it had ended up.  Or that she'd initiated the situation herself, using her newfound strength to force his face between her breasts.  Her big, sexy breasts.  The girl moaned, gritting her teeth for a moment before she did just that, using her free hand to press his face even further forward.  Hinata felt herself go over the edge, gasping into the quiet surrounding them as she climaxed.  <i>It's funny,</i> she thought, <i>but his head looks a little smaller than it did before.  Like my boobs are even... bigger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl withdrew her hand as soon as she finished, wiping the residue off on the rock behind them.  She hadn't realized in the heat of the moment, but her chakra had returned, which meant that Naruto's wouldn't be far behind.  Suddenly a little embarrassed by their position, Hinata set the boy down on the ground, straightening out her outfit while she waited for him to wake.  At least, as best she could.  For some reason, she couldn't get her shirt to pull down to her navel, and her pants felt uncomfortably tight.  That talk with her Dad might have to happen sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the thought aside as Naruto stirred, leaning down to pull him up.  \"What happened?\"  He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got away from the golem, but you took a knock to the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" He blinked.  \"Well, we should get going then, I guess.  Thanks for the help.\"  He paused, looking her up and down.  \"You know, I never noticed, but you're kinda tall Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled sweetly.  \"Just a little.\"  She set off beside him, so distracted by the complement that she didn't notice that the top of his head was only even with her mouth.</span></div></div>",

This leaves a possibility of the victim struggling even once they are inside the breast.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nine year old Hinata felt horribly embarrassed as she walked through the hallways of the academy. For the last week she had locked herself in her room and refused to go to her classes. Her embarrassment was well founded as before that week long disappearance she had suffered through a accident that ended the life of another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been helping out the teachers by removing streamers from the academy building. The first Hokage's birthday had just passed and it was a holiday celebrated by the whole village. Now that the time of celebrating had passed and Hinata had offered to help out. Standing on a ladder, she was just about to start on her way back down when detention was let out. One of the student that had just been let out ran into the ladder that she had been on, causing her to fall. Normally such a fall would leave someone like her in a great deal of pain or even break a bone or two on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnticipating the hard impact, Hinata channeled chakra to her backside to help soften the impact. What happened instead was something that shocked the young girl. Pain. Horrible pain unlike any she had ever felt assaulted her only moments after feeling her tush make contact with something solid. The only warning the poor girl had was the sound of fabric ripping apart before feeling something invade her rear end. As the momentum from her fall and gravity's hold slammed into her, Hinata suddenly found herself with her back on the ground and the pain having, despite all odds, increased in its intensity while somehow having moved to include a majority of, what felt like, her insides. It was enough to cause her to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata awoke, she found herself to still be hurting, though it was nothing like before as she was no longer feeling like she would pop at any second. Looking at the sky she realized she couldn't have been out for very long as there was still daylight out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself however nearly caused her to scream in shock and horror. There was a massive lump in her lower body and it was MOVING!!! Thankfully before her panic could fully take hold of her, the academy nurse exited the building, likely on her way home, and saw her. Things after that where a bit of a blur as her mind had still been in shock at what had happened to her, but she at least now knew what she had done. To think that she had unintentionally preformed a Kunoichi only ability that her class wasn't to be learning about for another month. It had been quite the shock for the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of talking to the nurse and having a abbreviated lesson on the jutsu and what it did, the nurse helped walk her home. Once in the clan compound she immediately rushed to her room and locked herself in, leading up to the present moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a small sigh as she sat down at the back of class. She had learned quite a lot about the odd jutsu and could see how it would be useful even if she didn't like the normal end result. Anything that went up a Kunoichi's rear tended to be either absorbed by the intestines or pulled into the stomach and digested. Of course one couldn't do that to a human and escape with no repercussions. Hinata blushed brightly as she shifted in her seat, trying to ignore the fact that her tush was noticeably fuller and rounder. She made a mental note to get some new panties as her current ones were now a little tight on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the evidence to the contrary, Hinata still had a hard time believing that she had a person larger then herself inside her body only a few days ago. She had an even harder time accepting the fact that after the first two days of being locked in her room, she completely forgot to even think of her victim as another human. She also realized that during the first few days she could have released her unintended victim but, the thought hadn't even crossed her mind until the boy inside her had long since stopped moving. It horrified her to know that the whole time he had squirmed and wiggled around inside her she had practically ignored him. It had taken a bit before she remembered the nurse had said something about that and how it was a normal and instinctive habit of all Kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going to class she had stopped by the nurse to ask a few more questions and had learned that not everything put up her butt had to be absorbed. Turns out there is a small pocket that was normally closed off to the rest of her intestines. This pocket could be used to store things or people. Where the rest of her body was practically made to absorb/digest anyone that entered it, this small pocket in fact take care of anyone that entered, making it ideal for long term imprisonment. If she used her chakra, she could force a person from her intestines into this small organic sack where enzymes would then be excreted from its walls. These enzymes kept the person health and provided nourishment by being easily absorbed through the skin or ingested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had also been warned that though this jutsu was explained in class it wasn't taught till the last year due to it triggering buried instincts in the female mind. She had been told that since she had experienced the sensation of taking a person into herself and turning them into butt fat, she would subconsciously start viewing others around her as potential targets to add to her backside. This subconscious instinct could be controlled to some degree but, seeing as how she was still so young, the chances of it getting the better of her where much higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed quietly to herself as she ignored the teachers ramblings and ran her gaze over the rest of her class. She hadn't believed the nurse when told that she would see the people around her differently but, here she was making a mental checklist of who she thought would look good added to her butt. She turned her eyes on Naruto and felt her body rumble in want at the sight of him. Seemed that even her predatory instincts loved Naruto as she only felt the urge to trap him inside of her rather then make him into padding on her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExerting more willpower then she ever thought she could have Hinata turned her attention back towards her sensei and tried to listen to what he had to say. She could already tell that it was going to be a long three-and-a-half years in the academy. She could only hope to keep herself under control till graduation.</span></div></div>",

For most of the week she had been forced to run from bully that had been chasing her and now she had forgotten to grab her lunch. The first few days hadn't been so bad. Especially the first time as the cute blond boy, the one with the whiskers she wanted to touch, had saved her but, after that things had gotten worse to the point that she had to run from them out of fear. She had just been chased into the woods and gotten lost. Her Byakugan didn't see very far yet so she couldn't use it to get back. On top of that, this morning she had been forced to skip breakfast as punishment for doing so bad in her morning gentle fist lessons, so she was very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to her knees weeping as she thought that no one would find her and she would go hungry forever!!! When her stomach growled loudly demanding food, she had doubled over, her arms covering her stomach as it painfully growled again. Little Hinata just whimpered and cried. <i>'I'm so hungry that I'd eat anything... I don't care what it was.... or even... who....'</i> so with that little Hinata decided that the first thing she could get her hands on she would eat. She heard a rustling noise from the bush in front of her and looked up. Her mouth was watering at the idea of something to eat coming to her. Images of different animals and even of a person or two being shoved into her mouth and slowly sliding in to her belly with every gulp started to play in her head. Unknowingly, her body seemed to agree because it was instinctively channeling chakra in a way that would allow her mental images to really happen. If she could get it in her mouth that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shifted herself, ready to pounce on anything that exited the bush. Images continued to play in her head as her mouth opened, drool spilling out as she struck out at the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time the figure exited it's cover little Hinata was already in motion and couldn't stop herself even if she wanted too. Not that she did mind you. Hinata didn't really care who or what she was trying to eat as long as something ended up in her belly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the head and shoved it towards her mouth in one motion. She was rather surprised when she felt her mouth open wider then it should and even more so when she felt her preys head pop into her stretched maw.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even react to this new development, the momentum she had built up from her leap slammed into her, causing her lips to suddenly be wrapped around the bottom of the neck. Blinking for a moment, Hinata made a point to ignore how her throat bulged out and focused on trying to work her lips around her meals shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lunch however seemed to have a different opinion of what she should do, as it raised it's arms and tried to force her off. An odd thought crossed Hinatas mind and made her nearly giggle. <i>'How silly, Lunch \u00a0belongs in my tummy, not running around.'</i> With a small smile on her stretched lips Hinata made a quick jab into her lunches shoulders causing them to fall limp from her gentle fist. Next, she used her legs to place a quick set of kicks into her meals chest and stomach. This, plus Hinata's weight on the front of the body caused her meal to fall on its butt, a muffled grunt reaching her ears.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow able to stand, Hinata used her greater leverage to keep her meal from going anywhere but, inside of her. So with that she gave a hard swallow, only to feel her collarbone crack and shift causing her a great deal of pain, as her meals large head slipped under it. Waiting a moment to let some of the pain pass Hinata continued eating her lunch, not even noticing the nearly non-existent sounds of her meal pleading for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping Hinata felt her lips wrap around the chest of her\u00a0twisting, writhing, squirming and arching meal. Hinata noted the taste of something that made think of perfume, with this in mind Hinata absently labeled her lunch as female and silently promised to try eating a boy-lunch next time. Pushing the thought to the back\u00a0of her mind she gave another hungry gulp that allowed Lunch to slide deeper into her body. Her ribs and just starting to develop, breasts \u00a0were pushed outwards as her meal upper body slid in underneath.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrgans easing themselves to the side in order to allow her grand meal to move on further. Only the sphincter, a band of muscles kept the squirming, and pleading meal from its final resting place... if only for a moment. The pressure soon became to much and it opened, allowing her long awaited meal to begin plopping into\u00a0the loudly-gurgling chamber of her sweltering and eager stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips now firmly around her <i>'girl-lunch'</i>es tummy, just under the ribcage, Hinata decided to sit. Slowly she lifted her meals still thrashing lower-body upwards, letting gravity help her along. Giving a small gulp Hinata found herself to be greatly enjoying The feeling of slowly lowering her meal deeper and deeper into her smoothly-bulging body. Sadly, hearing her stomach demand its food made Hinata realize the need for greater haste, she gulped quickly, cramming her meal mercilessly into her. A slow, rhythm of swallows and gulps brought her lips past her meals hips, her\u00a0gut having already started expanding in order to accommodate the meal\u00a0slowly curling up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was in heaven. Cradling her massively-distended gut, her head tilted back and her body gloriously bulging, she continued to swallow down the legs of her meal until only a pair of sandaled feet remained outside her body. Even though she had been hungry, Hinata had already come to the conclusion that clouthes tasted bad. So determined to not find out what sandals tasted like she quickly tore them off and tossed them into the woods. No longer distracted Hinata\u00a0threw her head back and gulped hard... causing the girl's feet to slip inside her mouth. The Hyuga paused for a moment before swallowing the limbs down and into her stomach, which eased itself just a little wider until <i>'Lunch'</i> was fully tucked and sealed away within deeply satisfied girl. To Hinata it felt as if her meal simply glid down, filling out her monstrous stomach as it gurgled and churned in preparation to deal with the latest meal it ever faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's chest heaved as she struggled to catch her breath.\u00a0Laying both hands across her fullness, she felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment spread throughout her being.\u00a0Gazing down as she\u00a0wrapped her arms around her large and heavily meat-laden belly, she felt\u00a0a soft rumble come from within the\u00a0massive, still-moving bulge just before seeing an odd\u00a0rippling of the surface of her distended belly. The sated heroine opened her mouth and gave a loud, wet belch, as her digestive tract contracted around its contents.\u00a0She could hear the faint sounds of gurgling liquids. Blushing a bright red at burping so loudly she quietly excused herself before\u00a0patting her pale stretched stomach. She giggled quietly at the funny movements she felt from inside her stomach, not quiet understanding the pain she was causing her victim who still silently begged for freedom, while writhing and convulsing painfully in the boiling depths of the Hyuga's belly.</span></div></div>",

The girls arm was the only limb she could move now that the sticky stomach hugged tightly against her form from all sides. Every attempt at moving was accompanied by a loud sloshing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stroked her hand against the bulge exactly where the punches came. Quite nonplussed as she pushed back every punch effortlessly. Bump... Bump... Bump... Bump...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, it made her giggle softly with a belch as lunch made its last stand. Bump... Bump... \u201cBurp!.. mmm...\u201d she stroked her belly pleasurably. Bump... And finally Hinata felt the girl slump to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so young Hinata didn't quite understand the concept of death. She had a better understanding of it then most children her age but, the idea of death and killing was still something she had difficulty wrapping her mind around. She didn't like the idea of hurting someone or something and seeing as how they weren't taught about the human body till the middle years of the academy, Hinata didn't realize that she had been hurting her <i>'girl-lunch'</i> or that them not moving was from them dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hinata felt herself yawn as she slowly started to fall asleep, her large meal being the cause. While she started to drift she felt her stomach pulse and throb around her lunch, the meat firmly held in its tight imbrace... Hinata's stomach started mining the pile of meat and bones for all the nutrients the girl was worth. Digestive acids coating the body, sucking all the moisture away before ripping the skin open... allowing acids to pour in and melt the tissue inside. The stomach lightly wobbling as it gurgled and sloshed actively to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of hours, this went on without a stop. Her body continuously fed as more of the other girls flesh, slowly melted into goop that her stomach walls would slowly absorbed for rest of her body. All the while Hinata happily dreamed, a small smile on her face as her body wrapped itself around her belly, clutching it like a teddy bear.</span></div></div>",

Smacking her lips, she looked around curiously trying to remember where she was. A \u00a0loud <i>'Gurgle'</i> sound drew her attention down towards her belly. It only took a few moments to remember what has happened once she laid eyes upon the churning gut that hung out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had been reduced to a small-ish round bulge, filled to the brim with a soup made of goop that had yet to be absorbed, along with a few bones that were harder to properly process. Not that Hinata knew this. As far as Hinata could figure, <i>'Lunch'</i> had decided to stay in her belly and so was getting smaller so it could fit. She knew that she was wrong but, she couldn't think of any other way to explain why her belly had gotten smaller. Pushing the whys and hows to the back of her mind for later, Hinata decided that it was time to try getting back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started off by \u00a0running through the long number of hand seals needed to activate her Byakugan, hand seals that she had been learning since she was three. She was surprised however when she found her range of sight had increased, before she hadn't been able to see anything but trees, now however she saw the starts of a small clearing just at the end of her vision. Deciding to go check it out in the hopes it would lead her back to the village or a part that she could recognize, Hinata tried standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was however, quick to find that her belly was throwing off her balance. As small as it was, her belly was still large enough that her loose fitting, elbow-sleeve length black shirt couldn't hide more then half of it from view. It took some time but, Hinata was eventually able to heft herself up. Lifting her belly from underneath she took a moment to look at it in awe. It felt so strange in her hands, the skin felt so soft yet, stretched tight. Wiggling her fingers against the soft flesh felt amazing and so alien but, it was feeling the gurgling and glorping sensation inside her belly against her hands that really drove it home.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her decided that she liked the feeling and that she would defiantly want to feel it more often.\u00a0With that Hinata began to half-walk, half-waddle towards her destination.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nearly Two Hours later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had just finished making up a little white lie to her father about were she had been, passing it off as a training excerise would hopefully satisfy him enough to let him drop it for a time. She didn't know how but, her belly, which had been so large when she started returning home, had shrunk down a great deal. It was now small enough for her shirt to just barely cover, though it did leave a noticeable bulge in said shirt. Hinata was just happy her father hadn't been paying attention. Moving quickly Hinata got washed up and moved to the dinning room, after all it was time for dinner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata gulped hard at her meal, simply wanting to cram the stupid boy into her belly and be done with him. Her lips around his waist she gulped again, bringing his behind into her mouth while his legs swung wildly in the air before her. The taste of his clothes on her tongue was sickening but, it simply made her want to put him away in her belly all the more so she would get rid of the nasty taste. She promised herself to try removing the clothes next time but, right now she just wanted to be done with this stupid bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t started out that bad of a day. She\u2019d woken up had a small breakfast and been on her way to the academy. It had been nearly a month after she had eaten her first person and she hadn\u2019t told a soul. She didn\u2019t know why but, for some reason she felt she would get into BIG trouble if someone found out. Though why was still something she didn\u2019t understand. The girl she had eaten was simply living inside her stomach even if it had shrunk or that\u2019s what she thought. Ever since Hinata had eaten the girl she had felt great. The world had simply seemed a so much brighter place then before. The fact that she had seen the cute blond boy with whiskers the next day had simply been a bonus for her. Seeing as she still didn\u2019t know his name Hinata had simply given him a nickname that she now used to refer to him.  <i><b>\"</b>Whiskers<b>\"</b></i> as he\u2019d come to be called was really to whole reason she was in a bad mood and eating a boy. Now Whiskers himself didn\u2019t do anything to upset her, no. It was the boy in her mouth and his two friends that had angered her. Anger\u2026 now that was something she had never dealt with before. Hinata had been upset before but, never could she remember being angry at someone. But, she felt that these three boys deserved it for what they did, the fact that they were the same boys that had been picking on her for so long only made it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had seen the three boys beating up on poor Whiskers on her way to the academy. Sadly she had been too scared to try and help him the same way he had helped her\u2026 or she had been at first. When she saw blood coming from the blond Hinata knew that things were going too far, and several emotions churned about inside her. Fear, fear that the boys were going to do more than seriously hurt her blond haired hero; Worry, worry about him and his safety; Disbelief, disbelief at the fact that no one was moving to stop the beating even when others saw it happening; And finally Anger, anger at the boys that were hurting her hero and laughing about it. Without thinking Hinata grabbed a small rock and chucked it at the leader of the three, it hit its mark by slamming into the back of his head. Shocked at what she had just done she stood there till she noticed that the bully was speeding towards her with rage clearly in his eyes. Turning to run she only had a moment to note that the other two boys had been jump on from behind by Whiskers before they could follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran as fast as she could but, the bully just seemed to always be just on her tail, if she lost him then she only got a brief respite before he seemed to find her again and the chase started all over. Soon enough she had to stop, she was just too tired to keep going. Panting heavily she looked around and groaned at finding herself lost in the woods once again. Hearing the sound of movement  coming from behind her Hinata panicked. Jumping into a nearby bush she waited hoping she could come up with a way to get this bully to leave her and her Whiskers alone. And as if called on her stomach gave a small growl. Blinking in thought Hinata realize she did have a way to make the bully go away and get rid of anyone who tried to bully her or her hero again. So with a plan in mind she waited till the bully entered her view and moved past her before she struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lead up to where she was, as she tossed the sandals off into the woods, then just as she had for her meal before she threw her head back and gulped hard. With the boys feet firmly inside her mouth she gave another hard swallow while inwardly hoping that the boy was very uncomfortable as he slid the rest of the way down and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's face darkened as she covered her mouth with a hand, a meek <i>'excuse me'</i> being uttered through the hand. A second, small burp followed but, no excuse was given as Hinata rubbed her giant stomach contently. A loud groan signaled that it had already begun to work on its tenant. Shifting slightly, she covered her mouth as she yawned, the act of eating the older boy and her currently full stomach which wriggled around due to her meals struggles, trying to coax her to sleep. Deciding that taking a small nap wouldn\u2019t hurt Hinata dragged herself to a tree to lean against before relaxing and contently listening to the sound of her stomach gurgling around her meal. As sleep started to take her Hinata got an idea and smiled. Soon all of Whiskers bully problems would be relocated to her stomach. And with a small yawn Hinata soon fell fast asleep dreaming about all the people that would soon be living inside her tiny belly as said stomach loudly gurgled and groaned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata Hyuga gave a pained groan before stifling a small belch that tried to escape her. She was no longer the little eight year old girl she once was. She had passed her first year at the ninja academy and was now in the middle of her second year, making her nine. Not too much had really changed with the young Hyuga in that time. She was still naturally shy and timid. She still secretly enjoyed eating people and had eaten quite a few since learning she could. She had however, grown a couple of inches in hight and her body had been developing wonderfully due to the highly nutritious meals of civilians and chakra wielding academy students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Hinata was now wearing a white long sleeved shirt over her under-mesh. Over this she had on a large lavender colored long sleeved jacket, with a pink hood top and pink sleeve ends; the bottom nearly reaching down to her knees. Her long pants were a type of brownish color and a pair of blue ninja sandals finished her current attire. Hinata gave another groan as she rubbed the massive bulging sphere that was her belly, of which was only just barely covered by her loose jacket, the fabric and zipper straining to hold back the gut its wearer currently sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night Hinata had snuck in to the home of a old woman. The bottom half of this woman's home was a store and mostly sold things like fruits and veggies. The old 60 something woman had always been kind to Hinata, occasionally giving her a free apple or orange to snack on. However, last week Hinata had born witness to the old lady assaulting her crush and hero, Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto-kun hadn't even done anything. The woman simply took one look at him before running back into her store. Only moments after running back in the woman came back out, swinging a broom around wildly while shrieking at Naruto-kun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hadn't been able to let such actions go and immediately started making plans to remove the old croon from the world. She would except nothing less for the crime of possible breaking her crushes arm. The remains of what had once been that old hag were now sloshing loudly within the great dome of her belly. Still, the old bat hadn't gone quietly, or easily as Hinata's irritated stomach could attest to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata groaned again and rubbed the large bulge in her body, hoping it would help sooth her indigestion. Not only had the old hag tasted terribly sour but, she couldn't even digest properly. Hinata guessed it was her meals way of spiting her. She hadn't been able to get a wink of sleep last night due to the terrible stomach cramps and now she was on her way to her academy class, only to still be suffering from the hag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach burbled and churned loudly as it struggled with its uncooperative meal; a bit of gas escaping her in the form of a wet belch. She hated this. The only reason no one had noticed her disappearance or the massive bulge straining her jacket, was because no one in her clan really cared to pay attention to her. Of her clan the only one likely to notice anything would be her little sister Hanabi, but knowing her she wouldn't make a peep about it unless the little girl thought she was doing something bad. \"Bless her little heart.\" Thought Hinata just before another batch of gas forced its way out of her body. This time from the rear much to her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her face alight from embarrassment Hinata wondered if maybe she should just skip classes today. If she actually entered class people were likely to stare at her and she really didn't want her crush to see her while she was so bloated. Still, if she didn't go her father was likely to find out and then he'd ask her why and likely insult her, or tell her how much of a disappointment she was. Hinata's lower lip quivered at the thought as tears formed in her eyes. She knew she was a failure, she didn't need her beloved father to keep reminding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly gave an odd squelching sound and Hinata clutched her lower belly in pain. Out of all her meals, this had been her first time eating an adult. Most had been only a few years older then herself, one or two even being younger. This one had left her feeling so overly full, but she had enjoyed every minute of it. If terrible stomach pains were part of every adult meal however, she might just stick with eating others her own age. Feeling the cramp in her gut worsen, Hinata sat herself down on a nearby bench. It wasn't long till the pain vanished with the release of farther loud fart. Covering her face in shame, Hinata was seriously thinking of just staying where she was until she fully digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens?</b></span></div></div>",

Hinata had been having these odd dreams from time to time ever since she and her class had seen a live demonstration of a snake eating a meal much bigger then itself. She was nearing the end of her first year at the ninja academy when the demonstration had been given and she remembered the sight bringing an odd feeling to her soon-to-be nine year old self. The dreams of finding animals or even other people only to shove them into her mouth and start swallowing them like she had seen the snake do had popped up from time to time since then. This however, was worse than usual.  The dreams had been coming far more often than ever before and they were starting to affect her daily life. To top it off, she hadn\u2019t been eating much recently, as every time food was placed in front of her, her mind would go back to the dreams making her lose her appetite despite her body\u2019s demands for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for a spare piece of paper she now kept nearby when sleeping Hinata began jotting down small details of the dream, she would write out the full thing into her dream diary later. Looking to a clock Hinata couldn\u2019t help but sigh. <i>\u2018I woke up two hours early. I need to meet my team at 9am for training and then we are suppose to get our new mission. I wish I could go back to sleep but I know that I\u2019ll never get back to sleep with these thoughts in my head.\u2019</i> Thought the tired and hungry girl. Getting up she decided to get ready for the day and hope that it would keep her from returning to the images and feelings she had of her dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I wonder if Naruto or sensei would really taste that good?\u2019</i> The image from the end of her dream appeared at the forefront of her mind. <u><i>She was lying back against a tree, her pale creamy skinned stomach appearing as a large orb with various bumps in it as it shifted back and forth. Her meals in the dream having consisted of both of her teammates and her sensei, who now struggled against her powerful stomach and its digestive acids as they were slowly melted into a nutritious paste that her body would use to energize itself and maybe make her more attractive to her beloved Naruto.</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t help but lick her lips at the idea before realizing what she was fanaticizing about and shaking her head in hopes of clearing it. Despite how slow she had been going she found herself finishing her morning routine with an extra hour before she had to meet her team, so she spent that time trying to force some breakfast down, while trying not to let the thoughts about her dreams stop her. Failing to eat much of anything Hinata tiredly made her way toward her teams meeting place, the dream constantly popping up making her lick her lips in hunger the whole way there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning the starved girl saw one of her friends from the other teams of Konoha. Shyly waving as they approached her a idea suddenly slammed into her. Quickly and subtly checking the surrounding area Hinata found that very few people were out and about. Plus their was a small dark alley near by that would easily hide her while performing the deed she had in mind. Licking her lips at the thought of being full of a live squirming meal was exciting her as her one time friend soon-to-be victim walked closer. <i>'This is perfect. Soon I will have a nice full belly and be able to get some peace from my hunger.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i> Thought the shy girl. Hinata watch anxiously as her target got closer. <i>'Thats right morsel, come closer. Ohh, you will look so good as fat on my body and then... a-and then-n...

But, a friend would want to help me so,... so, that means I'm just helping them help me with my hunger... right?'</i> Clearly the hunger that she felt was starting to affect her thinking and would likely only return to normal after eating.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was starting to panic. Her hunger was growing and she had yet to find a way to escape. If she didn't get away soon, Hinata would soon stop caring about who or what she ate as long as something entered her belly. Hinata looked to the person who had stopped her. It was a blond girl with pale blue eyes wearing a reviling purple shirt and skirt, with white bandages covering most of her body underneath. This was Ino Yamanaka, the gossip queen. Now Hinata had nothing against Ino, in fact the blond was the closest female friend she'd had since the academy.  Because of this Hinata didn't feel comfortable with the idea of eating her, so she was looking for some way to getaway before she lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno however seemed to be having none of it, as she continued to speak about all sorts of things ranging from boys to clothes, boys, fashion, did she mention boys! Just as Hinata was about to give up hope she saw what might be her salvation. Sasuke Uchiha was walking down the road behind Ino. Hinata had heard about the mission to Wave and had worried about Naruto but, seeing how the team had made it home in one piece she had only felt pride in the blond boy.  Now however, that pride wasn\u2019t important, only distracting Ino long enough to get away was. The fact that she didn't really like the Uchiha only made it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Ino...\" Hinata was a little surprised at how the blond girl instantly stopped talking and listened. \"I-isn't that S-sasuke?\" she asked, yes it was insultingly easy to see what she was trying to do but, oddly, Ino fell for it easy. \"Your right Hinata, good eye. Oh Sasuke, Sasuke!!!\" Hinata watched the blond scamper after the Uchiha, she being the only one to notice the small increase in his walking speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, now that that is over with.'</i> Hinata quietly hurried off some streets away before she looked around. It was completely unintentional that her eyes happened to land on the back of a rather beautiful woman. She was about Kurenai height with shoulder length strait brown hair and a wonderful hourglass-figure, wearing a deep blue Yukata or casual/summertime kimono complete with a rich purple obi or sash. However instead of the normal geta (Wooden clogs) she was wearing a pair of tabi (Japanese socks) and zori sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women stopped and turned to look at the wares of a small fruit stand, this gave Hinata a good side profile. Now able to see her skin, Hinata saw no blemishes or scars. The tone showed that she was darker then Hinata's creamy white but, not quiet as dark as Naruto and his tanned skin. The woman eyes were a dark amber color, her nose small but, cute and a slight smile on her face made her a very beautiful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's eyes however were drawn to the large mass on her chest. <i>'How does she bend forward like that and not fall over? Those things are HUGE!!!'</i> thought the shy girl and she was right. The woman looked to be no more than three or four years older than her and was already at an estimated G-cup maybe a borderline double G-cup. Looking further down Hinata noted how the women's rump stuck out somewhat, this was only being emphasized by the slight curve in her back. <i>'So much MEAT! I must have her.'</i> thought the hungry Hyuga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thought of having a full stomach in mind, the young Hyuga began to follow the women from a distance, absently noting that she seemed to be a civilian. As she followed target however, it became increasingly difficult to keep herself from simply trying to eat the busty burnet in plain sight. She paid no mind to the fact that she was starting to drool, nor that her eyes were firmly planted on the mid-to-late teen\u2019s plump bottom, watching as it swayed side to side with each step. All that mattered was eating her and hope she didn't get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Now, how do I catch her?'</i> the hungry heiress asked herself. <i>'I could try sneaking closer to her and pressing a chakra point. It would knock her out for a few minutes but, would it be long enough for me to drag her somewhere that I could eat in peace?'</i> Hinata considered her options. In truth as taste as the women looked Hinata didn't want to eat the Yukata and Obi, it would just be such a waste to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I could keep following till a better opportunity shows its self but, I'm not sure I could last that long plus, my team will likely start looking for me soon.'</i> Hinata did not like the odds of the second option but, they could be the easier choice. Thinking it over Hinata decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud groan of hunger rang from the stomach of a young kunoichi as she continued to follow her prey as silently as possible. Hinata had in fact been following her chosen target for nearly two and a half hours now and was really starting to reach her limit in holding off her hunger. She had been sticking to the shadows or mingling in the crowds without drawing attention to herself. Knowing that her team would be out looking for her at some point, Hinata had taken extra precautions, such as; carefully removing any and all insects from her person and trapping them under potted plants or upside down cups, as well as moving through areas where her scent would be lost easily like in bakeries or flower houses and other such places. The first would ensure that Shino couldn\u2019t trace her with his bugs, were as the second would make Kiba and Akamaru have a near impossible time in catching her scent. Being on a tracking and recon team meant that Hinata knew the tricks of the trade and how to hide from pursuers. In the darkness of a nearby ally, Hinata was watching her future meal with her Byakugan. She couldn\u2019t help but, frown when she saw her meal meet up with another woman. Hinata assumed it was a friend of her targets but, that idea was quickly thrown out the window when she saw the two women kiss. <i>\u2018I really shouldn\u2019t be so surprised. Same sex lovers are rather normal in the shinobi world, especially among kunoichi.\u2019</i> Hinata continued to mentally grumble to herself at the turn of events while looking the newcomer over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t differentiate between colors while her Byakugan was active but, Hinata got a good enough look. The women was a few inches shorter then her burnet lover and not nearly as well filled out on top but, her legs and hips certainly made up for it. Long strait hair that went down to the small of her back, a heart shaped face with full lips and an upper body with just enough muscle definition to see that she was no push over. As said her chest couldn\u2019t compete with her burnet friend but, was still an attractive D-cup and looked as if she didn\u2019t wear a bra. The newcomers' lower body however was more muscled then her upper body and Hinata could tell that being on the receiving end of a kick from her would ruin anyone\u2019s day. Hinata rather enjoyed the sight of the bubbly quality her bottom had in response to the strong muscles. The women wore shinobi pants and sandals with a simple spandex top tightly hugging her like a second skin. From the way she moved Hinata was certain that this woman was a Kunoichi. Frowning Hinata watched as the two simply walked around and chat with their arms linked, all the while Hinata silently cursed her luck at how much harder things had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud growl of hunger caught her attention and made Hinata look down towards her starving tummy as it continued to quietly growl in impatient hunger. Patting her stomach in hopes of quieting it, Hinata whispered a promise that it would have a large squirming meal before the day\u2019s end but, first she needed to grab a snack to hold her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Later that day\u2026</u></b><br>\r\nNight was descending upon Konoha and Hinata was greatly annoyed. After grabbing some dumplings to try and hold over her hunger she had continued to shadow the two older women. She had even slipped into the hot springs bathhouse without them noticing so she wouldn\u2019t have to expend her chakra. Her reward had been to watch in a mix of embarrassment and fascination as the two started to get rather hot-an-heavy in the hot spring. Had someone else been their then Hinata would likely have fainted out of sheer mortification, as such she was quite proud of herself for holding strong. A small part of her filed what she had witnessed and learned away to explore and study later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, she was on a rooftop across from her targets home. Hinata had placed herself between some outcroppings in the roof she was on as well as the surrounding homes. This would allow her to focus her Byakugan on just her intended meal and her lover as they continued where they left off in the hot springs. For the next few hours she would watch the two as they ravished each other, silently making mental notes to some of what she saw and took only short breaks to relax her eyes. She was rather surprised that no one had spotted her knowing just how red her face had to be while watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Hinata was about to admit defeat in consuming her first human meal she saw her chance. One of the times she wasn\u2019t using her Byakugan Hinata had found out that the long haired kunoichi had black hair and tanned skin with piercing green eyes. And now that same kunoichi was exhaustedly making her way to her own room, obviously intending to grab something before returning to her naked burnet lover, whom was sleeping heavily in her own room. Hinata knew that this would be her best chance, the only problem being who to go after. She had planned to simply eat the now sleeping burnet but, with a trained kunoichi in the house Hinata realized she would have very little chance of eating her meal and getting away unnoticed. <i>\u2018Maybe I should eat the kunoichi first while she\u2019s exhausted, then I can have the civilian for breakfast tomorrow morning.\u2019</i> Thought the white-eyed heiress. The idea did make sense as she would then have two meals for the price of simply waiting a little longer for the burnet to fill her hungry tummy. Licking her lips while thinking over her options, her stomach let loose the loudest and most demanding growl for food she\u2019d had all day. Her stomach didn\u2019t care who filled it as long as someone did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to lose the element of surprise due to her stomach made a split second decision and moved to slip in to the window of\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was surprisingly easy to slip into the kunoichis' room. Simply using the tree walking exercise to stick to the outer wall and applying the same principle to her hand and the window had been all it took to gain silent entrance. After slipping in it was a simple matter of returning the window to its previous position and silently latching herself over the doorframe. She turned off her Byakugan so as to not give away her position should her target have any sensory abilities. She didn\u2019t want to be caught just because she was using her chakra; besides, even without her Byakugan being active she still had better eyesight then most and was perfectly capable of working in the shadows. Hinata stiffened slightly at the sound of the door under her opening and closing softly. She watched silently as the obviously exhausted black haired kunoichi walked into the room and moved towards a desk just under the window she had entered from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealth fully dropping down to the ground Hinata took a quick look around the room. She could make out draws and dressers as well as other things that Hinata held no interest in on the left hand side of the room. In the opposite side sat a bed that looked to be rarely used as well as a small night stand next to the head of the bed. Turning her focus back to the kunoichi Hinata saw her seemingly making some last minute additions to a scroll on the table. Even with her greater sight Hinata couldn\u2019t make out what was being written without activating her Byakugan, so she instead carefully made sure the door to the room was locked before tiptoeing towards her target. The kunoichi seemingly made the finishing touches to her report and turned just as Hinata got into striking range. And strike she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick strike to the women\u2019s throat cut off any chance to call or shout for help as Hinata\u2019s gentle fist damaged the vocal cords rendering them nearly useless. While the kunoichi grabbed her throat in surprise and pain, Hinata quickly grabbed her and with a sweeping kick the younger girl threw the kunoichi to the ground. Activating her Byakugan to insure she hadn\u2019t awaken the taste looking burnet a few rooms down the hall, while leaping on top of her soon to be meal, Hinata quickly settled herself on the older woman\u2019s waist. Effectively straddling the recovering Kunoichi, Hinata slammed two chakra filled open palms into the older woman\u2019s shoulders, one to each. While this limited the elder of the two\u2019s mobility Hinata decided to be cautious and make a quick strike to each elbow, thereby removing any chance for retaliation through those limbs. Starting to make sense of what was happening to her, the kunoichi shifted herself so as to use her strong legs to attack her attacker from behind. Hinata however, foiled this by moving herself to be sitting upon her soon-to-be meals thighs, just above the knees. The younger girl kept the powerful legs pinned by locking her own legs to the sides of said knees before giving a few chakra filled taps to the hips and upper thighs of the kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata panted lightly as she slowly rose from her position now that the elder kunoichi was temporarily crippled. Hinata took a few deep calming breaths in hopes of getting her heart to stop beating so fast, before she lifted the woman whom would soon be coating the walls of her stomach as a nutritious soup and as gently as possible, tossing her facedown unto the bed. Moving closer Hinata could see the slight shaking of the woman\u2019s limbs as she tried to fight off the sluggish paralysis she was experiencing due to Hinata\u2019s chakra blocking up her own. Hinata, unthinkingly, removed her jacket and let it fall to the floor before doing the same to her shirt and under mesh top, leaving her upper half bare. She took a step towards the twitching feet, planning to start with them so she wouldn\u2019t have the taste of feet in her mouth at the end of her meal, but suddenly she just stopped and looked at the prone and nude woman that she had only just moments ago been thinking about as a tasty meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018What is wrong with me?\u2019</i> she asked herself. <i>\u2018Am I really thinking of eating another kunoichi, a comrade? A fellow human? I, I need to stop this. I need to\u2026\u2019</i> her thoughts were never finished as a low but powerful growl for food emitted from her stomach. Hinata looked towards her bare stomach with something akin to horror before she lifted her head and looked back to the still prone Kunoichi before with a look of reluctance. She was reluctant because she realized something. She was too far in to back out. <i>\u2018I\u2019ve already attacked a fellow kunoichi of Konoha. If I simply leave then she will look for whoever attacked her and will either kill them or bring them before the Hokage to be tried. Either way, if I leave then everything is over for me.\u2019</i> Hinata sighed sadly. \u201cSeems I no longer have a real choice.\u201d She muttered to herself, her stomach growling again as if to agree with such a statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Then lets begin.\u2019</i> She thought to herself before clapping her hands together in thanks. \u201cThank you for the meal.\u201d She muttered before grabbing the twitching feet and moving them towards her mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few years after the Kyuubi's attack on Konoha, a team of kunoichi had developed a fascinating new jutsu while trying to find a way to transport a prisoner safely and with no chance of them escaping.  It had taken a while, but they finally figured out that by consuming the prisoner, and guarding the stomach lining with an indestructible wall of chakra, they could move them with ease.  This jutsu even allowed them to control the digestive process so the prisoner wouldn't die from the natural process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, this jutsu was taught as part of the standard curriculum at the ninja academy.  By the time they graduated, every young kunoichi had mastered this jutsu.  Of course, there were those who would use it as they wanted, but it was hard to pin down exactly who did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year was the graduating class of Naruto Uzumaki, and he had just recieved his headband from Iruka, his teacher, for having learned the shadow clone jutsu.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stumbled slightly as he tried to recover from bumping into something soft or in this case someone. He spotted the person he had bumped into just as they spoke. \u201cNaruto\u2026\u201d said the other the tone holding a low somewhat threatening growl-like quality to it. \u201cS-Sakura! Hey, sorry about that. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Naruto hoped that she would simply except the apology and be done with it as he really didn\u2019t feel like running for his life right now. Despite Naruto's apology Sakura simply gave an annoyed huff while calling him a baka (idiot). <i>'I haven\u2019t been punched yet. That\u2019s a good sign, right?\u2019</i> thought the blond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruno Sakura was one of the larger and more voracious girls in his class. Her size was a testament to this fact as Sakura stood over his downed form while eagerly rubbing a bulging tummy. Her pale flesh tested the tight confines of her trademark red dress, jiggling with every movement that the now flabby ninja-in-training made. Her hips flared out, seemingly for attention, all the while supporting a monster bubble-butt. One of Sakura's hands, and the chubby fingers attached to it, was currently fumbling with the buttons on her top, acting as a last resort to holding back her huge belly which gurgled with fervor, whither out of hunger or digestion was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny who took the moment to really look at him would notice that Naruto was very nervous with Sakura so close. It wasn\u2019t because of the small crush he had on her back when they where younger, it was because he had seen what she could do to someone that pissed the hungry girl off enough. He really did not want to get that close to his old crush. Naruto gave a small shudder as his mind went back to that incident. At the simple age of 10 he had born witness to the sight of a 10 year old girl eating the majority of the class ahead of them. That event had left a lasting impression and had quickly killed off any feeling he had for the girl. Naruto silently reaffirmed his promise to himself that he would avoid having such an intimate meeting with Sakura\u2019s digestive track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked as he realized that Sakura was talking to him. \"So Baka, why are on your way to the academy? You failed remember?\" Naruto unconsciously took a few small steps back. He didn't know why but, something about the way Sakura was carrying herself put him on edge. \"No. I did pass but, there were complications that kept me from getting my passing grade at the time of the test.\u201d Naruto felt like patting himself on the back for the quick excuse. Idly he looked down towards her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Sakura? You've had breakfast already, right?\", asked the blond as he got ready to run should her answer be no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunoichi could be considered lucky as one would think that eating and digesting other people would be rather fattening. However, the justu they used somehow made their digestive tract much more efficient as digesting someone actually left just enough fat on their bodies to be noticeable. He had once asked Iruka about it and he had said that as long as a kunoichi trained hard enough, they could easily work away any leftover fat from their meals. Not that all the girls did this however. Sakura was one such girl. She would eat a good number of people Naruto's size then just lay back and digest. She did no training at all yet, she was amazingly agile and persistent when it came to catching her meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took a moment before answering, as if considering the best way to word it. \"Well, I did have breakfast and my after breakfast snack.\" Said the fat girl in an off handed manner, while giving her belly a small shake. Now that he was more focused on it, Naruto could easily see the forms of two people about his size struggling just under the thick layer of blubber on the girl. Despite seeing two people dying in agonizing digestion, Naruto felt greatly relieved at knowing that she wasn't hungry anymore. \"Then again I did happen to lose track of my after breakfast snack-snack. Sneaky little Hyuga girl.\" This made Naruto nervous all over again and the look that Sakura was giving him now wasn't helping. \"I'm still so hungry! Think you could help with that Naruto?\" Naruto laughed nervously as he knew exactly how Sakura wanted him to help ease her hunger. \"Yeah... About that... Um, Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ran as fast as he could from his potential eater, yet no matter what he did she was somehow always right behind him, that look of hunger gleaming in her eyes. Getting desperate, Naruto pushed chakra to his legs and ever so slowly he started to gain a little distance from the ground shaking steps of his hungry predator. He needed to get to the academy. If he could just find Iruka-sensei then he would be safe.</span></div></div>",

He knew this quite well from the time he had run face first into one of the water tanks adorning the occasional roof in the village. Those where not fun times. Running full speed into a person however was very new for him, especially so when considering who it was that he had slammed into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe *eep* noise made by the girl was unmistakable, and before he even laid eyes on her, he knew it was the dark-haired, shy heiress of the Hyuga clan. This one girl was the only one that Naruto truly felt comfortable near ever since the girls had learned to eat others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also the most confusing of all of them. He had seen just last year how gluttonous the shy and soft spoken girl could be. Like many of the other girls, he would sometimes catch Hinata looking at him with hunger in her eyes. Oddly, it seemed different then the hungry gaze all the other girls gave him. He couldn't for the life of him explain what it was and like never would be able to. All he knew for sure was that Hinata was the only kunoichi from class that clearly put in the long hours of training to stay in shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he know this? Because unlike the other girls who where massive blobs of flab on legs like Sakura or Ino, or even the only somewhat-on-the-chubby-side girls that dominated the class, Hinata was the only one that remained quite thin. Hinata was in fact the thinnest girl in class; not in a unhealthy way, more like a strong and fit manner. Though there was clearly some pudge on her from the feel of it. In some dark and rarely used corner of his mind he approved of this. He personally thought the girl would look rather cute with a little padding on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sor...sorry Hinata, I was in a big hurry and I didn't see you there.\" the blond genin apologized while trying to get up. Hinata blushed a cherry red at the fact that she had just been pressed against the very boy that she had been nurturing a massive crush on for some time. It was practically the best moment of her young life. At least it would have been had a certain hungry pink haired predator finally catch up to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only warning the two had was the sound of something heavy slamming to a stop right behind Naruto and said heavy thing screaming, <b>\"Get In My BELLY!\"</b></span></div></div>",

She was doing this in preparation for the absolute Hell she knew was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still can't believe this!' She groaned internally. 'Of all teams, I get the two most gluttonous, spoiled and dysfunctional kunoichi the program has seen in some time!...I'll just have to deal with it...some way.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment, Naruto came running up the stairs, fearfully looking behind him for a second before turning back to Kurenai expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded to him. \"Just take a seat Naruto.\" As he did so, a thought occurred to her. \"Why were you running up here?\" Kurenai had a guess but she wanted to hear it from her would-be student's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tugged at his collar nervously. \"W-Well, sensei, I'm just really excited to be a ninja and want to get started right way! Also...you see...\" Naruto trailed off, sullenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai sighed. That confirmed her worst fears. \"You're really scared of them, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded rapidly. \"Believe it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Sakura and Ino came lumbering up the stairs. They were pressed against each other, trying to knock the other off balance. As the two blob of girls approached, Naruto quickly scooted away, putting some distance between them. Kurenai noted that he didn't get closer to her, like logic might dictate. Instead, Naruto tried to get further away from Sakura and Ino while still giving himself a good amount of space from Kurenai. The red eyed Jonin frowned at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto's afraid of getting eaten.' She noted to herself. 'Then again, considering Sakrua and Ino's appetites and having to be constantly around them, that doesn't surprise me. He's become paranoid and it doesn't help that his teammates keep justifying it.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Kurenai spoke, getting all three Genin's attention. \"I'm Kurenai Yuhi. I will be your instructor. As a newly formed team, I'd like for you all to introduce yourselves. Your names, likes, dislikes, dreams...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura tried to speak up but Ino beat her to it. \"I'm Ino Yamanaka. I like flowers, dreamy guys and getting lots of practice with my vore jutsu.\" She even patted her large belly for emphasis. \"I dislike going without a meal and forehead over here. \" Ino jerked her thumb at Sakura who glared back. \"My dream is to become the best at vore jutsu and marry a hot guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sakura got a word in. \"My name is Sakura Haruno. I like having a full stomach. I dislike Ino-pig and going hungry. My dream is...well...\" She stared at Ino hungrily, who gave returned the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai turned to Naruto, who smiled for declaring. \"My name's Naruto Uzumaki. I like ramen and Iruka-sensei. I dislike the 3 three minutes you have wait for ramen. My dream is to become the greatest Hokage!\" 'If I don't get eaten first.' He added mentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai took all that in. 'It's just like I thought. Ino and Sakura are just rampaging gluttons. They'll eat each other, Naruto or even me if given half a chance. They're a liability and danger to everyone whose around them! Luckily, Naruto's much like his profile described. He's knucklehead with a ramen obession but he at least has clear goal and apparently learned the Shadow Clone jutsu in a just a few hours. It's amazing how the deadlast is the only ray of hope on this team!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything tied up for now, she told the team to meet her at the training ground in the morning at 8 am. The moment she'd let them go Naruto, had once again, bolted before Sakura or Ino could react, jumping from rooftop to rooftop with almost reckless abandon. As for the two girls, they'd left in opposite direction after giving each other a heated stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone at last, Kurenai once again thought on the situation. 'Those two are trouble. I can't trust them. At all. I certainly can't teach if I'm watching my back 24/7. Then there's Naruto. If he gets eaten, the Kyuubi could potentially burst free. It's not a certainty but it's not a risk the village or I can take. Not too mention, he's the only one whose got his head on at least somewhat straight. Yet, he's also scared stiff of kunoichi due his experiences. He won't get far. If I can't teach while watching my back, it'll be utterly impossible to watch out for myself and Naruto. At least one of those girls has got to go. Heck, if I'm honest, it would be better if they're both gone and I just have Naruto. No matter what, the team would be benched for a little while before we get issued new recruits. That give me some time with Naruto to iron out his issues and a chance to get a much better team. Besides...I haven't have that good of meal in while. The Genin test be an excellent opportunity to for it.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai contemplated on what she should do. No matter what, she had get rid of at least one of the girls, she decided. If questioned why, she could just claim that one of them had planned on eating her and it became self-defense. It wasn't like they hadn't thought about. Kurenai still remembered how they looked at her back in the classroom. However, going for both could be dangerous. She could get pinned down while eating one and end up devoured herself. It wasn't like she could count on Naruto to intercede. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai decided that she'd make up her mind when she unveiled the test on the 'team' tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kurenai was standing at the appointed spot where she and her team would meet in order to begin there first tests to prove they are capable of being ninja. Looking down at her wrist watch she saw that it five minutes until eight thirty. \"They should be here soon, hopefully if all goes well this'll help fix this disaster of a team. Gonna have to remember to thank Kakashi for this idea when we're done.\" She thinks to herself looking at her bag. About a moment later she heard the sound of someone approaching. Looking over she sees a Naruto making his way over. \"Good morning Kurenai-sensei.\" Naruto says with a yawn. \"Good morning Naruto. I hope you're ready for today's test.\" She says with a smile as he approaches. It was hard for her to believe that out of her entire team, she was genuinely the happiest to see the sole male member. It was then that she noticed that he was still standing a good distance from her, the look on his face suddenly changing to a nervous one. \"Looks like he still doesn't trust me yet, not completely anyway.\" She thinks to her self, realizing that this problem was going to need to be addressed sooner rather than later. \"Naruto, there's something I'd talk to you for a minute about.\" She says getting his attention from whatever thoughts was currently running through his head. \"Oh, uh, sure, what's up?\" He asks. \"You know you don't have to be afraid of me right? It's not like I'm going to eat you or anything.\" She says hoping to help him calm down, only to realize he seemed to get even more tensed up at what she said. \"Sorry, that was a poor choice of words on my part.\" She says apologizing. \"N-No It's okay. I know you're trying to help. In fact you're probably the only female ninja I've felt comfortable around in a long time. It's just everyone else just sort of ignores me or gives me these looks like they don't want me around or worse. And whenever I'm with girls my age It just seems like all they're thinking about is what I might taste like when they eat me. But you don't seem to be like any of the others Kurenai-sensei. You actually treat me like a person instead of a possible meal, and I'm really grateful for that, It's just.....\" He trails off. \"Don't worry Naruto, I understand.\" She says with an understanding smile. \"You've been living your life in a certain way for a long time now, and to be honest that's probably one of the big reasons you've made it this far. But now that you're a ninja you need to learn how to handle being in a team and how to handle being around Kunoichi in general. Which is why I promise you, right here and now. That I will do everything I can to help you so that you won't always have to be worried about being eaten, you have my word.\" At this Naruto begins to visibly relax. In fact he even begins moving closer to her. \"Thanks Kurenai-sensei, that means a lot! And i promise I'll do my best to live up to your expectations!\" He says with a large smile. At this point Kurenai couldn't help but smile back, sure he may be a bit of a spazz and have a crippling, if not rational fear of women. But he's still a good kid and his heart is definitely in the right place. She was definitely going to enjoy teaching Naruto to become a ninja, now all that's left is figure out what she was going to do with her OTHER students. \"Watch we're you're going Ino-pig!\" \"What? You're the one who bumped into ME bill-board brow!\" And as if on cue, the familiar voices of said students could be heard coming down that pathway. At which point Naruto's instinctive survival reflex kicked in and caused him to quickly dart behind Kurenai in an attempt to hide from his new team mates. \"*Sigh* Oh well, he's finally starting to feel comfortable around me at least.\" She thinks to herself as she pats Naruto on the head to try and calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after getting the two girls to stop arguing and Naruto to calm down the four went over to the center of the field. Kurenai standing in front of her three students and looking them over. \"Alright everyone. It's time to begin your first test as real ninja.\" She says, the look on their faces showing she had their full attention. \"Now as you three know, In order to be a successful ninja, you must be skilled in several techniques including Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, and Genjutsu. But that's not all, you all must also be able to complete missions and work as a team, from simple tasks such as supply gathering to delivering messages, to the important tasks of being body guards to political targets or even assassination.\" At this point a look comes over the girls faces as they begin to imagine said assassination missions, or rather the fact that they would get to eat said assassination targets and digest them and be rewarded for it. It was every young girls dream to be able to do make a living off of this. \"Now then, In order to figure out just how well you're all able to succeed in these missions. I'm going to be administering one final test before we begin taking on real missions.\" She says as she reaches into her bag and pulls out two bells. \"Your objectives Is to retrieve these bells from me. You may do so however you wish, If you manage to take the bell from me, then you will have passed the test and will be considered fully fledged ninja.\" She explains. At this point, Sakura interrupts. \"But Kurenai-sensei, you only have two bells there. How are we all supposed to get one if you don't have enough?\" She asks. \"Ah, I'm glad you noticed Sakura, yes, there are indeed only two bells here. Meaning that no matter what, one of you Is going to fail this test. And to the one who fails, they will be sent back to the academy.\" She says to their shock. \"What?!? But Kurenai-Sensei, we've already passed the exam and became ninja! You can't just-\" Ino starts, only to for Kurenai to stop her. \"Actually, I CAN. The school may say you have the ability to become ninja, but I'm the one who gets to decide whether or not you're ready to actually be a ninja. In this world you need to be ready to make certain choices, make the necessary sacrifices in order to complete the mission! Meaning that If you all can't put aside your petty differences and work together, you're not ready to be a ninja.\" She finishes, at which point the three of them all look at each other. \"And don't even THINK about eating one of your team mates just to get a bell because if you do you will automatically FAIL and be sent back to the academy.\" Kurenai adds seeing the look on Sakura and Ino's faces. At which point the two audibly groan, while at the same time Naruto Sighs in relief. Glad he didn't have to worry about getting eaten just so that they could pass. \"Now then, the test will begin at nine O'clock and will end at noon. Meaning you will have three hours to get one of these bells. If none of you manage to do so at this point, you will all fail and-\" At this point Sakura jumps at Kurenai and tackles her to the ground. Punching her until she was knocked out and proceeds to takes one of the bells from her. \"Tch, well THAT was easy.\" She says with a grin. \"You two have fun deciding who gets the last bell. I'll be getting something to eat if anyone needs me.\" She says as she beings walking away. Thinking about what she's going to have when a hand touched her shoulder. \"Oh really? And here I thought you actually wanted to be a ninja.\" Comes a familiar voice as Sakura turns around in shock to see none other than Kurenai standing there. \"What?!? But I thought-\" She starts looking over to where she had left her unconscious, only to see a large wooden log laying in her place. Looking down she sees that the bell she had grabbed was in fact nothing more than a leaf. Realizing she had fallen for such a simple trick she turned back to Kurenai ready to try again. Only to re-think her decision when she saw the look on her face. \"May I remind you that I'm not just an ordinary Ninja, I am a Jonin, a high ranking officer that has had YEARS of experience. And it's going to take a lot more then a simple surprise attack to take me down. Speaking of which, I said the mission begins at nine O'clock. So i suggest you take this time to work on a better plan.\" She says as she points back toward Naruto and Ino. To which Sakura mumbles under her breath as she walks back to the others. \"Now then, I want you all to take this time to prepare and make sure you know what you're going to do. Dismissed.\" She says as she walks over to a near by tree and leans back against it. At which point the three genin all look towards each other once again before running off in different directions. \"*Sigh* I suppose that went about as well as expected.\" She says to herself as she begins to think this plan may have been a mistake. \"Now all I have to do is just fend off those two idiots for the next three hours while at the same time try and find a good chance to slip Naruto a bell in a way that won't make it look like I'm just handing it to him....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what's with this?\" Naruto says to himself. Hiding in the bushes near by and looking over at Kurenai. \"One minute she's saying she'll help me get over my fear of women and become a great ninja, next minute she's saying that If i don't get a bell off of her I'll be sent back to the academy! I really don't get girls.\" He says to himself while trying to figure out what he was going to do. True she made sure that Sakura and Ino wouldn't just try to eat him to pass the test, and she definitely doesn't seem like she's trying to eat him. But how in the world is he supposed to get close enough to her to be able to take a bell off of her without freaking out? Let alone while having to deal with her defending herself. \"Hey Naruto!\" Came a familiar voice from behind him, causing him to jump before turning back to see none other than.....</span></div></div>",

Worried that she may be ignoring Kurenai-sensei warning and came to eat him for the heck of it. Only for that fear to be quickly quieted by what she had to say. \"Relax, I'm not here to eat you or anything like that, but we need to talk.\" She says moving up next to him so that she could see Kurenai as well. \"Um, okay, what about?\" He asks having to ignore the feeling of her soft body pressing up against his in the small space they had. \"What do you think? We need to get those bells off of Kurenai-sensei so that we can become ninja!\" She says in a \"No-duh!\" kind of way. \"Oh, wait-we?\" He asks surprised by this. The way she had phrased that made it seem like she was asking for his help. \"Yes, we.\" She continues. \"*Sigh* Look, I know you and I have never really gotten along for, obvious reasons.\" She says as her stomach lets out a low growl. Naruto resisting the urge to run the moment he heard said sound and continue to listen. \"But as of now we're at a cross roads. As much as I may hate to admit this, there's no way any of us will be able to get one of those bells off of Kurenai-sensei by our selves. Which means our only options are to either fail and go back to the academy for another year. Or work together and try and get those bells. And I'd rather go back to the academy for the rest of my life than work with Sakura!\" She says this last part with a look of annoyance. \"And from what I've seen you like Sakura just about as much as i do. So right now the obvious choice would be for us to put our pasts behind us and work together to get those bells. That way Sakura ends up failing and goes back to the academy, and you and i get to go on to be ninja's. It's a win-win! So what do you say?\" She asks holding her hand out to him. Naruto had to stop and think about this for a moment. Ino brought up a lot of good points.There was no way in hell he'd be able to get one of those bells off of Kurenai-Sensei by himself. And If he fails and ends up going back to the academy, there's no telling when he'd get another chance, and that's assuming he doesn't end up getting eaten before then. So the only logical choice was to work together, and while he has had close calls with both girls before. With Ino it was never really personal, it was usually just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She didn't seem to be openly targeting him most of the time like Sakura, who has openly admitted on several occasions that she'd eat him the first chance she got. This seemed like the only logical path to him, so after pushing all of his thoughts telling him to get away from her out of his mind. He slowly reached out and took Ino's hand and shook it. \"Deal, so any idea's on how we're gonna get those bells?\" He asks turning his attention back to Kurenai. At this Ino smiles. \"As a matter of fact, I do, and it's a rather brilliant one if i do say so myself!\" She says in a matter of fact tone. \"Now listen up, my family is famous for its use of the mind transfer jutsu. A technique that allows us to take over the mind and body of the user. With it, all I have to do is use it to take over Kurenai-sensei's mind and get the bells from her.\" She starts. \"Wow, really? Then why haven't you just done that already?\" Naruto asks surprised by this fact. \"It's not that simple.\" Ino continues. \"I need to be within a certain range in order to use the jutsu, not to mention it requires having the target in my line of sight, and using it tends to leave me open to attacks from the enemy. So even if I did try and use it, Kurenai-sensei would just dodge it and take me out before i could do anything. That's where you come in.\" She says with a grin, \"Oh no.\" He says already not liking where this was going. \"I need you to draw Kurenai-sensei towards me and keep her distracted so that I can use the mind transfer jutsu on her. Then I'll be able to just hand you the bells and you can bring one back to me.\" She finishes. \"And how exactly do you expect me to do that?!? If you can't get close enough to beat her then what makes you think I have any more of a chance?!?\" He asks. \"I told you you didn't have to beat her, I just said you just need to keep her distracted and in place long enough for me to use my jutsu on her. I heard you were able to use the shadow clone jutsu right? So just use that to get her into position and keep her there long enough for me to do my thing and that'll be it. Unless you have a better idea?\" She asks looking at him with a raised eye brow. \"Ugh, fine.\" Naruto said as he accepted that this was really the only plan that stood any chance of working. \"Just be ready with your mind-whatever when it's time.\" He says getting ready to jump out of the bushes, only to be stopped by Ino who grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back. \"What are you NUTS?!?\" She hissed. \"If you come out from here Kurenai-sensei will know where I'm at and will be able to see what we're up too! Go find somewhere else to jump out from!\" She finishes. \"Oh, uh, right.\" Naruto says sheepishly as he crawls away from Ino. \"Ugh, Idiot. This better work.\" She says to herself as she waits for the plan to begin.</span></div></div>",

After he crawled away from her, Naruto had not only started moving around Kurenai's position, circling her, but he actually discretely been making a leaving groups of Shadow Clones. As Naruto changed position, the clones would emerge from the brush and begin their assault/distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>If I throw enough clones at Kurenai-sensei, I think I can force her closer to where Ino is</i>,' Naruto thought as he made another batch of clones. '<i>Also, if I stay hidden like this, there's less of a chance one of those crazy girls will eat me!</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, for her part, actually grinned. '<i>Well, well, well...I guess Naruto is more useful then just being a meal! Now I just gotta be patient and wait for Kurenai-sensei...</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on Kurenai's side of things...she actually found the multi-pronged attack to be a bit troublesome. Her larger frame made dodging and dealing with the clones more arduous then it really should have been for a ninja of her caliber. Not to say that Kurenai wasn't good enough to fend them off but close quarters combat wasn't her true forte. As a genjutsu specialist, she was usually good enough to keep such attacks at bay by making her enemies see manner of things, allowing her to get the drop on them. But with some many clones coming at her, she really didn't have the time for such an approach.

At the same time Kurenai felt a sudden rise in chakra from near by. <i>\"Is that Ino? What Is she-*gasp!*\"</i> She thinks to herself before she felt the presence of another person entering her mind. At that moment, Kurenai's body locks up, before going limp as her arms fall to her sides and her head falls forward, making it appear as though she passed out standing up. Seeing this causes the shadow clones to stop their assault on their teacher as they wait to see what happens next. \"Did..... Did it work?\" One of the clones ask, watching curiously and carefully, hoping beyond hope that the plan had actually worked.<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, Kurenai finally began to stir from her trance. Her head slowly rising up, taking a moment to look down at her body before turning back to look at the shadow clones silently for a moment before a large grin spread across her face. \"Alright! We did it! The plan worked perfectly! Just like I knew it would!\" Kurenai finally spoke as she placed one hand on her hip, the other one rising into the air and delivering a V sign, and while what she said was with her usual voice, the way she spoke and her mannerisms seemed different now, like they belonged to someone younger and more wild than her. At this, the clones of Naruto all let out a collective sigh of relief. \"Oh thank goodness...\" One of them says before they all begin to disappear one by one.<br>\r\nSoon leaving only the real Naruto making his way out from the bushes on the other side of the field. \"Great job with the timing there Ino, for a second there I was worried we might have messed up and had to try again.\" He says walking over to his now possessed teacher. \"You weren't so bad yourself there Naruto! With my brains and your brawn, we might actually make a pretty good team!\" She says with a smile. \"Now then,\" She says reaching down to her waist, pulling off the two bells. \"Here you go, with this our paths to becoming ninja are secured!\" She says as she hands them to him. \"Alright!...... So what happens now?\" He asks looking at Kurenai and then back to where Ino was hiding.<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to undo the jutsu and return to my body. You're gonna wanna hurry and bring that bell over to me, because It'll only be a few seconds before Kurenai-Sensei wakes up and realizes what happened.\" She briefly explaining how the mind transfer jutsu worked. \"Now hurry up and get over here, I wanna be holding my bell before she fully wakes up.\" She says getting ready to perform the hand signs to release the jutsu. \"Um, hold on a second...\" Naruto says stopping her. \"Ugh, what is it now Naruto?\" She asks growing annoyed with him again. \"Well it's just that something doesn't seem right, this went way to smoothly, I mean, whatever happened to Sakura? You'd think she'd have tried to get one of the bells by now.\" He says now worried. \"Oh great, you just had to go and remind me of her now didn't you?\" She says putting her hand to her forehead and rub it in annoyance. But he was right, this was odd, It wasn't like her to just give up without even trying. Yet here they were already nearly finished without even a single sign of her anywhere, something was definitely wrong. Where could she be?......</span></div></div>",

When she saw an opening, she took it and such a mindset was how she got to her current size. With that said, it was no surprise that she had avoided all the confrontation to simply watch how things played out. She was going to get a meal out of this, she just didn't know who or how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai was more than likely out of the question. Sakura honestly doubted she could get the drop on a Jonin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto? Maybe...he was an idiot (at least, in Sakura's opinion) but he had also become in expert in dodging her over the years. While that alone would be all kinds of cathartic for her, he wouldn't be the most filling meal and, thus, not worth the effort for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno...oh, how Sakura longed to devour her rival. To finally prove her superiority and get the biggest morsel in the village. The very thought made drool! So you could imagine her delight once she overheard Naruto and Ino planning. She stumbled upon them by accident as she took off into the forest and hidden in a spot that was not too far from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so perfect. Once Ino did her little jutsu, her body would be easy pickings and even if she didn't actually get a chance to use the technique, she'd be so distracted focusing on Kurenai that it wouldn't matter. So, she waited and watched as Naruto and Ino actually maneuvered Kurenai into their trap. After they succeeded, Sakura started to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way towards where Ino's body lay, Sakura started to open her jaw, ready to ponce once she was close enough...  </span></div></div>",

She knew she was going to have to move quickly here. There was no telling how long It would be before Ino's consciousness returned to her body and realize what was happening, and even with Sakura's level of skill when It came to eating others it was going to take a while before she could eat Ino's large frame. So as much as she may have wanted to enjoy this moment for as long as possible, she knew that time was not on her side and that she'd need to do this quickly as she took her first big swallow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with Naruto and Ino, both had looked around for any signs of Sakura in the area, but found absolutely no trace of her. \"Damn it, where the hell did that billboard brow run off too? There's just no sign of her anywhere.\" Ino said as she scanned the area using Kurenai's body. Having no idea what was happening with her real body. \"Yeah no kidding,\" Naruto added looking around from the tree tops. Still worried Sakura may pop out from behind him in an attempt to get a quick meal. \"This is just too weird. Sakura was never too big on the whole \"stealth\" thing. Whenever she wants something she would normally just go straight for it and not let anything get in her way. Why would she not try to get a bell when she knows it's the only thing standing between her and being a ninja?\" He asks knowing enough about Sakura to know that she was dead set determined to become a ninja since it meant that she'd be allowed to eat people at a much more frequent rate than she already has been. \"It's more than just that.\" Ino added as she kept looking. \"It's not just that she goes straight for whatever she wants. She does it in the way that would benefit her the most, especially if it meant getting a free.... meal......\" She says stopping as a thought occurred to her. \".....Oh no....\" She says as it finally hit her. Naruto noticing this turns to look at her from his view point. \"What? What's wrong?\" He asks now confused. \"I need to get back to my body now!\" She says preparing to undo her mind transfer jutsu. \"Huh? Why? What's going on?\" Naruto asks not realizing what Ino already has. <i>\"God how could I be so stupid! Sakura is an opportunist at heart! She'll do whatever she can to get to her goal while taking out as many birds with a single stone as possible! Meaning she probably realized she doesn't have to get a bell if she takes one of us out before we get one ourselves!\"</i> She thinks to herself, hoping she was wrong as she performed the hand signs to undo the jutsu. \"RELEASE!\" She says. Kurenai's eyes going blank for a moment as Ino's mind leaves her body. \"What...?\" She asks putting her hand to her head. Confused as to what was happening. A moment later a loud scream could be heard coming from the bushes where Ino's body was hidden. \"What the? Ino!?!\" Naruto yelled as he quickly jumped from the tree he was in and dove into the bushes. \"Ino, what's wrong? What's-?!?!?\" He says before stopping in shock and slight horror at the sight in front of him....</span></div></div>",

It was Ino's fault...right? She left her body open, despite knowing what Sakura was like. Besides, Ino wasn't exactly innocent. She'd eaten numerous people and tried to get him more than a few times. And yet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was only in this position because she decided to help him and team up, which he had agreed to. She had put herself on the line so that they could actually pass...like a team. She'd put the team and the mission ahead of trying to get a free meal. So, if a bottomless pit of a predator like Ino could put aside her personal wants, shouldn't he be able to? He wanted to be Hokage! Wouldn't a Hokage conqueror their fears and face whatever they had? Wouldn't a Hokage risk their life to save a comrade? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Ino!\" Naruto bellowed as he went into a full sprint. \"Shadow Clone Jutsu!\" Multiple copies of Naruto joined him as they charged towards the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Ino could hear Naruto's words, even if they were muffled and to say that they girl was relieved was an understatement. Once Sakura had clamped her jaws around her head, Ino had given up. In that moment, the Yamanaka had known true terror and despair. This was karma, for all the innocent people she had eaten. This was what they had all gone through as she dragged them down into her gullet. Panic had flooded her mind as she tried desperately to free herself. But then she heard Naruto. He was coming to help her! He'd get her out! If Ino wasn't crying before she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please! Help m-me!\" She wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fellow blonde needed no more incentive. Naruto and some of his clones rushed to Ino's side and grabbed what they could of her bulk. The rest went behind Sakura and did the same. Both teams of Narutos pulled as if they were in tug of war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura glared over her meal. She finally had gotten Ino and now Naruto decided he had a spine and was going to deprive of her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like hell!'

His clones followed suit, each one just as determined as the original. Ino was not going to be Sakura's lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all dug their heels into the ground, not relenting, even as their muscles burned and their faces reddened with effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could have breathed fire at that very moment. She could feel it. Slowly but surely, she was losing her grip on Ino. This had never happened before and Sakura could safely say that she didn't like it. The feeling of prey, of food, being dragged back up her gullet was the worst sensation she'd ever had to experience, right up there with an empty stomach. The fact that this was being forced upon her by Naruto, of all people, just made it doubly worse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto didn't care for Sakura's growing anger and frustration. No, all his focus, all his care was on the drive to see his newest teammate free. In Naruto's mind, he saw every person who he ever seen eaten. Every person that maybe he could have helped, every person he'd left to be food to some overly gluttonous pig of a human being. But not this time. This time he refused to be some kind of coward. He would become Hokage and this was the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BELIEVE IT!!\" Naruto roared as his clone brigade all gave one mighty pull from their respective sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno came hurdling out of Sakura with all the speed of a wrecking ball right into the mass of clones that had been pulling on her. At the same time she crashed into Naruto, taking him with her to land on the ground with a loud thud.

The Jonin's red eyes bored into Sakura's with frightening intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think that I would tolerate you eating one of your teammates?\" Kurenai's voice was as sharp and cold as an icicle. \"That I, no, the village would accept that one their new genin passed only to be eaten by her <i>gluttonous, lazy, cowardly teammate who did absolutely nothing to contribute towards the test's goal</i>?!\" By the time she was finished, her voice had descended into a venomous hiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I...\" Sakura was having trouble even formulating a thought. Kurenai's killing intent was suffocating her. Sakura had never been on the receiving end of such treatment. She was used to being a big fish in a small pond, the predator to almost everyone else's prey. She was used to being the one doing the intimidating and to now be one subject to it? She just couldn't process it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai wasn't done, however. \"You show no camaraderie. You show no care for the others around you. You show no sense of duty towards your duty as ninja of this village. The only thing you care about is filling you own damn stomach and nothing else! I could understand eating your enemies but to you, there's no line that can't be crossed!

After what felt like hours alone in the dark pit that was Sakura's innards. Slowly moving forward on her one way trip towards her end. She looked around and realized she was not confined in a small, tight, and dark space filling with digestive juices, but was in fact still outside! Looking over just in time to see Kurenai Sensei finishing her speech to Sakura before pouncing on her and proceeding to stuff her head into her mouth. Now under normal circumstances Ino would have felt either pride knowing that this was how Sakura was going to meet her end, or possibly even a bit disappointed that it wasn't her being the one to finish off her long time rival. But at this point her thoughts were only focused on now glad she was that she wasn't inside of her before she received her punishment. And to think that this wouldn't even have been possible If It weren't for Naruto jumping in to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" She says as it finally hits her. Where was Naruto? She looked around but saw no signs of him. \"Naruto? N-Naruto???\" She asks now worried, scared that she may have been out of it for longer than she had realized and that Sakura had used that time to eat Naruto before Kurenai could get there. This thought caused her to begin to panic again. Not had she just barely avoided a fate worse than death to any predator, but now she'd have to live with the idea that the person who saved her life ended up getting eaten for just trying to rescue her! As she slowly started break down, she soon heard an all too familiar voice coming from underneath her! \"I-Ino......C-can't........breath!!!.......\" She heard the voice gasp. Quickly standing up and turning to look behind her she sees none other than Naruto laying in the spot where Ino had just been sitting. <i>\"Oh, whoops....\"</i> She thinks to herself blushing as she realized what must have happened. The force from Naruto pulling her out caused them both to go tumbling to the ground, causing him to land first and ultimately with her landing on top of him before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! Oh thank goodness you didn't get eaten! I'm so sorry about that, are you okay?!?\" She asks checking on him as she helps him sit up. \"*Gasp!* Y-yeah, I'll be fine, although I have to admit I definitely didn't imagine THAT being the way I'd go out. But you know what they say, \"No good deed goes without nearly being suffocated!\" He says not realizing how badly he had just botched that term. But the fact remained that he seemed alright, at this point Ino had seemed to reach her limit as tears could be seen streaming from her eyes as she sat down and began to cry. Naruto noticed this and became concerned, worried he may have said something the wrong way. \"H-hey Ino, why are you crying? Come on, there's no need to do that. See? Everything's okay noooooooo-OH GOD!!!\" He yells as Ino suddenly puts herself back on top of him. Grabbing him by the arms with her own. \"W-Wait,wait! I'm sorry! I take it back! PLEASE DON'T EAT ME I REALLY DON'T TASTE THAT GOOD AND-huh?\" He says realizing that Ino wasn't trying to eat him, but in fact was holding him in a hug as she leaned into his chest and began to cry even more. \"Thank you! Thank you so much!!! I was so scared back there, when I realized my head was already moving down her throat I thought I was done for! If it wasn't for you I would have been as good as dead! I can't ever thank you enough for saving me! I promise I'll never try to eat you ever again!!!\" She says practically sobbing at this point. To say this caught Naruto by complete surprise was an understatement. This was the first time he had ever seen Ino like this, so defenseless and vulnerable. Which honestly shouldn't be that much of a surprise considering what had just happened to her. But still, for her of all people to break down. After being known as one of the two top predators of the academy for so long to loose her cool. It really showed just how deep down they were a like, how we're all afraid of being eaten by someone bigger and stronger than them. And that in the end they were all just trying to find a way to live their lives in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about It.\" He says pulling her in to hug her. \"We're team mates remember? We're supposed to look out for and help each other in these kinds of situations. That's what being in a team is all about..........Oh, that's right!\" He says remembering something as he reached into his back pocket. Pulling it back out it was revealed that he was holding one of the bells needed to pass the test. \"With everything going to crap like it did back there I almost forgot about these.\" He says reaching over to take Ino's hand. Putting the bell into it before closing it so that it wouldn't fall out. \"There you go! One bell, just as promised! With this, our paths to becoming ninja are secured!!!\" He says with his usual big, dopey grin. Ino looked down at the bell now sitting in her hand, then back up to Naruto as he smiled, In response to this Ino's face turned a bright pink as she blushed heavily. This boy went out of his way to save her and help her fulfill her dreams all in a single day, and all she had ever done for him in return was try to eat him. The one weird kid in class who only ever talked about becoming the Hokage while at the same time running away screaming from any girl who even made eye contact with him. But now all of a sudden he was acting like an entirely different person, sure he still won't shut up about trying to become Hokage, but now he was actually showing the confidence to back up those words. There was just something about him now that actually made her believe in those words he kept saying. \"You really are one weird kid, you know that right?......\" She finally says which completely stunned Naruto. \"What? Hey come on! I was just trying to help!\" He says not getting why she was acting like that. \"Yeah I know, come here you little idiot.\" Was all she could says as she pulled him in close to kiss him on the cheek before pulling him in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow It was Naruto's turn to go bright red, both from the kiss, and the action of suddenly being pressed up against a girls body. Under normal circumstances Naruto would have been absolutely terrified of the idea of being this close to a girl, much letting her do all of this. But now? For some odd reason he was surprisingly okay with it. He had no idea why, but maybe just this once he wouldn't question it and just let this happy little moment stay happy. This moment lasted for a few minutes until It was promptly ended by someone speaking. \"Awww, isn't that cute?\" Came the voice of Kurenai, who had finally finished eating Sakura and was able to turn her attention to those two. Sure she put up a good fight for a while there. But in the end she was just a kid who wasn't even a fully fledged ninja fighting against a jonin. There was no way she was going to get out of this one. Of course that didn't stop her from putting up one hell of a fight inside of her now massive stomach. After hearing her words, both Naruto and Ino separated and stood straight up at attention. \"K-Kurenai Sensei! Th-Thank you for your help in all of this as well! If it weren't for you showing up when you did Sakura probably would have just gotten up and tried to eat us both again!\" She says with a bow. Blushing heavily as a result of being caught in that embarrassing moment. \"Uh-yeah! What she said!\" Naruto said with a nod as he thanked his teacher as well. At this Kurenai chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it. Odds are this was going to happen eventually given her rather chaotic tendencies. Let's just all be glad we were able to catch her and put a stop to her now before she could have caused any serious harm.\" She says patting her gut in an area that was bulging out, her own subtle way of telling Sakura to give it a rest. \"At any rate, I want to congratulate you both on a job well done, not only were you able to put aside your differences and work together, but you were even able to come up with a plan that worked and allowed you to complete your mission! Suffice to say you've both passed the test with flying colors and are both ready to become ninja as far as I'm concerned!\" She says with a smile as she watches their faces light up at hearing this. \"YES!!! You hear that Ino? We did it! We really managed to pull it off!!!\" He says jumping up and down in happiness. \"Hm, of course we did!\" She says in a manner of fact tone, her composure now completely restored to how it once was. \"Like I said before, with my brains and your brawn. The two of us make a surprisingly effective team!\" She says in a round about way of thanking him for his help, now to shy to say what she meant directly. At this Kurenai couldn't help but chuckle, \"Yes, well unfortunately we won't be able to do any official Ninja work at this point.\" She says getting her attention. \"As of now we are officially short a member and unable to perform to the full extent expected of a team. Not to mention that It's going to take me a few days to deal with our little drop out.\" She says, even though she knew of a jutsu that would accelerate the digestion proccess for situations like these, she wanted to let this one take it's course so that she could fully enjoy the fruits of her meal. \"So as of right now our team is going to be on a temporary leave of absence until a new member can be found to fill our missing spot. In the mean time I want you both to take this time and prepare yourselves for your first official mission whenever it may be.\" She says giving them their orders. \"Yes, Kurenai Sensei!\" They both respond. Knowing it would be unwise to disobey their teacher after seeing what she can do. \"Alright then, you're both dismissed, enjoy the rest of your day!\" She says before disappearing in a puff of smoke......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days went by surprisingly fast for Naruto. At first they started off like any other day for him, waking up first thing in the morning, making himself some ramen to have for breakfast, the same old routine that he normally had on his day's off. However that quickly changed as he had finished dressing himself in his usual orange clothes he heard a knock at the door. Wondering who It could be since he had already received his monthly allowance from the third Hokage's office and he hadn't remembered ordering anything. He opened the door and surprised to see none other than Ino standing there looking rather awkward. \"Uh, hi there Naruto....\" She says waving to him once he opened the door. A light shade of pink spread across her cheeks as she says this. \"Ino? What's up?\" He asks now worried, they weren't supposed to be meeting up for a few days since they had to wait for a new member to be assigned to the team. Was It possible that she had decided to go back to her old ways and eat him now that her rival was no longer in the picture to get in her way. After everything that had happened yesterday he thought things would probably be different now, especially since she promised that she'd never try to eat him. But still there was that voice in the back of his mind telling him to panic and jump out the window ASAP! It was this voice that usually helped Naruto avoid getting into trouble with girls up until now so he was always inclined to listen to it whenever he heard it. But this fear was quickly put to rest as Ino continued. \"Oh, well.........you know............ I just happened to be in the neighborhood, and I remembered that you lived here so I thought I'd stop by to say \"Hello!\" and...............\" She says rambling for a short while before realizing Naruto was giving her a look like she was acting weird and that he was going to run soon out of fear if she didn't get to the point. \"*sigh* Alright! Alright, I just.......... I just wanted to stop by and say thanks.\" She finally admitting what she came here for. \"I know I already said it back at the field yesterday....But It honestly just feels like It wasn't enough. So I wanted to come over and say it again and maybe...... maybe ask you if you wanted to spend the day together?\" She asks as her face turns bright red as she admits the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, this caught Naruto completely by surprise. To the point of him not actually being sure he heard her right the first time! \"What?!? Y-you mean, like-like a da-\" \"WHAT? NO YOU IDIOT!!!!!\" She yells turning a bright shade of crimson, quickly cutting him off before he could finish his question. \"What I MEAN is that now that we're team mates, we need to learn how to work together and how to get along. Sure we may have been able to defeat Kurenai-Sensei yesterday, but that was only because she was holding back on us at the time! If she were actually taking that test seriously like a real mission, she wouldn't have hesitated to put us all in one of her genjutsu traps and eat us all! We need to start learning about each others strengths and weaknesses so that we can learn to work together as a team more effectively!\" She explains. Naruto stood there listening while occasionally nodding every now and then. \"Oh, yeah I get it! When you put it that way It makes perfect sense!\" He says once she had finished her explanation. \"Good! Glad we're on the same page then!\" She says, mentally relieved that he believed her reasoning. While what she said was true and she really DID want to get to know him better so that they could function as a team more effectively, that wasn't the ONLY reason she wanted to spend time with Naruto. Not that she'd ever admit that to anyone else, and if they did figure that out she'd certainly make sure they wouldn't live long enough to tell anyone else about it, ESPECIALLY Naruto. \"So what do you say? You coming or not?\" She asks trying to quickly move on before he put any more thought into the conversation. \"Oh, uh yeah sure! Just let me take care of a few things here and I'll be right out!\" He says agreeing. \"Alright then. In that case you better get moving or else I'm leaving you behind.\" She says with a serious look, while on the inside she was cheering and screaming happily that he agreed to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went, for the next few days Naruto and Ino would meet up early in the morning and spend most of the day together. Whether that be working at Ino's parents flower shop where Ino would tell Naruto about herself, stopping for lunch at Ichiraku's Ramen Shop for lunch where Naruto would tell Ino about himself. While at the same time having to deal with the shop owner smiling and calling them a cute couple. At which both got embarrassed and explained that they were just team mates, although It didn't necessarily bother Ino that he had said that as much as she thought it would. and even just walking around and enjoying there time together. There was even a point when they were going to the movies, where right before they were able to buy the tickets and get their snacks Naruto ended up being harassed by a few of the patrons who happened to \"dislike\" him. This of course was nothing new to Naruto, he was used to dealing with the occasional situations where people would try and force him to leave before he caused any trouble. Only this time the situation didn't last very long as Ino soon stepped in. \"HEY! Just what the hell do you assholes think you're doing?!? That's my friend you're messing with!\" She asks getting up in their faces. Not even realizing she used the word \"friend\" instead of \"team mate\" which she had been making a constant effort to use up until this point. \"We have just as much of a right to be here as anyone else! So If you don't like it, then to bad! You can either leave us alone or get the hell out of here if it's such a problem for you! Or if not, I'm sure we could work something else out, I am going to need something to eat before the movie starts!\" She says as her stomach lets out a low growl which drives the point home as the people quickly took off out of fear of being eaten. Ino then smiles as she watches the two run off, her work now done, she turns back to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that that's been taken care of, lets go get our snacks before the movie starts.\" She says as Naruto stares at her in disbelief. \"Oh, um, right.\" He says as he follows after her. \"Hey uh, you know you didn't have to do that back there right? I'm actually pretty used to that kind of treatment, they'll just go away if you ignore them for long enough.\" He says surprised she stuck up for him like that. \"What? and just let them think it's okay to push you around like that? No way! You've gotta stand up for yourself more Naruto! Like what you did back with Sakura, otherwise people will never get it through their heads that they can't just do this kind of stuff to you!\" She explains. \"Besides, standing up and defending your friends is never wrong in my book!\" She says proudly as she realizing she had used the word friends again, only at this point she decided that it was fine at this point since that's what they were now. This affected Naruto in a profound way, he could only stand there watching her as she ordered her food. \"Friends......\" He says to himself as the reality of the situation sank in. \"Hey Ino,\" He says getting her attention. \"Thanks, for everything.\" He says with a smile. \"Hm, like I said, that's what friends are for!\" She says as she hides the fact that she was turning bright pink from the comment. \"Anyway, lets get in there before the movie starts!\" She says grabbing Naruto's hand and pulling him into the theater. Things continued like this for the next few days until they were called by Kurenai, who told them both to meet her at the Hokage's office where they would meet up with their new team mate before being assigned to their first mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day in one of the meeting offices, both Naruto and Ino were sitting in chairs waiting for Kurenai to show up with the new team member so they could get their mission. \"Maaan, what's taking Kurenai-Sensei so long?\" Naruto asks having already gotten bored and tired of waiting. \"She's probably still filling out the last of the paperwork for our new team mate, whoever that is. Just be patient Naruto.\" She says a little annoyed that they don't know who their new team member is. Kurenai refusing to tell them over the phone so it'd be a surprise. After another few minutes Kurenai finally came into the room. \"Hello you two, sorry that took so long, I've been buried up to my neck in paperwork over the last few days.\" She says as she remembers the events of what had happened. After a retelling of the events that took place at the training field and confirmation that it was true. Kurenai's actions were deemed a \"necessary response to a potential future threat to village security\". As such no punishment was dealt out for devouring Sakura, who by now was nothing more than a layer of fat on Kurenai's body, and quite the noticeable layer as well. While Kurenai was by no means a small woman before. The sudden addition from eating a voracious predator like Sakura pushed her weight above and beyond what most would consider \"normal\" for a Kunoichi. So once the paper work for that was filled out, all that was left was to find a new ninja to replace her. Which was actually easier than she expected, It turns out that one of the other teams ended up losing two of their members before they could even start, the reasoning behind this was vague, but the fact remained that it left the last member without a team. So it was a simple matter of filling out the paperwork and soon after that Team 7 was back up to four people. \"Now then,\" Kurenai started. \"Allow me to introduce the newest member of team seven.\" She says as she opens the door, both Naruto and Ino gasped as they immediately knew who it was....</span></div></div>",

She could feel 3 of naruto's clones grabbing her waist and arms, while the real naruto ran between Ino's legs to get a hold of her thighs while two other clones held her legs before they all started to pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! She had her one true rival in her mouth and was halfway done from sending her into the one place she deserved to be at. In Sakura's large belly! But now her progress was halted by the only male of her team who used to run away just by the sound of her growling stomach. 'I won't let you stop me you baka! I earned this meal!\" She mentally shouted as she forced her throat muscles to swallow again. She kept this up for a minute before feeling Ino start to slowly get pulled into her again. 'I will get Ino into my stomach and you won't stop it!' With those words in mind, Sakura tried to increase her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kept pulling with all his strength, he could see that his clones were struggling but at least they stopped Ino's progress into Sakura's stomach. They knew that if they kept this up they would free her. \"I swear Ino! I will get you out!\" Naruto shouted as he shut his eyes, trying to pull her out with all his strength, his clones shouting in agreement. They were unaware of the slight pull from Sakura's throat muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno would only whimper as she stared into the abyss of Sakura's stomach. The smell of her breakfast and snacks mixed with the digestive juices to create a putrid smell. She knew that if it wasn't for Naruto, she would have been fully eaten and prayed that he would be able to pull her out. If he could then she would swear to never attempt to eat him and protect him from being another woman's meal. <br>\r\nP..p...please Naruto. H.. help me.\" She quietly said as her tears fell into the digestive mixture.</span></div></div>",

He mentally screamed as he tried to pull harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee the slight progress she was making, caused Sakura smirk lightly before her stomach released a loud growl, demanding for a meal. The sound alone caused all the Naruto's to freeze slightly and allowed Sakura to tug her arms free before throwing them back into the chests of the clones and causing them to 'pop' from existence. This brought the real Naruto and his clone out of their frozen fear before they all started to pull once more, but it was all for not as Sakura used her freed arms to grip Ino's waist and pulled her deeper into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled as she felt Ino's ass enter her mouth slowly before they shined in enjoyment as she could now see a scared Naruto between Ino's thighs. She gave a wink to him as she used her hands to push Ino's thighs together and trapping Naruto between them. She mentally smirked in enjoyment to know that this Naruto didn't 'pop', meaning that this was the real one. 'Hehe two for one. I guess it is worth the fight.' She pushed Naruto's head into Ino's ass, which caused her prey to squeak in surprise before feeling her struggling again. The Naruto that held her waist, quickly released it in favor of trying to free the real Naruto while the other clones tried to pull Ino's legs open but the embarrassed and scared Ino kept her legs tightly squeezed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing a slight moan, Sakura kept Naruto's face in Ino's ass as she felt his head enter her mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To Naruto's horror he find no sign of his team mate and possible new friend Ino. Instead sitting where she once was was Sakura, who was now licking her lips and holding her now swollen stomach. It had already been large before, in fact it wasn't much of a stretch to say that Sakura was one of the heaviest girls in the academy, rivaled only by Ino who was in constant competition with her, but now it was absolutely huge! Her gut was now fully exposed as it had forcibly pushed her shirt up and out of the way to make room for it as it sat in her lap, covering most of her thighs and even reaching past her knees! \"*BUUUURP!* Oh hey Naruto, I was wondering when you were going to show up.\" She says now noticing him. \"For a minute there I worried you might have gotten here before I was able to finish taking care of Ino, but It looks like I was worried about nothing.\" She says giving her stomach a few playful pats. Signalling that Ino was indeed already deep within Sakura's gullet. In response to this her gut began to shift and move in short erratic bursts. Bulging out in a few places as Ino tried desperately to punch and kick at the walls of her new prison. Some muffled screams could be heard from inside as Ino called out. Most likely cursing Sakura or begging someone to help her. \"Oi, I said knock it off in there Ino-pig!\" She says giving her stomach a slap, causing it to jiggle and vibrate from the sudden force applied to it. \"You've already lost this fight, so just accept your defeat and take comfort and pride in the fact that you're going to be going to contribute to making me bigger, stronger, and even more beautiful that I already am!\" She says with a smirk at the thought of how large she was going to be when she was finished digesting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto was left speechless, suffice to say he was horrified by what he was seeing. Sure It was one thing to watch someone like Sakura swallow a boy whole was nothing new. In fact he wouldn't have even blinked if Sakura had said she had eaten two or three people in one sitting. But this was Ino they were talking about. A girl who was able to keep up with Sakura in terms of eating and size on a daily basis, and the very idea of Sakura being able to just grab her and swallow her whole in less than a few minutes was just terrifying. True Ino may have been unconscious during the initial stages of being eaten giving Sakura a head start. But still the fact that she was able to finish doing something like this so quickly spoke volumes on just how gluttonous she truly was, and the worst part about all of this, was that the look in her eye told him that she wasn't even done yet. In a feat of Herculean strength, Sakura manages to pick herself up off the ground with little effort and return to standing on her feet. Her stomach now jutting out a good four to five feet in front of her, as she slowly turned and began to walk towards Naruto. \"Wh-wha-what a-are you-u d-doing?\" He asks in absolute fear of her. Normally he'd have no problem running from the girl if she wanted to eat him. And this was without the extra two too three hundred extra pounds of person in her stomach. But just the sight of Sakura having finally eaten her long time rival and showing no signs of slowing down, now had Naruto frozen in place in shear panic. \"What am I doing? Well I figured that'd be obvious!\" She says with a grin as she makes her way over to him. \"I may have finally beaten Ino once and for all, but I still need to get one of those bells If I want to become a real ninja! And from what I heard, It sounds like you managed to get not just one, but BOTH of those bells off of Kurenai-Sensei while I was having my meal. So It's pretty obvious what I need to do now.\" She says licking her lips again. A sight that would have sent Naruto running as fast as possible during any other time, but not this time, this time Naruto could only stand there, his legs refusing to move out of shear terror. \"But then again, maybe not.\" She says putting hand to the side of her face. \"For once Naruto, you've caught me at a good time. Not ONLY am I in the best mood I've ever been in. But for once, I think I might actually be a little TOO full to try and eat you.\" She says patting her stomach for emphasis. \"Not to mention that I technically only need ONE of those bells in order to pass, just like you, and since Ino Is no longer in the picture, that means you have an extra bell that you don't need!\" She says with a smile, although this smile seemed less than a friendly smile coming from her. \"So tell you what Naruto, how about you just give me that extra bell you have and I'll pretend you weren't trying to work with a certain someone to try and screw me out of my future, and we'll call it even. Who knows? Maybe you and I might actually start to get along and work together once we become ninja together?\" She says as she holds out one of her hands at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach practically pressing up against Naruto, the feeling of the trapped person inside curled up into a ball in the tight confines were not lost to him. It was almost as if Sakura were trying to say that if he didn't do what she was asking that this would be his fate. At first Naruto stood there in a panic, to afraid to even breath, much less think about what to do next. For once he truly thought this would be the end for him, Sakura had him right where she wanted and there was no way he'd be able to worm his way out this time.. The only comforting thought in all of this being that at least this one time, Sakura was willing to let him go as long as he handed over one of the bells. Despite the fact that this would probably be the only and possibly LAST time he'd get away from her. Since once he gave her that bell, that would mean that she not only would become a ninja, but that he'd also have to work with her from now on. Meaning he'd have to deal with constantly being afraid of her deciding to use him as a mid-mission snack in the near future, just because she could. Hell, there wasn't even any guarantee that she wouldn't just go back on her word and eat him once he handed her the bell. But still, as things were right then and there, Naruto saw little choice but to hand over the bell and get out of there, hopefully Kurenai-Sensei hand finally snapped out of her disorientation and be able to help him, and if not then he'd simply run back home as fast as he could and hopefully forget about this disastrous day. He slowly began to reach into his pocket for one of the bells, when something caught his attention. It was a muffled sound coming from Sakura's stomach. At first he thought It might have just been her digestive tract getting to work on her meal, but in reality it turned out to be Ino who was.......crying? Sure at first she tried her hardest to fight against the walls of her prison in an attempt to escape. But once she realized that wasn't going to work she began to shut down. She realized that she soon was going to end up suffering the same fate as so many others before her. Becoming nothing more than a layer of fat on Sakura's body. The Irony was not lost on her as she realized she had done the same thing to many others just as well as Sakura, but the fact remained that this still wasn't how she wanted things to end up, for the first time in her life she was afraid she was going to die. So she began to cry, begging for help from someone, anyone who could help her escape. Sure many would have seen this as poetic justice for someone like her. But she still didn't want it to end like this! And Naruto couldn't help but relate to this feeling. He knew exactly what she must have been going through in that moment, the panic, the fear. He was all too familiar with this sensation. But now it was coming from someone else, someone who actually tried to help Naruto when he needed it. Ino was only in this position because she decided to help him and team up, which he had agreed to. She had put herself on the line so that they could actually pass...like a team. She'd put the team and the mission ahead of trying to get a free meal. So, if a bottomless pit of a predator like Ino could put aside her personal wants, shouldn't he be able to? He wanted to be Hokage! Wouldn't a Hokage conqueror their fears and face whatever they had? Wouldn't a Hokage risk their life to save a comrade?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for? Hand it over already!\" She says growing impatient with him. At this point Naruto was at a cross roads, he could either continue being the coward he has always been in order to live another day. Knowing full well that he let someone else die just so that he could escape. Or he could stand up to Sakura, stand up to the one person who had made his life a living hell for the last several years and finally say that he was done getting pushed around and letting other people get eaten just so that others can get whatever they want! Because that's what It meant to be a ninja to him. But would he live up to that ninja way? It was at this point that he made his decision as he....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of silence, Naruto began to slowly reach back behind himself. Sakura stood there waiting impatiently for him to hand her the bell, but was caught off guard as he slowly pulled out something from the pouch he kept on his hip. Not a bell, but a kunai. This had her confused and surprised as she wasn't expecting him to actually pull a weapon out on her. Nor did she expect him to suddenly raise it up and bring it down, stabbing himself in the leg, the wound was shallow, but it was deep enough to draw blood, which shocked both her and Naruto as well but for obviously different reasons. At this point Naruto jumped back to gain some distance between himself and Sakura. \"Heh, alright, looks like that trick worked! The pain snapped me out of that panic I was in and got my legs working again!\" He says with a grin as he tried to ignore the self inflicted wound. \"Ooookay, so what was that supposed to be about?\" Sakura asks wondering what this idiot was trying to accomplish by stabbing himself in the leg. She wasn't sure if she should be amused or annoyed at what Naruto was doing at this point. \"What that was, was my decision to stop letting fear rule over every part of my life.\" He says as he raises his free hand to point at her. \"I'm done letting people like you scare me and threaten me into doing what you want with the threat of eating me! On this wound, I make a solemn vow! A vow to never let someone like you or anyone else determine who I am or who I'm going to be! My name, Is Naruto Uzumaki, and I'm going to be the greatest Hokage! And you can forget about getting one of these bells as long as I have anything to say about it! Now spit Ino back up right now before I force her out of you!!!\" He says with a look of serious determination in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood there looking at him in dumbstruck silence. After a few minutes of silence Sakura finally responds. \"...........*Pffffft!* Hahahahahahaha!!! Ho man! That's a good one Naruto! You actually had me going there for a minute!!! I had no idea you had a sense of humor! But wouldn't you know, you actually have some pretty good material!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\" She laughs, having taken what Naruto said as a joke. At this point, something inside of Naruto snaps as he raises his right hand and actually throws the Kunai which he had stabbed himself with at Sakura, It just barely missed hitting her as it flies straight forward and plants itself into a near by tree. Whether or not this was intentional Sakura had no idea, but It was enough to get her to stop laughing and look back at Naruto. \"I'm not joking here damn it! I said what I meant and I meant what I said, and I never go back on my word! BELIEVE IT!!!\" He says showing her he was serious this time. After hearing this the look on Sakura's face changed once again, this time to a look of anger. \"*Tch* So now you finally decide to go and grow a spine and stick up for yourself?\" She asks. \"And not just that, but you're seriously trying to help HER?\" She asks slapping her stomach again to show she was speaking about Ino. \"So what? You've gone and decided to become a white knight for her because she was nice to you one time? You do realize she has tried to eat you almost as many times as I have right? Hell she was probably only nice to you just to get you to help her get the bells!\" She yells. \"That's not the point here!\" Naruto responds. \"It doesn't matter who you are or what you've done in the past. I'm done letting other people get eaten for no reason other than just because someone else thought they'd make a good snack, or even if it's to further your own ambitions! There are plenty of other ways to get what you want in life, ways that don't involve shoving people who may annoy you into your mouth to get rid of them! Ino saw that herself earlier and put herself out on the line in order to do just that! She put herself at risk just to help me achieve both my dream, and hers! And I'm not gonna just let that trust she put in me down because I might be afraid! Now either you spit her up right this instant! Or else I'll just have to reach in there myself and pull her out if I have to!!!............................Uh, actually, never mind, that would be a terrible idea......... But you get what I mean!!!\" He says correcting himself after realizing what he had just said. At this point Sakura just sighs out of reflex, she was used to dealing with Naruto's stupidity on a regular basis, but this? This has just crossed over into new territory. And this was something that Sakura just couldn't let slide. \"Alright, fine. You want me to let your \"friend\" go so badly? Then come and make me!!!\" She says as she cracks her knuckles, showing that she was ready to fight. \"Way ahead of you! SHADOW CLONE JUTSU!!!\" He says as he forms the hand sign for the shadow clone jutsu, several clones of Naruto appear around him before they all begin their assault on Sakura........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stumbled slightly as he tried to recover from bumping into something or in this case someone. He spotted the person he had bump into just as they spoke. \u201cNaruto\u2026\u201d said the other the tone holding a low somewhat threatening growl-like quality to it. \u201cS-Sakura! Hey, sorry about that. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Naruto hoped that she would simply except the apology and be done with it as he really didn\u2019t feel like running for his life right now. Haruno Sakura however simply gave an annoyed huff before calling him a baka (idiot). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I haven\u2019t been punched yet. That\u2019s a good sign, right?\u2019</i> thought the blond. Any who took the moment to really look at him would notice that Naruto was very nervous with Sakura so close. It wasn\u2019t because of the small crush he had on her but, because he had seen what she could do to someone that pissed her off enough. He really did not want to get that close to his pink haired crush. Naruto gave a small shudder as his mind went back to that incident. No more than the age of 10 and he was already scared for life. Naruto silently reaffirmed his promise to himself that he would avoid having such an intimate meeting with Sakura\u2019s digestive track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked as he realized Sakura had said something to him and he hadn\u2019t even heard it. \u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d Sakura sighed and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou really are a baka, you can\u2019t even listen right. What I said was, \u2018Why were you on your way to the academy? You failed remember? Unless you\u2019re coming to give yourself up and become fat on my belly.\u2019\u201d Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, think that Sakura was hoping he would agree to the last part. The look of hunger in her eyes wasn\u2019t helping Naruto to feel any more at ease with her. \u201cN-No. I did pass but, there were complications that kept me from getting my passing grade at the time of the test.\u201d Naruto felt like patting himself on the back for the quick excuse. Idly he looked down towards her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunoichi who used the justu tended to be rather lucky as digesting someone rarely left much of any fat on their bodies.  He had once asked Iruka about it and he had said some things that Naruto really hadn\u2019t understood. In the end though, he had figured out that kunoichi who used the justu had a faster metabolism or something. Basically, girls could eat people and be left with only a little bit of fat from each person. The amount was so small that most girls worked it off with only an hour or two of training. The very idea of ending up as nothing but, a small layer of fat and pile of poop, one that would be quickly flushed down the toilet after working so hard in life scared Naruto to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the only girl in class that didn\u2019t show signs of wanting to eat him was that weird shy girl, Hinata he believed the name was. Despite that, even she made him a bit nervous to be around as he had seen last year just how gluttonous the shy girl could be. <i>\u2018Seriously, how can someone pack away a small family of four into their stomach and still be so shy?\u2019</i> he wondered. He could understand that she got rather hungry, as she was one of the harder working girls in their class but, still that was a lot of live meat to swallow down, much less digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present he noticed how Sakura was still looking at him like he was a piece of tasty meat. \u201cYou're not actually hungry yet, right? I mean it\u2019s not even lunch time.\u201d He asked while slowly inching in the direction of the academy. Iruka was still their superior, so if he ordered Sakura to not eat him then she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to eat him. Once they were placed on teams, it would be up to the Jounin-sensei to keep the kunoichi in line and prevent them from eating their team. Those of equal rank however, had no say in it. If you didn\u2019t want to be eaten by a kunoichi then you simply couldn\u2019t let them eat you. Once you were eaten, your future was decided by the mercy of the one who ate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped as he got ready to run for his life only to go wide eyed and pale when he heard Sakura\u2019s stomach growl loudly in hunger. He watched has she licked her lips before speaking, \u201cYou know, I actually missed breakfast. Maybe I should fix that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Sakura had more to say, Naruto didn\u2019t hear it as he had already started running towards the academy at top speed. Chancing a look back however showed him that Sakura wasn\u2019t too far behind him and if his eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks on him, he would swear that she was drooling. Likely in anticipation of the meal he\u2019d make.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How?\u201d the blond boy asked with genuine curiosity. Naruto watched as Hinata seemed to fidget for a moment before taking a deep breath to steel her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do you trust me, Naruto?\u201d she asked. Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, feel she was fearful of his answer. Naruto coked his head to the side in confusion but, answered as truthfully as he could. \u201cI trust you far more than any other kunoichi in this village. You\u2019ve never been mean to me and have never tried to eat me so I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed, it wasn\u2019t quite what she had been silently hoping to hear but, it was certainty better than she had feared. \u201cI-If this i-is to work I\u2019ll n-need you to tr-rust me. P-Please close your eyes.\u201d Naruto gave her a wary look but, he did say that he would trust her so in the end he did as she asked and closed his eyes. Hinata then surprised him by moving his headband down from his forehead to cover his eyes. \u201cN-no p-peeking!\u201d Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, find the playful tone in her voice cute. \u201cPlease r-remember that I-I\u2019m only trying t-to help you Naruto.\u201d He gave a small node to show that he understood. He was soon blushing lightly when he felt her step extra close and wrap her arms around him. He stiffened for a moment before forcing himself to relax in her embrace. The fact that he was trying to get away from Sakura barely remembered. It was quite nice. Hinata\u2019s embrace was warm and gentle but, still held a strength to it that would prevent him from moving away easily. <i>\u2018Some sort of teleporting justu maybe?\u2019</i> the blond wondered. He didn\u2019t have long to wait as Hinata finished what she had to say to him. \u201cA-and try not to s-struggle to hard on the w-way down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wording made him nervous and he opened his mouth to ask her what she meant by that but, was cut off by the feeling of having his head submerged into a hot and moist environment. Naruto shuddered as he felt something wet and slick trace his face and tried to move away. Only to find that he couldn\u2019t. Naruto cringed as a loud sound echoed all around his head; it sounded a lot like someone moaning. A thought came to mind only for him to push it away, not willing to believe that Hinata would take advantage of his trust just to eat him herself. Only now did he notice something soft clamped around his neck, just under the base of his chin. He felt it move further down his neck and the wet slick thing really started to lather him in some wet slime stuff. Despite his rising fear of what Hinata was doing to him, Naruto reminded himself that he had said that he trusted her and so forced himself to not panic and tried to relax.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata had a very different view of what was happening. The moment she finished asking him to not struggle too hard she had opened her mouth and worked her jaws apart, before gently sliding her lips over Naruto\u2019s head. The moment her tongue touched his skin she was assaulted by a wonderful assortment of flavors that left her all warm and tingly inside. She was unable to stop herself from moaning as Naruto\u2019s flavor coated her tongue and sent her taste buds into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata worked her lips down Naruto\u2019s neck before feeling his head enter her gullet. Smiling as best as she could around him at how good Naruto was being as she consumed him, Hinata gave her first swallow, bringing her lips down to his shoulders. Now she could taste his clothes and though they tasted poor in comparison to his skin, they still managed to hold enough of his flavor to keep her from gagging in distaste. The swallow however, was the straw that broke the camels back as Naruto started to instinctively struggle against her, trying not to enter her body any further. With her arms wrapped around him in the way they were, they kept him from bringing his arms up high enough to push her away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his arms and already neck deep inside the shy heiress, Naruto stood little to no hope of getting free. This was only proven further as Hinata gave a hard gulp, bringing his shoulders into her now widely stretched mouth. This caused two things to happen, first was the humongous bulge that had grown in her throat from Naruto\u2019s head entering it, was now starting to disappear under her jacket as his head would soon enter her chest cavity. The second thing was much more embarrassing for Hinata as his hands were still pressed against her, trying to push her away. With Naruto now further inside her, his body was being pulled upwards towards her mouth. So, finding Naruto\u2019s hands suddenly pushing against her breast was both partly unexpected and highly embarrassing. Especially so, when Naruto suddenly stopped struggling and gave her breast a few curious squeezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs pleased as Hinata felt at knowing that Naruto was touching her in such an intimate way, she knew she needed to finish packing him away into her stomach and get to the Academy lecture hall. So with another hard gulp she easily slid her lips down his body, claiming most of his chest. She made it a point to taste as much of him as she could while letting his jacket, and in turn chest, soak in her saliva to make him easier to swallow. A small gulp brought enough of Naruto into herself that she didn\u2019t need to keep holding his arms down, this left her lips encircling his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her new found leverage, Hinata straitened herself out a bit, raising Naruto\u2019s feet off the ground by a few inches. She could feel Naruto\u2019s head press against the sphincter and cooed to herself in pleasure. If she had known swallowing Naruto would feel this wonderful she would have attempted it the day they first met. She gave another small swallow, bringing him in a few more inches and ushering him headfirst into her stomach; something that she couldn\u2019t help but, feel exultant at. Especially at the feeling of her belly stretching outward as more of Naruto was slowly pulled in. The feeling of Naruto filling her empty belly shattered any inhibitions she had at this idea and a rather naughty idea crossed her mind. Reaching out she grabbed Naruto\u2019s rump and gave it a squeeze. She smiled slightly at how firm his behind was and used it to help lift Naruto up so he was falling into her at a slightly incline. Using her grip on his butt she pushed him in just as she swallowed, allowing her to take in so much of him that she had to pull her hands out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just his swinging legs left, Hinata tilted her head back and allowed them to slowly slide into her mouth. Her belly had already reached the size that she looked about eight months pregnant, and she hadn\u2019t even gotten most of him inside her stomach yet. As she gobbled up his legs she could feel Naruto\u2019s shoulders and chest slide into her stomach. Hinata hummed in pleasure as her stomach widened more and more as her beloved was emptied into it. Encouraged by the feeling she soon felt his arms and stomach enter her belly as she slurped down his calves and shins till only his twitching feet remained outside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to taste his sandals, Hinata quickly removed them and held them at her side. He would need them if she let him back out. <i>\u2018If?\u2019</i> she thought to herself. Why would she say \u2018if\u2019? She had every intention of spiting him back up as she felt Naruto didn\u2019t deserve to be digested by anyone. Though if she was honest with herself, she would admit that she believed that if anyone \u2018should\u2019 get to digest Naruto, that that someone should be her. Hinata blinked at the thought before blushing at the idea of really digesting Naruto and making him a part of herself. The idea still bothered her but, oddly not as much as she would have thought. Mentally shaking her head, Hinata decided that she had put off finishing Naruto for long enough. <i>\u2018Now my belly, here he comes!\u2019</i> she thought as she tilted her head back, letting the bare feet completely vanish into her mouth. With her mouth closing the moment his toes passed her lips, she tilted her head back again and accompanied it with an audible gulp, the bulge that was the last of Naruto vanishing behind her coat covered chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed explosively as Naruto was fully loaded into her stomach, which moved and swayed faintly as the tightly packed boy tried to wriggle against the cramped and slimy confines she had firmly placed him inside of. She could even feel a faint gurgling as preliminary digestion kicked in; something that she put a quick end to by applying the protective portion of the justu to keep her ingested beloved safe. Hinata knew that she was never very good at the protective part of the justu but, she could hopefully keep it up long enough to get Naruto to the relative safety of class. She figured that she had somewhere around half an hour before her powerful stomach ate through the protective chakra and started digesting Naruto. She just hoped that her stomach didn\u2019t eat through his protection any quicker then that or all of this would be for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well not exactly nothing.\u2019</i> Hinata thought gleefully as she gave a loud burp and licked her lips. She felt Naruto wiggle around as he tried to get into a more comfortable position; this however only caused Hinata to give another belch. \u201cBbbuuuuuurrrrrrppppp!\u201d  She muttered a week \u2018excuse me\u2019 before letting her hands gently caress her now dome-shaped midsection. \u201cS-see that wasn\u2019t so -\u201curp\u201d-bad. Right, Naruto?\u201d She had hoped that it would help calm him down but, the squirming only seemed to increase causing her stomach to swing slightly to the sides, while this happened Hinata could also hear muffled noises coming from her heavily loaded gut. Likely, Naruto, pleading her to let him out or crying for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling someone\u2019s gaze upon her, Hinata decided to put up a show, as she didn\u2019t want others to know that she was trying to help Naruto rather then make a meal of him. \u201cN-now now Naruto, no u-use in st-truggling. You\u2019re mine now!\u201d Hinata stated in her best acting voice before giving a small belch. She then turned to her observer and hoped that they didn\u2019t intend to keep her away from getting to class soon, as she wanted to make sure Naruto stayed safe while inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does she see?</span></div></div>",

The truth was Hinata was not yet used to carrying the person she ate any farther than ten feet.  She knew that it was her responsibility as a practitioner of this jutsu to be able to use it effectively, but had not had the time to do so.  Most of her spare time was taken by practice with her father.

He had trusted her and she swallowed him but, she also let him back out once she got to the academy's front door. Feeling himself sliding down her throat and curling up inside her stomach had been the most terrifying thing he had ever experienced. The fact that he told her that he'd trust her only moments before, made it that much worse for him. But, she didn't hurt him. Made him feel a bit motion sick, yes but, not hurt him. This left him feeling a bit conflicted as he was a bit fearful of visiting her stomach again, but she did it to give him some safety from the other hungry kunoichi. As they entered the classroom, he decided that he would continue to trust her. After all, if she had wanted to hurt him, even digest him, he wouldn't have been able to stop her. She only ate him to try and help him. Nodding to himself he idly wondered if she would need to swallow him and lug him around again. For some reason, he found the thought of her doing so didn't bother him nearly as much as before.<br>\r\n<b>----------------</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt relieved when she entered the classroom and found Iruka-sensei hadn't arrived yet. That meant they were still on time.  She gave a sigh of relief before she walked to a seat in the back. A small part of her hoped that Naruto would take the empty seat next to her but, she doubted he would want to sit next to the person that had just crammed him into her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a small dejected sigh at the thought as she sat down. The thought of Naruto possible avoiding her now made her feel so miserable that she wouldn't be surprised if dark rain clouds started following her. As such, it is understandable how she 'epp'ed loudly and jumped when a male voice spoke to her from the previously empty seat next to her. Even more so, when the voice sounded much like Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata are you alright?\" Asked the blond boy. \"Y-yes Naru-uto. I'm f-fine.\" Stuttered the shy girl as she got her racing heart under control. She couldn't believe that Naruto was willingly sitting next to her, she would've squealed in delight if she wasn't so shy. \"So Hinata,\" the boy began, breaking her from her thoughts, \"do you think we will get too be on the same team?\" Hinata couldn't believe her ears. Naruto was asking for her opinion and from the sound of his voice, he seemed to be hoping she would be his teammate. \"I-I hope so. I'd l-like t-to be on your t-team Nar-ruto.\" She really did hope so and the smile he gave her in response made her want to melt into a puddle of goo as her heart fluttered. It wasn't one of Naruto's wide grins but, a softer smile. It left his wonderful blue eyes open, letting her see how they shined in glee while holding a soft feel in his gaze; a silent sort of thanks that was for her and her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there for the next few minutes, simply looking into the others eyes and feeling a connection form between them. It was a sense of trust the two felt towards the other, solidifying a feeling of unity that if given a chance could evolve into something so much more. The moment ended however, when the door opened and in walked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two turned just in time to see someone they had been hoping to avoid, Sakura. \"There you are!\" Screeched the pink harlot as she pointed at Naruto in obvious rage. \"Baka's like you don't belong here, they belong in my Belly! Now. Get. Inside. My. <b>STOMACH!!!</b>\" Yells the furious and hungry pinkett just before she jumps at Naruto with her mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<b>---------------</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't believe what just happened. While he just sat there in terror Hinata had jumped to his defense and moved so she was in between him and the gaping mouth of the hungry Haruno. Her brave stand didn't last for long though as Sakura's mouth enveloped Hinata's head and shoulders in one motion. Naruto half-sat/half-stood there, stunned beyond belief as he watched Sakura shrug in indifference at who she caught before giving a hard swallow. Naruto watched in morbid fascination as a bulge, signifying Hinata's head appeared in Sakura's throat. He could hear the muffled sounds of Hinata screaming for help as she tried to struggle free. Sakura however, weathered the frantic movements of her meal with ease while letting her saliva drench the girl\u2019s heavy jacket. Another gulp pulled Hinata in just past her breast, locking the poor girls' arms in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her new found leverage, Sakura straitened herself out a bit, raising Hinata's feet off the ground by a few inches. As Sakura did this, Naruto saw Hinata's head bulge slip in under Sakura's collarbone and into the pinkett's chest. Naruto realized that he had to do something or else Hinata would be nothing more than a squirming bugle in Sakura's body before she was digested. He could not allow that. He stood quickly and turned fully towards Sakura.  \"Let her go Sakura.\" Demanded the blond giving her his best warning look. Sakura stopped consuming Hinata for a moment and gave Naruto an odd look. He saw her face muscles twitch and wondered if she was laughing at him or something. Either way, her next action gave him his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grabbed Hinata's rump and gave a hard swallow as she pulled Hinata further into her body. Her lips stopping about mid-stomach while lifting Hinata's lower half further up so she was kicking at empty air. Naruto saw the bulge fully move to Sakura's stomach, making it start to bulge outward as Hinata started filling the pinkett's stomach. Naruto did not take this action well and quickly approached Sakura. An anger that had been suppressed for so long finally forced its way up, all of it directed towards this girl who was consuming the closest thing he had to a female friend without so much as batting an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said... <b>LET. HER. GO!</b>\" The now furious blond demanded just before slamming a fist into Sakura's gut. The punch came from an angle, causing it to move upwards as Naruto drove it home. Not only did it knock the wind out of Sakura, it also forced some of Hinata back up causing her consumer to gag violently on her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto backed up a bit. The shock of what he had just done hitting home. He watched as Sakura's body violently expelled Hinata before collapsing on the ground and curling up on herself as she coughed and hacked, trying to get air back into her lungs and her stomach acid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata however, had been thrown down hard onto her lower back but, she didn't really seem to notice. No, she was too busy trying to scoot away from Sakura as quickly as she could without falling fully to the sense of panic she felt. Naruto quickly moved to the trembling girl and didn't fight as she immediately latched on to him and quietly cried into his jacket. Boys were given classes to help them deal with the very real possibility of being eaten but, girls were not.</span></div></div>",

One look was all he needed to know that something big had just happened and that he needed to get it sorted out before they continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit but, Iruka had managed to get the class to settle down and quickly questioned some of the students to learn what happened. Now he was at an impasse. Naruto was originally slated for Team 7 but, with the knowledge that Sakura was so determined to make a meal of him and their sensei's habit of being hours late, Iruka knew that putting Naruto on that team was tantamount to a death sentence. So using his authority as teacher of the class, Iruka could overrule the team selections once and change them has he felt was needed. This just left one problem; who to place as Naruto's last teammate? Hinata was a no brainier once Naruto told him all of what had happened so far. He also made sure to give him a good teacher in one Kurenai Y\u016bhi. The women would make sure Naruto was at least taught and cared for, even if only to prove that she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he didn't want to, Iruka could only find one person to put on their team that wouldn't over power it or leave the other teams lacking. So after calling team 7 which consisted of Sasuke Uchiha, Kiba Inuzuka, and Ino Yamanaka under Kakashi Hatake; he began on team 8. \"Team 8. Your sensei is Kurenai Y\u016bhi. The members are: Naruto Uzumaki,\" he saw Naruto perk up from his seat next to Hinata. \"Hinata Hyuga,\" Iruka had to fight to keep down the smile he felt coming as the two looked at each other, the joy in their faces clearly able to be seen even from the other side of the room. But as they say, all good things come to an end. \"And Sakura Haruno.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka winced internally as he saw Naruto and Hinata\u2019s expressions quickly change from joyful to horrified. Their faces paled and their eyes widened as they looked over at their new teammate. A low rumble was heard coming from Sakura clearly showing what thought of the team arrangements. Iruka could do nothing but, give the two a look that showed how sorry he was at putting them on the same team before continuing. As he finished up the teams he began his speech about how proud he was of them and so on. Mentally he was hoping that Kurenai was a punctual as she always was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Kurenai Y\u016bhi was having a bad start to her day would be an understatement. First she finds that the alarm on her clock wouldn\u2019t work, causing her to get up an hour late. Then she couldn't find her shinobi uniform, one that she was sure she had left out so it would be easy to find and the hot water valve in her home isn\u2019t working leaving her to take an ice cold shower. A number of other small things happened to slow her down before she finally left to pickup her new team, only to be caught by ANBU and informed that the teams had under gone a sudden change and the Hokage would explain it to her after she dismissed her team for the day. The ANBU at least gave her a few sheets of paper, each having info about her new students. Kami (God) however, had other plans as she soon got dragged into helping track down and capture her friend Anko, who had gotten herself plastered at one of the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, nearly two hours after the pickup time she was finally entering the academy. As she walked she looked at the sheets of info on her new students. She was happy that she was still training Hinata as she had developed a bit of a soft spot for the girl during the time she escorted her to the academy. The boy maybe a problem but, she was sure she could handle the boy and mold him into someone great. And if not, well you could say that one of the girls won\u2019t need to worry about lunch. Kurenai gave a wicked smile. She had a method of dealing with baka\u2019s.  They were taught and either learned to not be such baka\u2019s or they ended up as a nutritious meal. The third one however, could prove to be a problem if this info was correct. The girl seemed to care only about Sasuke Uchiha and who to make her next meal out of. Kurenai hoped that this Sakura would keep her hunger impulses under control or the village would likely be losing a kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the classroom, Kurenai opened the door expecting to see the six genin of her team 8 and Kakashi\u2019s team 7. As such she was slightly surprised when she found the numbers coming up short. She looked around and saw the brooding Uchiha and a girl with pink hair with a rather smug look on her face and the sounds of digestion coming from her stomach. Do to her sitting behind a desk though, Kurenai couldn\u2019t be sure if what she thought happened really did happen. Stepping in she and asking were the rest were, she was surprised by the answer she got.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It all clicked for Kurenai after she noticed this.  Obviously, the Haruno girl had been hungry and wanted to be alone with the Uchiha at the same time.  The red-eyed jounin deduced that she must have eaten both Naruto and Hinata, and in the time she was Kiba and Ino had hidden themselves so as not to be next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai marched over to the girl with the overextending, wiggling belly and stopped right in front of her with arms crossed and a stern expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!  I was just a little bit late and you've already eaten your teammates!\" she yelled, furious with the girl for being unable to control herself.  \"Look young lady, there is something I think you need to hear again, because it obviously didn't take when you were taught it in the academy.  Kunoichi who prove themselves a danger to their fellow Konoha ninja, and who are unable to control their baser urges, are themselves disposed of in a similar manner.\"  Her eyes drilled into Sakura''s, and caused the pinkette to flinch back.  \"I never want to catch you doing this to your teammates again, or you won't be able to make the mistake a third time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Hinata and Naruto, roughly the same time when the vore jutsu was created, a forced regurgitation jutsu was made in order to prevent Konoha casualties.  Kurenai performed the necessary hand seals and slammed her chakra coated palm into Sakura's stomach.  With a horrible retch, Hinata and Naruto were deposited on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now follow me, we can introduce ourselves along the way and I can tell you about what's next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual introductions were given, and shortly after Kurenai told them about their next test.  Her three pupils got up to leave, but their jounin sensei gave them one final warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, I have been given permission to eat any of you three during the test to subdue you.  Nothing permanent, just thought you should be prepared.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kurenai arrived at the training ground she found herself rather surprised. She had expected to find Naruto, as he apparently had some kind of healing factor, or even Sakura as she didn't have any wounds from yesterday. She hadn't expected to find Hinata here, trying to run laps around the area while weighted down. In truth, Kurenai had expected to have to postpone her test for a few days or just fail her team outright. The reason being that she had brought Hinata to the hospital to have her acid burns treated and such things normally take a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to watch her timid student run till she hunched over and started huffing, Kurenai decided it was time to make her presence known.<br>\r\n.\u2026\u2026<br>\r\nHinata was tired beyond belief. She hadn't expected running laps while weighed down by someone else her size to be so tiring. Finally getting her second wind Hinata straitened and was about to try for one last lap, when the air in front of her shimmered and Kurenai appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" The startled Hyuga princess jumped, throwing her balance off and causing Hinata to fall forward. Kurenai watched amused as Hinata twisted herself so she wouldn't land on her stomach. Thought in hindsight, Kurenai couldn't help but, feel sympathy for her student as Hinata landed hard on her back. The stomach the young girl was sporting was of course a victim to gravity and slammed into the poor girl with a hard bounce, causing a loud wet belch to exit Hinata's mouth while her belly bounced and jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would tell you to calm down but, it seems that would be rather pointless now wouldn't it.\" Kurenai stated more then asked her groaning student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sen-(urp)-sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping the girl stand back up Kurenai began to ask if what she was doing here so early, much less alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a-alone, sensei.\" Hinata meekly stated. Kurenai looked at her confused and asked for some clarification. \"W-well you see, um... I-I needed hel-lp with training. As Kunoichi I n-need to be able to car-rry prisoners or c-captives back to Konoha.\" Hinata paused for a moment only continuing when Kurenai motioned her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of m-my spare time is u-used for train-ning with my father in our clan style. So I needed to practice.\" Kurenai smiled as Hinata shyly finished her explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, Hinata. I'm glad to see you are taking the initiative and continuing to train even when you haven't been ordered to in you spare time.\" She saw how Hinata seemed to beam in delight at the praise. \"However, it is nearly time to start the test, so go ahead and digest your meal and rest.\" Kurenai found it surprising at how Hinata seemed to suddenly get very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai could barely hear her as she whispered. \"Hinata, if you are having a difficult time digesting this one then you don't need to hide it.\" Kurenai gently told her while starting to make hand signs for a digestive aid jutsu. \"We've all had stubborn meals before. Now just stay still and I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Shouted the shy girl as she quickly jumped away from Kurenai's glowing hands. Kurenai looked on in confusion as Hinata put distance between her and the girls stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You d-don't understand. I-I at-te Nar-ruto!\" Hinata went on to explain how she had asked Naruto to help her with this training and how he had agreed to let her eat him but, only if she kept her promise to let him back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai rubbed her temples as she processed this new tidbit of info. \"He let you eat him?\" She asked incredibly. Hinata simply nodded, her attention half on her and half on her stomach as she rubbed it. An obvious attempt to comfort herself if Kurenai ever saw one. \"And all because you promised him that you would let him out?\" Again Hinata nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai sighed. She couldn't believe her only male student was that trusting or at least that dense. If it had been any other girl, Kurenai knew that she would be searching for a new member of the team right now. Hell, if it was anyone else in her stomach, Hinata might have just said 'too hell with it' and digested them anyway.  Taking a peek Kurenai say Hinata off in her own little world as she rubbed her stomach lovingly. There was no way Hinata would willingly digest Naruto unless as a last resort to keep him safe from others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again Kurenai told Hinata to let Naruto out, which she did just as her protection for Naruto collapsed. Kurenai had to admit that it was somewhat amusing to watch Naruto fall flat on his face as Hinata threw him up. She also noticed how the boy tried to hide his reaction to moving through Hinatas body from them, though only Hinata didn't seem to notice the effect she now had on the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai shook her head has she realized that Naruto starting to experience the effects of puberty. And to make it worse, the boy seems to physically enjoy the sensation of Hinata's body surrounding his whole being. She wondered if Naruto even realized why he was reacting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that Sakura showed up. Kurenai decided it was finally time to start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright,\" began the Jounin quickly catching the attention of her charges. \"I would first like to thank Naruto and Hinata for showing up today after what happened before.\" Kurenai threw a glance at Sakura whose attention seemed to be drifting towards her teammates. Kurenai gave a mental sigh at this. \"Also, Hinata. I'd like to know how you seem completely healed after having suffered stomach acid burns only just yesterday.\" It was more a statement then a question though. The shy girl fidgeted for a moment seemingly working up the courage to speak. \"I m-make healing creams in my sp-pare time. I always add some compounds that-t neutralize the acids and accelerate the healing process.\" The young Hyuga girl glanced up and saw the look of amazement in her sensei's eyes before returning her gaze down towards the ground, blushing the whole time at the sense of accomplishment she now felt for her creams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kurenai finally stopped gaping, a large smile made its home on her face. She was so proud of the girl. It also meant that she had some talent for healing. Kurenai made note to introduce Hinata and maybe even Sakura to the healing arts of medical jutsu. For now however she had a test to give, she just hoped these three would pass and not fall to some of her nastier genjustu traps that had been place about. \"Well, team let\u2019s start this test shall we? Now, most teams when made are arranged with a certain goal in mind. For instance, a group with members having tracking related abilities tend to be placed together in order to create a tracking and recon team. Or the famous Ino-Shika-Cho team, which was an interrogation/infiltration/support team, as their abilities made them ideal for supporting others or attacking the enemy through none direct methods.\" She took a moment make sure everyone was with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei?\" Kurenai turned to her pink haired student, slightly surprised that the clearly hungry girl was paying attention to what was being said and not on how to eat her team. Though Kurenai didn't put it past the girl to try later. \"Yes, Sakura.\" \"Sensei, if every team is designed with a purpose then what is ours? Hinata is the only one of us from a clan and she would likely lean more towards tracking and recon or ambushing. Naruto and I however don't have any unique abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai smiled at the fact Sakura had caught on so quick. \"Your right! You and Naruto don't really bring anything to a tracking team or even an assault or support team. But there is something you have in common Sakura, or at least something you and Hinata have in common.\" A grin spread on Kurenai's face as she saw the confused looks she was getting. Hinata seemed less lost then the others yet still didn't seem to grasp what Kurenai was saying. She almost chuckled at how simple the answer was. \"The answer is that you are both kunoichi. And what can every kunoichi do that no boy can?\" Looks of understanding blossomed on the girls faces. \"We are Konoha's first ever, genin level disposal team. It is our job as a team of mostly kunoichi to consume and dispose of our comrades and villages enemies. We will likely be given missions involving the removal of people, such as bandits.\" Kurenai couldn\u2019t help the hungry grin that soon found its way to her face, she hadn\u2019t been on a good disposal mission for some time and her stomach was just aching for the chance to be filled till she was immobile. There was no surprise in seeing Sakura practically drooling at the thought of being ordered to eat her fill. Hinata on the other hand, though less obvious about it looked just as eager to start gorging herself on some pitiful bandits. Naruto of course looked both out of place and rather unsettled at being on a team composed of hungry females but, the girls were too far in their own little worlds to really care, even Hinata didn\u2019t notice his discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping from her daydreams of stuffing herself well beyond the limits of what any person should be able to consume, Kurenai clapped her hands to regain her students\u2019 attention. \u201cNow, for this test you will have two ways of success. The first is simple. I will be attacking you with the intention of consuming every one of you. If I succeed in putting all three of you inside my belly,\u201d she pauses a moment to give said stomach a gentle pat drawing her students attention to the bandage-dress covered stomach, \u201cthen you will affectively fail this test and be sent back to the academy.\u201d She noticed how all three of them relaxed slightly at hearing what failure would mean, none more so then Naruto. Kurenai smirked as she could already think of what punishment the boy had been so afraid of. \u201cNow knowing this you must have already realized that your objective is to not be caught and eaten for a set period of time. Seeing as how I can keep my stomach from digesting whatever is in it for nearly five hours time, you three will need to remain free of my stomach for that long in order to pass.\u201d Kurenai paused to look up at the suns position. \u201cIt is nearly 8am, so you will need to remain outside of my stomach till 1pm. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the second way we can pass?\u201d This was asked by the lone male of the team. \u201cWell Naruto, this second method is something that you won\u2019t be able to do unless you can suddenly change into a girl.\u201d Despite herself Kurenai felt a chill of foreboding run down her spine at that but, brushed it off and continued talking. \u201cThe second way of passing is for one of the girls to swallow me. The moment they manage to trap me completely inside one of their stomachs is the moment that every one of you passes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Kurenai said that Sakura\u2019s mind went into overdrive. It was obvious that once a person was trapped inside the stomach, they had little to no chance of escaping without being let out by the kunoichi that had swallowed them. This was due to the insides of a kunoichi having some kind of sealing effect on their meals chakra, so once inside the stomach jutsu couldn\u2019t be used. <i>\u2018If I play this right then I can swallow down Kurenai-sensei once she swallows the other two. If I do, then I\u2019ll be getting a three course meal for the price of one with no one able to stop me from digesting them.\u2019</i> Thought the pinket as plans were already being made to insure this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we start a word of warning. If either of you girls eat your teammates and try to digest them then I will fail you! I give you this warning because there are a number of genjustu around the area that if you fall under its sway you will try to eat the first living thing to see. These genjustu also lower your reluctance to digest any living meals, so be careful you don\u2019t fall prey to these genjustu.\u201d Despite what she said there was one person that Kurenai would make an exception for; Hinata. If the girl ate one of her teammates and digested them before the test was over, then Kurenai would have no choice but, to take her under her wing and teach the young Hyuga girl how to avoid this from happening ever again. Then again, with her Byakugan Kurenai doubted that Hinata would fall prey to such a genjustu. After all, just because her family saw her as weak didn\u2019t mean that they wouldn\u2019t even teach the girl how to recognize genjustu and dispel them, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s get started.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata wiggled around inside the cramped and fleshy confines of her current prison. She couldn\u2019t believe how quickly things had gone wrong. As she thought this she shifted her hips a bit too much and Hinata soon felt her current \u2018roommate\u2019 for lack of a better word, squirm around causing Hinata to blush brightly due to their current positions. Her mind however took her back to when things started going bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Flashback-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first hour was nearing its end and they had a problem. Hinata was in the tree line trying to hide herself from her sensei, who was right out in the open not that far from her current position. The problem however wasn\u2019t that. Sakura had taken only one look at the situation in the open field before turning and continuing on away from this location. Hinata however, couldn\u2019t bring herself to do that as Naruto was at this moment alone, facing off against their sensei. Hinata however, had quickly learned that Naruto was completely hopeless against genjustu as he was simply standing there as Kurenai calmly walked up to him, fully intending to swallow him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to leave Naruto all on his own or let him enter the stomach of any girl that wasn\u2019t her, Hinata had quickly pulled out some shuriken and thrown the bladed stars out between Kurenai-sensei and Naruto. She then jumped out herself, speeding towards Naruto while still throwing shuriken to keep sensei away long enough to waken Naruto and run. She had not however, expected this to all be an elaborate trap set up by her sensei. As soon as she reached Naruto the blond suddenly moved, attacking her of all things. Still not seeing the truth of what was happening Hinata was caught off guard and soon found herself flying back towards the trees. Finally, activating her Byakugan Hinata saw the truth of what had happened. Kurenai had swallowed Naruto up long before she had tried to intervene. Her sensei had used her compassion and feelings for Naruto and his safety against her by disguising herself as Naruto while keeping a genjustu up to fool her into thinking that Naruto hadn\u2019t been eaten yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn\u2019t get any longer to contemplate this as her flight started dipping back down, causing her to crash in the trees branches and leaves, getting herself tangled and disoriented. Gravity however, would not be denied and it pulled her down towards the ground, her jacket getting caught and slowly being pulled off of her was the only reason she had remained in the branches for so long. As the Hyuga heiress plummeted down, now jacketless, she straitened herself out and prepared to absorb the impact and start running. She only noticed Kurenai-sensei standing right under her with her mouth wide open once it was too late. A small \"Eep\" was the last sound she made as she shot down Kurenai\u2019s throat like a rocket. The force behind her fall causing Hinata to go down like a butter greased sausage. Kurenai only need one gulp to make sure all of the girl was fully pushed into her new temporary home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuuuurrrrrpppp!!!\u201d Kurenai gave a loud happy sigh as she rubbed the over inflated beach ball sized stomach she now had, the bandage dress parting just ever so slightly to accommodate the large protrusion. \u201cI have to say you two. Despite only getting a small taste of Hinata I can safely say you both taste delicious! It\u2019s no wonder why people want to eat you two so much!\u201d exclaimed their sensei before giving another belch just as Hinata\u2019s jacket landed on top of her. Kurenai chuckled before zipping the jacket open and sliding it on, if not for the massive stomach she might have been able to even zip it back up. \u201cEnjoy your private time together you two as you aren\u2019t getting back out until this test if over.\u201d Kurenai gave her belly a gentle pat as she felt her two ingested students squirm. She made to move but, froze when she heard a very muffled \u201cEep!\u201d from her belly. Gently probing her middle for a second Kurenai quickly figured out what had happened and chuckled before walking deeper into the forest in search of her final student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-End Flashback-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what left her where she was. Due to how sensei had swallowed them, Hinata and Naruto had ended up in a very awkward and embarrassingly intimate position. Naruto had been swallowed head first from behind, if his current location was anything to go by. Hinata on the other hand had been swallowed feet first while looking the same direction as her sensei. With them both now trapped inside the cramped organ and how they had been swallowed, Hinata had quickly found out that she was sitting on top of Naruto\u2019s face, his mouth and noise breathing/poking a particular area between her legs. Now every time he moved the part of him that pressed against her, her thighs would squeeze together in an attempt to keep that part of herself closed off. With Naruto\u2019s head trapped between her legs however that made things difficult. All in all, Hinata was left feeling a mix of mortification, aroused and embarrassed as she suffered though her first experienced with the position known as the 69.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I hope this ends soon or else I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to keep myself in check.\u2019</i> Thought the heavily embarrassed and rather aroused girl as she was forced to actively stop her body from rocking its hips and pressing down on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Outside the stomach</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai was walking around the forest trying to keep the feeling that something bad would soon happen from showing in her body language. Her belly still jutted out in front of her, wiggling every so often from Hinata and Naruto\u2019s movements. She was thankful once again for her dress keeping her belly form swaying around too much. Kurenai hoped that Sakura would be smart and simply try to keep her distance from her rather than try and swallow her with a surprise attack. If the girl tried to surprise her and succeeded than Kurenai feared what would happen to her students as once swallowed, Kurenai wouldn\u2019t be able to use her chakra to keep her stomach from digesting the other two inside her. <i>\u2018Where are you girl?\u2019</i> she wondered to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been three hours already and nothing had happened. Kurenai had expected her team to at least test the waters sort-to-speak once or twice before this much time had passed. Narrowing her eyes in concentration Kurenai tried to feel out the chakra signatures of her students. Although not a sensor type by any means, Kurenai still had a talent for feeling out familiar chakras. This made finding Hinata the easiest of them. Feeling the young Hyuga girl near one of her hunger inducing genjustu traps, Kurenai felt it best to go and see if the girls training had been neglected as much as she feared. If Hinata had fallen to her genjustu then it would only be a matter of time before she tried to eat and digest one of her teammates. The worst part was that those genjustu could only be broken if you 'knew' you were being affected by them before they fully activated. With her eyes Kurenai was sure that Hinata would see them long before she fell prey to the genjustu. The only other way to break free was for the jutsu caster to release them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai reached out, trying to feel her other two students. She couldn't find any trace of them. That left two realistically possible options, as she didn't believe it possible for a genin to hide themselves from a Jounin. The first possible option was that their chakras were too weak to be felt. She could believe this to be true for Sakura but, not someone like Uzumaki. The second option was that they had been eaten by a kunoichi. A Kunoichi\u2019s stomach blocked off chakra to those trapped inside but, it also interfered with a sensory ninja\u2019s chakra sensing abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai frowned at this. Naruto's chakra was too great to fully suppress, especially for such a young ninja. That could only mean that Naruto had been eaten. Now, while Kurenai wasn't particularly fond of the boy, at least not yet, she knew that if something happened to him then Hinata would be devastated. Sakura seemed like the most likely culprit for such a thing. She had already proven that she wasn't above eating her teammates should the chance arise. However, Hinata hadn't moved from her spot in the genjustu trap area. The only answer Kurenai had for this was that Hinata had eaten something or more like a someone and was now laying back and digesting her meal(s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrifying thought struck Kurenai. <i>'What if Hinata ate Naruto and was digesting him right now?!?'</i> If this happened then Kurenai wasn't sure what the girl would do upon learning of it. The greatest problem was that it could already be too late. Kurenai hadn't been keeping a very close watch on her students for the last three uneventful hours. If Hinata had fallen to the genjustu early on then she would likely be too far into digestion to save whoever had been eaten. Kurenai hoped that that wasn't the case as she started moving towards Hinata's location.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><u><b>During those three hours</b></u><br>\r\nHinata was chewing on her lip in worry. The test had started and for safety, she and Naruto had decided to stick together. This was not so much to protect them from their sensei as it was to protect themselves from their other teammate. Hinata had no wish to visit Sakuras' stomach again, a sentiment that Naruto shared. On an unrelated note, she did find it sort of sweet when he had said he preferred being in her stomach. He had quickly realized how his statement could be taken and tried to correct himself. This of course had only left him putting his foot in his mouth once again, leaving her blushing and giggling at his attempts to not make it seem like he enjoyed being in her belly. Whether or not he enjoyed being inside her stomach more then he should mattered little to her, though she wouldn't disapprove of him asking her to eat him more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, they had been moving through the trees, hoping to avoid running into both their sensei and their teammate. And that in its self was the problem. Kurenai-sensei was a Jounin. As genin they couldn't realistically be expected to be able to avoid her for five hours. The chances of them being able to capture and swallow her were even less reasonable. The only chance they would have at that would require the three of them to work together. This left Hinata in a weird position, as she knew she had to tell Naruto about this but, every survival instinct they had screamed at them to stay far away from Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually made up her mind to tell Naruto what she thought and to go from there. Seeing they were just about to enter a small clearing Hinata spoke up. \"Umm, N-naruto. I t-think we need to...\" She got no further as the genjustu trap in the area worked its magic at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding in the clearing Naruto turned towards his teammate and possible friend, confused at why she had stopped talking mid-sentence. \"Hinata? Hey what's wrong?\" He asked, his worry for the girl starting to grow as she didn't answer and just stood there with her head down. Naruto was pretty sure that that wasn't a good sign. Walking closer he leaned in to try and see if anything was wrong. Once he did however, her head quickly shot up startling him enough that he jumped back slightly in surprise. Naruto took the opportunity to look deeply into her pale lavender eyes. Many things were different about her at that moment. Most noticeable was that unlike the rare times Naruto got to look at her eyes she didn't turn away quickly, they were hardened, unmoving, and half lidded, as opposed to their usual shakiness. He also took note of the light blush coloring her cheeks. Finally, there was a small soft smile gracing her lips, almost alluring in manner where normally a nervous expression adorned her face. All these things together sent an odd tingle down his spine, and for reasons he didn't understand his heart rate increased slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swayed towards him slowly, her hips gently rocking with each step, which made him back away with a blush starting to color his face. \"Naruto-kun\u2026come here please.\" She said without a stutter with her always gentle voice, but the blond merely shook his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm\u2026N-no that's o-oka\u2026\" Before he could finish, Hinata was in front of him. Naruto barely sensed her movement and still didn't manage to react until she was already there, her smiling face no more than an inch from his. He quickly jumped back across the open field away from her, his heart throbbing like crazy. He was about to speak up again till he saw her strutting towards him as if nothing happened. He backed away once again till he hit a tree. He wished he could just run away but his legs quivered and refused to move an inch. Naruto never in his life, had felt this way before, it certainly wasn't fear. It was something more alien than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she reached him and placed her hands on his hips, and had it travel up and under his shirt and jacket till they rested lightly over his abs. He was still young, so he wouldn't have anything rock hard but, giving his stomach a gentle squeeze she could certainly feel some muscle definition. Hinata released a light but, clearly pleased moan which confused the heavily breathing blond. She then moved one hand out from under his shirt, upward till it reached his cheek and gently caressed it. She leaned in closer. \"Don't worry Naruto-kun, I promise you won't be disappointed.\" She leaned in closer till their lips met in what would be the Hyuuga heiress's first kiss. Naruto, not able to register what was happening, did nothing; Hinata however used this moment of inaction to push her tongue into the blonds\u2019 mouth, deepening the kiss to a passionate level. After a few moments every muscle in Naruto's body calmed down and she broke the kiss to whisper gentle words in his ear. \"I want show you what you mean to me, Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood there, a mix of stunned disbelief and confusion over what was happening. After a moment he managed to give a shaky response. \"Wh-what do you m-mean?\" He was still trying get over the fact that Hinata had just kissed him. Hinata however, only activated her Byakugan and scanned for her other teammate and sensei. It only took her a moment before turned off her bloodline and whispered in Naruto's ear again. \"Sensei doesn't appear to be searching for us and Sakura is a distance from here, so we don't need to worry about either of them interrupting.\" \"I-interup-pting what?\" He asked, trembling not in fear but something else. Hinata unzipped his jacket before sliding her other hand back under his shirt, joining its twin in exploring Naruto's body. \"Our love session.\" \"L-l-love session!?!\" Hinata continued to entertain herself by pressing her body against him and rubbing her pelvis against a large bulge that had formed in his pants. \"I'm going to make you mine, Naruto. All mine.\" He never noticed her lick her lips in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a clearing two young teens lay together naked as the day they were born. Despite the test they where suppose to be taking, Hinata Hyuga had suddenly forced herself on her teammate and crush, one Naruto Uzumaki. Despite his nervousness and fully rational fear of what would happen when people found out what they had just done, Naruto had fallen for the Hyuga girls charms rather quickly. That\u2019s not to say that he didn\u2019t try to say no, he simply gave up on trying to refuse when Hinata made it very clear, even to him, that she would not take no for an answer. Now he was laid out on the grass exhausted beyond anything he could remember. He had thought that training was tiring but, they both soon learned that physical stamina and endurance does not always transfer over to sexual stamina and endurance. It was so hard now to even stay awake, leaving him completely venerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, who was equally tired, panted hard as her young sweaty body slowly came down from its sexual high. The genjustu she had been under persisted even now but, one would wonder why she had allowed herself to lose her virginity when the genjustu simply forced her to eat those close at hand. The reason stemmed from the fact that Kunoichi even the young ones, where willing to go to great lengths to claim a singled out target as a meal. In this cause, Hinata had deemed Naruto far to capable of escaping her should he so wish to, so she decided to exhaust him first to make consuming him both easier and more enjoyable. Hinata was just thankful for the changes that chakra gave people. When chakra was tapped into for the first time it tended to be painful, this was due to the chakra making changes to the body in order to allow the body to better handle the newly activate chakra. This made a person both stronger and faster than a normal civilian and allowed them to heal faster as well. However it also had an effect on their growth. Academy students in their last year, around the time of graduation, tend to be more developed in some ways then their civilian counterparts. One such area was the sexual development, though most never partook of this till a few years have passed, most academy graduates are capable of being sexually active. This was especially true for the girls like Hinata. This of course also meant that they were fully capable of suffering the consequences of such acts as well. Hinata however, decided that she would deal with the possibility of being pregnant later, should it ever happen from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pressed herself harder against the naked boy that she had been lying on top of and gave his cheek a few soft kisses. This was done both out of affection that she felt for the boy and to give her a chance to taste him discreetly. Naruto groaned in exhaustion as feeling Hinata\u2019s body pressing against him made a part of him wish to have another go; the rest of him however demanded sleep. \u201cGo ahead and rest for a bit Naruto-kun.\u201d The genjustu effected girl whispered gently. \u201cWe still have plenty of time.\u201d She emphasized this by kissing him again, secretly relishing in the flavors his hot and sweat covered body held. Naruto didn\u2019t need to be told twice; as much as he wanted to stay awake and finish this test his body overruled him. It did not take long for the tired boy to fall fast asleep in the warm grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took this moment to give Naruto a gentle look and giggle softly as she heard him mutter nonsense in his sleep. \u201cOh Naruto. I love you so much and you look so adorable as you sleep. But I feel I would love you even more once you are inside my belly. I hope you enjoyed my final gift to you as much as I did.\u201d She whispered, giving the boy one final kiss before backing away and moving towards his feet. She planned to start from the bottom up this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, carefully, she pressed his feet together, his ankles aligned and parallel, his big toes pressed together and pointing up, straight towards her face. Opening her mouth wide, and shutting her eyes tight, she leaned forward and wrapped her lips as far around his feet as they'd initially go without letting her jaw fully drop. She got pretty far surprisingly - the corners of her mouth pressed against his little toes on either side, and his big toes rested firmly on her tongue. Wanting to get past his feet so she could join Naruto in sleep as quickly as possible and eager to waste as little time as needed, she allowed her jaw to open to its full size and swallowed. This time the hot, dark, wetness of her mouth took in his feet up to just before his heels, his toes pressing at her throat's entrance already. Encouraged by the rather tasty success so far she quickly decided to not linger, as she was sure the rest of him would be even tastier. With that thought in mind she took another firm swallow. By now his feet were twitching slightly, as the first feelings of something were probably nagging at his slumbering senses. She had heard that boys sometimes dreamed about being eaten by girls they thought to be cute and Hinata wouldn\u2019t be against it if he had had such dreams if they happened to involve her. She could feel the muscles jerking, slightly, probingly, inside of her, because after that last gulp his feet had been tugged down almost entirely into the pulsing, slick tube of muscle that led down to her stomach, empty and hungry because she'd been too nervous to eat much the night before and this morning leading up to her Exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heels were pulled down from resting on her tongue to being hugged, along with the rest of his feet, inside of her throat when she took another swallow... One that brought his ankles into her mouth. Slick, pulsing flesh pulled down on his feet even while she wasn't swallowing, the constant motion tugging him down a tiny bit further even when she wasn't trying to. Of course, that trip was assisted by the gulps she did take, the next quick series of which made short work of his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stirred for a moment, causing Hinata to halt her advance up his legs. She was thankful that he did not full wake as he simply went back to sleep. She waited a few moments to ensure he had fallen asleep before she continued. By now her lips were already stretched impossibly wide, resting just below his knees, as she moved higher and higher up along his legs. She wasn't entirely sure, but she could have sworn that she could already feel his toes pushing against the tightly shut entrance to her stomach, the pressure increasing against it every second... Until her next hungry gulp took in his knees, and pushed his toes forcibly through and down into the slightly more spacious organ that his entire body would soon be held in upon her finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ring squeezed tightly around his feet, sliding up along them as she took another gulp and started up his thighs, she wondered just how deeply Naruto could sleep. One would think that the feeling of a wet, squeezing, pulsing warmth surrounding the better part of your legs, would rouse you from your slumber. But in the end it didn\u2019t matter, as Hinata was truthfully grateful for him being such a deep sleeper as it would allow her to get a great deal of him inside her stomach before he started struggling. As she took a strong gulp her eyes focused in on a part of Naruto that she truthfully hadn\u2019t expected to see standing at attention again so soon. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed in herself for not thinking to turn him over before she started eating him. What she wouldn\u2019t give to run her tongue over his stiff member again. To taste that thick and slightly salty goodness as it filled her mouth and coated her tongue again. Mentally she signed and gave another swallow bringing her right up to his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a potential obstacle Hinata reached out and grabbed his hands, bringing them to rest flat at his sides so she could trap them on her way up. She knew that he couldn\u2019t simply pull himself out from inside of her, not when her muscles were holding him so tightly. Still she didn\u2019t feel like dealing with him hurting her by accident should he wake and start to panic. As she gulped in the top part of his hips, the bulging stomach she had been resting on grew as more of his body disappeared inside of hers. His knees now having entered her stomach, his hands were soon locked in place inside of her mouth. No amount of tugging or struggling on his part would free them from her mouth, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took this chance to start running her tongue along his body, or more specifically his rear. During the few time Hinata had swallowed him before, she had never removed any of his clothes and thus only knew some of Naruto\u2019s wonderful flavours. This soon changed as her world seemed to explode into tantalizing flavours and textures that she had never tasted before. The sweat on his body only further added to the party of flavours dancing in her mouth. She was almost sad to know that she would never get to taste him like this again. But she quickly pushed those feelings away as the saliva slicked walls of her throat tugged relentlessly at her meal in an attempt to pull him down towards her impatient stomach. As she gulped again and brought her lips level with the area between his chest and stomach she thought to herself, <i>\u2018Not much longer.\u2019</i></span></div></div>",

She idly noted that she could feel his form through her skin, her hand happily rubbing against his legs as they bent inside of her stomach in order to make more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to shift around so she was kneeling on the ground, the hand beneath Naruto\u2019s back being used to support and lift what remained of him outside of her body as the other hand continued to rub and massage her growing stomach. Now that gravity was on her side, she'd make even shorter work of him. A rapid series of gulps buried him inside of her up to just below his shoulders only proved this to be true. The quick succession of swallows however, jerked him this way and that, jolting him from his slumber. Seeing this and knowing that she couldn\u2019t allow Naruto to start screaming or yelling until he was curled up inside of her stomach, Hinata slowly reached up and gently poked the side of his neck with a finger. The simple poke allowed her to inject a little chakra into his vocal cords, paralyzing them for a very short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of his drowsy state she gave another deep swallow, one that brought his shoulders into her mouth and let her lips tighten again, less stretched as all they had to wrap around was his neck. She could feel his legs bending inside of her, likely more than slightly uncomfortable for him as more of his body was slowly pushed into the small cavern that was her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto awoke to feel something warm, wet, pulsing all around him, massaging him from every angle up to his neck. He grimaced slightly at feeling some kind of stinging sensation slowly replace the tingling one that had been surrounding his feet. Though only semi-painfully, it was still an unwanted sensation. It was here however, that he found he couldn\u2019t move any part of him that was feeling the warm, wet, pulsing sensation. He felt whatever it was that was surrounding him, tense up for a moment before he was yanked down. He immediately knew what was happening to him; the fact that he could see the top part of Hinata\u2019s face only confirmed it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew he saw her and she didn\u2019t care. All that mattered to her now was eating him up and taking a nap so she could digest. Knowing she was now at the end of her meal she swallowed and her lips now around his face, just above his nose... Another gulp, and her lips closed behind his head, her tongue pressing hot and wet and thick against the back of his head as his face was pushed against the roof of her mouth. Even without words, and without hope, he struggled, squirming and writhing against the constant downward tug. But it was useless; even before she swallowed he could feel her muscles pulling him hungrily down to the acidic fate that awaited him, and then when she did swallow, it was like someone had forcibly pushed down on the top of his head - he was instantly and entirely trapped in her throat and stomach, rapidly filling the latter. His body bent and curled as more and more of it was deposited into the ever-expanding organ, the walls of it stretching both internally and externally to fit the bumps and bulges of his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his struggles he felt her hands on her stomach, outside, rubbing over and around his body, stroking almost... lovingly?... over the various bumps and bulges that he made. Finally he was entirely inside her stomach, the slimily walls rubbing against his face as soon as they had the chance, churning noisily all around him. The sounds of her body were deafening from inside - the churning, groaning, growling sounds of her stomach, the steady, rapid thumping heartbeat above him, her whooshing breathing also above as she gasped for breath for the first time in minutes. He pressed his hands out against the walls of her stomach as he struggled. The struggling seemed to be too much for her, and he felt another shift of gravity, the acids pooled at the bottom of her stomach sloshing messily as she seemed to flop onto her back... He could feel her arms wrapped tightly around him, around her swollen stomach, but that didn't help at all - he continued to struggle, and hopelessly feel for something, anything, that could get him out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was useless. The sphincter he'd come in through was clenched shut again, too tight to get even a finger through. Somehow, he knew that this Hinata wasn\u2019t the same one that had promised to release him every time she ate him. Somehow he just knew that this Hinata was planning for this to be a one way trip. This only seemed more certain as he felt the walls of her stomach massaging as-of-yet semi-useless acids into his skin and no sign of a protection jutsu being activated anytime soon. Hugging his knees tight against his chest, he finally stopped struggling, resigned to his fate.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\nFeeling the shaking inside of her, Hinata hugged her stomach tighter. \"Kami you are delicious Naruto-kun!\" She said with an explosive sigh. She smiled slightly at hearing the muffled cries and sobs from inside her, feeling kicks and spasms, punches and struggles renewed by the burning, hungry acids that slowly coated her stomach walls. She fell asleep on the warm grass only moments later, the genjustu forcing her to feel happy as she sunned her massive stomach as it let out its first loud groan. As she fell into warm dreams of her and Naruto being together, the small part of her that had been forced to watch herself eat her beloved took solace in the fact that Naruto still had a chance to escape. Despite how strong her stomach was, it would still take some time for her to fatally digest someone as resilient as Naruto. She could only hope that would be enough.</span></div></div>",

As she moved her hands around, trying to feel everything that was happening through the girls stomach Kurenai's hopes of finding Naruto alive and well where dropping rapidly. Just as she was about to give up and write Naruto off as having been digested she felt something. It wasn't much and truthfully she had nearly passed it off as simply Hinata's stomach but, when she felt it again Kurenai stopped and pressed a little harder against the gurgling and churning gut. Finally she found something solid floating around in the sleeping girls gut but, Kurenai's relief and hope for her only male student quickly died as she managed to get a better feel for Naruto's condition. The boys movements where weak and rather lacking in responsiveness. If she had to guess she'd say that Naruto was simply reacting out of instinct to try and escape now. Kurenai sighed as she pulled away from Hinata's stomach. There was no point in trying to get Naruto out as the trauma of being expelled from her stomach would likely be enough to kill him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving another heavy sigh, Kurenai shattered the genjutsu that had been affecting Hinata while placing another one in its place. The new genjutsu would keep Hinata asleep for a while longer, hopefully most of Naruto would be gone by then. Next, Kurenai did something that she truly hated herself for doing. She cast a new genjutsu that muddled Hinata's memory and would keep her from realizing that she had eaten and digested the very boy she cared so much for. Kurenai would not take the chance of Hinata trying to kill herself out of grief for this, especially since her clan was suppose to teach her how to recognize a genjutsu before it took hold and dispel it. She would need to bring Hinata to Ino's father and have him work out something a bit more permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her work on Hinata, Kurenai gathered up Naruto's clothes and sealed them away. A strong enough trigger could break her genjutsu and Hinata would be forced to remember that she had turned the boy she liked into food. Once done Kurenai moved back into the forest thinking on what would be the best way to deal with her final student. She could either fail the girl and send her back to the academy. Or she could just eat the girl herself and simply pass it off as Hinata having retaliated against Sakura for her eating Naruto. The second would give her greater leverage to take Hinata on as her apprentice rather then just a student.</span></div></div>",

What good will paperwork and test scores do to determine how good someone is as far as practical application in the field?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai looked at Naruto and had to, at least mentally, concede to that point. The fact that he was better than everyone thought made her excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing Naruto, she took note of his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his head was short, blond, spiky hair \u00a0that stuck up in all directions like the spines of a sea urchin and a blue headband with a metal plate attached to it that had the Hidden Leaf Village symbol of a spiral arrow engraved into it. As for his face he had blue eyes and odd whisker-like marks on his face. He wore orange pants and an orange shirt that has blue near the shoulders and was white at the neck, on the back of the shirt was a red spiral symbol, He had some bandages on his thigh and a carrying case for a kunai knives. He also wore a small pouch on his belt for basic ninja supplies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the Jonin found Naruto rather cute...cute enough to EAT!\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr even better...love making!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, males were nothing more then breeding stock or food. And \u00a0her only male student was trusting or at least, dense. She had learned that when she'd had Hinata explain how Naruto LET her swallow him for training purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai sighed and rubbed her temples \"Well since there can't be a three-person squad now, I'll have to flunk you since Hinata ate Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! You can't blame Hinata for that! She was just out to keep that damn cannibal from going after all three of us!\" Naruto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk...THAT caught Kurenai's attention. THREE?! Sakura was out to eat her would-be teacher too? That brought a frown to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata went rosy at her long-time crush defending her, Kurenai eyed the two as she processed the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...alright, I'll need to report this to the Hokage, see if there's a way to bend the rules. I'll tell you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two genin-hopefuls nodded and turned to leave. Neither of them noticing Kurenai making a handsign. As Hinata left, she smiled at getting her revenge on Sakura for earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen she got home, however, she saw that Naruto wasn't with her. She frowned, but then...she knew where he lived and Kurenai DID say she'd see them both the next day.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BACK AT THE TRAINING FIELDS...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around, confused.

Hinata blushed at the thought of just the two of them on a team and her mind slowly started moving towards the more naught side of things. She could barely wait to have him all to herself. He would finally see her and one day fall for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo lost was she in her daydreams that she paid no mind to the screaming and thrashing bitch in her stomach as she pressed against the walls of her prison. Her belly churned and gurgled pleasantly as her would be teammate sloshed around in what would be her final resting place. Hinata was only drawn out of her thoughts by a very unlady-like belch escaping her lips. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d, the girl meekly whispered before glaring at her bellies occupant, blaming her for the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching her room, Hinata opened the door only to stop as an ominous feeling washed over her only to vanish just as quickly as it came.

As Naruto settled in her hungry tummy, Kurenai sighed in pleasure at having something in her before giving a loud belch. Licking her lips and patting the wiggling bulge in her belly, Kurenai started on her way out of the training grounds. She still had a report to give before she went home to sleep.

It had all been fine only for her to wake up during the night from terrible stomach cramps and indigestion. She wasn\u2019t able to get much sleep after that started up as her stomach would have a fit every few minutes. It would seem that Sakura had her revenge against the Hyuga heiress by denying her a pleasant digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was now awaiting her hopefully, new sensei and teammate/crush while sitting on a nearby bench and rubbing her agitated tummy. <i>\u2018I can\u2019t believe there is still so much left. She should have been thoroughly digested and nothing but, a pile of shit and bones on its way down a toilet by now. Instead I\u2019m left with this\u2026\u2019</i> the young girl thought to herself in annoyance as she glared at the large bulging potbelly she now sported. Hinata had unzipped her jacket so as to better reach the large and surprisingly hard mound. She had been hoping that it would settle down and finish digesting its meal if she rubbed it long enough but, that didn\u2019t seem to be helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hissed and clutched her gut as it suffered another bout of cramps and a fresh wave of nausea hit her. She really wished her stomach would quit having these fits and remove the last bits of that bitch from her system already. When her stomach finally calmed down Hinata laid back against the bench with a tired sigh. What she wouldn\u2019t give to have Naruto here and giving her a nice belly rub. She smiled at the thought and let her mind run with it, daydreaming about her crush happily rubbing her belly and telling her how she was so cute and how her belly was so nice and soft. Hinata sighed happily at the daydream as a light blush covered her cheeks at the idea of having Naruto touching her skin in such an intimate manner.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai couldn\u2019t help but, smirk as she walked out of her apartment started on her way towards the Kage tower. It had taken all night and more than one digestive aid and accelerated digestion jutsu but, in the end she had finally proven that a woman\u2019s stomach was stronger than even Naruto Uzumaki\u2019s stubborn determination. In truth, after digesting him for a few hours and not getting anywhere, she had been a bit scared that she would have to regurgitate the blond and hope that her genjustu was enough to alter his memory. Kurenai\u2019s smirk turned into a full-fledged smile as she strutted down the streets, knowing that she had managed to digest the blond in the end and all that was left of him was a little padding on her body, a pile of shit and bones in her septic tank, and a small layer of fat around her belly that would be easy for her to burn off. That didn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be a bit annoying at having to do so as most meals, even the more massive ones of thirty people, rarely ever left any fat behind on her body. Still she did enjoy the little upgrade to her measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Kurenai a few moments to notice her new apprentice as she was too focused on how energetic she currently felt. Chalking up the \u2018feel good\u2019 sensation as a pleasant side effect of eating the Kyuubi container, Kurenai swiftly made her way over to her sloughing apprentice. \u201cHinata wake up!\u201d, although she didn\u2019t yell her voice clearly still startled the poor girl as she jumped slightly before focusing on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurenai-sensei, good morning.\u201d Greeted the shy girl. \u201cMaybe for me it is but, you seem to be having some problem\u201d, she said pointing at the younger girls gut. \u201cWould you like a little help with that before we get started?\u201d Getting a nod, Kurenai was quick to administer a digestive aid jutsu to the girls\u2019 stomach receiving a loud sigh of relief from the girl in thanks as her indigestion finally settled. \u201cThank you Kurenai-sensei. Is Naruto-kun here?\u201d asked the now excited girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai paused, not really sure what to say to the girl. She had no wish to enrage her new student and that is all that telling her the truth would do. Then again, she really didn\u2019t want to outright lie either as once she found out the truth, if she ever did, then that would likely only make things worse between them then outright telling the truth. Then again, Kurenai fully believed that Hinata would eventually grow out of her silly crush on the idiot and would simply be upset with knowing that she had missed her chance to eat the boy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a warm sunny day in Konoha. Birds were chirping, children were out playing and laughing, all was normal for its citizens. Unless one counted the odd sight of what was arguably the shyest and most soft spoken girl in all of Konoha trying to sooth and comfort the loudest knucklehead in the village, who just so happened to be her crush. So maybe it wasn\u2019t all that normal a day after all\u2026<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata had gotten up this morning she had thought that today would be a great day, as she was meeting up with Naruto to see if they had been given clearance to continue as a team after she had eaten and digested their other would-be teammate. She had gotten ready and ran out of her families compound faster then was thought possible by most of her clan. Upon seeing Naruto sitting on a bench not too far from the Hokage\u2019s tower, Hinata had been all smiles. Then as she approached she noticed that not all was well with her blond haired crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked like he hadn\u2019t had a wink of sleep and his eyes were shifting around as if he was trying to look everywhere at once. The part that scared her though was how his eyes seemed to be glazed over, like he wasn\u2019t really there or was lost in his own little world. From the pained looking twitches he made every few moments, Hinata would bet that it was the later and that it was a world full of pain. As she walked closer she noticed how he seemed to be shaking, as if he was jittery and on edge, ready to bolt at any second. This was not the strong and determined young boy that she had fallen for. It was a young boy that looked as if he had just gotten away from a very traumatic experience. She remembered that ominous feeling she had had last night before going to sleep and cursed herself for not rushing off to check on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto-kun?\u201d she called out to him in hopes she wouldn\u2019t startle him, however he didn\u2019t respond. It bothered her how his eyes simply went right past her as if she wasn\u2019t there while still looking like he was searching for something, as if he expected something to jump out and attack him. Not willing to be ignored by her crush she reached out with her hand, intending to gently place it on his shoulder and called his name again. \u201cNaruto-kun?\u201d This time as her hand touched him she got a response, it just wasn\u2019t the one she had been hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrieked in terror the moment her hand touched him and tried to jump away from her. Hinata was too shocked by Naruto\u2019s reaction to try and stop him and even as he tumbled in his haste to jump away while still sitting on the bench she did nothing but, stare at him with wide eyes feeling both hurt and worried. Her worry for him only grew as she watched him turnaround from his spot on the ground and look at her like she was the Shikigami himself come to take his soul. It took a few moments but, she eventually saw recognition make its way through his eyes and he visibly started to calm down. While Hinata was felt the hurt that Naruto\u2019s earlier reaction had caused to disappear, she still worried about what had happened to him to cause this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a small step forward she reached out for him but, made sure she didn\u2019t get to close out of fear that he would start panicking again. She needn\u2019t have worried, as before she could call his name again Naruto had leaped up and embraced her in a powerful, if seemingly desperate hug. She was quick to push the embarrassment she felt away and wrapped her arms around him, whispering soothing words and rubbing his back as she felt his body quiver from barely contained sobs. Gently she maneuvered them back to the bench and sat down. Never once releasing her hold on Naruto as the boy continued to hug her with a sense of desperation, like she was his last lifeline in whatever had happened. She silently swore to herself that she would find whoever or whatever had done this to her Naruto-kun and she would make them suffer the slowest and most agonizing digestion that she could possibly give. Hinata would never forgive the one that had hurt her beloved Naruto.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai walked towards the Hokage Tower feeling very nervous. She had desperately tried to digest her only male student nearly all night long but, after using four Rapid Digestion and three Digestive Aid jutsu\u2019s in her attempt to end her male students life and failing, she had no choice but to let him out. She had regurgitated him and then quickly slapped some very powerful genjutsu\u2019s on him in an attempt to alter his memory of the entire event. Even if she had managed that, the chances of him going back to how he was before she ate him were not very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came closer to her destination she noticed a very unusual sight. Hinata Hyuga was currently holding a boy\u2019s head to her chest and running the fingers of one hand through the boy\u2019s spiky blond locks. She stopped at that and looked again. <i>\u2018Spiky blond hair, check; orange jumpsuit, check; Hinata willingly allowing the boy to live more than a few seconds after having his face pressed against her breasts, check; There is only one person that could be then\u2026\u2019</i> she thought to herself with a sigh, <i>\u2018Naruto.\u2019</i> Kurenai was now really hoping her genjustu had done its job or else she might be walking right up to a potential beating; from her shyest student no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing towards her should-have-been apprentice and would-be meal, Kurenai attempted to calm her racing heart and readied herself for what would likely be her best acting moment ever.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt relief at seeing her teacher appear and pulled the much calmer boy just a little closer to herself before gently whispering to him, \u201cNaruto-kun, Kurenai-sensei is\u2026\u201d She got no farther as Naruto immediately stiffened at hearing their teachers name and quickly realized that he was starting to have another panic attack, this one even worse than the one he had to her. \u201cNaruto-kun?!? Naruto-kun what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She could feel Naruto\u2019s panic starting to seep into her and her voice. Looking at the boy she noticed how he had turned to look at their teacher and how that glazed I\u2019m-not-here look had returned to his eyes as his entire body started trembling. Her feelings of worry soon mixed with fright as she saw that he was starting to hyperventilate at the sight of Kurenai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly Hinata, forced Naruto to stop looking at the woman and buried his face in her bosom while trying desperately to calm him down. Her mind didn\u2019t want to except it but, from Naruto\u2019s reaction she now knew that Kurenai had something to do with his current condition. She pushed the thoughts of vengeance to the back of her mind for now. Naruto was all that mattered to her, she would simply have to deal justice to her sensei later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kurenai arrived she quickly hid herself in the trees so as to get a peek at what was happening. Suffice to say the scene she saw playing out was not one that she had expected. In the clearing she could see the two girls of her team, both looking like they had seen better days. Hinata was on the ground looking as if she had just gone ten rounds with a rabid animal. Her clothes were torn and her body, from what Kurenai could see as the girl was laying facedown in the ground, was covered in cuts, bruises and blood. Kurenai was happy to see that Sakura wasn't all that much better off, as the pink haired girl was clearly in pain and favoring her left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered where Naruto was but, on seeing Sakura moving in with the clear intention of making Hinata into a meal, Kurenai decided that it was time to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------- Some Minutes Earlier----- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't to sure about the plan that Hinata and Sakura had cooked up together. Despite their pink haired teammates desire to eat them, Hinata had believed that working together would bring about better results then working alone. To that end Hinata had approached Sakura and struck a deal with her. He wasn't sure what that deal was but, it somehow involved letting Hinata swallow him down again. Not that he was complaining about letting Hinata eat him. No, he was more concerned with how doing so would then make Hinata into a much more desirable target for their hungry teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking with Sakura made him feel uneasy and he had made sure to tell Hinata this. Her response had been a small comforting smile. It shouldn't have been so easy for her to put him at ease. It shouldn't be that easy for her to get him to agree, yet all it took was that one smile and a promise that it would all work out to get him to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed into the slimy, pulsing muscles of Hinata's stomach wall. Common sense told him that it was a bad idea to go along with an agreement that he didn't even know the terms to. Then again, he never was one to listen to common sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----With Hinata and Sakura------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura couldn't help but, feel a strong sense of jealousy as she observed Hinata gulping down the rest of Naruto. The boy hadn't fought against being eaten by the heiress in even the slightest manner. <i>'It's almost like he wants t...'</i> Sakura quickly banished that thought with a shake of the head. It didn't matter to her if Naruto wanted Hinata to eat him or not. All that mattered was that their plan worked so they could get missions that told them to eat people. Every hungery kunoichi dreamed of being on a disposal squad as it meant being ordered to eat till you were about to pop. Even Hinata, as shy and kind as she was, dreamed of being ordered to go out and eat herself into a food coma. It was just how kunoichi's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the last of Naruto enter Hinata's stomach she decided to push forward. \"Now that he is packed away, perform the <b>'Stomach Concealment no Jutsu'</b> so we can get started.\" Sakura cracked her knuckles as she prepared to start wailing on the sated girl. Hinata gave a wet belch while looking at her impatient partner in this plan. \"I need to ~urp~ let him settle ~Buuurrrppp~ first, before the jutsu. You remember the plan right?\" The bloated Hyuga asked clearly enjoying the tiny wiggles Naruto made as he settled into his hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned in a mix of irritation and hunger. \"Yes, I remember the plan. After you use the concealment jutsu we beat on each other until sensei comes. Then you will lay on the ground and I'll move in as if I'm going to eat you. You'll give a signal to tell me that sensei is incoming. My job will then be to distract her while you throw Naruto back up. Then all three of us will attack her with the intention of one of us eating her so we can pass.\" Seeing the girl smile at her while rubbing her Naruto belly made Sakura's eye twitch in annoyance. \"Well?!? Get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata performed the seals for the <b>'Stomach Concealment'</b> jutsu but, seeing as how she had not mastered it yet, her belly only shrank down to a bulge the size of a basket ball rather then to a barely noticeable bump in her otherwise flat belly. With that done the two got in their battle stances and charged each other, fully intending to beat the other to a bloody pulp.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto couldn't help himself. No matter how much he told himself to stop watching he just couldn't take his eyes off of his teammate. So, he watched on with no small amount of excitement as Hinata gave another hard gulp around their sensei's calves. He didn't understand why he found such perverse pleasure in watching the shy girl swallow down their sensei after said sensei swallowed Sakura. Then again, part of him didn't really care why he like seeing it, just that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking her over he felt as if he had never seen something so beautiful as this girl as she consumed another person. Her belly was nearly as big as she was tall and Naruto could see the outline of their sensei's form against her skin with surprising ease. If that wasn't enough, Kurenai-sensei had managed to swallow down Sakura before Hinata caught her. Letting his eyes run over that soft skin as it stretched to fit the larger woman, Naruto felt his pants getting tight again as he laid eyes on the circular mound of their sensei's stomach pressing out against Hinata's stomach walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout access to her chakra Kurenai couldn't keep her stomach from ballooning out to its true size. This of course made Hinata even bigger even as she brought Kurenai's toes into her mouth and gave a hard gulp. He watched with baited breath as the last of their sensei was sent down to Hinata's stomach with just a few more swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Hinata that wasn't reveling in the ecstasy of swallowing down her teacher knew that Naruto was watching her. That part also knew that he seemed to like watching her if the blush covering his face was any sign. But, that part of her was tiny in comparison to the parts of her that simply cared for finishing her meal and basking in the after glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the last of their sensei into her, Hinata closed her mouth and gave the strongest swallow she'd ever produced. The feeling of her sensei sliding the rest of the way into her stomach was indescribable. Only eating Naruto had ever made her feel this good and Naruto thrashing around inside of her still beat out her bloated sensei's squirming. She could however, still make out the tiny movements of Sakura struggling inside of their sensei's stomach and that was just enough to get Hinata lost in the feeling of her meals squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face was bright red as he stared at the goddess before him. She looked so pleased, so sated and happy as she rubbed the large wiggling belly that she laid upon. Moving just ever so slightly closer he felt his heart beat double or even triple while hammering so hard in his chest that he was sure that Hinata had to be able to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upon that creamy white skin, he wanted to reach out and touch it, to run his hands over the bulges and shapes of her belly. Forcing his eyes away from the sight that was surely to haunt his wet dreams, not that he knew that part, he turned to look at Hinata's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Hinata?\" He suddenly went ridged when her eyes flashed to him and he saw something in them. Before he had a chance to even consider moving away he felt Hinata grab the front of his jacket and lift him up to her face before she....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura felt wonderful. The day had started out like shit yes but, now she was quite content. Her day started with failing to eat the blond haired baka (idiot) known as Naruto Uzumaki on her way to the academy. Her second attempt to fill her stomach had also ended in failure. Once she had entered the classroom she had noticed Naruto and quickly leaped to consume the blond before he tried to run again. Oddly, Hinata of all people had jumped in her way but, in the end could do nothing to stop the pink rocket as her lips enveloped the poor Hyuga girl. Sakura of course really didn\u2019t care. If Hinata wanted to be eaten before Naruto then hell, Sakura was all for it. The fact that Hinata tasted like the finest treat that money could buy only added to Sakura\u2019s desire to consume the Hyuga heiress. But, Naruto just had to ruin it by punching her, <b>PUNCHING HER!</b> Of all the things that idiot could have done, he chose to make her gage and nearly choke on her half finished meal. Sakura had had no choice but, to release the girl as the baka\u2019s punch had knocked the air out of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura couldn\u2019t help but, grin wickedly as she thought on how sweet revenge tasted. Third time was the charm they say and Sakura had to agree. The class had emptied out no more than twenty minutes after Iruka-sensei finished reading out the team listings. Iruka himself had to leave five minutes after to attend to his other duties. The moment Sakura was sure that Iruka wasn\u2019t coming back she struck. Naruto and Hinata were so surprised by the sudden attack that they had only just risen from their seats by the time Sakura was upon them. The pinkett\u2019s first order of business was to deal a debilitating blow to the blond, and nothing debilitates a boy more than finding a chakra powered kick hitting home. Naruto crumpled quickly, tears in his eyes as he held his crotch. Sakura would admit that kicking him like that had felt really good and she would swear she heard his pelvis bone crack from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata however, moved in at that moment, planning to defend the agony stricken blond. Sakura had different plans however, as she quickly dodged the palm strike and grabbed the Hyuga\u2019s arm. She used this to throw Hinata off balance before tripping her and slamming the shy girl down into the wooden floor face first. Sakura would give Hinata credit though, as the girl recovered rather quickly from having her nose nearly break. Too bad for her that she didn\u2019t recover faster, as when Hinata spun herself to face her attacker, one of her hands had remained around her face, cradling her nose. That cost her greatly as Sakura used that moment to shove her enlarged mouth around the heiress, the lips stopping their descent around Hinata\u2019s chest. With one of the Hyuga\u2019s hands trapped in Sakura\u2019s esophagus along with her head, Hinata stood no chance. Not wishing to tempt fate, Sakura quickly started swallowing the now panicking girl the moment her saliva lubed her enough to go down. With Hinata still stuck with her rump on the ground, as opposed to Sakura who was standing over her, Hinata had no way of stopping her consumer and soon found herself pushing past Sakura\u2019s sphincter and beginning to fill the pinkett\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, now having consumed Hinata up to her rump, quickly raised her mouth up so that Hinata was hoisted into the air. She watched idly for a few moments as the legs kick and flailed at naught but empty air. The moment soon past as she let Hinata\u2019s own struggles help drag her down into Sakura till only the twitching feet and toes of her delicious meal remained. Those to soon fallowed as Sakura threw her head back with a gulp, pulling the last of her meal into her body before sealing her mouth shut the moment those tasty toes past her lips. She repeated the motions with great vigor as an audible gulp was heard by all still in the room, the bulge signifying the last of Hinata quickly disappearing down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gave a loud sigh followed soon after by a wet belch. \u201cBbbbbuuuurrrrrrp!\u201d Sakura allowed her hands to grab the sides of her swaying and squirming gut. Though her stomach was large it simply pushed against her dress, causing it to lift up a good bit but, not so much that you would see the skin. One could however, clearly make out the contours of the ingested girls body as she squirmed and fought the best she could given her new position. Sakura gave her belly a pat and a small belch, not at all discomforted by the fighting of her meal. She soon turned her hungry eyes on the barely recovered blond and licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>20 Minutes Later</u></b><br>\r\nSakura watched as the toes of her blond haired rival twitched a few times before sucking them in and giving a hard gulp. The bulge didn\u2019t have very far to go before it disappeared, as Sakura had made quick work of the delectable Uzumaki before turning her sights on Kiba and Ino. After all, she had still been hungry. Now, she was laying on top of her gut as it gurgled and churned violently at its squirming contents, the organ itself now being big enough that it looked like she was laying on a skin colored bean bag. She felt so content, she could probably still eat a small child half her size but, seeing as those were currently in short supply and she was rather weighed down with something around three-hundred and fifty-one pounds of nutrition-heavy meat she decided to simply be happy with what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing happily to herself she began to rub her gut while rubbing her cheek against her belly, happy beyond belief at finally having something in her stomach to digest. She let her hands run over the bulges her meals made and groaned in pleasure as she could feel her stomach starting to release weak acids that would work away at her meals clothes and skin. She smiled in a wicked fashion as she thought of how much they would thrash around once the stronger acids poured in and started eating at them. She could hardly wait to hear their muffled screams as her stomach melted them alive into a nutritious goo that her body would happily absorb. She was looking forward to Naruto and Hinata\u2019s last moments most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Current time</u></b><br>\r\nSakura had a smug smile on her face as she knew that her meals would soon start to give in to her and her powerful stomach. <i>\u2018Just a few more minutes before they start going limp, and once they do no one not even the Hokage will be allowed to order me to release them.\u2019</i> She thought, giddy at the idea as it was seen as pointless to force a Kunoichi to throw up a meal that has already expired. So pointless was it that it had become a law among Kunoichi that once your meal goes limp or expires, no one is allowed to take them from you, not even the Hokage could order it. Sakura rubbed her loudly digesting belly, the glee she was feeling growing by the second as she could feel her meals movements slowing, weakening. She licked her lips trying to taste the flavors of her meals once more. She was looking forward to rubbing the fact that she ate and digested two clan heiresses and the dumb blond Naruto in the faces of every girl in her graduating class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that a rather haggard looking woman entered the class and looked around, clearly confused at the lack of students. When she asked where they were Sakura cheerfully stated that she ate them and was currently digesting her large meal. The women did not seem pleased by this however as she marched herself up to Sakura and glared down at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Kurenai Y\u016bhi, Jun\u00edn sensei to Team 8. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be Sakura Haruno, would you?\u201d the red-eyed woman asked. Sakura, either not recognizing the dangerous glare Kurenai was giving her or simply not caring due to how close her meals were in expiring gave and affirmative. \u201cYep, that\u2019s me. And if you\u2019re looking for your team, well I\u2019m right here.\u201d The pinkett said, as cheery as could be. \u201cI see\u2026\u201d Kurenai responded \u201cthe team seems a bit lacking in members though. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be digesting your teammates, would you?\u201d the Jun\u00edn asked with a dangerous tone in her voice. \u201cYes I am, I\u2019m also digesting the pieces of trash on Sasuke\u2019s team. Not like these worthless sacks of meat could amount to anything more than wonderful meals for a real Kunoichi.\u201d She said with such certainty staining her voice that Kurenai realized that Sakura truly believed what she had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026 that\u2019s such a shame.\u201d Kurenai coldly said as she began a short string of hand seals.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kurenai finished her hand seals and gently placed her hand upon Sakura\u2019s loudly churning stomach. She watched as her student suddenly went wide eyed and pale before she started heaving and retching, both loudly and violently. Kurenai watched with a cold impassiveness as a bulge slowly formed outside Sakura\u2019s loudly protesting and groaning stomach. The single bulge was soon followed by more as they traveled up through Sakura\u2019s chest and into her throat. Kurenai was hoping that Sakura would at least vomit up Hinata though she would prefer the pink haired girl lost all of her meals. Sadly, Kurenai knew that would not happen as the justu she had used would only force up two students, and due to how the justu worked she would not be able to use it again on Sakura. So if she failed to save her students through this justu, she would have to use her authority to order the girl vomit up the rest or force her to. Kurenai was worried though as she had no idea just how long the girl had been digesting her captives, on top of that she had little experience in using this forced regurgitation justu and thus ran the risk of accelerating the girls\u2019 digestion on the two who were not released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai was broken from her thoughts and worries by the sound of a wet body hitting the floor. Looking she felt a sense of dread form in the pit of her stomach as she saw the red and acid burned form of Kiba Inuzuka, his clothes having been digested to the point that they were nothing more than tattered and sticky strands of thread. The boy was still breathing and would live if given proper medical attention. Kurenai hated herself for hoping it but, she dearly prayed Hinata would be the one to find her way out of the death trap her pink-haired teammate turned out to be. Her prayers went unanswered however, as Ino Yamanaka hit the ground next to Kiba with a hard bang. The girl didn\u2019t look much better then Kiba but, she at least still had some clothing, though tattered cloth and partly digested bandages may not really count toward such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai stared at the two young genin in a mix of horror and relief, relief that she had managed to save two promising ninja of her village and horror because, Hinata wasn\u2019t among the two she had saved. Turning her eyes towards Sakura she saw the girl clutching her throat and coughing while using her other hand to support herself against a wall. Kurenai eyed the girls\u2019 stomach which was swaying gently underneath the pinkett as she slowly started to get her breathing under control and relax. Kurenai saw the movements inside the organic prison and her heart sped with worry at seeing so little movement from her captive students. Kurenai made to move towards Sakura and demand that she release her teammates as well but, stopped as she heard a terrible sound. Sakura\u2019s stomach churned loudly and violently for a moment before returning to a calmer pace as it continued to unleash acids to painfully melt the meat inside it into a nutritious goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai had never felt such disgust for a Kunoichi\u2019s stomach as they digested their captives alive as she did right now. She lost herself for a moment simply glaring hatefully at the organic prison as it continued to peacefully sway as it work away at her other students. A gurgle snapped Kurenai out of her hateful glare and reminded her that there was still time to save them, if barely. She moved quickly to Sakura and grabbed the girl by the shoulder, forcing her to turn. Kurenai opened her mouth to speak but, took on last glance at the girls\u2019 stomach where she saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kurenai couldn\u2019t believe it. She stood there, mouth agape as she stared at Haruno\u2019s stomach. She had turned her pink haired student around and had just opened her mouth to demand that she vomit up her teammates, when she saw the forms inside the girl\u2019s stomach suddenly go limp. Kurenai watched the stomach, a mixed feeling of defeat and hopelessness filling her. She had failed two of her students before she even got the chance to see them. Kurenai felt a need to sit down and slowly walked backwards to a chair before collapsing in to it like a puppet with its strings cut. So deep was she in her self-reflection of her failure that she almost didn\u2019t hear Sakura as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's about time they just died! I swear, I expected the blond baka to keep fighting even past the time he should\u2019ve died but, Hinata surprised me. She was downright delicious but, still. She fought a pointless fight longer then Naruto. Stupid tasty bitch should have just rolled over and died as soon as\u2026\u201d Sakura however never got to finish her sentence as Kurenai, in a fit of rage sprang up and grabbed the girl by her dresses collar. The wind was soon knocked out of Sakura as Kurenai slammed the girls back into the nearest wall with a loud <b>\u2018THUD\u2019</b>. Opening her eyes and looking at her new sensei Sakura finally realized that maybe she had crossed the line with that comment. \u201cListen and listen well you little pink haired monster,\u201d Kurenai began, her voice low and colder the ice the look of disgust and hate burning behind her eyes creating a small spark of fear in the semi-stated Haruno. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone else has to say on this matter; the fact is that you have just committed a crime as stated in the village charter. Now, if you don\u2019t feel like visiting \u2018MY\u2019 stomach as punishment then you will go to the Hokage\u2019s office and inform him that there are some \u2018issues\u2019 with the team setup, you will also tell him that I will explain everything to him once I arrive. You are not to tell anyone who has died in your stomach, is this clear?!?\u201d Haruno opened her mouth to speak, a defiant spark in her eye but, Kurenai would have none of that and slammed her into the wall again. \u201cI said, <b>IS THAT CLEAR!!!</b>\u201d Sakura seemed to get the message and though glaring at her while doing it, she did nod. \u201cGood,\u201d Kurenai replied while dropping the girl to her feet \u201cNow go.\u201d Kurenai watched as Sakura stomped her way out of the room, her belly, which was already starting to soften and round out as her meals slowly lost their form, gurgled and sloshed loudly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Kurenai directed her gaze at the Uchiha. \u201cYou will inform that lazy bastard you have for a sensei that he can find his other students at the hospital.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a reply as she quickly but, carefully scooped up Kiba and Ino before she used a Shunshin (body flicker) to quickly bring them to the hospital. After dropping the two genin off, Kurenai decided that it would be best to get the one person that would be most affected by Hinata\u2019s fate and bring them to the Kage\u2019s office. So with a resigned sigh she disappeared in a flash of Shunshin towards the Hyuga compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Twenty minutes Later:</b><br>\r\n<b><u>Hokage\u2019s Office</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi Hiruzen the Third Hokage was watching the pink haired girl with a curious eye. He had no idea what had happened that Kurenai sent her obviously gorged student to him with a message rather then simply coming to report it herself but, something told him that it was going to cause quite a lot of problems soon. He was soon proven correct as Kurenai entered his office along with Hiashi Hyuga, Hinata\u2019s father and Hanabi Hyuga, Hinata\u2019s little sister of nearly eight years old. Sarutobi groaned, expertly ignoring Haruno\u2019s quite belch as he wondered what could possibly have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurenai please explain to me what this is about? And how it involves Hiashi and his youngest daughter?\u201d Hiashi took this moment to move forward and speak to Kurenai. \u201cI too would like to know why I have been dragged away from my daughters\u2019 teachings, Kurenai.\u201d Kurenai gave Hiashi a look of slight contempt before speaking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought you would\u2019ve liked to have a say in the future of the one you ate and digested you eldest daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went silent for a moment. The quiet broken by the voice of a young girl. \u201cWHAT?!? WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY SISTER WAS DIGESTED?!? I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPOSSE TO BE HER TEACHER!?!\u201d everyone turned to the little Hyuga who was now shaking in both shock and fear of what she had heard. Tears started to build in her eyes as she gave Kurenai a pleading look, as if begging to hear her say that this was some sick joke. Kurenai looked away from the distraught child in shame and began to make her report. Needless to say most of the occupants of the room started to glare at the Haruno, who barely seemed effected at all. No, Sakura was spending her time much more productively, in her mind, as she made small taunts and jeers to Hanabi. She saw the girl was barely holding herself back from charging her with the intent to kill and Sakura was hoping she would as it would mean a second Hyuga snack. As far as Sakura was concerned, if the little girl wanted her sister back then she just had to take a trip down her throat and digest like Hinata still was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage looked gravely at Hiashi before speaking, \u201cHiashi, as the injured party you have say over what to do with this criminal.\u201d He was prevented from saying anymore however, from the shrieking voice of said criminal. \u201cWHAT?!? That\u2019s not fair! I ate them fair an square, you have no right to punish me!\u201d Hiashi however was the one to speak surprising everyone as his voice showed only the slimmest glimmers of hate and contempt for Sakura, a testament to his emotional control. \u201cThat is where you are wrong. If you had paid better attention to the laws you would know that the consuming of teammates is forbidden unless given permission by said teammate or ordered to by the Hokage themselves. On top of this, there is a ruling in Konoha\u2019s charter that expressly forbids the consumption and digestion of clan heirs and heiresses. This law also applies to Naruto due to his value to the village.\u201d Kurenai, not to be forgotten, pick up from there. \u201cYou have not only consumed and digested you teammates without any form of permission or orders but, you have also done so to both, Naruto, a valued village military asset and Hinata, the heiress of one of the most prot\u00e9g\u00e9s clans in the village. That\u2019s three charges right there, all of which have a punishment ranging from lifelong imprisonment to public execution to even forced enslavement to the injured party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura by this time had paled considerable as she realizes that her life as she knew it was over. She silently blamed Naruto and Hinata for being so damn tasty and stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Hiashi,\u201d asked the Kage \u201cwhat sort of punishment should Sakura be given?\u201d Hiashi however turned to Hanabi and told her that she would be the one to choose. The Hyuga munchkin glared hatefully at Sakura and said, \u201cI want\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hiashi looked to his youngest daughter, only slightly surprised by her choice. \u201cAre you sure, Hanabi? You have only just started learning how to consume things as big as your head and with your teacher,\u201d he took this moment to look at Sakura\u2019s churning stomach which by now had lost all the bulges Hinata and Naruto had once made, \u201cpermanently indisposed, you have some ways to go before you could eat this girl when she isn\u2019t so\u2026 sated.\u201d Hanabi turned to her father, a determined and stubborn flare in her lilac eyes. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just learn how to eat her quickly. Give me two days and I\u2019ll eat this\u2026 this, \u201cbitch\u201d no problem.\u201d  Sakura seemed insulted at the bitch comment but, Sarutobi cut her off before she could even begin. \u201cVery well. In three days time Sakura Haruno will suffer punishment of death by digestion from one Hanabi Hyuga. Till that time Haruno will be kept in a secure prison and not allowed visitation by anyone. ANBU take her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that Sakura found herself surrounded by members of the ANBU Black Ops and escorted to a small secured room, were she was chained to a wall by a short set of chains meant to keep her standing the whole time she was there. Sakura huffed in annoyance, she promised herself that she would show that little bite sized snack who was boss and so patently waited for time to pass. The sounds of Naruto and Hinata\u2019s remains sloshing around in her belly acting as her only company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Back in the Kage office</u></b><br>\r\n\u201cWell Hanabi, I wish you luck in your practice. The execution will be a private affair done in the small room Haruno is locked up in now. Will you want anyone with you as you consume her?\u201d asked the aged leader. Hanabi thought on this before deciding against it. She wanted the payback to have a more personal feel to it. Something that would be lost to her if she had an audience. \u201cVery well then. When the time comes you will make your way into her cell to consume her. We will return after a time to check up on you. An hour or two should give you plenty of time to swallow her down and be well on your way to digesting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting soon ended with her father stating that he would have some of the more talented kunoichi in their clan teach her what they can with what time she still had. Hanabi thanked her father but moved to her sisters\u2019 room the moment they entered the compound. Hiashi made sure the clan members knew not to bother her as Hanabi needed this chance to grieve for her loving older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later that Night:</b><br>\r\n<b><u>In Haruno\u2019s cell</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in cloak and mask stepped through the shadows with long practiced ease. He moved quietly and quickly. Removing the guards around his targets room proved easy as a simple push of pressure points knocked them out cold allowing him to silently step inside. There chained to the wall, he saw his target and made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwaken Haruno\u201d he spoke in an emotionless voice, he was one striped of the burden of emotions thanks to his master. A master that now had an offer he felt this girl would find most enjoyable. He waited till the girl awoke and looked at him before continuing. \u201cMy master was most displeased to find you had digested this village\u2019s greatest weapon.\u201d He saw fear enter the girls\u2019 eyes and would have scoffed if he was capable of it. \u201cWith Naruto Uzumaki gone, he has decided to shift his view to others, such as you. My master wishes to make a \u2018deal\u2019 if you will. A bargain that will be seen as favorable for both sides.\u201d He gave her a moment and saw the fear vanish from her eyes, curiosity now taking hold. \u201dI will loosen the shackles that bind you enough so that you can break free and turn things around on your executioner before making an escape. Though my master has already shifted some of his people in place you will still need to make the escape yourself. And you will not have much time after consuming your would be consumer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought on this a moment before asking the obviously question, \u201cWhat do I need to do in exchange?\u201d The masked figure gave a small grunt before responding. \u201cYou will eat.\u201d He said as if that answered everything. When he saw her cock her head to the side in confusion he explained further. \u201cMy master wants a weapon against the other villages. You, or more precisely your stomach, will be that weapon. You will be given special training before being sent out with the goal of literally consuming the other ninja villages and rouge ninja.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a moment to think it over before asking, \u201cWill you accept my master\u2019s most generous offer? Freedom, the right to consume anyone not bearing Konoha\u2019s symbol, and of course making a meal out of a second Hyuga heiress. What more could you ask for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought and thought. This offer seemed like a holy grail to hungry Kunoichi\u2019s but, was it worth it to\u2026 She was snapped from her thoughts by her hungry stomach. Hinata and Naruto now long gone, nothing left of them but, a small layer of fat on her belly and the rest currently collecting in her intestines as waste for disposal at a later time. Sakura licked her lips in anticipation. \u201cTell your boss he has a deal!\u201d the masked man nodded, \u201cLord Danzo will be most pleased.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then the rest of Sakura's stomach bulge seemed to just follow the first one up her throat. <i>'What the hell is... ?\u2019</i> She thought till an idea suddenly hit her. The massive shape making its way up Sakura's throat, and inadvertently making the girl start to choke slightly, was the same shape one would expect a girl with a human meal in their belly to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe Hinata took advantage of the situation to eat Naruto'</i> she thought.

She'd much rather have a team composed completely of girls anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truthfully surprised her to see someone covered in what appeared to be an orange full body suit. The wearer had to be female if the massive stomach they sported was anything to go by, the fact that Kurenai could clearly see two large mounds on their chest once further out, only helped to confirm this. It made her wonder why, much less how, Hinata was completely covered from head to toe in something reminiscent of Naruto's horrible jumpsuit? She watched as the figure, that she was sure had to be Hinata, started grasping at their face the moment their arms where freed from the constricting passage of Sakura's throat. Just as she managed to pull the orange covering down from her mouth, Sakura violently hurled, causing the girl in her mouth to fall hard on top of the stomach that the orange suit seemed to be stretched to the limit of in order to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl slamming on top of her belly like that was clearly too much as with a sudden belch the last member of Kurenai's genin shot out of the orange covered females body and landed at Kurenai's feet with a wet splat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kurenai blinked in shock as she continued to stare down at the naked Hyuga girl. How couldn't she? She had believed that Hinata was the girl in orange yet, here she was, naked as the day she was born with only angry red skin and very light acid burns to show for her time inside her teammates stomach. As happy as Kurenai was to see Hinata was okay, she still wondered who the other girl was. Last she remembered, she was suppose to have Naruto Uzumaki as the only male of the team. Yet, she could see no blond haired boy exiting from the pink haired death trap that was Sakura. So where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close!\" Stated the clearly relieved orange wearing girl. Kurenai wondered just who she was and kept a close eye on her while ripping some of the bandages from her dress so she could make some makeshift covering for the young Hyuga girl. To say she was shocked at seeing bright blond hair and blue eyes on the girl would be an understatement, or it would have been had she not remembered the rumors about this boy developing some kind of anti-pervert jutsu. Still she had a few questions that she had to know the answers to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" The blond girl turned towards Kurenai and smiled while attempting to strip herself of the skintight orange suit. \"Sorry Sensei but, when I'm like this I prefer you call me Naruko.\" Kurenai couldn't help but give the blond a curious look before sweat dropping at the sight of her male-turned-female student complaining about the suit being too tight around her boobs as she tried to free herself. \"Oookay, Naruko then. How are you not, well, digested? And an even better question, how did you swallow Hinata like that?\" Asked the Jounin as she preformed minor medical jutsu on Hinata and kept an eye on the gasping and gagging form of Sakura. Seemed the other girl was in some pain from regurgitating such a massive shape as a Hinata-filled-Naruko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko, who much to Kurenai's shock and embarrassment, gave her sensei a confused look while trying to wiggle her hips out of the tight suit and expose her naked form to everyone. \"What do you mean, <i>'how did you swallow Hinata like that'</i>? I just swallowed her, like any girl does.\" Answer the confused girl as she finally freed her hips and started hopping around while trying to slide the suit off her legs. Kurenai felt like hitting the boy, err, girl for making such a display in public. Didn't she notice how her hopping was causing her rather large, for her age, breasts to bounce and jiggle in front of everyone? Face palming in embarrassment her annoyance only heightened when she heard Hinata give a small 'eep' and faint with a small nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko you realize that a boy shouldn't be able to do that, even if they use the <i><u>'Transformation jutsu'</u></i>? It is only an illusion after all.\" Hearing that Naruko stilled and promptly fell over before sputtering out, \"WHAT?!? But, sensei, if it's only an illusion why did no one tell me I've been doing something wrong? I mean these are rather real if I do say so myself.\" The blond emphasized her point by cupping her breasts. \"No way those can be real Baka! Right Sasuke-kun?\" Came the horse voice of team Kurenai's pink haired member. All she got from the still brooding boy was a \"Hn\" and a scowl before he went back to thinking of ways to kill a certain brother of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so gay. I mean Hinata-chan and I are butt naked and he hasn't even tried to steal a peek.\" deadpanned the naked blond girl who was still fondling her rack. <i><u><b>\"HENTAI! DIE!! CHA!!!\"</b></u></i> Came the obvious response from 'Pinky' as she smashed the blonds face in with her fist, KO-ing the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai ignored Sakura's ranting and refused to acknowledge the out cold naked blond girl who clearly didn't understand the term modesty. Instead she focused on the orange suit. She knew that there where fabrics and materials that were resistant to even a kunoichi's powerful stomach but to have an entire suit of it was very rare, and very pricy... The fact that Naruto had it on as a jumpsuit and that it now took the form of a complete bodysuit said that it was not only custom made but, that it had to have a multitude of seals in it that would allow it to shift and access a stored up chakra that was likely sealed up in some complicated seal array. <i>'There is no way that an orphan, much less a hated orphan with nothing to his name, has the money to make purchase something like this. And if that's not all, he can even perform a true transformation! That shouldn't even be possible; at least I don't think it is...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai had a lot she'd have to think on about this but first, \"Alright, Sakura you are staying here and explaining to Kakashi why he is lacking two students. You will then perform any punishment that he finds appropriate without complaint. Uchiha, you will insure she informs your sensei as this could give him an excuse to simply drop your team completely.\" She ignored the looks of surprise that crossed the only two conscious genin, though she did take some delight in the angry glare the Uchiha sent Sakura. \"If Kakashi asks, I'll be dropping these four off at the hospital. Sakura, I'll be speaking to the Hokage about this. If he doesn't revoke your headband then meet at training ground 16 at 7am two days from now.\" And with that Kurenai and the four out cold students simply vanished.</span></div></div>",

How about some universal law of nature makes it so boys can survive things they normally couldn't, but only as long as they are in physical contact with a female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn example: A brick falls on a boy, the weight crushing him to death. However, when a girl sits down and puts her full weight on a shrunken boy they survive, though it likely hurts them or at least feels extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions:<br>\r\n1) Of course its fatal. The girls can easily digest any boy they eat, though there may be some exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) While painful and likely to cause damage to them, boys aren't so easy to digest. It would take multiple consecutive trips through a girls digestive track to really kill them. Girls are just as liable to keep boys that catch their interest as toys as they are to turn them into easy to swallow meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) While digestion isn't fatal and doesn't cause any real lasting damage, traveling through the digestive track is anything but fun for the boys.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto Uzumaki was looking for food, it was just after sunset in Konoha and he was being very cautious, you see, as far back as anyone can remember, one day suddenly all males have been shrunken in the elemental nations to be at an inch tall, many people speculate that it was an act of Kami, others say it was an extremely powerful jutsu that seems to only effect the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, females were now the dominate gender in the elemental nations. But it wasn't all bad for the shrunken males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the being shrunk males have become somewhat more durable, but only by being in contact with a woman, for example, if a brick falls on a male, the weight from the brick will crush him to death. However, when a female sits down on top of a male and puts her full weight on the shrunken male, the male will survive, though it likely hurts them or at least makes them feel extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso after learning this, the women began to abuse the males in one of two ways, the most common way the women do is, that they swallow any shrunken male they can, While digestion isn't fatal and doesn't cause any real lasting damage, traveling through a women's digestive track is anything but fun for the males. Being eaten is an embarrassing and humiliating experience for the males, and under the right conditions (such as the girl who eats them and how often they get eaten compared to how long they spend outside a girls hungry body.) can leave a lasting stigma on a boys reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the exact reason for why Naruto is to be very cautious as he was looking for food, cause he remembers all to well just how close he was to being inside a woman's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Flashback ---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto was six years old, he was alone, and it was already night and he was looking for some food, and then he saw a piece of dango fall in front of him and since he was so hungry, he threw caution to the wind and he ran to the piece to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a shadow covered him, causing him to look up and he was suddenly snatched up from the ground and he was suddenly in Anko's mouth on top of her tounge, being swished, tasted and also being rapped by the special jonin's tongue and Anko wanted to also enjoy her favorite snack, tied with shrunken males, a piece of dango to go with her prey, so when she opened her mouth, Naruto took that as his chance to escape Anko's mouth and he quickly jumped out of her mouth and began to run as fast as his legs could go, the second he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her little snack was running, Anko got angry and gave chase but Naruto was using his size to squeeze under places that Anko was too big to go through or had to make her go around, and after a while of being chased, Naruto finally lost her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- Flashback end ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Naruto has been very cautious and Anko wasn't the only Kunoichi to try and swallow him though, Naruto has also encountered Tsume Inuzuka, Yugao Uzuki, Kurenai Yuhi, and more and everytime, he's always escaped from each of them before they could swallow him, and soon enough the Kunoichi had put a bounty on his head and the reward to the kunoichi who could bring him to the mission assignment office, the kunoichi in question will get the right to claim Naruto as theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Naruto was out looking for food, someone was looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl named Tenten that had chocolate brown eyes, lightly tanned skin, a perpetual blush due to her young age, and wore a pink blouse, and yellow fastening buttons. She also had bangs that covered her forehead, along with her long, chocolate brown hair being done up in a practical style of two Chinese-style chignon buns, one on either side of her head with them parted by a space between them in the middle so that they resembled the ears of a panda or a cartoon mouse to keep it out her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was after Naruto so she could claim the reward on Naruto's bounty to help get more materials and supplies for her family's blacksmith shop, to see if Naruto's sexual rumors were true or not, possibly see what Naruto would taste like (\"possibly\" being the key word there), to prove that women are just as strong if not stronger than men and to prove that she had what it takes to be a real kunoichi even though she was still in the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one thing that she really wanted to see, was that if it was true or not, was how it was rumored that her target actually respected women, even felt that they could do and take things that men can only ever dream of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard that Naruto felt that the whole men-are-stronger-than-women thing wasn't just chauvinistic garbage, it was ass-backwards! If anything, it was WOMEN that are tougher and stronger than men, as a sheer principle of the laws of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good example of that, from what it had been heard Naruto saying, was giving birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt the reason that WOMEN are the only ones who go through it was simple\u2015they were the ONLY ones with a firm enough constitution to be able to handle it! Hell! Tenten heard that, he even considered the Make-Out Series he had to use as temporary shelter from a rain storm to be complete filth and that \"Toad Sage\" guy that writes them to be an absolutely shameless pig for making women be presented that way, just so he could make himself a few bucks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Tenten had plenty of reasons to want to get ahold of him as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble being, she couldn't FIND him! She'd been at this for hours already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was just about to call it quites, she looked everywhere every shrunken boy Naruto's age would go to, but she couldn't find that blonde Uzumaki boy, but she thought of looking at one last place where she heard that he does go to and when she got to the Ichiraku ramen shop, her eyes widened and used an optical jutsu that her fellow kunoichi-hopefulls were learning to use to find shrunken boys and there he was, naked as the day he was born and sitting near the service counter eating a fishcake that some kunoichi must've dropped. Containing her excitement and joy to finding him she carefully and slowly crept up from behind the blonde Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crept up from behind Naruto, Tenten was mentally chanting to him, 'That's right Naruto, you just keep eating that delicious fishcake piece you like so much, don't mind me, I'm just a curious giantess to you and about to catch you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was close enough, Tenten quickly snatched Naruto right off the ground saying as she did, \"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was instant as Naruto started to struggle desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten blinked. Well...as common as this was, she had to admit Naruto was putting up such a spirited struggle that his capture seemed unjust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly pulling out a spool of ninja wire, the girl looked down at him while saying, \"For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she procceded to wrap him in the wire until he was cocooned in it, up to his chin. And he still struggled frantically. Tenten had to admit, she could see why this little guy was such a handful to capture. He never quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...she had him, now the trick was keeping her hold of him.<br>\r\nTenten smiled as a though struck her and she put Naruto in one of her hair buns and lightly pressed him down into it until he was completely submerged in her hair. She hoped he'd find his place to hide from anyone out to take him from her to be cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now to turn him in to the mission assignment office.' Tenten thought to herself as she turned and quickly ran to the mission office...</span></div></div>",

Their stretchable bodies allow girls to have sex with the much larger males and carry child.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened the classroom door slowly and took a quick peek in. He wasn't late for class or anything. He was just trying to make sure that he wouldn't get jumped and eaten by one of the small creatures in class called girls. You would think that being a whopping 4ft and 7in to their, at tallest, 10 inches would make him feel pretty safe. At first it had, till that day he saw three boys picking on a small girl. The girl was clearly young enough to have not fully shrunken down yet but, she was still nowhere near as tall as the three boys picking on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight year old Naruto had just started to move in too try and get them to stop bullying the poor girl when it happened. One moment there had been the sound of cruel laughter, then next moment there was silence, broken only by the odd slurping and gulping sounds. Then came the screams of panic and fear only to soon be replaced by muffled sounds and a loud burp. Naruto had quickly retreated once he broke from his shock. He spent the rest of the night haunted by what he had seen in his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it, Naruto had to admit that the girl had been rather cute but, that didn't mean he wanted to get that close to a girl now or ever. Seeing that the room seemed empty, Naruto stealth-fully made his way in and moved towards his seat. He kept his eyes open as he had no wish to spend who knows how many hours curled up in some tiny girls gut while being digested. Still, he did find it amazing that something so small could stretch enough to fit something like him inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in his chair his mind started to wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Okay. Now I'm doing this so we can have a choice that will effect the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>First choice:</u></b> Naruto suddenly gets slurped down by a girl. This girl will be Naruto's partner and the only one able to eat and digest Naruto only for him to reform after. This of course means that if he is eaten and digested by anyone else, then he stays that way. How he reforms can be in any number of ways from getting pooped out of the girl, to suddenly reappearing in their bed. But, please lets stick with whatever it is we choose first please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Second choice:</u></b> Naruto avoids getting eaten for now. Being eaten means death and there is no coming back at all! There are no partnerships.)</i></span></div></div>",

He tried to yell but, was quickly cut off by his eater giving him a hard yank, causing him to slip out of his seat and crack the back of his head against his seat. Then again, it's not like anyone would have cared enough to try and help him any way, even if there had actually been others in the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down while trying to block out the pain in his head, he made note that his waist had disappeared and the girl was already slurping down his stomach. Instinctive panic caused him to reach down in an unwise attempt to stop or slow his consumption. Of course all this really did was present his hands to his consumer, who happily clamped down on them and continued gulping him down. He could already feel most of himself having curled up inside the cramped stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he knew it was pointless, he struggled anyway. Soon enough though the lips of his eater wrapped around his neck, just under his head. And the next thing Naruto knew, he was staring at the inside of a girls esophagus, his head crammed into her chest cavity, while the rest of him was packed tightly inside her stomach with only a few locks of blond hair still poking out from her lips. That of course was soon fixed as with a hard gulp Naruto was pushed completely into the incredibly tight stomach. Although he couldn't really understand what she said, he had been in this very position with her so many times that he already knew what she had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to ignore her routine comments about how wonderfully he stretched her stomach and eating giants more often, Naruto attempted to wiggle around and get comfortable. He knew that his partner wasn't going to let him back out now that he was firmly back inside her stomach. At least, she wouldn't be letting him out till she finished digesting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pondered on this and how willing males seemed to be at being digested by their female partners. One would think that digestion was a terrible thing and that any sane human would struggle for all they were worth. After all, to be digested is too die. At least that's what one would think. Instead, it had been found that some males would reappear after being digested. After much study was given into this odd occurrence, people learned that these males had some kind of connection with the girls that was very difficult to understand. All that they knew, even to this day, was that these males could be eaten over and over again only to reform once digestion was complete. However, this only worked when eaten by that one particular girl. Any other girl that ate the male would digest them and the male would not return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had met his partner near the beginning of the academy and she had been making a meal out of him on a near daily basis almost ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is Naruto's partner?</span></div></div>",

What would I do without you to fill my hungry tummy? No matter how many times I eat you it always feels just like the first time. Wonderful!\" sighed the girl in a blissful manner while laying on top of her massive creamy white stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was what you'd expect of a normal Kunoichi nowadays. All girls wore a skintight full body suit that opened around the belly, leaving the girls stomach completely bare. It was the standard outfit that all Kunoichi where given during their time at the academy and it tended to stay with them throughout their years on active duty. Many girls started making small custom changes to the outfit or simply discarded it once they graduated. Hinata however, did nothing to her outfit outside of adding a baggy tan jacket as she quite liked the form fitting outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata licked her lips as she rubbed as much of her stomach as her 7 inch body could reach. She had always love feeling Naruto fill her stomach. From the very first time she gobbled him up she had been hooked. To Hinata, Naruto's flavor was pure ecstasy and the full feeling he gave her once curled up inside her stomach was bliss. Now Hinata simply laid there, knowing that she wouldn't be going anywhere for the next couple of wonderful hours as she digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next twenty minutes Hinata completely ignored everything else as the classroom filled up with students. Her attention was focused completely on her massive Naruto filled stomach as it's occupant wiggled as best he could in the uncomfortably small organ. Hinata giggled in delight as Naruto's movements filled her with an indescribable warm feeling in her heart; and she was pretty sure it wasn't heartburn. Her belly groaned gently as it started squeezing and rubbing against Naruto while weak acids were slowly excreted from her stomach walls. His clothing alone would take her over an hour to eat away, much less the more savory and enjoyable parts of the body. Cooing and kissing her wonderful belly Hinata was startled out of her own little world by Iruka-sensei shouting his greetings to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class. I'm sure all of you are excited and eager to learn what team you will be placed on so you can start your ninja career. So, let's get strait to it. First is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata however, had stopped paying attention as she realized that in her hast to enjoy Naruto again she had completely forgotten that they were being assigned their new teams today. Looking down at her belly she couldn't help but, sweat drop at how careless she had been to forget something so important. Now her team would be forced to wait until she finished digesting and Naruto returned. Her belly simply groaned happily as it continued its slow work of her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh well. It's not like they can blame a girl for wanting to eat right?'</i> She thought just before she heard her name. \"Hinata Hyuga, Naruto Uzumaki and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is their other teammate and sensei?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the girls were gathered in the clearing. They all knew what was about to happen, and how could then not? They've only spent the last three or so years preparing for it. All that time spent learning numerious styles of martial arts, all the exercises in existance and just how they effect the body, strategy and tactics lessons, and most importantly how to gather and channel chakra. Everything they would need to become kunoichi. And now it was time to see if it was worth it, or if the last three years of their lives were wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, everyone was under a lot of stress and trying to deal with it in their own ways. Many were clustered in small groups, nervously chatting. Others were doing some warm up stretches and exercises, trying not to think of what failure would mean. And there amoung them, towards the back, was one girl with a hard look of resolve in her eyes. She knew exactly how she wanted this to play out and she would not settle for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a new figure emerged into the field through the thin stretch of trees that separated the forest from the academy. The wide figure, sporting a large gut the preceded him, was one that was immediately familiar to the girls. It was Iruka, the male teacher of the academy. He spent most of his time instructing the boys portion of the class, but the girls had all seen him many of times when he would emitt chakra for them to practice weilding and gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a stop before them, a rather serious expression on his round face in place of his normal cheerful grin. Seeing that he had their attention, he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the day. Today is the day when you all prove to us if you have what it takes to be Kunoichi of Konoha. This is what you have all prepared for. I trust that you all know what is at stake and what you are supposed to do, but I will repeat it one last to ensure there is no confusion and no excuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way of the ninja is composed of two parts, the way of the shinobi and the way of the kunoichi. Shinobi are the only ones capable of generating chakra, but are incapable of wielding it. Kunoichi are the only ones who can wield chakra but cannot make it. So the two must always act together. The shinobi must train to enlarge his reserves and their bodies in order to hold them, which the kunoichi must train her body to make it a strong as possible and learn to wield to chakra shinobi lend them. The two must always act together to be strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is the purpose of today's test. For the boys to prove that they have the reserves necessary to become shinobi and you girls to prove that you have the strength required to be kunoichi. The boy's half of your class has been scattered throughout the far reaches of the forest, and when the test begins at noon, they will begin to release their chakra into the air. Now, if it were me or another experienced shinobi, you would all be able to feel it easily. But that is not the case here. None of the boys have anywhere near my charka reserves or my level of chakra dispersion skills. And that is where the test begins for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you all should know, certain kunoichi are more receptive to certain shinobi's chakra. The chakra just seems to match the coils very easily. And that is what will happen here. You will only be able to feel the chakra of one of the boys, if any, and that will be the one to whom you are the most allined with, the one who you will work best with. And if the two of you pass, the one you will be paired with for your entire ninja career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My entire career, maybe my entire life, spent together with Naruto,' the girl thinks to herself, further strengthening her resolve with that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first you must pass your exam,\" Iruka continued. \"And to do that, you must follow the chakra they are emitting back to them. As said, they are in the far recesses of this forest, dispersed at random, making it highly unlikely that you will find one of them unless you are following his chakra, feeling it growing stronger as you get closer and using it to speed you on your way as you get closer and the terrain gets ruffer. And don't expect any of them to make their way to you. As I said before, the terrain between them and the academy is very rugged and difficult, in order for them to all get in there, they had to be carrried by kunoichi, and that is the only way they can get out, whether it is with one of you or one of the instructers after the test is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even once you reach one of your male peers, there is still more to the test. We must be absolutely sure that both of you have what it takes to be ninja and that chakra really is flowing between the two of you. Now I know that all of you are more than strong enough to carry a civilian your age over this terrain. But these are not civilians you will be carrying. The boys have spent a long time preparing for this day, strengthening their reserves, so now even the smallest and lightest of them is far heavier than a civilian their age. And as I said before, the terrain is far to difficult for them to cross and the distance far too great for them to cover in the three hours you have for this test. That means that you will have to carry them back here the whole way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The terrain is not so difficult as to stop you, even if you aren't using chakra, but that is only true on the way there. For the trip back, it will be impossible for you to carry them back in time without chakra. However if you can use his chakra, you may very well find the trip back easier than the trip there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To sum it up, follow a chakra signiture to the boy who is emitting it. Then use that chakra that they are emitting to carry him back. If the two of you make it back within three hours, then your ninja careers begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wish you all the best of luck, because the test starts NOW!\" Iruka shouted the last bit, concluding his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls stood still, searching and feeling for any chakra. And among them stood one of them whose eyes held such resolve eariler, eyes now closed, completely focused on the task at hand. For her the rest of the world faded away, trivial and unimportant compared to the undertaking before her. She stood there perfectly still, searching for it. 'THERE!' she thought, her head immediately turning slightly to the left, before she shot off in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore through the foliage, not even bothering to look at her peers or sense, aware only the path before her and the faint energy in the air. Energy she was swiftly gathering, sending straight to her legs, strengthening her toned leg muscles to speed her one her way. 'I'm coming Naruto,' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the subject of the pale eyed heiress's thoughts sat in a field deep within the forest. He had no idea where where in said forest he was, or even which was the way to the academy, but none of that mattered. He had far more vital things demanding his attention and could not afford to be distracted by such trivial thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to focus all his thoughts on the chakra he was emitting and his reserves. He had to make sure that it was enough to be noticed and to lead someone here, but not so much that he wouldn't have any to lend on the way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to ignore everything else in the world, but he could not help himself. He was already extremely anxious when the exam began, and as time passed he only grew more so. He began to fear that he wasn't sending out enough chakra to be noticed or that it wasn't reaching far enough. With a shake of his head, he banished such thoughts. He had to stay focused, he couldn't allow for doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he was started as he heard a rustling in the vegetation around him, and into the clearing strode . . .</span></div></div>",

But on the day of his birth, the Kyubi broke free with the help of a dark pair.  So, using what they had left, they sealed the Kyubi within Naruto, ensuring his fate to be a powerful Shinobi.  His natural chakara reserves were evident soon after birth as he was naturally chubby, but the village elders knew in most every case of a tail-beast container being a man, he would have several partners.  But this fact was not commonly known, nor was what Naruto contained within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood before the sitting Naruto.  She let out a heavy sigh.  She had hoped to find Sasuke, but knew her duty as a Kunochi to work with her partner.  She walked towards her new companion.  Like most other girls, she had not been given much chance to befriend many boys since she started in the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Naruto,\" Sakura said finally.  Naruto looked up at the fit girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, so you're my partner?\" he asked.  He hoped it had not been some trick.  Despite little contact with the girls most of the boys still mocked him, inheriting their parents' hatred of the blond chubby boy.  Only his friendship with Iruka-sensei and his partner Anko-sensei helped him through the loneliness.  Though she still freaked him out at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I followed my instincts and it led me he-\" Before she could finish Sakura turned quickly and saw an equally tall blond woman coming from another way.  Ino's eyes narrowed as she saw Sakura sitting near Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Given what Iruka-sensei had said Naruto had to be the only guy in the area, so why was Sakura here?</i>\" Ino thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forehead,\" Ino said on approach.  Her voice was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bimbo,\" Sakura replied.  She took some steps towards Naruto and put her hand on his shoulder.  Ino put her hands on Naruto's other shoulder.  \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I followed my path to my partner.  Why are you?\" Ino replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as you,\" Sakura said before looking at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me!  I was just happy to have someone find me,\" Naruto confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata cursed herself.  She had tripped on that one root, causing her to lose time in finding her Naruto.  But now she was running hard and fast.  She knew he was right before her and pushed on.  When she entered the small clearing, she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata froze as she entered the clearing, spotting the two other girls standing were standing next to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, you too Hinata?\" Sakura said, growing more confused by the minute. \"What is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was just as confused, but she forced herself to remain calm, she'd spent too much time preparing for this day to let anything screw it up, no matter how unexpected. She raised her hands up, forming the ram seal, \"Byakugan!\" she cried, veins bulging around her pearly white eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Hinata, what are you . . .? \" Ino began before trailing off, growing ever more perplexed. \"How are you . . .?\" She didn't understand it. She was sure that she felt chakra entering her body and leading her here and that there was no shinobi (potential or otherwise) around besides Naruto. So, how was Hinata able to activate her Byakugan? Unknown to her, similar thoughts were running through Sakura's head. And finally, Naruto continued to sit on the ground, so focused and confused by the events around him that he forgot to stop channeling  chakra outside his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata merely stood there for another moment, Byakugan still active and focus evident on her face. Finally she released it with a sigh. \"I just don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, none of us do\" Sakura replied. \"Iruka-sensei never mentioned anything like this in the test, l don't know what's happening here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening is that we're all somehow responding to Naruto's chakra,\" Hinata stated as she walked further into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" everyone else responded in shock, even Naruto stopped channeling chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is something like that possible?\" Sakura questioned, a puzzled look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Hinata responded. \"But when I used my Byakugan I saw that Naruto was the only source of chakra around and that we were all accepting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno lightly scratched her head, still every bit as confused as she was when they started. \"So what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata adopted a determined look on her face as she continued drawing closer to Naruto. She would not allow herself to be weak or indecisive in front of her long time crush, not when there was so much at stake. She'd already spent a great deal of time and effort preparing for this day, preparing to show Naruto how strong and beautiful she was, even if it wasn't happening as she imagined. \"Well we can't just go back empty handed, so . . .\" And with that she knelt down next to Naruto and slid one hand underneath his knees and the other behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, fighting back a blush at the close contact with her crush. She spoke gently, \"Are your ready Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to snap Naruto out of his stunned silence and he gave her an enormous grin as he formed the ram seal. \"Let's go! I've got more than enough chakra for this, believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata easily lifted Naruto with the new found strength of his chakra flowing through her. She turned back towards the direction of the academy and glanced over her shoulder at Sakura and Ino. \"Coming?\" she questioned before jumping into the forest, using Naruto's chakra to propel herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Ino shared a momentary glance as they gave each other a slight shrug before they took off after them, drawing on the chakra Naruto lent to them as well. They soon caught up and found Hinata again with her Byakugan active, navigating through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were partially right. Hinata was using her Byakugan to help move the forest, but only slightly, for most of her attention was focused on the blonde in her arms. She slowly took in all of his features in their exactness. First there were his thighs, round and plump, stretching the fabric of his pants and spreading around where her arm held him. Next she continued upward to his widened hips and expanded butt. She could not help but take advantaged of the situation to take a quick feel, pretending to readjust her grip. Then she came to his chest and plump arms. The large gut spread across his lap and small moobs resting a top it were a stark contrast to the firm abbs the pressed against and the large breasts just above them. And finally she came to his face, his checks plump with thin whisker marks extended across them, and the hints of a double chin forming. And although his eyes were closed in concentration, she knew them to be the most beautiful and brilliant shade of blue. And last but not least, there was his golden blonde hair, shining like the sun. And she found all of these features to be so cute and handsome, for he was perfect in her eyes and his weight felt so right in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted nothing more than to stay with him for as long as possible, and no matter what, she would find a way to make it happen, even if she also had to tolerate Saukra's and Ino's presences. If nothing else, it was just more protection for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they make it to the academy or does something happen to the on the way?</span></div></div>",

The lead girl turned her head to look at the pink-haired kunochi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino and I should be carrying Naruto as well,\" Sakura said, \"I didn't workout for so long just to run back without doing anything.\"  Hinata's face scrunched up.  \"If I was carrying Naruto and you were following, wouldn't you feel the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if this isn't some freak accident and we are forced to work together, knowing how to pass Naruto to each other during a run would be wise,\" Ino added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, would you like to try that?\" Hinata asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, what?\" Naruto said as his ears told him what was just said.  \"Umm, that sounds pretty smart.  I think Iruka-sensei and Anko-sensei would want that.  Hinata bit her lip but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sakura come up on my left,\" Hinata said.  Sakura did as commanded and carefully pulled Naruto into her arms.  Feeling his chakra this close was very pleasant.  \"<i>No wonder Hinata was hesitant to let him go,</i>\" Sakura thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe test entered into the final hour as Anko worked out with her favorite weight:  Iruka.  Using a disc for him to sit on, she bench-pressed her partner as he gave her a little chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anko, someone's coming,\" Iruka said as the first pair was about to exit.  Anko set Iruka down and stood up. They held their faces as four people emerged.  Hinata was in the lead with Sakura to her left and Ino holding the heavy Naruto to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hokage suspected this might happen,\" Anko said, \"We'll proceed with the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon,\" Iruka said smiling up at his muscular lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Senseis,\" Hinata began, \"All three of us felt-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is understood,\" Anko said, \"You four are to follow me now.\"  She turned and started to run towards the village and the Hokage residence.  The three young girls followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some part of the exam?\" Naruto wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Ino replied, taking in Naruto's smell.  It was a nice smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her byakugan active for the first time outside of training with her father, Hinata was looking around and saw Anbu pairs watching them.  What could the reason behind Naruto's attraction be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the entrance, Anko led the three up the stairs before coming before the Hokage's office.  Anko knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter!\" came a female voice.  Anko opened the door.  Lord Jiraiya and Lady Tsunade looked up from their shogi game.  \"I see,\" Tsunade said coldly, \"You may leave Anko.\"  Anko nodded and departed closing the door so the four youngsters were alone with the strongest team in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine you have many questions,\" Jiraiya said coldly.  The four nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do something wrong with attracting three girls?\" Naruto asked, still being held by Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Naruto,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes a shinobi is born with such an impressive level of chakra that multiple kunochi find it matches well with them.  It is rare but not unheard of,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who will Naruto's partner be?\" Sakura asked, \"I found him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think that should give you precedence over the other two?\" Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. Well ... This is just confusing,\" Sakura confessed.  Tsunade nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine so.  But this is how things are,\" Tsunade said, \"So to better train you three and Naruto we are assigning you a special pair for your training Sensei.\"  Tsunade wrote down the location and time.  \"You will meet them there tomorrow at noon.  For now I suggest you retire, rest up, and eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where will we stay?\" Hinata asked, \"Anko-sensei told us we would live in either house together so we can get to know each other better, but with four of us ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just my view, but which of your homes would best fit all of you?\" Jraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a larger apartment next to mine with more rooms in it,\" Naruto noted.  \"We could move in there, if we had your permission.\"  Jiraiya glanced at Tsunade and both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember one crucial fact:  Naruto is providing strength to three of you.  His health is key for you to continue on your paths as Ninja.  You will need to widen him up as part of your training,\" Tsunade said, \"Just between us, Jiraiya was a skinny guy at only 220 pounds compared to the next smallest at 260 pounds but he developed nicely.\"  Jiraiya patted his large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's telling the truth,\" Jiraiya said, \"Now dismissed.\"  The three girls bowed and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't put Naruto down once,\" Tsunade noted when the door was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It runs in his blood.  Kushina didn't set Minato down for almost a whole day,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we go together or alone?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if we all went and packed some stuff up alone it would be quickest,\" Sakura said.  Ino nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.  Now Naruto, what do you have at your place for dinner?\" Ino asked before setting him down.  He looked up at the taller girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramen.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Ramen.\"  Their eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are this large with just ramen?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  All I could afford,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that won't do Naruto,\" Ino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bimbo's right,\" Sakura said, \"So how about we pick up some groceries for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what do you like?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beef,\" Sakura said.  \"Pork,\" Ino replied.  \"Chicken,\" Hinata answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I like them all,\" Naruto said, really trying not to show favoritism between the girls.  They sighed before looking at each other and nodded.  The answer to all disagreements like this could be solved with Rock-Paper-Scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral rounds later, Sakura won and would bring some beef from her home, Ino would pick up the vegetables, and Hinata was in charge of the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in a bit,\" Naruto said, happily before the ladies departed and Naruto walked home.  When he got home, he found his key no longer worked in the lock and a note on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your property was moved next door.\"  Nodding, Naruto went to the next apartment and opened it.  It was much nicer than his small-corner place.  The bedroom, its own separate place with a door to close, was certainly large enough for him and the girls to sleep in.  Now all they needed was three more beds.  They only left one large one in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls moved quickly, none of them wanted to be the last to get back to Naruto.  With their gear packed up, they left and reached the apartment at the same time.  They shot each other friendly glares. This would take some getting used to.</span></div></div>",

Sakura was currently working a wok making some beef stir fry, Ino was chopping up a number of vegitables to make a salad, and since Hinata bought cinnamon rolls for dessert she was busy setting the table, and Naruto, well he was sitting on the couch watching this all happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you girls sure I can't do anything to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looks up from her chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Naruto you just take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face scrunches up in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been taking it easy all day, hell you girls spent at least an hour each carrying my fat ass around Konoha, I want to help. Don't forget I spent a lot of time by my self I know how to do a few things around the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then share a quick glance with each other, and while he was very blunt about it Naruto did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Naruto if your so sure, you can help Hinata set the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it Sakura!\" Naruto cheered before picking himself off the couch and waddling over to Hinata's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls couldn't help but smile a little bit at how eager Naruto was to help them. Being kunoichi they've heard the stories from Anko-sensei, about how through out history, there were shinobi who treated their kunoichi counterparts as personal servants. Ordering them around and threatening to deny them chakra on the field if they disobeyed. Thankfully there were plenty of laws now-a-days to protect kunoichi from such treatment, but the girls were greatful that Naruto would definately not be one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later all four were seated around the table, enjoying the dinner they prepaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naruto what do you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was working his way through his, obviously, much larger servings of food with a pleased smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's awesome Sakura, and Ino I've gotta admit your salad might change my opinion on vegitables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls blush good naturedly at the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? You girls should teach me how to cook, so I can help in the kitchen too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls smile appreciatively at that statment, all three mentaly thanking the gods that they got such a thoughtful partner. The night progressed well, with dessert receiving similar ovations. And the four just sat around and talked afterwards, sharing little bits about their lives before this unusual arrangement started, and eventually they decided to go to bed, knowing they had an early day tommorow.</span></div></div>",

And right now she was concidering the situation in the bed room, sure the bed was definately big enough for everyone but there was little chance of everybody being comfortable with sleeping together, especially with it being their first night together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Sakura turns to see Naruto in his sleep wear, a pair of well fitting orange lounge pants and a white t-shirt that was a bit too small, showing off his plump body fairly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushes a little then turns back to the bed. \"Well I don't know. This is technically your place so I suppose you should get the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you kidding? I'm the one with all the extra padding, I can take the couch and you girls disscuss amongst yourselves about who can get the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet of you Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turn around to find Hinata and Ino both in their own pajamas, Ino was wearing a silky violet camisole, while hinata was in a fluffy set of lounge pants and a white long sleeve shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno stepped forward continuing where she left off. \"But were a team now, lets figure this out together okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno carefully caresses a hand along Naruto's pudgy face, the boy was stunned silent and could only nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, w-why don't we just try sleeping together tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turns to Hinata, surprised at the girl's rather bold, even with the studdering, proclimation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just when we're away on missions we'll have to stay close to Naruto-kun to keep him safe, I f-figure that we should s-start t-trying to get used to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's logic was pretty sound, so with the expected amount of trepidation the four of them were comfortably settled into the bed which surprisingly had some room to spare. At the moment the four of them were trying to fall asleep, try being the key word here, Naruto was especially nervious as he was currently sandwiched between Hinata and Sakura, and he was trying very hard not to squirm to much and accidentally do something one of the girls would think was perverted, even without full acess to his chakra the two of them were still strong enough to give him quite the beating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the night wore on everyone slowly started to relax and just when Naruto was about to fall asleep the felt a pair of arms circle his waist, sure enough Hinata was snuggling up to him like a big teddy bear, not long afterwards Sakura did the same to his left, then just beyond Sakura one of Ino's hands reach over and  touch him too, one thing was for certain, it was going to be a long night.</span></div></div>",

Ten-ten, carry Naruto over to where the guys will be eating,\" Tsunade ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage, I could do that-\" Hinata began before getting a cold glare from the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is going to be in your group, Naruto will need to be familiar with her,\" Tsunade said as she hefted Jiraiya up once more and the women moved out.  Ten-ten walked forward, looking at the obese boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi,\" he said, smiling.  Naruto could feel the glares of the other girls aiming at the bun-topped girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for giving me this chance,\" Ten-ten said, lifting up Naruto and felt his chakra go into her.  She turned and ran after the leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, why did you thank me?\" Naruto asked as he pushed out his chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I failed last year to find a partner.  I was sent to a special squad of others who didn't find a partner but still nothing,\" Ten-Ten said, \"I thought I was a failure.  I'm not the most receptive girl but yesterday I came to your location but I was late and you were gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" Naruto said as the others came into view.  They had stopped just outside the town were a large picnic was set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are my last chance to help protect this village as a ninja,\" Ten-ten said as they arrived.  She set Naruto down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right ladies, move out,\" Tsunade yelled, leading them away from the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, come sit,\" Jiraiya said pointing to an open seat next to him.  Naruto waddled over and took the seat between Jiraiya and an near equally obese Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Naruto,\" Iruka said across from him, \"You know how we taught you to focus on the image of your partner?\"  Naruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now as you eat, you need to focus on all four girls starting now.  Think of no one else but them.  It will be hard to maintain it but you need to do it,\" Jiraiya said.  Naruto nodded and accepted the bowl of dumplings and dug in.  After downing the first two, he looked at the men around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is all my training is going to be?  Eating and thinking of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now.  In time, you will learn to better control who gets more chakra and how fast you give it to them,\" Ibiki said.  Naruto noticed Iruka and Hayate smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the report gentlemen?\" Jiraiya asked the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls are receiving his chakra and the training has begun,\"  Iruka announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grunted as she ducked left to right avoiding the sporting balls being launched at her from her senseis.  The baseballs, golf balls, and softballs flew at her with speeds that could kill a normal civilian.  Sakura was assured she was getting the slow attacks today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up Sakura!\" Tsunade said, throwing one at Sakura's leg.  Sakura jumped into the air only to receive a double shot of baseballs to her gut and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make such unneeded movements!\" Shizune chided, \"You need to make small movements, contain your strength and energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen-ten did not look at her right arm where a blade had scratched on it.  Her sensei was demanding all her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good on defense!\" Yuago said as she continued to press the shorter Tenten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stood in a circle of trees and shrubs.  There were charms all around her and one was activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, feel the world around you Hinata,\" Rin said, \"Look for the marker I set up.\"  Hinata punched in the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How close?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off by a bit,\" Rin said, pointing to one charm that was ten feet above and to the right of the one she picked.  \"You need to clear your concern of all else, including Naruto!\"  Hinata's eyes widened.  She wanted to respond but didn't.  She only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno looked around the genjutsu her.  Gathering her chakra, she pushed it out. \"Kia!\" she called out, dispelling the jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" Kurenai said, \"Now let's make the next one harder to notice when you fall into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only if I do,\" Ino said proudly.  Anko chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do not try to challenge us young lady,\" Anko said.  \"You won't like what you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Anko-sensei,\" Ino said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right now, while the girls were performing increasingly difficult tasks, Naruto was sitting and eating while focusing on the girls his eyes clamped shut in concentration, all the while the men around him would occasionally give him little hints and tips to make the job easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on how they look Naruto picture the girls as clearly in your mind as you can.\" Says Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying Kakashi-sensei.\" Naruto mumbles around a mouthfull of buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that a different form of visualisation is better. Naruto try to picture your chakra as water and the girls as glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Naruto's eyes peek open at Hayate's little hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei I don't think thinking of them as objects is going to help me much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto's right, sometimes the simplest ideas are the best. Naruto just close your eyes and try to tune the rest of us out, Kakashi was right about one thing though, picturing the girls in your mind will help, so try to ignore us for now just focus on eating and your partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found Iruka's advice to most helpful, so taking that advice to heart he closed his eyes again and started back onto his lunch. Eventually he became so focused on the double duty of eating and sending chakra to the girls that the side conversations of the other men around him faded. In his minds eye he could see each girl, their details comeing to him clearly, even though he barely spent a full day with them, even less with Tenten. If any one there was be able to see chakra they would be able to make out several blue streams of energy, tinted slightly red, flowing from Naruto and out to the various training grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'with Sakura'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was the closest to where the men were stationed so she was the first to benifit from Naruto's chakra. At that moment she was doubled over winded and sweaty her pink hair matted to her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girl you can't be tired yet were, only getting started here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura can't help but glare a little at Tsunade and Shizune, the two had been relentless with their baseball pitching and Sakura could tell she was reaching her limit. Then almost suddenly a very familar warm sensation starts to wash over her, starting from her chest and moving outwards all over her body. The fatuige she was feeling mere seconds ago practically vanishes, her breathing quickly became less ragged and a smile starts to creep over her face, she could even feel her muscles grow a little from the sudden introduction of chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\" The pinkette whispered to herself, before she heard the familar and now very hated whisle of an incoming baseball. Then quick as a snake she reaches forward with her hand and catches the ball squarely, before crushing the damn thing like a balloon.  Sakura then picked herself up straight cracks her neck left and right, before taking a ready stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women share a knowing glace with eachother before resuming the exercise. Meanwhile at all the other training grounds similar hapening were occouring with the other girls, Tenten's reflexes picked up to the point where she could block even the difficult to see senbon needles. Hinata's Byakugan surge to full power with the introduction of her male partners chakra making Rin's test boarderline childs play. And while the genjutsu Ino was exposed to didn't dissapear it was now easier to tell the difference between fake objects and real ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course now that the women teachers knew that the girls were now receiving the full benifits of Naruto's chakra, ammeturish was they were, they had to increase the difficulty of the training exercises accordingly, so they started to actively draw chakra from their male partners.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata Hyuga was not a happy camper. Why? Simple, really. She was graduating later today and would need to pass a test to find her partner as new genin. The boys in her class year had been training and practicing for this moment all throughout the last few years. Now even though boys could normally generate chakra of their own it tended to be in such small levels that they could only perform some of the simplest justu. Girls however, were found to be able to generate large amounts of usable chakra and their chakra tended to be even more potent than their male counterparts. You could tell how much chakra a girl generated based on how much fat was on their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was in itself Hinata\u2019s problem. No matter how hard she tried she couldn\u2019t gain much weight. Her metabolism work so fast that it was a battle to keep what fat and in turn chakra stores, she had. She was easily the smallest girl in her entire class, having only a small layer of flab over most of her body, and a stomach, which was her largest feature, that just barley peeked out from under her tan jacket. Grabbing a handful of her soft belly she gave a small smile at how it would slightly bounce or jiggle with her movements. She may not seem it but, Hinata was proud of herself for being able to pass the requirements to be Kunoichi despite the difficulties her own body gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pride however, quickly deflated as she reminded herself that she was in the grey area, the area between being a ninja or living the life of a civilian and if she failed this test she'd have the life of a civilian to look forward to. To any civilian, whom still retain the old methods of dieting as they didn\u2019t produce much chakra, she was over-weight but, to a ninja she was barley even worth the notice. The closet girl to her size was Ami, who was, to Hinata's shame, twice her size. Poking the lump of fat lying in her lap Hinata gave a depressed sigh. <i>\u2018How am I supposed to be of any use to anyone? Yes, my chakra levels are unnaturally large for being so small but, no one would want to be seen in public with someone so small, not when they could have someone like Sakura or Ino.\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Sakura and Ino, who were currently arguing about who would sync better with Sasuke, were the two largest girls to enter the academy for some years. Both were a head or two taller than the others and were the fattest blobs on legs one might ever see. Hinata just came up to the middle of their chest, if she stood strait as a pole and had more than once been completely engulfed by the flabby forms of the two girls. <i>'Those were some of the most embarrassing times of my life, right up there with being told I'd make a better teddy bear to some child then a ninja.'</i> She watched the two girls in a depressed fascination, while her hopes and dreams to be paired up with Naruto Uzumaki seemed to, in her mind, be fading into the realm of un-realized dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki was a blond boy that Hinata had fallen for; when she was younger he had tried to scare off a bunch of bullies that were picking on her. Small and as thin as a stick at the time, he had still tried to fight off the group of older bullies; he had sadly ended up being ganged up on and getting beaten for his troubles. Hinata however, had always kept that moment, that brave and selfless act, close to her heart. He hadn\u2019t even known her and had still come to her rescue. Ever since she had watched him as he struggled to achieve his dream and the rest is as they say, is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata snapped from her thoughts and memories when the girl assigned to test just before her was called to enter the test room. Shaking the dark thoughts of failure to the back of her mind she called up the memories of her mother and the stories she had once told her. Hinata\u2019s favorite stories were about the <i><u>\u2018Three Sirens\u2019</u></i> as they had been dubbed. She had even seen a picture of the three. They were Kunoichi of a dying breed. Each one was able to produce chakra and even use the chakra for themselves, rather than just emit it for their male counterparts to use. This and the fact that they had the slim body-type of Kunoichi in the past on top of their skills in battle had made them legends in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Where most girls idolized Tsunade, Hinata idolized the red-haired leader of the Sirens\u2019; the only person to come close to matching the famed Forth Hokage on the battlefield during the Third Great Ninja War. Her mother never told her the woman\u2019s last name but, she had learned that she was called Kushina. The picture had shown that she had a slender, but feminine build, fair skin, violet-blue eyes, bright red hair - a trait her mother told her was common amongst the members of Kushina's clan - that reached her ankles, with strands that framed both sides of her face and a yellow clip that parts her hair to the left. Hinata remembered how her mother had once compared her to Kushina when she had been a child. Hinata\u2019s face warmed in glee at knowing the fact that her red-haired Idol had started out allot like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had of course learned the names of the other two <i>\u2018Sirens\u2019</i>. The second being a Mikoto Uchiha. The stories about her were far fewer then Kushina\u2019s but, Hinata knew the women was said to be a very gentle and kind woman as well as good friends with Kushina. The picture showed her in casual wear, which next to a battle ready Kushina always managed to get a giggle out of the girl. But, the last of the Sirens had blown Hinata\u2019s mind; for in place of the last Siren stood her own mother, looking as happy as could be, given how exhausted she looked. Her mother had just come back from battle were as Kushina was just being deployed to the frontlines, it was only luck that brought them together at that time, something Hinata was thankful for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was broken from her memories of those stories by a sharp nudge in the side. Blinking about owlishly before hearing Iruka-sensei\u2019s slightly amused tone calling for her from the test room entrance. Hinata quickly scurried down to the sliding wooden doors, a small blush being the only show of embarrassment for not responding the first time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iruka watched as Hinata closed the wooden sliding door behind her at his request before she walked to the center of the small square testing room, shacking the whole way.  <i>\u2018She\u2019s nervous. Hopefully that won\u2019t affect her chakra dispersion or who will pick up on her chakra signature.\u2019</i> Coughing to clear his throat he began the standardized method of test giving.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHinata couldn\u2019t help but, jump slightly at hearing her large muscled teacher cough. She however, shook off the startled look and gave him her undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinata, first let me say that I am proud to see you standing here today, ready to find your lifelong partner and begin you career as Kunoichi.\u201d He paused a moment to let the girl take in his small praise, knowing that since her mother\u2019s untimely passing, that she rarely received any. He had to keep the sadness from his face at seeing the girls\u2019 strong reaction to such small praise. \u201cNow I trust that you know what is at stake and what you are supposed to do, but I will repeat it one last to ensure there is no confusion and no excuses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way of the ninja is composed of two parts, the way of the shinobi and the way of the kunoichi. Kunoichi are the only ones capable of generating large amounts of chakra, but are incapable of wielding more than a tenth of it, which is why you can even use your gentle fist style. Shinobi are the only ones who can wield chakra in vast quantities but, can barely make enough it to perform simple justu, like the Replacement Justu; so the two must always act together. The kunoichi must train to enlarge her reserves and in turn their bodies, in order to hold them, while the shinobi must train his body to make it as strong as possible and learn to wield the chakra their kunoichi lend them. The two must always act together to be strong.\" Pausing to glance at the girl for a moment, he saw a stronger resolve in her eyes then any of his previous female students. <i>\u2018Maybe because, she has something to prove. Not just to us but, to herself. Keep hold of that resolve and you will go far, Hinata.\u2019</i> Quickly pushing down the smile that tugged at his lips he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the first part of your test, we are going to see if any of the shinobi-in-training react to your chakra. If one does than you will join them in completing the second course of the exam, which is given to see if you and your shinobi can work together to complete your objectives. What the second exam is exactly will be explained \u201cIF\u201d your chakra garners a reaction out of any of our shinobi. If not then you will take the solo test to evaluate your skills at a later time. Now I think I\u2019ve stalled you for long enough, so please turn to your right and face the wooden doors opposite from where you entered and release your chakra. If any of them react within five minutes our guest, Anko Mitarashi who was asked to judge our shinobi, will inform us of a reaction. You may begin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath to help center herself, Hinata made the hand sign for \u2018Tiger\u2019 and began to pull her chakra out from within her body and push it towards the door that separated herself from the class of Shinobi and by extension Naruto. She focused herself to the task at hand and kept the images of her beloved blond in mind, spurring her to give it her all. Her concentration broke at hearing the sound of the wooden doors sliding open. A quick glance to the clock over the door showed only three minutes had passed so someone had to have reacted. <i>\u2018Please let it be Naruto!\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly all that she heard was a women\u2019s voice saying \u201cWe gots a live one here. Boy shot up as if something bit him!\u201d Hinata could practically hear the smile in the older Kunoichi\u2019s voice. And with that she was told to return to her class seat as she would be called back to meet her partner after everyone finished taking the first exam.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The victorious ladies sat together while the unlucky ones glared in anger and envy. Their eyes focused on Hinata more than the others as the tiny girl was able to find a shinobi while their bodies of far greater mass failed. Hinata felt even more worried as both Sakura and Ino had passed and they were arguing about who was the one who snagged Sasuke. And once again, Hinata was caught between their massive guts hoping she wouldn\u2019t get smothered to near-death like so many other times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way Sasuke felt you! Naruto would sooner pick Hinata, then Sasuke would pick you!\" Ino yelled at the massive girl. Sakura growled and clenched her fists. \"This coming from the girl whose clan has been feeling out either the Nara or Akimichi clans!\" Sakura yelled back. Ino, shocked at the statement but, not detruded, pulled her hand back to slap Sakura when a soft cough made them all freeze. Turning Iruka was standing there a small scroll in hand.<br>\r\n\"Those who were felt, please come with me. Those who failed please remain. Another chunin will come and speak with you about when your solo tests will be.\" Iruka said. The girls who passed rose and followed Iruka out in single file. They walked down the hallway and stood before a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this room, you will meet your partner. You will also face your second test. Thou the methods used to test you may be different for each person, it is all fairly simple. You just need to not die.\" Iruka said. \"What do you mean by that?\" Ino yelled. Iruka glared at Ino for her outburst causing the massive girl to shrink back.<br>\r\n\"I mean what I said. Your very lives will be at risk and unless you become one you will both die,\" Iruka said calmly. He paused a moment to let this sink into the girls' minds. \u201cNow know that for some of you the test will seem fairly simple where as others may have a seemingly much harder test. You might be asked to run a length of rough terrain or you may need to recover something form a hazardous forest such as the Forest of Death. Know that each will be chosen at random so even we do not know what you will encounter until you do.\u201d He saw the fear growing in their eyes. <i>'Good.'</i> \"Now when I call your name, you will walk in.\" He opened the scroll. \"Ino Yamanaka\" Ino smiled and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it will be Sasuke,\" she proclaimed as she entered. Iruka paused for a moment and glanced about. He noticed one or two seemed to pick up on the faint but powerful chakra use behind the door. \u2018If they can hone that sense, then all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata Hyuuga,\" he called. The small girl walked slowly to the door. Entering she saw blackness. Taking a few unsure steps forward she nearly shrieked when she felt a hand land on her shoulder from behind, but a seal on the floor suddenly glowed bright with power from under them and she saw only white.<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\nShocked and slightly dizzy from the transport seal, Hinata tried to rein in her wobbling body, to no avail. Feeling herself fall backwards she shut her eyes in preparation for the pain to come only to feel a set of strong arms catch her. \u201cEasy now, your still off balance from the sudden shift.\u201d Hinata\u2019s eyes snapped open. She knew that voice it was\u2026 \u201cN-n-naru-uto?!?\u201d she squeaked out, looking into the bright blues of the boy she had hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the smile spread across his face and felt her cheeks grow warmer. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Naruto Uzumaki, future Hokage and soon to be full-fledge shinobi\u2026 with your help\u2026 of course.\u201d  He gave her a quick once over, passing the increased redness of her face off as something else, and took in her feature. Now the boys\u2019 class had spent time with the girls on more than one occasion, the purpose being that they were to learn at least one thing about each possible partner as well as their name. \u201cYour\u2026 Hinata, right? Hinata Hyuuga?\u201d She could only nod as she didn\u2019t trust her voice. She felt him help her stand strait before he moved back a step. Looking her secret crush and new partner over she noticed a change since she had last seen him, all of two nights ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Orange windbreaker jumpsuit was no longer present instead he wore a black long-sleeve shirt with a black vest jacket, the former clinging to his muscled body. Both having dark-burnt orange strips moving horizontally across. His pants were loose cargos with many extra pockets and a set of loops to place scrolls on the outer-side of his left leg. The pants kept with his earlier pattern of burnt orange strips though the lining and edges were also orange. His kunai holster and sandals were a dark blue, almost black; she could only assume that his shuriken pouch was the same. It seemed he had also forgone the goggles he use to wear and now let his hair fall free, causing his blond bangs to cast his eyes in a light shadow. Hinata only thought that it brought the blue in his eyes out even more. He was of course taller than her being about the same height a Sakura and Ino had been. The confident air and feeling of power rippling beneath the surface only served to make her feel even smaller than she all ready was, but, his friendly smile, enhanced by his whiskers, and playful twinkle in his eyes only made her want  to smile and embrace him like she was meeting an old friend. Instead she just blushed and gave a shy smile while tugging on the hem of her jacket and shuffling her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Hinata. Iruka-sensei didn\u2019t happen to tell you anything about our second test did he?\u201d Naruto asked. She simply gave a small shake of her head before noticing where they were. It was a forest of some sort. The trees were larger than any she\u2019d ever seen. She also noted that it seemed rather dark do to the tree covering. \u201cHey, Hinata!\u201d Giving a small <i>\u2018epp\u2019</i> in shock she turned to Naruto who seemed to be pointing at a note pinned to a tree by a kunai. Rushing over to see they both read it over to find it was info on their test.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was happy. There was just no other way to put it. Hinata Hyuuga was happy with her life. She had grown into quite the capable Kunoichi in the last few years. She stood about 51/2 feet tall with long night colored hair falling down her back to just over her rear. Her body had grown slender with curves in just the right places. Her round perky breast had grown even larger with the knowledge of her soon-to-be second child. She had of course fought her body every step of the way to the current point in time in order to retain her thin layer of fat and pudgy belly. She didn\u2019t know why but, any questions that plagued her mind were silenced at the fact that her husband, the 5th Hokage Naruto Uzumaki just seemed to love fondling it during their private times together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a casual light purple kimono befitting the wife of a Kage, she was currently walking into a meadow to join her Husband and their first born child in a picnic. They just loved their little girl. Five years old with light blond hair and cream colored skin, little Shion Uzumaki was loving bundle of energy. Her lavender eyes that held just a hint of blue to them always seemed to sparkle in joy when with her parents were there. Hinata was grateful that she had been Naruto\u2019s chosen partner all those years ago. The adventures they shared, the love that grew between them\u2026 She snapped out of her musings when her little girl latched on to her leg and giggled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picnic went by in a blur, laughing and smiles as they watch Shion chase the butterflies and she traded fond memories with her beloved. However, it all changed from wonderful dream to horrible nightmare when she heard him say those hurtful words. The words he spoke held such cold resentment that she felt like she had been dipped in ice. \u201cWhy would I want someone like you as my Kunoichi? We nearly failed the second exam because of you being so weak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with shock and hurt clearly on her face. \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Turning she saw her father looking at her with cold hate. \u201cYou worthless daughter of mine. You shame the clan and your parents with your weakness!\u201d Each word felt like an ice-cold knives being driven into her heart but, it was his next words that filled her with dread. \u201cFor your shameful weakness I hereby brand you with the Caged-bird seal.\u201d A pain on her forehead made itself known causing her to cry in pain and agony at the branding. Whimpering pitifully she looked to her husband for help but found only the cold stare of her father in his place. \u201cI saved you\u2026 over and over again I saved you\u2026Do you know why?... Because, if I didn\u2019t then the village would strip me of all shinobi related rights. In the end you were only a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of pain and disbelief ran down her face now and only turned her gaze at the sound of small footsteps. <i>\u2018Shion\u2026 surly my own daughter wouldn\u2019t hate me so\u2026 would she?\u2019</i> Hinata had her answer as she looked into the cold hateful eyes of her dear daughter, the Caged-bird seal on her forehead standing out against her pale skin. \u201cI hate you Mother. I wish father never saved you from those plants in your exams!\u201d her little girl sneered and spat out <i>\u2018Mother\u2019</i> like it was something vile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018No\u2026 No\u2026 this \u2026 this isn\u2019t right. I\u2026 I haven\u2019t\u2026\u2019</i> Hinata was never given the chance to finish her thoughts as a sound that she thought she would never hear again made its way to her ears. Turning she could only raise her arms in a feeble attempt to ward of the thing she found looming over her. She screamed in horror and despair as it lunged, enveloping her in one bite.<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\nHinata snapped awake and nearly shirked in terror, instead she chose to gage on the scream that wished to be let loose and simply started to quietly sob to herself. Shaking at what she had seen in her nightmare and hugging herself for comfort she simply cried into her black and orange striped pillow.<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nNaruto was tired. Even he could get worn down with all that had been happening. So they had decided to sit and rest in a tree branch. Naruto sat, his mind quite, senses sharp for anything that might be a threat. He had learned to be a light sleeper if he was guarding something. Something he had learned to do thanks to Iruka-sensei and Anko\u2019s aid. He sat with his back to the tree, Hinata safely in his lap and held close. His short nap was interrupted when he felt Hinata suddenly stiffen. His shirt grew wet, having given his vest to Hinata as a makeshift blanket. He could feel her quite sobs as she curled into herself. <i>\u2018Nightmare most likely. Then again, I\u2019d like to see someone be eaten five times by plants in four hours and still be able to get a good-night\u2019s sleep.\u2019</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning at his uncertainty of what to do he decided to simply give to her what he had always wanted when woken by a bad dream. Wrapping his arms around her in comforting manner, or what he hoped it was, he started to rub her back and rock slightly here to there and whisper that everything was alright, that she was safe. He lost track of how long it took for her sobs to subside but, was happy to see that she had fallen back asleep while clutching him tightly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a small smile grace her face as she soon started to nuzzle his chest, he sat back and wondered <i>\u2018why?\u2026 why do I feel such a need to comfort her? Why does seeing her in any kind of pain make my heart hurt, or make me wish to beat whatever or whoever hurt her into paste? I know this isn\u2019t just about her being \u2018my\u2019 Kunoichi\u2026\u2019</i> Glancing at the cute chubby face of the girl in his arms he brushed a loose bit of hair from her face and wondered, <i>\u2018Just what sort of hold do you have over my heart Hinata Hyuuga? Why do I feel that you could either keep my heart safely tucked away or just as easily crush it to dust in your hands? Guess I\u2019ll just have to find out for myself, huh?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he leaned back against the tree and slept, his dreams filled with images of the girl in his lap and her scent of lavender with a hint of sandal-wood.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<u><b>*In the office of the Hokage*</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old balding man sat in his chair, biting on the end of his pipe as he watched the video of near mishaps of his favorite blond-haired prankster. <i>\u2018I glad we placed those special seals on to the back of those map pieces. Had we not then I\u2019d be even more worried than I am now, about those two\u2026 hmm\u2026 maybe sending them to a chakra eating forest wasn\u2019t such a bright idea after all.\u2019</i> He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith how dense the girls\u2019 chakra is on top of her unnaturally large reserves, coupled with her small size, I can see why they are being tracked by the more aggressive Flora.\u201d He muttered as he watch the poor Hyuuga be eaten for a fifth time, this time by a pod like plant that had waited till Naruto was too far to hear her be caught as it sprung down right on top of the girl only to shoot back up to its resting place, the girl trapped inside with the acids soon to come. He watched with baited breath as Naruto search everyone of the venues flytrap like plants for his chunky kunoichi. <i>\u2018The only reason she survived that encounter was due to a drop of acid-slime landing on his vest. Had that not happened\u2026 Uhg\u2026 I don\u2019t even want to think about how I\u2019d break it to her father. For all the shit he\u2019s forced to put her thru he does care deeply for his little girl.\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiruzen Sarutobi, the Sandaime(third) Hokage, could only hope that the man would be prepared to do what was needed to keep his first-born daughter safe. If worse came to worse, Hiruzen had the betrothal papers for Hinata and Kushina\u2019s son, Naruto ready. That would force the Hyuuga clan elders to back off or risk a clan war, in which he would give Naruto his full support.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They awoke hours later with Hinata blushing a bright red at having spent the night in her \u2018secret\u2019 crushes arms. Naruto had soon surprised her by performing an advance clone justu known as <u>\u2018Shadow Clone\u2019</u>. It surprised her because such a justu would require large amounts of chakra, chakra that she had not supplied him with. Naruto had quickly explained how he seemed to have larger amounts of chakra then most males in his body and that allowed him some major advantages in justu and chakra use. Though, Hinata did find out that he couldn\u2019t make more than three at a time before collapsing from chakra exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching him send out his clones to secure some food, they silently gathered some firewood. It turns out that they didn\u2019t even need to send the clones out as they were attacked by a group of large brown chakra bears. These bears were a lot like vampires, only for chakra. They would drain a target of their chakra by merely being near it then when its prey was too weak to fight back it would tear into its flesh. The smallest of the three was sadly a full foot taller than Naruto, when on its hind legs, were as the largest towered over poor Hinata, making her feel like a flea fighting a giant. Naruto had dispelled his clones and re-summoned them to fight this new threat; thankfully it didn\u2019t take too long for Naruto, with some aid from Hinata, to take down the three would-be predators. This led to them quickly setting up a fire and Naruto clones skinning and gutting the smallest bear for food, the other two already sealed away for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Naruto and Hinata had had their fill three-fourths of the bear was gone. Naruto had had a good portion of its meat but, Hinata had eaten so much that her stomach was three times the size it had been before eating; unknown to Naruto this was due to a special justu for Kunoichi to help put on more fat and increase their chakra reserves. For the next hour they just sat there as Hinata laid back groaning, as she had never eaten so much at once, while her stomach tried to break down its large meal. Naruto sat with her, and at her request was rubbing her overstuffed tummy to try and help it along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time skip: hour and a half later</b></u><br>\r\nHinata was feeling better now that she wasn\u2019t overly stuffed, her stomach having shrunk down by a quarter of its size and was still working on its\u2019 meal. After Naruto sealed the rest of the bear meat away they had began looking for the rest of the map fragments and had found them, rather quickly to their surprise. They then started trying to put the map pieces back together and found that when the proper sides connected they would latch together and meld into one piece. After they completed to map it showed where they were in correspondence to where they needed to be, so they set off to the very center of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time skip: Hours later</b></u><br>\r\nIt took most of the day to get around the plants and animals before making it towards the center of the forest. Hinata had grabbed a quick snack behind Naruto\u2019s back in the form of a small rabbit; she had used the justu for kunoichi and swallowed the poor thing down without killing it first. She was just glad Naruto didn\u2019t notice the odd movements of her stomach or passed it off as her stomach simply finishing off the last of the cooked bears meat from earlier. She swore to herself to never tell any of the other kunoichi about swallowing a rabbit whole, the last thing she wanted was for the others to get ideas on how else to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling Naruto stop moving, as he was still carrying her, she notice that they had stopped on the edge of a clearing, one filled with a very rare sight. A cave stood on the other side of the clearing but, between them were a pack of beautiful white-tigers who were lounging in the clearing. Hinata counted 7 tigers total. Two cubs playing off to the side, judging from the small size and speed built structures of their bodies two of the adults were male and the other three large and powerful looking ones were the females. White-tigers were very rare, so much so that to kill one warranted a punishment near equal to that of treason, and not just in Fire country but, all of the nations with Hidden villages held the same ruling. There were, of course, exceptions to this rule, like if you are being attacked by them and cannot get away without it, then you are still punished thou not as severely. That however was not the thoughts on Hinata\u2019s mind, no, the only thing on her mind was that these seven tigers could be the last of their kind in the five great nations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They sat there for a few minutes, just watching the rare sight before them. Hinata had once seen a white tiger cub up close when she was a little girl. It had somehow gotten in to the village without being noticed but, instead of being scared of it, Hinata had at the time, tried to pet the <i>\u2018pretty kitty\u2019</i> as she had called it. If someone was to ask if see was scared of tigers from that encounter she would say no, and that now her two favorite animals were foxes and white tigers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Hinata.\u201d Turning her head to look at Naruto she saw he had their map out and he was pointing towards the cave. \u2018That can\u2019t be good.\u2019 \u201cWe need to get inside that cave, any ideas?\u201d She bit her lip in thought and took a look around. \u201cW-we could try to s-sneak arou-und.\u201d Looking towards the sky she saw that night would soon be falling that would be the best time normally for stealth, but this was against tigers. Stealth may just not be possible here. \u201cWell, I do have a second idea if you want to try it.\u201d He said while pulling out five sticky notes with seal designs on them. Perplex she asked, \u201cWh-what do those do, N-naruto?\u201d \u201cThese are paralysis and restraint seals though I only have enough for the adults. It won\u2019t hurt them but it needs to be stuck to their heads to work.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment to weigh the pros and cons of both they choose to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that a surprise attack would likely work better than trying to sneak around a group of natural predators they went about making a plan. Hinata would deal with the two cubs as she could do so without killing them, were as Naruto would slap the seal tags on as many of the adults as possible with the use of Shadow clones. These clones would be powered by Hinata\u2019s chakra as Naruto didn\u2019t have enough to make them and fight off the tigers at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on his stomach, to give the most stable connection, Hinata poured her chakra into Naruto while trying to stop herself from indulging and rubbing his abs. Naruto with his eyes closed focused on her chakra, and molding it into the proper shape for his clones. He let it gather within him before performing the hand seal for his justu, and with a thought of 'Shadow clone justu\u2019 Hinata found herself nearly surrounded by the five Narutos\u2019. <i>\u2018So many Narutos\u2026\u2019</i>Feeling faint she pushed it away with a surprising amount of determination and forced her blush down as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Naruto quickly passed one seal-tag to each clone and with a quick nod to each he and his clones seemingly vanished. Confused at his sudden disappearance as well as slightly disappointed at no longer being surrounded by her blond crush, Hinata looked to the clearing just in time to see the five Naruto\u2019s land right in the center of the five adult tigers. She leaped down to the edge of the clearing, drawing the attention of every tiger strait to her. She froze for a moment in fear only to see Naruto spring into action. Before the tigers could even figure out what had happened Naruto clones had already slapped three tags onto their targets before dispelling themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watched as the last two, a male and the alpha-female from the looks of it, managed to scramble away from Naruto just before the tags could be placed on them. She saw the male jump at one just for the blond to duck; this however meant that the tiger would land upon the Naruto whose back was facing it. Moving to run and warn him about the tiger she realizes only after that she had forgotten something important. Two something\u2019s, both of which slammed into her from the side and behind.<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nNaruto had just dodged the tiger only to feel the memories of his last clone hit him a few moments later. The clone had managed to turn around and slap the tag onto the pouncing tigers\u2019 nose just before the tiger slammed into it, causing it to dispel. Turning, he faced the last of his feline foes.<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nThe white tiger did not understand this human. It wore the colors of its cousin kin yet, didn\u2019t hold the scent of their blood on him, nor did it kill her pack as she could see that they still breathed.<i> \u2018What could this human want? Is he after the summoning contract for Byakko and his kin?\u2019</i> this thought worried the tiger as well as angered it. <i>\u2018If these humans think they can take our contract by force then they are mistaken, and when they fail they will know that I, Tengantsuu (clairvoyance), Last of Byakko\u2019s earth realm kin was the one to stop them.\u2019</i> The tiger now known as Tengantsuu, gave the equivalent to a smirk at the end of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes she pounced and clawed at the human in her cousin kin\u2019s colors, only to never land a blow. She had seen the odd papers on her pack mates faces and knew that if this human did the same to her, then they would be at its mercy. Readying herself for another try at the human she paused at seeing movement from the corner of her eye. Chancing a glance her heart nearly stopped\u2026 <i>\u2018Human\u2026female\u2026the cubs!\u2019</i> and with that she turned to deal with the human that would dare endanger the cubs of her pack.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nWhen the weight of two tiger cubs slammed into her she had at first been terrified. That feeling had passed however, as they started licking her face and nuzzling against her. Next thing she knew she was wrestling with the two cubs and mimicking their growls. She now found herself lying on top of the male cubs back keeping it from getting up while the female cub was stretched out with its stomach on her back keeping her down. Looking at the face of the girl cub, Hinata would almost think that it was giving her a smug smirk. Hinata giggled, she was having more fun with these cubs then she could remember having in a long time. This changed when she saw the alpha-female charging at them with her fangs bared. Luckily Naruto appeared in front of the tiger and managed to slip the tag on its face, right on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Time skip: 15 minutes later</b></u><br>\r\nHinata had continued to play with the cubs but, she was still worried. After catching the alpha, Naruto had simple sat down on a small rock making him eye level with the tiger and proceeded to do nothing but, sit and stare in the eyes. She paused in her wrestling with the cubs when she saw him pull out a scroll and open it. A poof and the leftover meat from one of the chakra bears was now sitting before the alpha. At the appearance of food the cubs had quickly hurried over to the pile of fresh meat and began to dig in. Hinata watched in fascination as Naruto looked the tiger in the eye once more before suddenly ripping the seal off of its forehead. Stiffening a gasp, Hinata ran over as fast as she could to stop the tiger from attacking her Naruto, only to stop when he turned to her and gave a small shake of the head.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nTengantsuu watched the human curiously, as he ripped the tag from her head. As she saw him turn to look at the female, <i>\u2018His mate maybe?\u2019</i>, she knew that right then would be the best time to strike but, something held her back. After staring defiantly into this humans eyes for so long she felt a\u2026 connection to him. As if they had simple been two animals who meet each other and had a friendly, if slightly tense, conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the cubs, she saw not a scratch on them and that they seemed happy with the playing they had just done. Turning to move towards the others of her pack she walked slowly, glancing over her shoulder every so often to ensure that the cubs were safe. Hearing the sound of movement she turned her head the other way to see the male human moving towards her frozen pack only to stop and turn to face her as if waiting for her. After a few minutes of speaking to her pack with the human far enough behind her that she felt comfortable, she turned to him with an excepting gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human happily took this as his queue and started to remove the tags from her pack mates. They took the next few minute to simple sit or stand in most case, near each other while watching how the cubs tried to pull the human girl into another game of chase and pounce. During this time Tengantsuu started to think that maybe these humans were more trust worthy then she first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Basic idea of how Hinata looks after eating <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=\" target=\"_blank\">http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=</a>\u00a7ion=&amp;global=1&amp;q=chubby+hinata#/d4p6iq1 )<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the cubs had thoroughly tired themselves and her out she had stayed with them, petting their warm fur as they purred as best a tiger could to the gentle strokes of her hand. But now she and Naruto were making their way through the cave, looking for whatever they needed so they could leave the forest and pass their genin test and earn their headbands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the back end of the cave they saw a wooden door. Opening it they saw a small closet, it was tall enough for Naruto, if he didn\u2019t mind his head touching the ceiling, and was wide enough for Hinata to squeeze into if she tried. Half of the closest was occupied by the white marble block, making it stand out in the darkness of the cave. Upon the block was a scroll and a book. The scroll looked as ordinary as could be. Tan scroll with black edge-borders, but, written in the center was what made the scroll so special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\u201cA Shinobi guide to battle\u201d</u> written by Minato Namikaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a scroll written by the Forth Hokage himself. This of course caught Naruto\u2019s attention right away as he nearly made a grab for the scroll. Hinata however, smiled at her crushes wish to learn more about his hero, she only wished she could do the same. Looking at the book she saw it was a dark-red, nearly brown in color, hardcover book with a latch on the side using what looked like a seal for a lock. It was however the title and name of the author that got her attention.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<u>\u201cSong of Sirens: A Kunoichi Guide to better themselves\u201d</u> Written by: The Scarlet Siren, Kushina Uzumaki<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Hinata gasp as the revelation that her hero Kushina, if it was the same one, was in fact a relative to the very boy she was partnered to. <i>\u2018Relatives of two sirens as a ninja pair. But what is Naruto's connection to Kushina? I know that she died fighting the Kyuubi and even pieced together how she was killed. Mother confirmed it and even told me how her body was found in the Fourth Hokages' arms, suggesting a possible relationship outside of being a pair... Naruto... Naruto couldn't be their... child?!?... Could he?\u2019</i> she wondered, as her hands trembled, wishing to take hold of this piece of history and learn from it. The fact that it came from Kushina herself would give her more insight to the woman' life then any text book or ninja record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she took notice of the wooden plank set on the wall between the scroll and book. On it was a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunoichi and Shinobi,<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not dead!?! Well, a congrats are an order for making it here. But, before you even think that you are done you have one last test. Lying before you are a number of items chosen by the Hokage themselves. Your job is to choose only one. The item you chose will from that point on belong to the two of you. Think of it as a reward for not dying. What you do with your chosen reward is up to you but, the moment you grab hold of one you will both be sent back to the Kage tower where you will receive instructions on where to gain you new headbands and start you careers together. So congrats genin and just remember this piece of wisdom on you first mission. <b>\"Just don't die!\"</b><br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Office of the Hokage</b></u><br>\r\nHiruzen Sarutobi was watching with baited breath. They needed an item to show that they had passed their exam and either the scroll or the book would work. <i>\u2018Their choice here will have a major impact on their future. Minato\u2019s scroll will aid Naruto greatly and if he can crack the code maybe even learn his fathers\u2019 prized justu. Sadly, the same can't be said for Hinata. The book however, is a different matter.\u2019</i> Sarutobi sat back in his chair taking a puff of his pipe; his eyes never left the viewing globe. <i>\u2018Kushina\u2019s book can only be opened by an Uzumaki, or someone tuned to one, like Hinata. The book should contain training methods for kunoichi as well as sealing methods for an Uzumaki to learn. Her ken(sword) justu style might even be in those pages and since the other two Sirens helped to make the book into a trilogy, who knows what else they might find.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at seeing how the two were talking, trying to figure out which one to take. <i>\u2018No matter which one they take someone will become a legend, but the question is will only one of them benefit or will they both?\u2019</i></span></div></div>",

But more than that had happened in the short time between their return and now. Clutching a small dark-red hardcover book to her chest Hinata pondered on the things the Hokage had told them and the things he had simply hinted at, but most of all she wondered what it was the Sandaime Hokage had wanted to tell Naruto without her there. The thought both depressed her a bit and intrigued her. <i>\u2018He already told us about Kushina and how she was in fact Naruto\u2019s mother as well as the connection to the land of Whirlpool. *sigh* I still can\u2019t believe that I was right. That Naruto\u2019s mother was Kushina, the Scarlet Siren, The Queen of Storms and The Bloody Whirlpool. On top of that Naruto is so kind and gentle, not to mention so warm.\u2019</i> Her face flushed a bright red at that thought as it brought up how she had spent her time asleep wrapped in his arms. Smiling at the memory she silently hoped he wouldn\u2019t mind if she slept in his arms every night they were together. Blushing brighter she speed up so to get home quicker, it wouldn\u2019t do to faint in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Hokage\u2019s Office</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had been annoyed at how the Old man had simply sent Hinata home on her own so suddenly but, now after hearing what he had to say, Naruto felt he understood why. His face was hidden in his hands and his body slumped forward with his elbows resting on his legs. Here sitting before the Hokage Naruto felt so lost. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Naruto but, I felt that you needed to know this now rather then find out on your own or from someone else later.\u201d The words came from the old man sitting behind his desk, hoping to give the young boy before him some comfort no matter how small it may be. The blond spoke up, choking on the first few words as he tried to come to terms with what he had learned. \u201cI-it\u2019s all right Old Man. I, it\u2019s just some much to take in. My mother was Kushina Uzumaki, the last known member of the Uzumaki clan from the village of the Swirling Tides. And if not for her, the Forth would never have been able to stop the Ky\u016bbi, the very creature sealed into my body. Then there is the whole honoring my family thing with the symbol of the Swirling Tides village on the back of every chunin and Jounin vest, yet this village treats me so poorly because of the same burden my mother carried. My emotions are all over the place. I\u2019m happy that I finally have some knowledge of my parents even if it\u2019s only about my mom, but I\u2019m angry at this village. My mother died to save it and to save me, her crest is on the vest of most of the ninja forces of our village yet, I\u2019m treated like shit. Yet, I still love this village if for nothing else then the fact that my parents loved this place so much and because like mom I\u2019ve found my partner. I-I need some time to think Old Man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi looked at the young boy before him and couldn\u2019t help but, feel guilty about putting so many burdens on to this one person. He knew that there were even worse burdens that would in time come to bear down on the boy but, he would give the boy as much time as he could before Naruto had to face them. Sadly one such burden was rearing its ugly head sooner then he would like, but maybe some good news first. \u201cVery well Naruto. Take some time to relax and sort it all out before you meet your assigned sensei.\u201d Reaching into a draw he pulled out a shiny new key as well as a copy with a note attached. \u201cHere you go my boy. Do enjoy your new home.\u201d And with that he tossed the items toward the blond who caught them with a confused and bewildered look. The old leader merely chuckled before answering his unspoken question. \u201cConsider it a graduation gift from an old man, besides most partners tend to live together. You couldn\u2019t do that with your old apartment and yes <b><i>\u2018all\u2019</i></b> of you things have been moved there already.\u201d The blond sputtered and blushed as he realized his secret storage area under his floorboards weren\u2019t so secret after all. A thought occurred to him that made him blush even more. \u201cWait, Old Man. Live together as, as in\u2026\u201d The old man in question merely gave an innocent look as he spoke. \u201cWhy yes Naruto. Together. As in you and your female partner living under the same roof, sharing the same space and maybe even the same bedding if you follow the footsteps of most partners.\u201d He took a moment to watch Naruto\u2019s face turn so red he could swear the whole village might see boys blush. <i>\u2018Now for the clincher.\u2019</i> \u201cBesides Naruto, how do you think your mother and father had you? They were partners and were quite happy to be able to spend time together\u2026 alone\u2026 where no one could see what they were doing.\u201d Seeing the poor boy rush out of his office faster than you could say \u201cFree Raman\u201d sent the old man into a fit of laughter as he hadn\u2019t been lying at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Hyuuga Compound</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was cursing herself for not paying attention when she entered her home. As soon as she had removed her sandals and started walking towards her room she was attacked. She had only the sound of small feet thundering down the hall strait at her to act as a warning, and only a few seconds worth at that. Shifting her stance as to try and brace herself was futile as a small blur slammed into her, knocking her to the ground with a loud \u201coof\u201d as the air was knocked from her lungs. Lying on her back and staring at the ceiling for a moment Hinata looked down towards the little firecracker that had just bulldozed her. She saw a little seven year old girl, with long dark brown hair and large, white eyes with a hint of lilac in them. The little girl who was burying her face in Hinata\u2019s bosom, was Hanabi Hyuga, Hinata\u2019s little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt Hanabi mutter something into her bosom. Sighing with a smile on her face Hinata forced herself to sit up before scooping the little girl into her arms as best she could. Hanabi immediately latched herself around Hinata\u2019s neck and hugged her. Hinata knew it was from Hanabi missing her and Hinata really didn\u2019t know how long she had been gone, the Sandaime had told her that time seemed to move differently in the forest they went to. For all Hinata knew, she could have left Hanabi alone for only a few hours to maybe a few weeks. She simply sat there for a few minutes, holding Hanabi close before picking up the book Naruto had asked her to hold on to. Securing Hanabi in her arms, Hinata stood as started to once more walk to her room; she was however stopped once more but, this time by her father. \u201cHinata.\u201d Stopping, Hinata greeted her father as best she could seeing how she couldn\u2019t bow in respect with Hanabi in her arms. \u201cF-father. Hello.\u201d Standing before her at 5feet and 9inches of lean muscle was Hiashi Hyuga. He was wearing his traditional, loose fitting robes with a long-sleeved, brown haori, his long dark brown hair hanging freely behind him as he looked over his chunky first born daughter. \u201cI trust your partner was able to keep you safe during you exams?\u201d  \u201cY-yes, father.\u201d \u201cGood. At least you have a capable partner, try not to cause him too much trouble.\u201d He ignored the downtrodden look of his eldest and focused on his youngest daughter. \u201cHanabi, you know you have shown a great deal of disrespect to Ko by running out of your training session without approval. You will be punished later thou, for now go and get washed up before coming to dinner.\u201d And with that Hiashi left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Hanabi, Hinata now noticed that she was still in her training clothes consisting of a sleeveless, blue v-neck shirt, with mesh armor underneath and blue shorts and sandals. Giving the curious looking seven year old a kiss on the forehead to show nothing was wrong, Hinata suggested they take a bath together. This of course got an instant approval from the girl who squirmed out of Hinata\u2019s grip to gather her bathing supplies. Hanabi was happy to have her big sister and mother figure back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dinner and spending some sister time with Hanabi, Hinata was finally able to get ready for bed. Now wearing a light sleeping kimono Hinata moved under the covers of her bed. But she would not even think of sleeping, not when the book written by her hero lay near her pillow. Hinata had promised herself to read some of it before she slept and so she grabbed the book and carefully opened the seal-lock with a small burst of her chakra. Back in the Hokage\u2019s office Sandaime Hokage had explained that too open the lock she needed to be keyed into its ID framework. The only problem was that only Uzumaki chakra wouldn\u2019t react violently with the seal and cause its safety function to kick in. This feature was able to be worked around only by having Naruto channel some of his chakra into her where she would use her chakra to direct it through her and into the seal, this let the ID portion of the seal identify her as Naruto\u2019s bonded Kunoichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excitement grew by leaps and bounds when she saw the latch pop open. It took all her restraint training to not simply rip the cover open and instead gently lift the cover to reveal\u2026. Nothing!!! <i>\u2018Wait. That can\u2019t be right!\u2019</i> thought the chunky Hyuga girl as she flipped through the pages of the book only to see a blank white page each time. \u201cBut, why go through so much trouble for an empty book?\u201d the girl asked herself in a disbelieving whisper. It was only when she reached the end that she found something. A message written in quick feminine handwriting. \u201cAll answers lie in the beginning? What does that mean?\u201d Quickly she flipped back to the front finding something that hadn\u2019t been their earlier. An odd looking seal painted upon the inside of the front cover stared back at the confused young girl, its design looked so complex that just looking at it hurt. Before she could look away to rest her eyes for a moment the seal started to glow. It was faint at first but quickly grew into a blinding flash of light. When the light died down Hinata had her head on her pillow seemingly asleep, the seal glowing softly upon the pages as they moved from cover to cover at an amazing pace.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\nHe bolted upwards his body covered in a cold sweat, chest heaving as he panted and his blue eyes quickly searched the room. His search ended almost as quickly as it started as the whiskered blond quickly reached over to his nightstand and grabbed a book. The book in his hand looked ominous, almost evil, and held an aura of pain, fear and sorrow. Its black cover had odd red vain-like things covering it and in the dark room the red seemed to radiate an unholy glow. This book was his nightmare journal, something he had been writing in more often as he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stole a quick glance at the clock over his bed before he pulled out a pen and moved to the next empty page. He sat like that for some time simply writing about his nightmare in excruciating detail, pausing only to try and refresh his memory of an event from the dream. As much as he hated reliving the nightmares something told him that these nightmares were important and so made sure to write about every detail that he could remember. Once done Naruto closed the book with a heavy sigh, looking towards his clock again he saw it was only ten after three. The half-awake blond got out of bed knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to sleep and moved to a corner of his new room. The apartment the old man had given him was at least three times as large as his last one; this left him plenty of room for what he had set up in this one corner. An easel with some sketching and painting tools sat in this corner as well as a number of drawings he had already made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting himself down he began to lightly sketch whatever came to him while his mind wandered, by the time he stopped and looked at his sketch he found he had moved from sketching to painting the sketch without thought. He spent the next hour putting the finishing touches to the nearly finished image. Looking to the clock he made a mental note of the time and reminded himself that he was to meet Hinata at the park at 8 this morning. This left him with half an hour to get ready and arrive. Turning towards the picture he took it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom was a burning ruin that was once a village. In the center of these destroyed and burning buildings was the image of a young man with blond hair, his back facing anyone who may look upon the painted sketch. Before the boy hidden in the shadows made by the flames where nine shadowed figures, the glow of the flames and the red cloud pattern that covered them being the only reason you could see them. Moving to the middle of the painting the smoke from the fires gathered and blown to the left revealing the broken remains of one of the Hokage faces. Above the faces was another shadowed figure with only an odd orange swirl mask over its face. Behind the figure however was the most eye-catching part of this painting. The Moon. The celestial orb that Naruto always found so beautiful now gave off an eerie and sickly glow. In truth, it looked more like an eye then the moon, with its four concentric circles with nine tomoe in the three circles closest to the pupil. All in all, Naruto couldn\u2019t help but, feel something was trying to warn him. Shaking it off he got up and began to get ready to go meet Hinata.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t know what to feel. So many emotions were running through her at this moment that she was surprised she hadn\u2019t fainted from emotional overload. For the past few hours while her body rested her mind had been through the most trying of ordeals. She had seen it, from her earliest childhood memories to the moment of her death; Hinata was now the only person in all of Konoha who knew so much about Kushina Uzumaki. She had not only seen but, felt the woman\u2019s emotions as she went through her life. The laughter and joy she felt with her friends, the love she felt for the blond who stole her heart, to the pain of childbirth. Hinata had felt everything that made the women she saw as her hero tick. Tears flowed down her cheeks as she remembered the wonderful woman\u2019s parting words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Naruto\u2026 you're going to experience a lot of pain and suffering. Remember who you are! Find a goal\u2026 a dream\u2026 and don't stop trying until it comes true. There's\u2026 there's so much more that I want to say\u2026 to teach you\u2026 I want to stay with you\u2026 I love you.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing down her tears Hinata opened the book once more to find the seal and the message were now gone and in their place were various chapters of training methods and exercises designed just for kunoichi as well as details on Uzumaki clan traditions and ninja arts, complete with a section called <u><i>\u2018F\u016binjutsu for dummies\u2019</i></u>. Seeing how she couldn\u2019t rely on the seal appearing again Hinata vowed to give Naruto all the knowledge she now had on his mother herself. He deserved to know how much his mother loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting her bed Hinata quickly got ready for her day. She was to meet Naruto today so they could learn more about each other. When she was finally ready she hurried on her way stopping only to give her father a quick farewell and give Hanabi a promise to come home and spend some time with her in the afternoon.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, there is a river nearby, and Naruto gets to fishing. He has the toad, Gamakichi, resting on his head.

It has in it's moth a fish just as large as it. The turtle drops the fish on the ground and goes back into the river, possibly to get more.

But Naruto suddenly creates two shadow clones of himself, he then puts into them a decent amount of Hinata's chakra, and had them run off. This confused the giant ant and it chased after them instead. Naruto then says, \"I'm surprised that worked.\" They both then start walking to the end of the forest. Naruto then says, \"Hinata, Gamakichi, did you guys notice something odd?\" Gamakichi says, \"Like what?\" And Naruto says, \"Iruka Sensei said to don't die, and the note we found said there was a time limit. I studied my ass off last night on this exam. Nobody ever dies in this exam and there is no time limit...I think it's a scare tactic.\" Hinata then says, \"And there's the turtle and ant.\" Gamakichi says, \"Yeah...The turtle brought two fishes as large as whales to eat, and the giant ant ignored us for some weaker source of chakra.\" Naruto says, \"I think Iruka Sensei sent them to keep us on edge.\" They then made it to the end of the forest and found a wooden door. They then go what looks like a library, but there is only one book. Naruto picks it up. There is no title on the book, and when he flips through the pages are blank. Gamakichi says, \"You do realize that's a chakra book, right?\" Hinata says, \"So it can only be read when chakra flows in it?\" And Naruto taps into Hinata's chakra and the title reads, History of the Hidden Leaf Village: Famous Shinobi and Kunoichi, techniques, strategy, and jutsu. Naruto looks through it and says, \"Wow! This book tells us about details on everyone famous from the Hidden Leaf Village and their techniques and how to train to use it!\" Hinata says, \"Famous people?\" And Naruto says, \"The Hokage, War Heroes, Sannin, Sirens, you name it their here!\"</span></div></div>",

The Third Hokage said, \"Naruto Uzumaki, Hinata Hyuga. Congratulations on passing the test. I have a few gifts for the two of you. He then looks to Iruka, who pulls out a briefcase like object. He then opened it. The Old man said, \"First, we would like to give to both of you your new headbands.\" Iruka pulled out the two headbands with the leaf symbol on them. The Old man continued, \"And the second gift will be the name of one of your sensei's. One of them is Kakashi Hatake.\" He paused to bite onto his pipe, breathe through it, and continues, \"And the last is this.\" He takes something out of his pocket, and tosses it to the two. Naruto catches it and finds a key with a leaf symbol key chain. He says, \"You could say that it is customary for a Shinobi to live with their Kunoichi, so a law was passed that allows graduates to live in an apartment complex seated in a neighborhood called the starter homes.\" He then sees that Hinata has gotten a little red to this. He then gets a sinister grin that can't be seen by them, and says, \"Now the apartment complex has two separate beds in them, but there can be only a single bed.\" As Hinata gets redder, Naruto also gets redder. Iruka catches on and says, \"Yes, in fact, that's how most couples in the village are made...Like how Hinata's parents met.\" Now the two new ninja are beyond red. The Old man says, \"Yes...Everyone of the ninja enjoy the alone time in those apartments, not just as partners, but-\" He didn't even finish as the two ran off as fast as they could. Iruka said, \"Be sure to move your things over, you will meet your new sensei's at the academy on saturday!\" Once they are completely gone, they both break out laughing. Iruka says, \"You'd think Ichiraku put up a new free ramen campaign.\"</span></div></div>",

How's my number one customer!?\" And Naruto points to his headband with his thumb and says, \"Like a graduate!\" He then orders the usual ramen he gets. He starts eating, but finds himself constantly thinking of Hinata. He had no reason to, really, but just wanted to. He then thought <i>she does look cute</i>. Then he hears the owner welcome someone in. And Naruto is patted on the back and hears a friend say, \"So, I heard you became a ninja today boss?\" He turns around to see the old man's grandson and one of his friends, Konohamaru, wearing the same pair of goggles he used to wear. Naruto says, \"That's right Konohamaru! And I got a new apartment!\" He then flashes his new keys. Konohamaru then says, \"So who's the Kunoichi you got?\" And Naruto says, \"Her name's Hinata. Real nice, very shy though.\" And Konohamaru says, \"Hinata?...I think I'm in the same class as her sister.\" He then ordered some ramen and they both ate together.

The victorious ladies sat together while the unlucky ones glared in anger and envy.  Their eyes focused on Hinata more than the others as the tiny girl was able to find a shinobi while their bodies of far greater mass failed.  Hinata felt even more worried as both Sakura and Ino had passed and they were arguing about who was the one who snagged Sasuke.  And once again, Hinata was caught between their massive guts shaking with every bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way Sasuke felt you!  Naruto would sooner pick Hinata then Sasuke would pick you!\" Ino yelled at the massive girl.  Sakura growled and clenched her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coming from the girl whose clan has been feeling out either the Nara or Akimichi clans!\" Sakura yelled back.  Ino pulled her hand back to slap Sakura when a soft cough made them all freeze.  Turning Iruka was standing there.  He had a scroll in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who were felt, please come with me.  Those who failed please remain.  Another chunin will come and speak with you about when your solo tests will be,\" Iruka said.  The girls who passed rose and followed Iruka out in single file.  They walked down the hallway and stood before a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this room, you will meet your partner.  You will also face your second test.  It is fairly simple.  You just need to not die,\" Iruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Ino yelled.  Iruka glared at Ino for her out burst.  The massive girl shrunk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what I said.  Your very lives will be at risk and unless you become one you will both die,\" Iruka said calmly.  He paused a moment to let this sink into the girls' minds.  He saw the fear growing in their eyes.  Good.  \"Now when I call your name, you will walk in.\"  He opened the scroll.  \"Ino Yamanaka\"  Ino smiled and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it will be Sasuke,\" she proclaimed as she entered.  Iruka paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata Hyuuga,\" he called.  The small girl walked slowly to the door.  As she entered, she was in darkness.  Then the lamps lit up.  She was standing on a seal.  In front of her, her eyes widened as  the man before her was not Naruto.  She looked around, hoping she could ask to try again when she saw them.  Two pairs of Kunochi and Shinobi put their powers together and Hinata and her partner vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in the middle of the woods.  There were two kunai near them and only each other to depend on.  \"Umm ... Hello,\" Hinata said as she blushed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruko Uzumaki was not happy. It should have been one of the happiest days in her life, because today she would graduate the Shinobi Academy, but she had one major problem. To be acknowledged as Kunoichi, one had to be paired up with a male who would become her companion for life, but there was a simple thing that had been a problem for her for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't get me wrong, by civilian standards she was most certainly overweight, being close to 190 pounds on a 5'3 frame certainly wasn't skinny by their standards, but compared to a Kunoichi she was barely worth mentioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't her fault goddammit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas most girls in her class came from decently rich parents or were clan heirs, she was an orphan so she wasn't able to spend all of her money on food alone so she could get some fat on her bones. She had to pay rent, and even if she was able to have enough money remaining at the end of a month shops were selling their products at higher prices to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe of course knew that, for her size, she had an incredible amount of Chakra, but no one in public knew that, so she couldn't imagine any boy wanting to be seen with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was currently sitting on the edge of her bed in her pajama's, her potbelly straining the fabric usually made for civilian girls, who still were retaining skinny bodies. How the blonde wished she would be able to shop in a Kunoichi store, but she simply wasn't big enough. Naruko undid the buttons on the shirt, leaving her belly to fall on her lap. She kneaded the lump of fat, wishing, that if she graduated she would be able to earn enough money to finally get some more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko stood up, and began her morning routine of showering, combing her hair and brushing her teeth. Next she went to her closet, rummaging around until she found what she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked a simple outfit, the orange monstrosity that she had worn throughout the academy finally having served it's purpose, so now she decided upon a simple black shirt with orange highlights that showed a tiny bit of her belly and black Kunoichi pants that hugged her chunky thighs and emphasized the curve of her bottom. She had them special ordered, just for this occasion, because she knew that she had to be looking her best to make a good first impression on her future partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko went to leave her apartment, and left towards the academy. Thankfully she didn't live too far away, so it was only a short walk. She went into the building and into her classroom, sitting down in her usual seat to the far back. She felt small again, because the sitting arrangement was designed for a usual female graduate, so the seat was bigger than her bottom by a fair margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around for a bit, seeing a few no name students, but after a few minutes more familiar faces entered her vision. Sasuke Uchiha was probably the most popular and the strongest guy in the academy at the moment, and while Naruko hated to admit it she certainly knew why he was so popular. The way his muscles moved when he worked out, and his handsome face had certainly been fantasies of hers for a long time. But she also knew that he was out of her league, so she didn't pursue anything with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the two people Naruko certainly liked the least out of all the people in the academy. They had everything she wanted but took it for granted because they came from two rich families. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno came from a rich merchant family and was spoiled to the core. Not only was she rich, but she also had the boxy to prove it, weighing at least twice as much as Naruko and standing nearly a head taller than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka from the prestigious Yamanaka family was about the same size as her pink haired friend, but whereas Sakura had a belly that fell halfway down to her knees but no breasts to speak of Ino's fat gave her an exaggerated hourglass figure with a bit more weight centered towards the ass. Of course Ino had a pudgy belly too, but it was far, far smaller than Sakura's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Naruko knew it eclipsed her own meager midsection by a mile. Ino and Sakura knew this too, so Naruko was constantly teased for her small body, and sometimes even squashed underneath or in between the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ino and Sakura were best friends they constantly argued about who would be Sasuke's partner, so they were in a competition of sorts to see who would become the biggest before graduation, and like everybody expected it was a tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes their teachers entered. Iruka was certainly muscular, but compared to other Shinobi in the village he was only average. In contrast to this, his Kunoichi partner Anko was simply enormous. Not even Sakura's belly could compare to the enormous apron the purple haired woman had attached to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were told what they had to do for graduation test. The Kunoichi would be hidden in the forest around the village, while the Shinobi were tasked to find them. The girls were forbidden to move too far from the place they were deposited at, but they would have to constantly emit Chakra so that the Shinobi who was the most tuned to the Kunoichi's frequency would be the one to find her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kunoichi were given enough food to last a few hours and then were brought outside of the village. As soon as Naruko's guide left she sat down and began to emit Chakra. After a few minutes she noticed a growl coming from her stomach, and knowing that she had enough food with her she opened her bag, in which she found a cup of instant Ramen. She used her Chakra to heat it up and began eating right away, when she noticed steps approaching her. She turned around, noodles still hanging from her plump lips, and immediately blushed when she noticed it was the Shinobi who would be destined for her. When the Shinobi stepped into the clearing she immediately recognized him as... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruko couldn't belive it. Here she was, the smallest girl to come out of the Academy in probably forever, and she got the hunkiest guy there was. Sure, Naruko hadn't talked to him that much, but she was sure that Sasuke was a nice guy... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnn, do you even have enough Chakra to be considered a Kunoichi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not. \"Hey what is that supposed to mean?\" Naruko spoke with her mouth full, now jumping up from the ground, causing her tummy to jiggle lightly. She marched up to him and stood only a few inches away from him, her growing chest nearly touching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke meanwhile was highly amused. Here was this girl, barely tall enough to reach his pecs,  trying to stare him down. As much as he was used to brooding and despite all his self control he couldn't help but smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smiling about, you jerk?\" If Naruko was intimidated by the size difference she certainly didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uchiha simply ignored her and picked her up, his strong fingers sinking into the layer of fat that coated Naruko's gluteus maximus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down you pervert!\" Naruko ordered. Sasuke again couldn't help himself and openly chuckled. Here was this girl, this small, feisty girl that, without even trying, broke through years of building up his emotional walls. Ever since the Uchiha massacre Sasuke had been a loner, but in the five minutes since he began talking to this girl she had with her strange ways brought him to care for her. Maybe it was her Chakra that he was absorbing, but he felt as if she was someone important to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be silent. I'm going to carry you back towards the academy.\" Sasuke tried to say it in monotone, but Naruko realized the emotions in his voice and her eyes softened. She knew that he would be able to protect her, and if she supplied him with Chakra he would be able to do that without any problems. Kunoichi were usually defenseless alone, except certain few that are able to use their own special techniques. Because of this most were constantly together with their Shinobi partner to minimize the risk of one of them being killed, the Shinobi being greatly weakened without access to Chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis special bond was also used to bring two people together more quickly. Naruko could certainly feel the bond that her Chakra had created with Sasuke. At the moment it was weak, but she had no doubt that both of them would become great ninjas, with each other's help of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half an hour both walked in silence back towards the academy, both thinking about the future that awaited them. Sasuke still wanted to kill his brother, but now, with this girl in his arms there was no doubt that she would become important to him, maybe more important than his mission. Naruko meanwhile wondered about Sasuke. Both of them were similar yet so very different. Both of them were orphans, but while Naruko had never even known her family Sasuke had seen his slain right before his eyes. Naruko was poor, Sasuke was rich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought could have gone on forever, comparing the two of them, but she realized that they had arrived at the Academy. They were the first to arrive, no one else but the teachers being there yet. There was Mizuki, who was slightly more muscular than Iruka and then there was his Kunoichi, a women that was a few dozen pounds lighter than Anko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey told Naruko to go and get measured and weighed while she would be releasing as much Chakra over ten seconds as she possibly could. Sasuke's strength, speed and endurance would be tested meanwhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke passed his test with flying colors, as was expected from him, but Naruko had a few problems. Firstly, the minimum weight for a Kunoichi was usually 200 pounds with a few exceptions. She was one such exception, her Chakra being denser than normal, but despite its density it simply couldn't compare to other girl's quantity. Despite all of the effort she put into the test she simply wasn't able to meet the requirements, so she failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was close to tears now. She had gotten a chance at being a ninja, but she simply didn't have the means to be useful to her Shinobi. She ran outside the room, going to the roof, where she cried herself to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruko was women up she realized it was nearly evening. She looked around and saw that it was Mizuki that had shaken her awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you want to be a Kunoichi, so I searched around and if found a backup test for people with problems similar to yours. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruko was wide awake, all thought of sleep forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was running through the forest, a large scroll strapped to her back. She was headed for a clearing which Mizuki had designated as finish point for her test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredibly easy to steal the scroll, because while it would have been impossible to reach for a civilian, the average Kunoichi or Shinobi were too big to enter the location without detection. But because of her small stature she managed to slip in and out without being detected, now having escaped past the village walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko arrived in the clearing with time to spare, so now she wondered what was written in the scroll. She opened it, finding dozens of Jutsu's and techniques there, some she knew, but most of them were completely unknown to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily she had a pen on her, so she was able to write down jutsu instructions on every part of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was finished with the last jutsu on the scroll Iruka appeared in front of her. Before he could say anything Naruko asked him:\"Iruka-sensei, I got the scroll. Do I pass now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko, who told you that you would pass if you stole the forbidden scroll of sealing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was\" \"Me\" Mizuki appeared in front of them, with a crazed look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Iruka, the plan was for the demon bitch to die alone, but I guess I can't leave any witness alive now, so I'll have to kill you too.\" With that Iruka began fighting Mizuki, but it was clear that the silver haired Chunin had the upper hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile ran as fast as her chunky legs could carry her, having received orders from Iruka to bring the scroll back to the village where it would be save, but she suddenly stopped when she noticed that Iruka and Mizuki were talking now, the former heavily wounded but still alive. Naruko hid behind a tree, listening in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... don't know why you protect the demon, it killed your parents! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That maybe true, but Naruko Uzumaki isn't the demon, she is my hard working student, and a proud citizen of the leaf. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko couldn't help but let out happy tears, finally having gotten somebody's acknowledgement after all these years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should tell the demon bitch why she is the demon bitch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mizuki, it's forbidden! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12 years ago, on the day you were born the Kyuubi attacked, but the fourth Hokage sealed it away inside of a baby. That baby was you Naruko Uzumaki, or should I say Kyuubi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko was now in shock. The reason why she was ignored or downright hated by the villagers finally having been revealed to her. Once again a multitude of emotions ran through her and she wondered if she was indeed the demon. All of this stopped though when she felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned around to see Sasuke looking down at her, a small smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry, dobe. What happened to that girl that takes no shit from anyone from a few hours ago? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Naruko couldn't help but smile. Knowing that her partner had her back her worries had been mostly lifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's show them what we are made of!\" Sasuke said, and without having to receive any form of signal Naruko transfered her Chakra towards the Uchiha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke beat Mizuki without much trouble, because the Chunin didn't have his Kunoichi with him, and because of that had only access to his own Chakra, which was barely above the level of a civilian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mizuki was laying on the ground unconscious Sasuke went to pick up Naruko, who was now panting heavily, the strain of transferring all her Chakra visible. He grabbed her ass again and had her lean against him, but instead of complaining like last time she just leaned into his shoulder and wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him close. In that moment she knew they could make this work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have some serious training ahead of you if you have only so little Chakra. But I think the both of us will enjoy that very much. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, they definitely <i>would</i> make this work... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As was custom Naruko moved in with Sasuke, the Uchiha easily having enough place to accommodate for her. In the week they had lived together now they had fallen into a routine of sorts. Sasuke would wake up an hour before her and he would prepare breakfast, which consisted of the most fattening foods available for her, and he did so in a quantity that she was nearly unable to eat everything, and was usually close to nauseous after the meal, throughout which Sasuke encouraged her to go on and rub her belly, which would go from a soft, doughy shape to a tightly stretched, rock hard sphere by the end of breakfast. She ate more at one meal than she had been able to afford for an entire day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Sasuke would train in the weight room, where she would watch him, often times munching on a multitude of snacks ranging from sandwiches to fries, all the while massaging her belly, which would by now be distended far more than ever, coming close to Ino's in size. But where Ino's was soft fat, Naruko's was filled with an incredible amount of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards the Uchiha went on a jog around the village, when Naruko would take a nap to digest. She would wake up around lunch time, Sasuke having brought back takeout from his Lunch. Each day it was something different, for example yesterday he returned with 3 civilian family sized pizza's for her. Of course she had eaten them, not wanting to disappoint him, which caused her to fall into a food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up Sasuke would have a cake or two ready for her, which she again forced down her throat, knowing that this was for her own best interest. Now the two would take a walk around the village, Sasuke carrying her when she got too tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would oftentimes treat Naruko to Ice cream on their walks, and he would oftentimes simply listen to her while she talked, telling him about her life. Sometimes he would comment, but he mostly listened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the house Sasuke would begin preparing dinner. Surprisingly he was a very good cook, and Naruko was more than happy to assist him. He would cook enough for the both of them, which meant that he would cook enough to get him sated, and to get Naruko absolutely stuffed to her limits. After every dinner she swore she could hear her belly creaking, and the tremendous amount of food placed within her tummy caused it to become hard as a rock, and to swell so far into her lap that her thighs were completely covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ate Sasuke would massage her belly, so that she would have more room in there and sometimes, when he thought she was too distracted by eating he would cup her growing breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts wasn't the only thing growing though. The rest of her body was quickly filling out, her having gained 20 pounds in a week, which was quite impressive. Her belly filled out, making it a real gut now and her breasts went up half a cup size, her B cup bras having to be replaced by a C cup, that, while still a bit loose she would quickly grow into. Her pants were thankfully elastic, so she hadn't encountered any problems with them. Her shirt though wasn't so lucky, it becoming so strained that her belly button was showing even when her tummy was empty. When she was stuffed full it would ride up, covering only her breasts and leaving her belly naked for Sasuke to admire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner The Uchiha would carry his Uzumaki to bed where she slept till morning, where the cycle began anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, seven days after they had become Ninja's they were on their way to the academy. They were to be apprenticed under a Kunoichi and Shinobi pair, to be taught more then what they learned in the academy. Naruko was excitedly babbling about how good a Kunoichi she would be, while Sasuke was quietly enjoying the sound of her voice. When they arrived in the room they were designated to meet their new teachers Sasuke pulled food from his bag and gave it to Naruko, who gladly ate it. It didn't matter to her that she was still stuffed from breakfast, she still wasn't used to the quantity of food that Sasuke procured from his wealth and she still thought that she mustn't let any food get to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited for a bit, until after a few minutes two people entered the room. These two people were of course their new Senseis, and they introduced themselves as... </span></div></div>",

He was very tall too, standing close to 7 feet, which gave him a very powerful presence. He easily towered over his wife, who was 6'3, which was still much, much taller than Naruko herself was. Sasuke meanwhile was just shy of 6'2, so he was nearly eye level with their Kunoichi sensei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a very bottom heavy woman, with thighs bigger than Naruko's waist and an ass that weighed more than the blonde's entire body. She only had a small potbelly though, with equally normal breasts resting on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi only eye smiled at his new students, but he was still sending glances to the orange book in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have so much fun together!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Naruko came back to her senses she was still slightly dizzy, being completely surprised by her Sensei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, how did you do that? I thought Kunoichi couldn't use Jutsus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right about that, but there are some Jutsus a Kunoichi can learn. For example most of the Jutsus without an element are easy to learn, and medical jutsu, though that is a bit more difficult.\" Rin answered and as an afterthought added, \" and non of that Sensei crap. From now on you're my cute little sister, so you'll call me nee-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Sen...\" Naruko stopped herself when she saw the look Rin was giving her, \"I mean OK nee-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to start with we're going to see what your limits are. Concentrate on Sasuke and focus on transferring your Chakra to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's too far away! He out of my range!\" Each Kunoichi had a range over which she could transfer her Chakra. This range could be increased by practicing Chakra Control exercises or simply increasing one's reserves and simply pumping more Chakra, but it would be like sending water through dripping pipes, because much of the Chakra would get lost. The best way to increase ones range was doing both things at the same time, but usually Kunoichi specialized after a certain point in their careers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your range right now?\" Rin inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 30 meters\" Rin expected that. Naruko was still smaller than the average graduate, and because her Chakra was so dense and potent it was harder to control. An average Kunoichi fresh out of the Academy had a range of 50 meters, give or take a few. Most experienced Genin had increased it to 100 meters and a Chunin usually rested between 100 and 200 meters. Jonin came in a wider range, having the ability to actively supply their Shinobi from 200 up to 1000 meters away. Kage level Kunoichi were on a different level altogether, because they were able to transmit their Chakra over kilometers without much trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're going to use a little trick. I'm going to teach you the Shadow Clone Jutsu. With it we'll be able to speed up your training. While you yourself will be eating your clones will train with Chakra control.\" Rin showed Naruko the handseal, and the brunette was surprised when her blonde charge had mastered the Jutsu in under an hour. Rin was fuming silently, because it had taken her weeks to get it down, and even then she wasn't able to procure a perfect replica of herself like Naruko had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the real Naruko was eating ravenously, two Shadow Clones (which was her limit at the moment) were doing Chakra Control exercises with Rin. Rin was currently explaining a technique where one would send Chakra only in the direction of the Shinobi instead of just constantly releasing it into the surroundings. She demonstrated by laying out a few seals that would glow when Chakra was sent into them. Rin demonstrated, and the clones tried to replicate her. It wasn't very useful over short ranges, because it was impossible to change the direction of the Chakra stream so fast, but over long ranges it was a definite improvement, because it didn't waste too much Chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the real Naruko was stuffed full and had a headache, because the clones thought it would be a good idea to pop at exactly the same time instead of one after the other. Rin had also given her some scrolls with Control exercises which she would have to do. She returned home, noticing that Sasuke wasn't there yet so she simply decided to lay down on the couch and sleep it of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was woken up when she noticed that Sasuke was home, and was currently making dinner for the two of them. Despite the enormous picnic she had she noticed that she still had a bit of room left to eat, so she made her way over to the dining room, where she was shocked to see the sheer quantity of food prepared. The entire table, which was built for a family of 6 was full of plates and platters, some of which had food on them that she hadn't even heard of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko had a feeling that the previous feasts were but a snack compared to the feasts that would await her in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of her couldn't help but be excited by this. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month later Naruko and Sasuke had just completed another D-rank mission in the village. They had managed to catch the demon cat and were currently standing in front of the Hokage. Jiraya and Tsunade had replaced their sensei Sarutobi 13 years ago after the Kyuubi attacked and he lost his Kunoichi, forcing him into retirement. He was still a highly respected man in the village and served as an advicer to the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya was a man that made Kakashi look lanky, with arms that looked powerful enough to bend steel and legs that looked string enough to carry a building around. Tsunade meanwhile was the single fattest Kunoichi in the village. Weighing over a thousand pounds easily she was recognized as the strongest Kunoichi that had been born since the founding of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the month since graduating Sasuke and Naruko had changed quite a bit, Naruko more so than her Uchiha teammate. She had grown a few inches, now standing 5'8 tall and she had also gained quite a bit of weight, which was emphasized by her constantly too small wardrobe. Sadly she hadn't gained quite as fast as in the first week, her body having gotten used to more food, but in the end she had still gained another 60 pounds, putting her at 270, which was about the same as a freshly graduated Genin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke meanwhile had grown a bit more muscle, making him look like a seasoned Chunin, not the Genin he was. Also he had grown an inch, so now he stood about as tall as Rin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir training had gone splendid, with Kakashi teaching Sasuke offensive Jutsu, while Rin taught Naruko all about channeling her Chakra, so now the blonde had an effective range of 70 Meters. The quick advancement could be attributed to her Shadow Clone training, because by now she constantly trained with four of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't catch anymore cats, give us a real mission!\" Naruko demanded from the Hokage, for which she was quickly reprimanded by Iruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Iruka, don't be so harsh. Kakashi and Rin, do you think your students are ready for a C-rank mission?\" Jiraiya inquired, to which Rin enthusiastically punched her arm in the air, which sent a wave of jiggling throughout her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah they are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Send in the bridge builder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey received the details to the mission and they learned that they would have to protect the man named Tazuna from bandits while he was finishing his bridge. They were told to meet at the gate in two hours and then they went their separate ways to pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had set out of the village and made their way down the road to Wave country. But suddenly, after they had passed a puddle on the ground they were assaulted. Kakashi was quickly taken out, which caused Rin to freeze up for a moment. Naruko and Sasuke quickly looked around and found two people holding onto the chain that killed Kakashi. They were two Shinobi, but they weren't Shinobi like Sasuke or Kakashi, no these two were trained for infiltration and assassination, which meant that instead of being mountains of muscle like most Shinobi were they looked like normal civilians. These kind of Shinobi were trained to stick to the shadows instead of being front line fighters like a modern Shinobi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko quickly established a stream of Chakra towards Sasuke, so now he was fighting against them. He quickly overpowered them, because they simply couldn't keep up with the power of a Shinobi and the stamina and endurance a Kunoichi provided them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were both unconscious, Kakashi walked out of the tree line, completely unharmed. Naruko immediately flung herself at him, having come to see the older Shinobi as a sort of older brother. She impacted with Kakashi's chest and immediately hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever do something like that again. We thought we lost you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\" came from Rin's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you froze up\" Sasuke nonchalantly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I acted you little brat!\" Rin punched him on the head, causing a bump to form. \"Anyway, Tazuna, mind telling us why Shinobi were after you, and not only bandits like you said?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Tazuna presented them with an obvious sob story. Or at least it was completely obvious for the two males, but Rin and Naruko totally fell for it. Not wanting to face the wrath of their respective partners, Kakashi and Sasuke agreed to continue the mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few hours they came upon a body of water covered in fog, and a boat waiting to take them over it. When they got sight of the bridge that was to be built Naruko was in awe. She clearly hadn't expected the old drunkard to build something even remotely like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stepped ashore on dry land again they walked on, until Kakashi suddenly stopped them and pushed all of them to the ground. A huge, cleaver like sword passed over them and stuck in a tree. Then, an even huger man appeared on it. He introduced himself as Zabuza Momoichi, and after the two Jonin's ordered Naruko and Sasuke to stay back Kakashi engaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief fight and a successful rescue attempt after which the silver haired Jonin dominated the fifth Kakashi was victorious, but before he could kill Zabuza he was interrupted by a Hunter Ninja from Kirigakure. The Hunter thanked them and vanished with Zabuza's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then continued their way towards Tazuna's house, and when they arrived they were greeted by his daughter, who introduced herself as Tsunami. She was a civilian beauty, with a flat stomach, thin arms, some ass and a whole lot of bust. Her face had a cute heart shape, and the button nose that she had only emphasized her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly nighttime when they arrived, so now they received all rooms. Kakashi and Rin would have their own room, because they were a married couple and it was pretty clear what they would do to relax after the journey and the fights. Sasuke would get the room of Tsunami's son, and Naruko would share Tsunami's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all changed into their sleep wear, which for Naruko consisted only of her panties, which by now looked more like a thong as she had gotten them two weeks ago, and her bra, which was straining to hold her burgeoning bust, because the D-cups that she had when she had gotten the piece of cloth were buried under another layer of fat when she had gained the last dozen pounds. Naruko lay down on the bed, which she could only assume was meant for a married couple and drifted of to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night she was... </span></div></div>",

She was standing ankle deep in water, but the water wasn't cold, it was exactly her body's temperature, so it was comforting. She looked around for a bit and then decided to explore a bit. She walked for what seemed like a long time, but she really couldn't tell because everything looked the same. Until suddenly, the tunnel she was in widened until it looked like she was standing in a hall. One half of the huge room was split of by a large cage, whose gates were held closed by a single piece of paper. Naruko squinted a bit, trying to look at what was in the cage, but she could only see a pair of large, red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than she could see, a clawed hand shot out of the cage, and stopped only a few centimeters in front of her, which caused her to fall on her well padded behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you?\" Naruko had clearly not calmed down from nearly being skewered by a claw bigger than she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, baritone voice answered her:\"I am the mighty Kyuubi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's the case, why are you trying to kill me? The Hokage told me that if I die you die with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool! I would just reform! But now that I think about it, that is actually quite painful. Hmm, alright brat, I'll not kill you for now.\" Naruko sighed in relief, \"so now tell me what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anything, I don't even know how I got here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let me tell you what I want. I want you to get fatter, the bigger your belly is the larger the room for me to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was already planning to do that, if you hadn't noticed I'm a Kunoichi. It is expected of me to get as big as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I have seen your 'big', and let me tell you, when I'm through with you your Hokage will look svelte compared to you. Let me tell you what. I have some control over your body. I will slow down your metabolism so far that everything you eat will become fat, and I will boost your digestion speed. Of course you're going to need more food, but with that Uchiha of yours that shouldn't be a problem. The only thing I want in return is access to your taste buds. I haven't eaten anything in so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko pondered. It was a deal that would only bring her advantages really, because she would become stronger faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept. But only on the condition that you lend me your Chakra should I need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine brat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she was awoken by the heavenly aroma of food. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Naruko had woken up she had eaten more ravenously than ever. She had eaten about the same amount as Rin at that breakfast, a woman who was still over 300 pounds her senior. The older Kunoichi was quite surprised, but not being one to be outdone she still ate a bit more than Naruko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later the results of their little contest were a bit different. While Naruko was still going full swing, Rin was wheezing to keep up. It was quite funny really, the Kunoichi that weighted a bit less then double that of Naruko was beaten in an eating contest by her student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the eating had payed off though, because Naruko had certainly gotten bigger. She had gained another 35 pounds, finally breaking the big 300 barrier. Naruko was now closing in on Sakura and Ino when they graduated, and she definitely wasn't the smallest girl of their graduation class anymore. She was a bit above average now. Also she had grown an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had also had the pleasure of meeting Inari, Tsunami's son. The boy had upset Naruko with a comment he made about family, after which the blonde beauty was running into the forrest. There she ate a bit from the bag she had grabbed before leaving and fell asleep. She was awoken by a slightly chubby girl, who introduced herself as Haku. She was even smaller than Naruko had been when she graduated, but she said she was a civilian, and with the small amount of fat she had the blonde believed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a bit, and Naruko managed to befriend the other girl, helping her find healing herbs for the other girls friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Naruko was asleep in the bedroom, but she was awoken by a commotion coming from downstairs. She stood up and quickly got dressed, but she had gained so much weight recently that there was still more skin showing than what would be appropriate. She went down the stairs and found that two thugs were attacking Tsunami. She quick formed two shadow clones and had them tackle the bandits to the ground and sit on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked, and after a few seconds of both bandits being smothered by 305 pounds each, they fell unconscious. Naruko quickly made her way to the bridge, where she knew Sasuke was and ran. When she arrived she found Sasuke amidst an ice dome, looking exhausted, but when she tried sending Chakra to him the Ice blocked it from reaching him. She looked around for a second, Kakashi dueling Zabuza once again, who was receiving Chakra from a seal. Obviously a Kunoichi had stored her Chakra in there for him, so he wasn't dependent on one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one to help her she did the only thing that she could think of and ran into the dome of ice mirrors, and once she was in she opened her Chakra up to Sasuke who was immediately up on his feet again, the Chakra giving him a much needed boost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough. The other ninja was simply too fast, jumping from mirror to mirror. The fight shifted slightly when Sasuke awakened his Sharingan, but the other ninja only adjusted the speed of attacks and movement. Also Sasuke had to protect Naruko, because as Kunoichi she wasn't trained to fight herself. They were in a pretty bad spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ninja threw Senbon at Naruko, Sasuke jumped in front of her, making him look like a pin cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" Naruko had tears in her eyes, desperately clinging to Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're my partner and *cough* I lo...\" Sasuke head rolled to his side, and Naruko was openly crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the first time you see someone precious to you die?\" The ninja asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Shut up shutupshutupshutup!\" Naruko's eyes were turning red now, and the ninja noticed that her clothes were visibly straining to hold in her girth. She was getting fatter right before the ninja. But how was this possible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyuubi had sent her a small amount of Chakra. Small for him, but for her it wasn't small at all. It was a huge surge that went through her system, and her body being too small to accommodate for the power swelled accordingly. She expanded quickly, feeling like she gained 100 pounds, no 200 pounds in seconds. She finally stopped growing once she was close to Rin in weight, and when that was the case she released her Chakra in a destructive wave, that shattered the ice mirrors and caused the ninja to fly through the air. The ninja immediately fell unconscious, and the mask that the now revealed she was wearing shattered, showing Haku's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko wanted to get answers, but she had more important things to do. She crawled over to Sasuke, her belly dragging over the ground, and, when she was kneeling next to him, she shook his shoulders, trying to wake him up. Naruko was crying into his chest, and she didn't notice when he began breathing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko, you're too heavy, get off me.\" Sasuke voice was strained, most likely due to the 600 pounds of Kunoichi sitting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, the blonde just looked up from his chest, shocked that he was still alive. She quickly crawled upwards, her pendolous breasts now resting on his chest, and her belly pressing down onto his eight pack. She lowered her lips to his, and quickly caught him in a kiss. In that moment both of them felt a spark go through them, and Sasuke couldn't help himself and used his hands to reach as far around Naruko's belly as he could. He began massaging her love handles and squeezing every roll he found, all the while still kissing Naruko with such a possessiveness that one could assume he had bought her on the market like the food that she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to stop eventually, as both of them needed air to breath and so they pulled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Naruko muttered under her breath, but Sasuke still heard it clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got off him, they looked around, noticing that Kakashi had beaten Zabuza once again, but before he could deliver the killing blow his employer, the shipping tycoon Gato showed up with an army of mercenaries. Zabuza sacrificed himself to kill Gato, and asked Kakashi to take Haku with him to Konoha, so that she may have a better live where she wouldn't be seen as a tool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the renmants of the mercenaries were quickly taken out by the villagers, who had been convinced by Inari to fight. They stayed for a few more days, in which Naruko deflated to her original size, much to Sasuke's displeasure and Haku woke up. The ice user was sad that Zabuza was dead, but she accepted that his last order had been for her to live in Konoha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been welcomed into the team by Naruko quickly, who after learning that she hadn't thought about killing Sasuke once quickly befriended the older girl. They left Wave country with a happy smile on their face, because they knew that they had done something good. </span></div></div>",

That left Rin alone with Naruko and Sasuke, and wanting to celebrate their first mission outside of the village she took them out to get something to eat. They quickly made their way to one of the restaurant owned by the Akimichi family and when they arrived there they quickly got a booth. Because this was a Shinobi restaurant the seating arrangements were extra large because of the many bodacious Kunoichi that frequented the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruko and Sasuke where sitting next to each other, Rin across from them and the single male was constantly supplying the two Kunoichi with food by making frequent trips to the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So *burp* you two know that the Chunin exams are starting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No nee-chan, we *belch* didn't. In fact this is the first time I heard about it.\" Naruko replied, Sasuke nodding in confirmation when Rin looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, me and Kakashi have thought about sending you to compete. Even if you don't make Chunin, it will be quite the experience for the two of you. As the name says you get the chance to become Chunin, which would make both me and Kakashi quite proud.\" Naruko immediately got stars in her eyes, wanting to prove that she wasn't a failure and she proclaimed that they would of course pass. Sasuke gave Rin a quick glance that said that they would be participating, which caused Rin to smile brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's celebrate! We need a bit more food for that though. Sasuke! Do your duty!\" Rin joked, but Sasuke did as he was told, happy that he would be able to watch Naruko stuff her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left Naruko was stuffed full, clutching her belly that was so tight that it looked as if it would burst if a single ounce of food passed through her mouth. Rin soon said her goodbyes and left Naruko and Sasuke alone on their way home. They ran across Konohamaru, who was the third Hokage's grandson. He was a scrawny kid, not having started the Shinobi Academy yet, but he was constantly trying to prove that he was stronger by making frequent \"attacks\"  on his grandfather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a second he ran away again, and when he turned around a corner wasn't looking where he was going, so he bumped into something soft, heavy, but to his disadvantage unmoving, so his momentum transfered itself back to him and he was sent sprawling to the ground. He looked up, but he could only recognize a silhouette of a large woman, who was blocking out the sun with glowing yellow eyes. In that moment Naruko and Sasuke came around the corner and witnessed the scene in front of them. Konohamaru was lying in the ground, in front of a foreign Kunoichi whose breasts were still jiggling from the impact. Next to the Kunoichi was a Shinobi none of them had ever seen. He wasn't really that muscular, which confirmed his position as a long range fighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little brat! What do you think you're doing! You dishonor my sister by touching her breasts, and now you're not even going to apologize?\" The foreign Shinobi clearly was pissed, but he was quickly silenced when his now revealed sister used her hip to easily bump him aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want to cause an incident, Kankuro. It's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKankuro, who was now embarrassed cried out:\"But Temari, he touched your boobs. Shouldn't you be pissed about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a new voice joined them from above, someone who was clearly standing in the tree next to them. The voice was </span></div></div>",

Out of the corner of her eyes she could see that Temari's and Kankuro's eyes widened in fear, which caused her to come to the conclusion that they knew the voice's owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a thick branch in the tree above them stood a female that made the other women standing there look anorexic in comparison. It was a mystery how the branch was able to hold her, the girl clearly weighing close to 600 pounds. Whereas Temari's fat occupied her lower body, with thunder thighs as big as tree trunks and an ass to match them, the red headed girl in the tree was completely round. Though her fat was deposited more equally in her body, that didn't mean that Temari's cheeks were bigger, the 200 pounds between them clearly giving the redhead an edge in body size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gaia, we were just-\" Kankuro tried to explain to the now revealed Gaia, but he was interrupted by the red head, who spoke in monotone, but clearly with an edge that said she would hurt you when you pissed her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari, Kankuro, shut up.\" The two immediately stopped, and stepped back a few steps, making space for Gaia to jump from the tree and land in front of them. The redhead did just that, and with her feet landing on the ground she sent massive vibrations through the ground, which could be felt for dozens of meters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Temari, my sister.\" Gaia pointed at the blonde haired, pear shaped 400 pound beauty behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Kankuro, my brother.\" Gaia's fingers were now pointing towards the boy, who, while being muscular by civilian standards was nothing impressive. He was even smaller than Kiba, who was the dead-last in the Shinobi class during Naruko's Academy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sasuke Uchiha, and this is my partner Naruko Uzumaki.\" Sasuke introduced them, while wrapping his arm around her shoulder. Naruko meanwhile was stunned. She could feel something familiar from the redhead, but she didn't know what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look forward to facing you in the tournament, Sasuke Uchiha and Naruko Uzumaki.\" With that Gaia turned around and left, her siblings quickly following her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were out of earshot the strange feeling Naruko had finally stopped, and she turned to face her boyfriend:\" I think we should watch out for them. Gaia gives me the creeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke quickly reassured her with a quick kiss, and after they said goodbye to Konohamaru they were on their way home. After all they both had a lot of training to do for the upcoming Chunin exams. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks later Sasuke and Naruko were on their way to the academy, a place where they hadn't been since they graduated. The two walked in relative silence, only speaking a word or two every few minutes, because they were both deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke thought about everything that had changed since he had been partnered up with Naruko. He had been broody, and would ignore everyone around him if they wouldn't be able to become stronger. Also he had been constantly stalked in his Academy days by fan girls. Thankfully that had stopped once everyone had become ninjas, which was a great relieve to him. Never again he would wish to see Sakura or Ino. They were girls that were greedy, and saw him as the ultimate price to be had. Their greed reflected in their bodies, which were the biggest in the academy. But then again, he hadn't seen them since graduation. He couldn't help himself and looked to his right, where Naruko was walking. During the last two weeks the blonde had gained immensely, quickly growing towards 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe at first couldn't believe it, her unnatural growth was simply too fast, but then she confided in him the deal she had struck with her prisoner. Naruko was currently wearing a battle dress which showed an incredible amount of cleavage, but covered everything about halfway down her thunder thighs. They had used bandages to make her look smaller, so their enemies would underestimate them more easily, because her belly was pressed to her body so much that she easily looked 30 pounds lighter. It had been a small argument between them, because Naruko wanted to show of, but Sasuke managed to make her see his point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't been able to use the same tactic to make him look smaller, because while fat was soft and malleable, muscle was not. His training had gone well too, because he started using Naruko as a weight for bench pressing, and lifting her ever increasing girth made for a perfect exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko meanwhile too thought about how her life had changed since graduating. No longer was she the scrawny girl everyone would bully, no, she was pretty sure that by now she was one of if not the biggest Kunoichi their age. She couldn't wait to see the looks on Sakura's and Ino's faces once would realize that the scrawny girl that Naruko was was now bigger than them. Not only that, but she had gotten the boy both of them wanted for herself. Of course she loved Sasuke, but rubbing it in their faces would be sweet revenge. By now she also had some of the problems Kunoichi would face. Civilian clothing stores were off limits to her, chairs designed for non-Kunoichi women began buckling under her weight, and she had more than once woken up in front of an empty fridge, having emptied it out while sleeping. But all those problems were - for Naruko at least -  achievements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to her left, and couldn't help herself but blush. Sasuke had been nothing but sweet to her since they graduated, and he had helped her become stronger than ever. She had fallen for him, and fallen hard. She couldn't imagine her live without him anymore, and she didn't want to. It didn't hurt that he had only gotten hotter since they left the academy. He was still wearing the same blue shirt white short combo he wore, but where before the shirt was loose it was now skin tight, showing off every single muscle he had trained for. Naruko didn't mind that one bit, because she certainly got her eye candy, and she got lots of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the Academy and they went into the room they were supposed to be tested, but they quickly noticed a Genjutsu over the room sign, so they went up another floor. There they then went into the real room, where the other people were waiting. There were many Genin, from as many countries in the room, some sitting in their seats waiting for the exam to begin and others formed groups with allied villages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke didn't see anyone he knew until a heavy weight pressed down on his back and chunky arms wrapped around him from behind. Out of the corner of his eyes he saw</span></div></div>",

Sakura even began groping his muscles! That was her boyfriend goddammit, and she wouldn't let some pink haired harlot touch him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look pinky, that's my partner you're groping, so back off, before I make you regret it.\" Even Sakura wasn't blind to the malice that Naruko put in her words, but without even turning to look at Naruko she said:\"As if some skinny, tiny child could ever be Sasuke-kun's partner.\" She was clearly too busy fondling Sasuke, who was clearly amused by all this and decided to let Naruko handle the situation. He knew she was easily capable of holding her own against Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura suddenly was pushed to the side, causing her to fall onto the ground, which sent vibrations through the ground which could be felt in the entire room. The pinkette was lying there for a few seconds, until she returned to her senses, and looked at the person that pushed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she saw small, pudgy feet that wore Kunoichi sandals with small heels, shins covered by guards, which lead up to much bigger, tree trunk thick thighs in a perfect cone shape. The person wore an orange long sleeved battle dress with black accents, that fell just below her knees, which had a slit going down all the way from the waist, allowing greater mobility. Underneath the dress the person wore mesh stockings, which ended underneath a small skirt in a slightly darker color than the rest of the dress. Wide hips carried more ass than Sakura herself had two times over,and above that  a black belt wrapped around an expansive, nearly perfectly round belly, which, while impressive was still smaller than the pinkette's own midsection. Still, Sakura couldn't help herself but be jealous. A round belly was seen as more attractive than one with rolls, because it indicated that the Kunoichi was stuffed, which meant that she was still getting fatter and hadn't reached a plateau in her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the orb of a belly rested Sakura's attackers breasts, which were many times bigger than Sakura's own pair of knockers. She would say they were a medium G-cup, which was quite impressive for the age of the attacker, which Sakura guessed to be around the same as her own. They formed an impressive amount of cleavage, because they were clearly pressed together by the dress confining them. Sakura couldn't help but take note of the persons arms, which were stuck out to the sides by a few degrees because of the love handles the girl had. They were quite pudgy too, being a bit wider than most civilian girls thighs. Sakura let her eyes wander upwards, seeing a pudgy neck, which was partially covered by what would be a double chin, but because the person was looking down was a triple chin. Full, plump lips were smothered between chipmunk cheeks, giving the persons face a round look which many Kunoichi would kill to have, leading upwards to eyes blue as the sky. She would say that The girl was around 360, maybe 370 pounds, which put her and Sakura at the same weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hair was blond, a golden color which framed the persons pudgy face, and was quite spiky, making it look like a golden crown, or a lions mane. Sakura didn't recognize who it was that had knocked her to the ground at first, but after being stunned for another few seconds she caught sight of whisker marks upon her attackers cheeks. There was only one person Sakura knew that had whisker marks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruko?\" she inquired <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and you better stay the hell away from my boyfriend.\" Naruko ordered, clearly being annoyed by the pinkette's stares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but how? How did you gain so much weight? You were so skinny a few months ago! There's no way you gained 200 pounds in that time! It's impossible.\" Sakura stuttered, not being able to believe that small Naruko, who she could always bully was now this fat Kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sasuke helped, and I'm thankful for every pound he helped me gain since we became partners.\" Naruko turned to Sasuke, and pulled him into a long, passionate kiss, making her claim all the more clear to Sakura. While the two were making out Sakura was still in shock, only coming back to her senses when someone tapped her on the shoulder. She turned around and found that it was her partner,... </span></div></div>",

He also wasn't as tall as other boys his age, standing at just under 6 feet, which was about Naruko's height. Speaking of the blonde she had finally stopped making out with her boyfriend and was now looking around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desks were arranged so that teams would sit together, but couldn't see each other's piece of paper, which made it all the more clear that teamwork was one of the things that would be tested today. She began looking at the different people in the room, seeing quite a few familiar faces. She saw Kiba arguing with Sakura about something, but she couldn't make out what the two were talking about. She saw Ino standing next to Shikamaru, breasts and ass bigger than ever,  causing Sasuke to duck down in order to get unnoticed by the platinum blonde hourglass. She had clearly put a bit more effort into her Ninja training than Sakura, because if Naruko had to guess she would say she was a few pounds heavier than herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also saw the Suna team they had stumbled across a few days ago, Temari was already sitting on one of the  Kunoichi chairs, her ass completely engulfing the seating arrangement, and leaking over the sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as impressive as it was to see someone being heavier than was expected, she was still looking tiny next to her sister Gaia. The redhead was crushing the two chairs on which her rear end was parked, Naruko could practically hear the sound the girl was making the chairs make, even over the sound of the crowd. The rest were not really that impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were alerted of the arrival of the instructors by a cloud of smoke that signified the use of Shunshin. There were two that caught Naruko's eye in the crowd. The first was a man wearing a black trench coat and wearing a bandana covering his head, who would later introduce himself as Ibiki Morino. The next was a woman who introduced herself as Yugao Uzuki. She had purple hair, and if Naruko had to guess she would say that she weighed about 700, maybe 750 pounds. It was clear that she was an elite Kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Chunin hopefuls took their places and we're handed out different pieces of papers. There were ten questions, and when Naruko read the first one she had no clue what to answer. She read the second, and she again had no idea. And how could she? These were all Shinobi questions! She hadn't learned this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Sasuke and saw him having similar problems, causing her to guess that he had Kunoichi questions. She sent a small thread of Chakra to him, undetectable by anybody not looking for it. She knew that she couldn't talk, because they would be disqualified, but if no one knew they cheated than no one could call them out for it. The technique she used was taught to her by Rin. It was apparently developed from the Yamanaka clans mind switch techniques. It allowed the user to hear the targets thoughts, but because it worked both ways it was useless on the battlefield. But for situations such as this it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke helped her answer the Shinobi questions, which were about fighting and maximizing muscle development, while she helped him with Kunoichi questions, which were about eating the most, the best ways to gain weight and even how to best distribute Chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quickly finished and were allowed to leave the room once they turned in their papers which they of course did. They were brought to a waiting lounge with weights and food, which both of them used immediately. Sasuke sat down on one of the couches with two dumbbells, while Naruko sat next to him with a plate of food loaded high with calorie heavy goodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while they were joined by others and, when more and more people entered the room it was clear that the exam had finished. They were lead back into the testing room, where - to Naruko's surprise -  Anko waited for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were told that the second task was...  </span></div></div>",

Naruko was astonished by the huge size of the trees, the smallest branches being bigger around than all tree trunks she had seen in her life up until now. All Genin that passed the first test were standing in a semi circle surrounding Anko, who was standing with her back against the fence and started explaining the next test to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the middle of this forest there is a tower which you will have to reach to pass my little test. But this isn't any normal forest we'll have you go through. No. This forest is called the Forest Of Anorexia. Now you may wonder why it is called such a horrible name. The reason behind it is that it is populated by Chakra absorbing wildlife. They mostly ignore Shinobi due to their negligible Chakra capacity and their high agility due to their muscles, but the slow and heavy Kunoichi make for excellent prey.\" Anko made a dramatic pause before continuing. \"The Forest has the interesting property of robbing it's Victims of their bulk, and through that of their Chakra capacity. All those who lose more than 200 pounds will be disqualified immediately, which means that you have a maximum of 5 days to arrive at the tower, because that's how long the trees in the forest need to suck that weight out of you. The sooner you arrive, the more you will be able to gain back before the finals. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Anko led the female portion of the Genin into a tent which had previously been set up. They were weighted one after the other, with following results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno: 374 pounds <br>\r\nHinata Hyuuga: 279 pounds <br>\r\nTenten: 440 pounds <br>\r\nNaruko Uzumaki: 412 pounds<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka : 415 pounds<br>\r\nGaia no Subaku: 627 pounds <br>\r\nTemari no Subaku: 445 pounds <br>\r\nKarin: 256 pounds <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Karin Naruko stopped paying attention, because there weren't any other people she knew. She zoned out and thought about all the food she had stashed in the sealing scrolls hidden in her rolls. She knew they weren't supposed to take food with them, but she just couldn't help herself. She got hungry quickly dammit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko returned to Sasuke, who was waiting in front of the gate that would allow them to enter. Sasuke explained that he had thought of a plan, which would allow them to get to the tower quickly,while she wouldn't lose too much weight. He knew a bit about the forest, because he had hidden there a few times when his fan girls got too crazy, so he knew a good path to the tower. She trusted him, and allowed him to carry her bridal style, because she knew he could carry her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran across a few other teams, all of which were easily defeated and, after making it within a few miles of the tower they set up camp for the night. Naruko was bloated from all the food she had eaten from her stash, so she lay down in the small cave that was their temporary home and fell asleep. After Sasuke set up some traps he joined her and used her belly as a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waking up the next morning Naruko got quite a scare, because the bandages across her midriff had loosened so much that they were loose enough to fall to the ground. She gathered her bearings quickly and they were off to the tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later they arrived, and were led to the rooms prepared for the faster Genin. They weren't the first Genin to arrive, Gaia's team having arrived a few hours before them, but second place was still good. Naruko quickly got to work on regaining the weight she lost, and by the time it was time for the weigh in she had grown her fat deposits back to its previous size and then some. The bindings actually slightly painful now, and it wouldn't be long before her belly shredded them to bits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were weighted with following results:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno: 205 pounds. The pinkette had only arrived in the last few hours, and apparently she was nearly sucked dry by a strange plant before Kiba managed to free her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata Hyuuga: 223 pounds. She arrived sometime on the fourth day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten: 405 pounds. Having arrived on the second day she quickly worked her way back above 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruko Uzumaki: 430 pounds. Now that wasn't a surprise, because thanks to her constant snacking and the deal she had with the Kyuubi she was constantly growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka: 367 pounds. The blond haired heiress blamed her arrival on the third day on her partner Shikamaru. Still, she sported a grin that was nearly as wide as her hips when she saw the now only chubby form of Sakura walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari seemed to have neither lost nor gained that much weight, she topped out at 450 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarin had apparently not made it to the tower, because she got dangerously underweight so she was rescued from the forest by an experienced Shinobi from her village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of a hold up after Gaia stepped on the scale, because she had broken the thing. It topped out at 640 pounds, so the redhead must have been a bit over that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Kunoichi were weighted, but Naruko didn't recognize anybody else, so she stopped paying attention to the numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group was led into a large sparring area, where the statue of a hugely obese woman several times bigger than most of the girls in attendance and a male that was a mountain of muscle that made the Jonin look lanky holding hands was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man that was similar to Kakashi in size walked into the middle of the arena and explained what will happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, because so many teams have passed we have to hold a preliminary round. This will be similar to the finals, but instead of multiple fights you will only fight once to see if you advance. As a little extra rule... </span></div></div>",

When Naruto gets one bite, Kakashi and Rin return.

It was early morning and he hardly sleep all night worrying about his upcoming test, now it was only a short time away. This test was one of the most important test he would have to take as it will be the first step in achieving his dream, becoming Hokage! But as of right now he was scared of taking his test. Although not because it was a hard test, it was, but because that it was not just up to him alone to pass but with a partner, and not just any partner but a girl partner, and that made him nervous. Normally he would be very confident in himself, but relying on another he was not used to. For most of his life he always had to take care of himself, and now he was going to be pared with a girl for the rest of his life and that scared him. Was she going to be mean to him like everyone else, was she not going to be as driven as he was in achieving his dream, or worse was she not big enough to achieve his dreams. He then thought about the resent events that happened to him. Him learning about how he poses the Nine-tailed fox within him after stealing a scroll, how that would effect their relationships. He began to think about how he was betrayed by one of his teachers because of the Nine-tailed fox that lies within him. Lucky he was saved by another teacher, the one who will give him his graduation test, Iruka Umino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm clock chimed snapping Naruto out of his thoughts. He quickly looked at the clock on his nightstand see that he was running late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn,\" he yelled as he hopped off his bed and quickly started to pack his gear. He ran around his house gathering his clothes before bolting out of his abnormal large door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning down the road to his school, passing houses that would be considered to be too big for a average man with doors bigger then the width of couple of men, all to accommodate for the large women population of their tribe. Although for the most part women was similar size to men with the exception of female ninjas. With kynoichi on average being almost one-and-a-half to two times bigger then their male counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was crouching in front of the massive school huffing and puffing. As he was catching his breath he looked up to see that the rest of his class was already waiting. Although most of his class he didn't know personally there was a few familiar faces. Neji, Choji, and his self-proclaimed rival Sasuke stood near the entrance of the school with several other boys just chilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto, I see your actually on time for once,\" Choji said while eating a bag of flavor chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world,\" Naruto huffed. He then looked at the other boys before returning back to Choji, \"hey where is the rest of the guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their taking different test from our own,\" Sasuke spoke annoyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different test? There other kinds of tests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea but that doesn't matter, your not going to pass this one,\" Sasuke stated strongly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rushed to Sasuke's face with a serious face, \"Oh yea well I bet you I'll get a girl long before you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if.\" Sasuke said without acknowledging Naruto standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Naruto which girl are you hoping to snag,\" Choji spoke as he opened another bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed as his body recoil back at the question. Although he haven't had thought much on which girl he would want he did have a crush on the two largest girls in there class, Sakura and Ino. Both being of equal size standing almost 8 feet tall and weighting just over 800 each, they was the largest girls in our school, with the next size down being at 7 and 650. The two girls were always competing with each other, over food, size, and most of all over the affection of Sasuke, the strongest boy in the school, although Naruto won't admit that. Being also the largest they are the most desirable out of the other girls, even Sasuke wanted them, although he wouldn't tell you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, I... I was hoping I get Sakura,\" Naruto said sounding a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke scoffed. Naruto quickly turned to face Sasuke, \"Oh yea! I'll take you on right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud cough come from the entrance of the school. Everyone quickly turn to see that Iruka Umino was standing there with a clipboard and looking sternly at Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone line up,\" Iruka commanded. The boys quickly formed a line shoulder to shoulder in front of their teacher with Naruto snorting at Sasuke before he fell into line with the rest of his classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boys, your graduation test will begin shortly. But before you all begin I have a couple of things I want to discuss with you about the test. First of all this test is to test your ability to track your kunoichi, this will be essential in a mission if you two ever get separated. Secondly inside you will find a underground maze where five kunoichi will be hidden throughout the it with several different types of traps guarding the pathways. These traps are to test you on your ability to fight, dodge, and maneuver around danger either by the traps or by you fellow classmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised his hand went up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only five girls? There is about ten of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, not everyone here will able to pass and those who fail will have to retake the test next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dread fell upon the boys as the realization that less then half of them will pass this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly, once you find your kunoichi you two will be escorted out so nobody will try to find that kunoichi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and his classmates stood in silence contemplating on what was in store for them. If one of them was following the trail of one of the kunoichi and that kunoichi's chakra signal disappeared before found them then you could be lost and have to start all over again. Secondly since there is only five kunoichi that mean that they would have to fight each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" Iruka started, snapping the boys out of their thoughts, \"if there is no more questions we will begin the test shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for a response Iruka looked at the boys gauging there response. Some of them was panicking, including Naruto, while others remained clam, like Sasuke and Neji, confident in their abilities. \"Ok then, follow me,\" he said when no questions arose. He walked away from the doorway and headed towered the nearby forest, the boys following close behind him.</span></div></div>",

It was covered in moss and vines, hiding most of the doorway. Iruka hadn't slowed down as he walking into the structure, wile the boys hesitated in front of the out of place entrance looking down the dark staircase. That was until Sasuke and Neji entering it first prompting the others to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staircase was dark and moist, with only light illuminating was by the entrance and exit way down bellow. They slowed walked down into the darkness barley able to see Iruka. Luck for them it was a short way down before they came into a large concrete room. It was dimly lit by a couple ceiling lights and ahead of then was several hallway also illuminated dimly. Iruka stood in front of the hallways facing the boys as they entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok boys, this is where you start. Down these halls are the girls waiting for you to find them. On my mark, they will start releasing chakra and do what is needed to track them down.\" Iruka then pulled out a walkie-talkie, \"start!\" Upon the signal the boys made a couple of hand signs and concreted on the oncoming chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent as the boys stood in a line waiting for any sign of the girls chakra. It was a couple of minutes before the first boy detected any chakra, and to nobody surprise it was Sasuke. Without making a sound he bolted forward into the most left hallway. As if on cue some of the boys looked at each other in confirmation and rushed in following behind him. Shortly after that Neji detected something and ran into the middle hallway. Soon one by one the line of boys dwindle as they ran into one of the entrances or following one of there classmates, and after a couple of minutes almost everyone has went into the maze, that is all except one, Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood still now starting to sweet as he tried to concreted on feeling anything from the hallways. Although he could of followed one of the boys or just guessed like some of the other boys, this was a matter of pride for him and need to prove that he had the making of a good ninja. But even with that he was beginning to strain as he stood there in silence concentrating with all his might as Iruka watched from the wall off Naruto's left. Iruke, although looking calm, was worried for the student he as grown fond of. He knew Naruto was one of the weakest of the students in his class externally, but he also knew he had the most potential out of everyone to become one of the greats. But if dose not succeed here Naruto might lose all his confidences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he thought that Naruto jolted in shock as if something nipped him in the butt. Naruto, with a large smile growing on his face, quickly looked down the most right hallway. With surprising speed he bolted down the hallway with Iruka smiling feeling relieved.</span></div></div>",

Each screen was on showing each student as they progressed through the maze. Once Naruto zipped into the maze Iruka had opened a nearby hidden door that lead into this observation room. He took a seat and began to observe the students progress. No surprise to Iruka that both Sasuke and Neji was doing the best as they dodged traps and pitfalls in the dim lited maze. Occasionally he would see a student or two fighting off other students when they cross paths or caught up to students that they were fallowing. There was only four girl to the ten boys, so fighting was inevitable. Then Iruka turned to the screen that showed Naruto's progress, and he was persistent Iruka had to give him that. Although Naruto kept moving forward he really didn't have much for situation awareness. Iruka could see that Naruto would rush into traps, triggering them, and barely dodging the knifes and needles or dropping into pits with spikes, either barely jumping over them or catching the spikes themselves preventing himself from being skewed. For a accident prone boy he was extremely lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was catching his breath from his latest trap that he narrowly escaped, a collapsing ceiling.

But to him that didn't matter, he was just too ecstatic that he could feel that chakra that fact that he almost died a couple of times didn't bother him. The chakra he felt warm and strangely soft, a lot different the what he felt from school practice. From school it felt more rough and stiff, he's sensei told them that's because they was not that compatible with it, some girls will be more compatible with them then others and they'll know it when they feel it. So Naruto knew whoever chakra he was following it will be compatible with him and this made him excited. So excited that he over came his tiredness quickly, running down the hallway... and into another trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead end again, arg!\" Naruto yelling at a wall as he collapsed to the ground in frustration. This has been the seventh dead end in a row. Even though he could feel the chakra he couldn't tell where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat there scratching he head in frustration thinking on how to find this girl. He as been running though this darn maze for almost an half-hour and he was starting to panic. He knew that the longer he took to finding this girl the more likely the chance someone else would find her, which means that the flow of chakra would end, which means him being lost in the maze, which means that either he finds a new chakra to follow or fail, and if he failed that means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I'm not going to fail!\" He yelled as he jump back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only hope of not failing was that he still felt the chakra and that he was getting closer was that the chakra he felt was getting stronger. Quickly he turned around heading back where he came from desperate to find his new partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just dodged another trap and was hoping down the hall removing some of the needles that did successfully pin him. But that didn't stop him because he knew he was close, very close. The chakra felt like a thick fog compared to a light haze from the beginning. His body was pumping with adrenaline pushing him though the bruises and cuts as he came close to what appears to be a strong light coming from around the bend. In this maze of dimly lit hallways it was the brightest light by far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it, did I make it?\" Naruto thought as he quickly hobble to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turn the bend he was suddenly blinded by a bright light that he had to cover his eyes. It took him a moment for him to adjust to the light before he could see who was in the room. And who he saw was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the well lit room sat the chubby girl on a large simple metal bench in the center of a grayish marble room with a very large simple metal door behind her. Hinata hasn't noticed Naruto coming around the corner as she had her eyes closed, her hands clamped together concentrating on releasing her chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just stared at Hinata for a bit, mostly just to catch his breath, as he gradually  realizing that he had succeed in finding a girl. Slowly he took a step into the room, echoing in the mostly empty room. Hinata immediately snapped out of her concentration quickly turning to the entrance to the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata heart stopped as she looked at Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na-Na-ruto-o-kun?\" Hinata stuttered, then she began to fall to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Naruto lunged at Hinata catching her before she hit the ground. Grunting as he struggled a bit both because of his weaken state and how much Hinata weighted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, are you alright?\" Naruto said looking down at Hinata's surprising lean face given her plump body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must've weighted no more then two hundred but it was hard to see through her baggy clothes. But from Naruto could feel she must have had a large backside and a surprisingly large bust given her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be exhausted,\" he thought as he attempted to wake Hinata up, failing to notice the small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka watched Naruto's attempts to wake Hinata up, he exhaled in relief. The last several minutes was stressful as he watched Naruto stumble upon this room. Naruto got lost so many times that even Iruka didn't know where Naruto was sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka slowly got up from his chair, stretched and turn to a door to his left, \"time to meet the newly formed couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata slowly got up with the help of Naruto the metal door opened grabbing both of their attention. Iruka now stood in the doorway clapping, \"Congratulations Naruto and Hinata, now follow me to the waiting room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two followed Iruka down a tall and wide concrete hallway, it was a short trip as they came to another large wooden door. Upon opening it Naruto and Hinata saw a large very nice room. Hanging on the ceiling was several modern lamps while the walls was covered with a light blue wallpaper with a white marble floor with another large wooden door at their right. Along the walls was several large love seats, made for a girl and boy can sit together, and already some of them was occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you made it\" cried Choji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Choji sitting at one of the love seats in the middle. Next to him sat a grumpy looking Ino eating one of Choji's bags of potato chips. Choji giving a thumbs-up and a big smile to Naruto. On Choji's right sat Neji and Tenten just sitting there awkwardly, trying to avoid eye contact with each other. And on the left of Ino was Sasuke and Sakura, Sakura looking very pleased with herself and Sasuke looking stern as if nothing has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Choji I see you made it, and made a good catch,\" Naruto said as Ino huffed in irritation. He and Hinata then took a available bench next to Neji and Tenten. Neji turning to Hinata with a judgmental face while Hinata looked down to the floor trying to hid how happy she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two took their seats Iruka can see how out of place Naruto and Hinata was from the rest of pairs. Sakura and Ino just sitting was over a foot taller than Sasuke and Choji, while Tenten was half-a-foot taller then Neji. Hinata was the only one who was smaller then her male partner. She was also the smallest in weight as both Sakura and Ino took up nearly two-thirds of the couch size love seats while Tenten taking only half. Naruto and Hinata looked so small in the oversized seats as both of then just taking up only half of its length. Even Naruto stood out as he had the more cuts and dirt then all other three boys combined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka then pulled out his walkie-talkie and put it to his mouth, \"Okay that everyone, find the rest of the students, treat them for injuries and sent back to the school.\" Iruka put the walkie-talkie away and clapping his hands together to get the attention of the couples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, this is a monumental achievement for all of you and should be proud of yourselves. Now ladies, the partner that found you is the best to resonate with your chakra so it is best that you practice with your partner so that the flow of chakra between you two is second nature,\" Iruka looking at Ino for a moment catching her eyes, \"and gentlemen, I know you guys feel quite proud in 'catching' yourselves a girl, but you must treat your partner with respect. You will need to take care of her needs, inside and outside of battle. There is some things that your partner can't do so it's up to you to take care of those limitations. Now if you all follow me, we can register you in and assign you with new living quarters unless you already made plans.\" Iruka stated, then walked to the wooden door to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one they left their seats and followed Iruka down the well lit hallway to the register building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was looking at some mission reports that she just recently received. Although it was not easy to read such papers given her size. She was a giant of a woman, standing just shy of nine feet and weighting well over two tons. Her two mountains of a breast made it hard for her to see anything under her or in front of her as they rode up to her chin. Giving support to her bust her dome of a stomach was only slightly bigger then her breasts jutting out of her with very little sag. Her rear was just as big as her top needing a couch for each cheek just to sit comfortably. Standing next to the enormous Tsunade was Jiraiya, her partner, helping her with the paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here is the papers for new couples, from the academy\" Jiraiya said picking up several pieces of paper from his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hu,\" Tsunade said too focus on reading a report, one of many that laid across her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no surprise that Sasuke and Sakura got connected, he is one of best student we had in years and Sakura is one of the biggest girl this year,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hu,\" Tsunade said again as she moved to another report with some struggle. Jiraiya rolled his eyes at Tsunade response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then their is Choji and Ino, after that Neji and Tenten, and finally...\" Jiraiya stopped taking a look at Tsunade to see her reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who's the last group,\" Tsunade said looking away from her papers and down to Jiraiya with a frown, her cheeks puffing up in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last Naruto and Hinata, hmmm.\" Jiraiya thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, congrats on Naruto connecting with someone, I really wasn't sure if he could, but with Hinata, that an interesting pairing.\" Tsunade said as her expression changed to worriment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, although Hinata is the smallest in her class her fat actually contains three time more chakra then most other girls, I haven't seen someone with this much chakra concentration in many years. Then there's Naruto...\" Jiraiya said before becoming quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concern for Hinata's well-being,\" Tsunade stated looking down her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, when the a generator  give chakra to her user chakra also comes back to her, like a circuit. So the one who has the strongest personally of the two tends to influence the other one's personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Naruto outgoing nature is clearly more dominant then Hinata timid nature.\" He said while scratching his chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now normally that's fine, except that Naruto has the, *cough* the you know what, inside him.\" She said as she looked around the room seeing if anyone else was listening on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we better keep a close eye on them.\" Jiraiya said looking out the window seeing the school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was sitting on a bench outside of the house of Hyuga with his hastily packed shuffle bag. After leaving the school Hinata said that her family would provide them a house upon passing which was great news to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at Hinata's home there there stood only three people waiting outside of a large house for Hinata. One was a stern looking man who Naruto thinks might be her father. Next to him stood two large women, an middle age woman standing a bit over eight feet tall and weighting about half-a-ton while the other more younger one stood six-and-a-half and weighting probably over five hundred pounds. Both had an exaggerated hourglass shape, probably something to look forward to in Hinata Naruto thought. He presume they was her mother and sister, but he couldn't tell if the sister was younger or old given how she was bigger then Hinata. Upon looking at their faces he could see that they looked displeased. So now he was sitting outside waiting for Hinata to finish talking to her father, and by the little he could hear it was not pleasant. He didn't know what problem between Hinata and her family, he barely knew Hinata, which was going to change once he starts living with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow having time to think it was now dawning on him what this all means to him. Things are going to be very different from now on, no more being a prankster, no more doing things on his own, going on mission, and sharing a house with a girl. Thinking all this made Naruto scared, it was a lot for a fourteenth year old boy to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Naruto could think about it more Hinata came out of the house with a defeated look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright Hinata,\" he asked as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yea, everything is fine,\" Hinata jolted and quickly put on a smile. \"The place is all set, w-we better go and check it out.\" She then walked away from the house back to the village while Naruto followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short walk from the mansion as the sun was starting to fall behind the trees before Naruto spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, what's the deal with your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata froze a little from Naruto's bluntness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-everything is fine, they are j-just a bit serious,\" she answered hiding her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure? I would think that your family would be happy for graduating.\" He said was he put both arms behind his head looking to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" she sadly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they won't celebrate they we'll have our own party to congrats ourselves for passing,\" has said joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Hinata smile, this was why she loved Naruto. She didn't want to tell him that her family was very disappointed by Naruto being the one paired with her. Inside the her home she was scolded by her father for getting such a weak genin. Her father was planning not give them a house as punishment until Hinata argued that it would look bad for the house in the public eyes if he wouldn't give a home for his own child, how would he treat his business deals? Her father was shock by such boldness by his meek daughter. She even was surprised but she couldn't stand for her father insulting Naruto. So in the end begrudgingly her father gave her a decently nice house about half way between their estate and the village. And as the two walked closer to the house the better she felt just in the knowledge of her being with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path to the house was a wide cobblestone road leading into the forest. It was good that it was just a short walk to the house for Hinata as she was getting tired from everything that has happen, mostly from her family. The house itself was in a traditional minka style and stood fifteen feet tall with a twelve feet tall twelve feet wide bamboo door. It looked bigger then most homes Naruto as seen for ninjas, in fact it looked too big for them as both of then stood below six feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the door open with surprisingly ease, the two slowly stepped into the large house. Taking their shoes off and entered the living room they was amazed by its size, although it was a simple room that had a large table in the center. With great excitement Naruto bolted thought the rest of the house existed to see what this house had for them. One by one Naruto swiftly open doors to see what was lay inside. Regardless of the house's size he quickly went thought the entire house as it only had a couple of room. One bedroom, a very large kitchen, two bathroom, and a big twenty foot walk-in bathtub, large enough for a very big girl. Hinata took her time exploring the house before her and Naruto's stomach told them it was time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in the large kitchen wondering what to do. Even though the counters and cabinets was normal size, everything else super sized. The dishes, bowls, the pots and pans, even the fridge was almost twice of that Naruto was use to. Also Naruto has never cooked before except for instant ramen. Luckily Hinata knew a little bit of cooking to make something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can make something Naruto-kun.\" Hinata speaking softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to her in surprise, \"really? That's great, I don't know that much about cooking, but are your ok with cooking for the both of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled, \"it's not a problem Naruto-kun. I'll just make something simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hinata, I guess I'll go wash up a bit, I'm beginning to smell.\" He said rubbing the back of his head as he walked toward the room with the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quickly turn away from Naruto hiding her blush as she thought of seeing Naruto's naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was drying his hair with a white towel as he walked toward the living room. It really dawned on him how big this house was when he went into the bathtub. He felt so small that he thought he was in a small swimming pool with how much water there was. He was in there for an hour before Hinata called him for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the living room his stomach growled from the smell of food hovering in the air. Upon entering the room his eyes went wide at the food that was set on the table. On the table was two gigantic bowls of raman, each being about two feet in diameter. Sitting next to the table was a pot so big that Naruto could probably fit himself inside it, he wondered how Hinata could carry such a thing. The ramen bowls was filled with big slices of pork, fish cake, and scallion among other things. Hinata was already sitting down, patiently waited for Naruto. As Naruto was being amazed by the food Hinata as blushing upon seeing Naruto, he was only wearing a tank top and a pair of boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Hinata this looks delicious,\" he said excitedly as went to the table sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just blushed harder as she looked away from him in embarrassment, \"th-thank you Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both gave thanks and dug in, Naruto eating his quickly while Hinata was ate hers more slowly but still faster then most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is delicious!\" Naruto exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-thank you,\" Hinata said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was too focus on the delicious food to see Hinata's face becoming more red every passing minute. Her mind was in a state of euphoria, this was the greatest day of her life! Not only did Naruto found her in the maze making them a team, but also living together under the same house, cooking, bathing, and sleeping together like a married couple. She almost fainted as her body shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her bowl she saw that Naruto was eating his second bowl of ramen. She began to think about her body. She knew that she was small for her age being only 220 lbs and standing only at 5 foot 10. It's not like she didn't try to grow, both by her and by her family, but she had a faster metabolism them most people so her growth was slow. Even her younger sister Hanabi was more then twice her weight and eight inches taller then her, and she was five years younger then her! But before today she didn't have much of a drive to get bigger, and now being teamed up with Naruto and she didn't want to be small and weak anymore, she need to get bigger for his sake! Determine to grow and not have any leftovers for tonight she went to the large pot and scooped up a large amount of ramen for herself, more hungrier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat in silence as they ate bowl after bowl of ramen. When Naruto finished he ate three bowls feeling stuffed, while Hinata started with her third. Naruto was about to thank Hinata for a wonderful dinner before he saw that she was still eating. He didn't want to interrupt her as she looked very focus on her food, but also he never saw a girl eat this closely. Naruto remained quite, his face turning red, as he watched Hinata went for her forth serving, then her fifth, then her sixth. He was mesmerized by her as she keep eating with a steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time she finally put down her chopsticks and her bowl after drinking it's broth, her breathing quicken as she rubbed her swollen belly. That's when she saw Naruto staring at her. Immediately her face turned beet red. They was just staring at each other for a minute in awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... It's getting a little late,\" Naruto spoke, his voice a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just nodded and they both got up, quickly cleaning their bowls, and awkwardly walked to the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes they both came out at the same time both still embarrassed. They was both in their night clothes, Hinata wearing a simple light pink gown that went to her ankles while Naruto was just in a pair of orange boxers. As Hinata almost fainted upon see Naruto's almost naked body, Naruto could clearly see Hinata's curves. Although not as extreme as the other two women that greeted them, he could see she inherited the same body shape. He could also see that her belly was bigger then this morning when he was trying to wake her when she fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more awkward silence sitting on their beds, a floral room divider separating the two of them, they both nervously, at the same time, said good night to each other and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

Naruto didn't stir as he continued to softly snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, it's time to wake up,\" Hinata repeated saying it with more energy. Naruto still didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun! Wake up, we're going to be late!\" Hinata yelled in a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sprung up from his bed his eyes snapping open. Hinata jumped back in surprise as the two locked eyes with each other. Naruto now sitting up on his bed blushing as he look at Hinata standing at the foot of his bed having forgotten that now lived with a girl, and Hinata blushing as she looked upon Naruto's half naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-m so s-s-sorry N-Naruto-kun!\" Hinata quickly said as her body stiffen. Hastily she scooted backwards out of the room slamming the sliding door in front of her. With Naruto out of her sight she was able to calm herself down enough to form cohesive thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto-kun, we need to hurry or we'll be late for our first lesson with our new sensei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what Hinata has said he jumped out of his bed panicking running around the room looking for his clothes and gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally Hinata was much more punctual in her morning routine, as in getting up early, but because of yesterday's events and eating dinner till it hurt she had over slept. Lucky for them Naruto was much faster at getting ready then Hinata was but unlucky for them they had to slip breakfast. Quick they both ran out of their house barely having enough time to shut their door upon leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi was looking at down at his watch expressing no emotion as his watch showed 9:05.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! We're here!\" Yelled a blond hair boy running down the path with a dark blue hair girl trying to minimize her body jiggling as she held her arm over her breast not far behind him. Kakashi looked up at the two young ninja as they came right up to him huffing and puffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late,\" Kakashi said sternly, \"I should fail the both of you. Being late on a mission can cost you the lives of those around you including your team mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to defend himself but Hinata spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sensei,\" she plead as she bowed, \"it was my fault that we are late. I took too long on getting ready and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi put up his hand stopping her. \"I don't want excuse. Just make sure that you make it on time next time. Now stand in line with the other two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sensei!\" They both bowed in thanks and rushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was surprised by  Hinata for taking the blame. He was so used to taking the blame regardless if he deserved it or not. The fact that Hinata stood up for him really meant something, but before he could finish that thought he saw the other two young ninja's that he was supposed to line up next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, Sakura!? What are you doing here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ninjas stood side by side, Sasuke crossing his arms over his chest and looking at the ground before looking up at Naruto and Sakura who was standing very close to Sasuke. She moved her hands to her wide hips as Naruto and Hinata walked toward them looking sternly at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here for our test stupid,\" Sasuke said ignoring Naruto existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Naruto could counter back Kakashi intervened by placing his hand on Naruto's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save the fighting for the test.\" He said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Naruto and Hinata lined up next to Sakura Kakashi spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now before we begin I'll like to congrats you on your pairing,\" he said with what looks like smile under his ninja's mask. \"I'm Kakashi Hatake and I'll be your future sensei, but here on out things will get hard. And before I train you I'm going to test you and if you don't pass this test you and your teammate will be separated and be sent back to school for another year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto and Sakura yelled as Hinata brought her hands to her mouth in disbelief. Sasuke just looked up to Kakashi now showing some interest in what was currently happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the big leagues and I will not tolerate failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to panic, he came so far and... no this wasn't time lose his cool, he need to be confident and be brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take anything you throw at me, I'm not afraid!\" Naruto blurted out. Hearing Naruto's confidence Hinata lost some of her nervousness and began to smile at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, let's see if that attitude persist.\" Kakashi said looking sternly at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your test is simple,\" he stated as he put his hand into one of his pockets, but before he could continue everyone heard a pair of growls. They all turn to look at both Naruto and Hinata as they become embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sensei, we didn't have breakfast,\" said Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Kakashi with his other hand went into one of his chest pouches and pulled out a normal white pill bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that Sensei,\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he started as he opened the bottle and took one out putting it between his finger and thumb showing it to the young ninjas, \"is a Hot Calorie Pill, it's a emergency pill that is given to you when your out on missions, just in case food is hard to come by. Each pill contains five hundred calories, so I recommend that you don't take to many.\" He then took out five more pills and gave two to Naruto and four to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this amazing, why don't we get them all the time,\" Naruto said quickly swallowing the two pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sensei, can I have two more,\" Hinata asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi looked at her sternly but gave her two more. \"It's not good to take too many of them, you'll get temporary fatigue like after you ate a large meal and in a fight that's not good. Also they have very nutritional value, so there are not good at filling you up. They also sometimes cause mood swings in some people, so taking them at any time is discourage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata had a harder time swallowing the pills then Naruto had but she eventually ate them all. That's when from her belly grow outward she felt a strange sense of tiredness follow by a small feeling of aggression that Hinata quickly shook off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting back the bottle he when into another chest pocket and brought out a small bell, \"continuing what I said my partner, Rin Nohara, is hiding in the forest,\" Kakashi pointed to a small forest to his right,\" she will be holding just one bell just like this somewhere on her person. Your job is to take it.\" He finished with a grin. \"And once a team got the bell or it become sunset the test is over and whoever's team has the bell pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence fell upon them as the wind blew through the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Naruto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it.\" Kakashi stated flatly. \"You can use any tactic you wish to achieve this goal. You have five minutes to prepare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Hinata said feeling a growing fear, \"if there is only one bell that mean only one of the teams will pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's correct.\" Kakashi respond without changing his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensions filled the air as the realization downed on them that two of them as guarantee ot fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi then turned toward the forest and walked to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, where are you going,\" Sakura questioned looking at him worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi just lifted his hand above his head and waved to them continuing to walking without saying a word. Before long he disappeared into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence presided as the two groups looked at each other either of them wanting to make the first move. Breaking the silence Naruto put his hands behind his head cradling it and closed his eyes, \"Ha, it will be fun to beat you Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just ignored Naruto as he look in the direction of where Kakashi entered the forest, but Sakura became furious as she stomped her way to Naruto, shaking  the ground with ever forceful step she took as her entire body shaking like jello. If it wasn't for her size it would have looked funny as she towered over Naruto her hands on her hips anger painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, well all we have to do is sit on you to win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I can run around you and your fat butt all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto you stupid knucklehead!\" Sakura moved forward so she could ram Naruto with her giant gut but Naruto quickly jumped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just tuned out the two's arguing as he thought about Kakashi's test. It seem too easy, especially if he had to face Naruto, and wandered if there was any traps waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi was lay on a large branch back against the trunk reading one of his favorite books paying very little attention to his new students. Then only real threat to his test was Sasuke and Sakura. With Sasuke's training and Sakura's chakra they was a powerful team. Although there will be some unexpected surprises in the upcoming test, like on real missions. He hadn't expected much from Naruto and Hinata though. Naruto was unfocused and undisciplined and Hinata wasn't very ambitious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kakashi felt a wave of chakra coming from the field. Looking over his book he could see the two girls getting ready. It was obvious to see that they need more training in releasing their chakras as it was going in every direction, wasting it and easy to detect. What did get his attention was how both girls was radiating near equal amount of chakra despite their size differences. It was normal for grils to vary in chakra-to-fat ratio, but to this degree was amazing. Now if Naruto had some kind of hidden skill like Hinata has this test would get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi was not the only one to notice Hinata's hidden power as Sasuke looked upon Hinata from the corner of his eye while consecrating on connecting to Sakura's chakra. There was a small amount of doubt that he made the right choice in getting Sakura, but he quickly pushed that aside as he had a test to pass.</span></div></div>",

Inside, it didn't look like much, the paint looked older than Naruto's apartment, what looks like a reception desk, as well as a staircase that leads to a basement. The group is split in two, with Naruto, Neji, Choji, Sasuke, and the slacker Shikamaru staying while the others leave for a different building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka explains, \"Down there is your test. This is one of several buildings within the forest, and the four of you will enter here, while the others will enter from the other buildings. Now down there will be a maze, with five points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shows them a map of a circular maze that looked majorly complicated, \"The Kunoichi are spread apart equally, and the two buildings are here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe draws a simple star with a pencil, \"And here,\" He makes a similar mark not too far from the other, \"Now then, inside you will have to feel the chakra of the Kunoichi to tell you where to go, and along the way you'll find traps and puzzles. Whether you do good at this or not will either speed up the process to get to a Kunoichi, or slow you down. There are seven obstacles total for you to pass, if you go through more than seven, then you did something wrong and are being slowed down by a wrong answer. Now then, you'll enter the stairwell, and eventually, the main door will open and send you into the maze. Be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the boys enter the stairwell, and get to the bottom of a room that looks like a dungeon, with stone walls and floors and a grated gate blocking the way out. Neji inspects the door, \"From what I see it looks like this hallway breaks off in five routes, meaning we won't see each other again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji puts away his bag of chips and concentrates, \"Come on...Focus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru meditates on the floor, \"How troublesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji closes his eyes and crosses his face, \"Let me see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smirks, \"Gimme what I need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just presses his hands together, and prays, \"Kami, mystery girl, please send me a sign. Anything! I'm good at games, but I suck at tests, please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the gate opens, and Sasuke and Neji immediately begin running through, Naruto swears, \"Oh Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs next, while Choji and Shikamaru jog behind. One by one, they make it through a different hallway, while Choji hollers, \"Good luck, guys!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another day in his normal life. The sun was shining the birds chirping. But most of all, the Kunoichi were hungry and wanting to add some layers to their already fat bodies. <i>\u2018Just another day in my normal messed up life.\u2019</i> Thought the boy. His name was Naruto Uzumaki, the blond haired, blue eyed prankster of Konoha. Wearing his notorious orange tracksuit with blue on the upper shoulder areas, a large white collar, a white swirl on the side of the left arm and red swirl on the back. Completing his attire was a pair of orange pants and blue sandals. Naruto's most prominent trait, however, were the three whisker marks on each cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently he was walking down a hall towards his academy class with three other boys from his classroom. Taking a small glance over his shoulder Naruto hoped that the two boys trailing behind him wouldn\u2019t try throwing him to the females in class to be used as bait again. The first one\u2019s most notable feature was the lazy expression on his face. He had fairly long jet black hair tied in a spiky ponytail, narrow brown eyes, and has both ears adorned by small ring shaped earrings. His attire was rather plain consisting of a green lined mesh T-shirt under a short sleeved grey jacket with green edges, adorned on both the sleeves and the back with a circle with a line through it, brown pants, and blue sandals. He was Shikamaru Nara, heir to the Nara clan and the laziest person you were likely to ever find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him was a boy with spiky, brown hair, swirl marks on his cheeks with a more robust physique than most would expect of an academy student. He was wearing a pair of black shorts, a white shirt with his clan's obligatory kanji for \"food\" on it. Over that was a short-sleeved, green haori and a long white scarf wrapped around his neck. A pair of hoop earrings, bandages wrapped around his legs and forearms and a dark blue bandana styled in a manner to allow two tufts of hair to poke out from either side completed the look. He was Ch\u014dji Akimichi, heir to the Akimichi clan and someone who always seemed to have a bag of BBQ chips to snack on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was in front of the blond. Having drawn the short straw today Kiba Inuzuka was forced to take point and would be the first one to enter their classroom. Kiba was thought of as being rather wild. His messy brown hair, sharp black eyes with vertical slit-like pupils, pronounced canine teeth, and nails probably didn\u2019t help in removing such impressions. Like the other two, he was also part of a clan, the distinct red fang markings on his cheeks clearly showing his claim as one of the Inuzuka clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing dark grayish pants which reached his calves, a pair of blue ninja sandals and a grey, hooded fur-lined coat, with the hood usually placed on his head. Lounging between Kiba\u2019s coat and fishnet undershirt was Akamaru. A small white furred puppy with dark brown patches on his ears, Akamaru was Kiba\u2019s ninkin or ninja dog. All Inuzuka had a lifelong partner and Akamaru was Kiba\u2019s, as well as his best friend and consent companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the door to their classroom Kiba nervously moved to open the door. This had become the normal procedure for entering their classroom. This was due to how as males they could be training to become strong ninjas one day only to find their lives cut short, normally inside the stomach of a fat and hungry kunoichi. In this day and age, a hungry kunoichi was the most terrifying enemy you could come across. Kunoichi\u2019s had the ability to devour other people whole, normally making death very painful for those they ate. This ability however, was only amplified by the hunger most kunoichi experienced throughout their lives. Most girls didn\u2019t develop the ability to eat others till the age of eight but, some rare girls would find themselves going through their first hunger pains as early as four. Males weren\u2019t the only ones on the menu however, as some kunoichi preferred to add more fat to their bodies with each meal then most. Those particular kunoichi often went after other kunoichi. If not for how girls seemed to give birth to large numbers of babies per pregnancy, the hungry kunoichi of the world would surely be the end of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba however didn\u2019t care about any of that. He only cared about getting into class without being eaten, going through role call and getting the hell out of dodge before lunch time came. So he was not particularly pleased with the scene playing out right before his eyes after he opened the door. Wondering what their friend/distraction was seeing that bothered him so, the others slowly crept over to see for themselves. After which they greatly regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched with looks of horror and disgusting at the scene before them. Just on the other side of the door laid one Ino Yamanaka, who was just finishing her most recent catch. The boys couldn't take their eyes off the fat blond as she slobbered all over herself while loudly gulping and swallowing down the poor soul she had caught. Ino was massive, as was her appetite. Her legs were as thick as tree trunks and her fat thunder thighs jiggled with the slightest movement. Her arms were just thick layers of fat with sausage-sized appendages for fingers. When standing her belly normally would hang down to her knees as well as visibly shake and jiggle when it growled in hunger. Finishing off the physical appearance of this 750 pound blob was her round and chubby face with three chins with a forth one well on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrool slid down her fat chin before dripping down to the floor. She lapped her tongue around her meals still wiggling calves. Seeing she had an audience Ino made a show of pulling in the rest of her meal. The boys watched with a mix of disgust and fascination as Ino\u2019s flabby form shook and jiggled with every gulp. Her purple vest like blouse with a raised collar barely covered her fattened assets where as her purple skirt did nothing to hide her fat rear end, which was only covered by a large number of bandages. This however also left her enormous belly in full view for any to see. Now was one such time as the platinum blond was currently lounging on top of said stomach, which was obviously full of her current victims/meals. To finish her appearance were a pair of purple and white elbow warmers, which seemed to be barely holding against her flabby forearms and blue ninja sandals. The girls\u2019 green-blue eyes never left her audience as she gave a small flip to the bangs covering the right side of her face and encircled her tongue to the underside of her current meals feet, that footwear already having been removed. As she closed her mouth around the feet a smile could be seen on her chunky face as she gave a hard swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued to watch on with looks on their faces showing how they felt rather sickened by the sight before them, and yet, they also couldn\u2019t help but fell slightly aroused by the show of dominance from Ino. At least till she loudly belched in their collective faces. \u201cSo boys\u2026\u201d began the blond haired blob \u201c\u2026 who wants to be next to slid down my throat and into my belly?\u201d she asked already drooling at the idea of another tasty meal squirming inside her massive belly. Her enormous belly rumbled as if agreeing and anticipating its next victim, all the while its current occupants struggled against the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Almost half an hour later</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as he sat down in his seat well away from most of the girls in class. It had been close but, the boys had gotten in class without having to sacrifice one of themselves to the gluttonous blond. He shuddered slightly as he could hear the sounds of stomachs churning and digesting their living meals from all around him. He couldn\u2019t help but, wonder what made him such a target for the hungry Kunoichi. Practically every girl in the academy building wanted him in her belly, and during his nearly four years here he had been eaten twice. The first time had been by the pink haired girl named Sakura Haruno, suffice to say any crush Naruto had had on her died pretty quickly after that. The second was from Suzume-sensei, who unlike Sakura, managed to swallow him entirely and left him to digest in her stomach.

Focusing on the heavy object he saw the very girl he had just been thinking about sitting with her side to him and her head turned towards him. A light blush dusted his cheeks at realizing Hinata was sitting in his lap. Shaking those thoughts from his head he gave the shy girl a small grin and greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Hinata.\" Hinata however didn't answer back and simply looked at him with half glazed eyes and an odd smile. \"Umm, Hinata. Is everything alright?\" he asked growing slightly concerned at her odd expression. His only reply was Hinata wrapping her arms around his neck and resting her head on the crook on his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling very concerned he pushed her away enough to get a better look at her. Letting his eyes scan her up and down, he tried to find any hint to what might be causing her odd behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there were her thighs, round and plump, stretching the fabric of her pants. Next he continued upward to her widened hips and expanded butt. A butt that he couldn't help but notice just how soft it was. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen he came to her chest and plump arms. The large gut that she normally tried to keep hidden under her baggy jacket seemed quite larger than normal. Where it would normally sit comfortable in her lap while being covered by her jacket, it now seemed to have almost engulfed her lap. He made a mental note of that and continued looking her over. Though he felt slightly ashamed of himself for letting his eyes linger on her rather large breasts as they rested atop her stomach. And finally he came to her face; her checks were plump and full with hints of a double chin forming. All this gave her face a rounded childish look, one that Naruto couldn't help but find adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned slightly at finding nothing to help explain Hinata's odd behavior, sides the enlarged belly. He knew though that the size was likely from her catching a quick bite to eat on the way to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the frown on his face, Hinata decided to try and remove it the only way her clouded mind could think of. Tightening the hold her arms currently had around his neck, she leaned closer, fully intending to remove his frown. Her approach caught his attention but, it was too late for him to do anything. Thankfully, or not depending on who you ask, Hinata didn't open her mouth to try and eat him. She did however, pucker up her lips and kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pulled back and blinked, cocking her head to the side in a moment of confusion. It didn't stop her for long thou, as she giggled and made another attempt to remove any trace of a frown from his lips. All though embarrassed at the display of affection, Naruto was able to catch a whiff of alcohol coming from Hinata as she kissed his nose. He couldn't help but groan as he realized that Hinata had eaten one of the drunks before they returned home. That explained why Hinata was acting so odd. All the alcohol from her clearly still digesting breakfast had gotten his only female friend drunk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he came into the room, he was surprised to see Mizuki bound in chains to the floor, two anbu keeping him in place. The hokage himself was at his desk overlooking both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in. Welcome, Naruto.\" Sarutobi was a giant of a man. A big bulky hulk, he was a symbol of strength for the whole village. He eagerly awaited the day, Naruto could become his successor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Grandpa? Why's the traitor here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple Naruto. I wanted to teach you the Power Devouring jutsu and I have a perfect target here for you to use it on first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki's eyes widened in fear and tried to say something, but his gag reduced it to incoherent muffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi gets up and approaches Mizuki. He beckons Naruto to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do what I do.\" He made a dozen slow hand signs. Naruto followed along as best he could. Sarutobi looked over every sign, wanting him to get it quickly. Once Naruto was good enough at the signs he went over the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you make the symbols and call out the name, a red glow will go over your hand. Place it on any part of the body you want and it will be turned into a crystal you can eat for power. It's going to feel strange your first time, but the benefits are immediate. You get stonger, bigger, and your chakra capacity grows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do fine Grandpa, after all. I'm going to be hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the symbols, and put his hands on Mizuki's head first. Immediately it turned into a smaller blue crystal. The crystallization spread down his body until only it remained. Naruto broke off the head and swallowed it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were immediate, He grew an inch, his biceps got more defined, and his legs got a bit thicker. Along with the outer change came an inner one as a hunger overtook Naruto and he started eating the rest ravenously. He grew much quicker now. His whole body shot up a head, his back started to tear out of his clothes. His arms seemed to be crammed into the sleeves, the biceps straining against the fabric. His chest burst the zipper, forcing it down with its size. Hidden by the zipper's remains, his abs, barely visible before, tightened into a 6 pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow his waist, his thighs pushed his pants to the limit.Visible through the fabric, the pants looked painted on. His calves were halfway out as the surge in size caused them to ride up. Unseen by all, his cock packed on a couple of inches as his ball thickened slightly. His feet no longer fit his sandals as they hung over the front and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now you are a true shinobi.You should head back to the school, your team should still be waiting for you in the room.</span></div></div>",

Shino being an Arubama had a unique for of the power devour Jutsu that allowed his incts to drain the strength of there opponents, and transfer it back when they returned, of course the big flaw was that if the bugs where killed before returning to Shino then the power they stole was lost.

It was during this time of conflict and death that an event occurred that changed the very world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kunoichi did battle with a shinobi. The shinobi was clearly more skilled then his female opponent yet, instead of finishing her and completing his mission, he took his time to toy with her. It was this attitude that caused both his death and the kunoichi to make a world altering discovery. Angered beyond all rational thought at being played with like an incompetent child the kunoichi lunged at her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew, the shinobi that had caused her such anger was waist deep inside of her. She watched as the legs of her once opponent now meal kicked wildly. Shocked at what she did, she could not stop herself from swallowing him down further. Once the male had been packed away inside of her now giant stomach, she tried to return to her clan. This was of course met with failure as she did not have the physical strength to lug her weighty meal around. After falling asleep, due both to the massive meal she needed to digest and the exhaustion from consuming said meal and trying to move around with it, the women found herself stronger then ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown a few inches in height and her muscles were larger, more defined. Quickly relieving herself of her meals remains she made her way back to her clan and began to inform the other kunoichi of what she had done. Soon her method of enemy disposal and strength acquisition was being used by all of her clans kunoichi. As time went on this method was learned by other kunoichi and used by them in turn. By the time hidden villages were founded, the consuming of others and growing stronger was seen as a normal part of being kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the physical traits started being seen in kunoichi shortly after being exposed to their chakra, giving most late first years and over a more muscled body then their peers. This did not stop the consumption part from being taught, no. It was in fact the first jutsu that kunoichi-in-training were taught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we start our story in Konoha and in its academy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was time for the ninja academy graduation exam. One young boy with spiky blond hair and sky blue eyes sat in his classroom nervously shifting about in his seat. His hands played with the zippers and folds of his orange jumpsuit as he glanced around. The last thing he wanted was to be cornered by one of the muscular kunoichi in-training. In the beginning things weren't so bad. The girls in class were small and not very aggressive. That all changed once they learned how to eat others and add to their mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought back and couldn't help but, find it ironic that the small girls that so many boys picked on eventually ate those boys and grew big. His eyes glanced over at a young girl who always sat in the back. There wasn't much to say as she seemed rather plain. Short dark indigo hair that was nearly the color of the night sky, combed to give the impression of a swans tail in back with two strands framing her face. Her skin was a creamy white and her white eyes held a hint of lavender in them, giving her eyes a soft and gentle look. Her upper body was covered by a tan jacket, while her legs were clothed in dark blue ninja pants and the blue ninja sandals completed her attire. This was Hinata Hyuga, the shyest and at one time, the smallest girl in the whole academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning one would never think that such a kind and sweet girl would ever eat someone. That thought went out the window shortly after the girl learned how to consume others. Naruto remembered that he had saved a young girl from some older bullies. That girl just so happened to have been Hinata before she learned the jutsu. Those same bullies ganged up on him sometime later. He had tried fighting back but, only got hurt more for it. Then Hinata of all people appeared and started eating the boys. Naruto could still remember the shock he felt at seeing Hinata standing over him, asking if he was alright while her massive stomach thrashed around as she started digesting the panicking bullies. That same girl was now in the top five most muscled girls of his class. This made Naruto think of the three most muscled girls. They where Sakura, Ino and the only bully to have avoided Hinata's stomach, Ami. These three had a three way grudge match going as each one wanted to attract Sasuke Uchiha. Any they were willing to devour the entire class if they had to just to make that dream possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt someone sit next to him and turned to see Hinata, making Naruto feel both shocked that she had approached him and nervous as to why. \"N-naruto, is everything ok?\" Asked the larger girl. Naruto gave a nervous smile and told her that he was just a bit nervous. He didn't feel it was right to say that having a potentially hungry muscle girl sitting next to him only made things worse. He had ever right to feel nervous too, for if Hinata decided to make a snack of him then he wouldn't be able to do much to stop her. She surprised him however with how fast she moved as he suddenly found himself sitting in her lap with her strong and muscular arms around him. \"Its okay, Naruto. Everyone here is nervous for one reason or another.\" She said as one of her hands snaked up and started playing with his hair. Naruto blushed as he found himself being hugged close to the girl. The fact that she had placed the side of his head against her chest only made his blush deepen. Oddly as the minutes passed, Naruto found himself starting to relax and just enjoying the feel of her fingers moving through his hair, or listening to her heartbeat. He felt so relaxed and safe that he completely forgot that he was sitting in the lap of a girl that could eat him at any second.</span></div></div>",

It was unbelievably tempting to just open her mouth and start cramming her secret crush in. She idly wondered what he might taste like. Her stomach gave a rather needy sounding growl of hunger, making Naruto stiffen in her arms. It took a bit of effort but, she managed to calm him. Though she realized that she never promised that she wouldn't swallow him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the idea of an easy blond boy snack/lunch out of her mind for a moment. Hinata looked around herself, picking out any potential meals she could have before Iruka-sensei arrived for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata found it a bit odd that she didn't see Ami in the classroom yet. She wouldn't have minded making a meal of the bully. The fact that Hinata knew her muscles would greatly increase in size and strength with such a protein rich meal was just a bonus for her. She quickly moved on however, as she saw no point in wishing for something that wasn't there. The heiress soon spotted a small gathering of the ever shrinking male population in class. She picked out two boys who were known bullies as she had seen them picking on the very boy she currently had cuddled up to her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was truthfully rather upset at how most of the well liked boys had been eaten near the beginning of the academy years. When she had started her academy classes, there had been well over a hundred students with a 3:1 ratio of boys to girls. That was nearly four classrooms worth of students. Over the next four years however, that number had dropped to only her class. Hinata could barely believe that out of so many people starting out only thirty had made it to today and that was only due to an additional batch of students being added to this generation. Of this class nearly a quarter of it was female so, Hinata had no disillusions that the number of current students would be cut in half before the day was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growl of her stomach caught her attention again. Naruto however, didn't stir as Hinata quickly realized that he had drift off to sleep. She stifled a giggle at how cute Naruto's sleeping face was while pressed against her bosom. He was so cute! <i>'And so easy...'</i> She thought while licking her lips. She was hungry and needed to make a meal choice. Would she take the easy meal and eat her sleeping crush? Or would she prefer some of the no name students?</span></div></div>",

They had been all over, and Naruto had met many interesting people, but he was glad to finally return home to Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch had changed since he had left the village, however, and both he and his teacher were in for a surprise when they got back.  During the long period of training for Naruto, a new jutsu had been developed by the kunoichi of his village.  Over time, most of them had mastered it, and were actively using it on missions.  This technique allowed for a female ninja to ingest a target and convert their body into new muscle.  Over time, some kunoichi had grown more muscular than any man in the village, with enough muscle to left multiple ton objects without the use of chakra enhancement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto entered the village gates with the same hyperactive energy he had as a young kid.  He sprinted toward a nearby pole, and with the application of chakra to his feet, ran right up it.  He stood with his arms spread above him and, with a loud voice, exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed this place!\"  He lowered his arms down and placed his hands on his hips and in a quieter voice, continued with, \"it hasn't changed a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how wrong the teenage ninja was in that regard.  Much had changed, and he would soon see that with his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master and student pair started towards the hokage's office, running into Kakashi along the way.  After giving him the new Icha Icha book, the three continued on, with Naruto well ahead of his teachers.  That is when he ran into Sakura, and realized just how wrong he was about things not changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond knucklehead didn't recognize the girl at all until his eyes fell on the pink hair that framed her emerald eyes.  His jaw fell open when he took in all of her.  His childhood crush was no longer the petite girl he remembered, now she had more muscle than he had ever seen on anyone, even the strongman at the circus he had convinced his master to take him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked like she was chiseled out of marble.  Her soft, alabaster skin was contrasted by the size of her muscles.  Her arms were unreal, around two feet around, and that was while they were relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...Sakura?\"  Naruto gasped out nervously as he tried to maintain his composure and not freak out like a scared child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time, but eventually Sakura explained to Naruto what had happened while he was away.  How every Kunoichi was now as musclebound as Sakura, and how they could grow bigger by eating other ninja.  It is here where they would have been tested once again by Kakashi, but a slight emergency arouse that required what was left of Team 7 to depart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spy that had infiltrated the village recently had stolen the specifics for the vore muscle growth technique and was heading back to his hidden village.  There was evidence that he had received help from inside Konoha, but Tsunade would deal with that personally.  The team was tasked with either capture or termination of said individual before this happened.  Either were acceptable outcomes as long as all evidence of the jutsu was kept out of enemy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Naruto.  Looks like I get to show you what it is that this jutsu can really do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In this we will assume that after a set time of exposer to their chakra girls (normally only Kunoichi) start to develop a form of clones in their womb. What these are, are unstable blanks that hold only half of the genetic material they need to be complete. Because of this girls are able to have children with just about anyone, all they need are some genetics from the one they wish to sire child with. This genetic material is usually gathered through sexual intercourse with either another female or a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the <i>'blank babies'</i> as they are called, are exposed to another's genetic material, the girl will remain pregnant. With this pregnancy comes a need for large amounts of food. It is here that a female\u2019s innate talent to consume things larger then themselves comes into play. A Kunoichi with only one <i>\u2018blank\u2019</i> will on average need to consume at least two twelve year old sized meals or one large adult twice a day. As such, the more <i>\u2018blanks\u2019</i> a kunoichi is carrying the more she will need to eat each day to sate their hunger. There are of course oddities and exceptions to these standards. Girls of the ages 10 to 18 tend to have the greatest appetites as they are eating not just for their <i>\u2018blank babies\u2019</i> but, for themselves as well. During these times, girls undergo puberty which seems to increase the hunger the girls go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the large sizes some females can reach as well as the number of <i>\u2018blanks\u2019</i> they can hold, some of the hungrier kunoichi will seek to make meals of other females over searching for a number of males to consume. There are laws that keep <i>\u2018fertilized blanks\u2019</i> (blank babies that have gained another person\u2019s genetic material and are forming into real babies) and their mothers\u2019 safe. Though there are some that will sometimes fall through the cracks and be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen <i>\u2018blank babies\u2019</i> are first formed, girls will have anywhere from one to three \u2018blanks\u2019 form. This number however, can increase with time. After a set period of time a Kunoichi may find themselves forming more \u2018blanks\u2019, with the average speed being one new \u2018blank\u2019 added to the womb every year form this point on. Kunoichi that do not wish to grow anymore \u2018blanks\u2019 are recommend to find a \u201cFather\u201d as soon as possible. In ninja society, the \u201cMother\u201d is the girl who carries the \u2018fertile blanks\u2019 where as the \u201cFather\u201d is the one who shared genetic material (DNA) with the mother to fertilize the blanks. \u2018Blank Babies\u2019 grow to full size in nine months and require anywhere from three to twelve months to be born after receiving DNA from another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo let me make it clear, Kunoichi or Kunoichi-in-training (girls from the last year of the academy) are the only ones who form <i>\u2018blank babies\u2019</i>. These same girls soon after start to view other people as a possible food source and shortly after will begin to consume them for sustenance. Males in this society are viewed as <b>A)</b> Food or <b>B)</b> potential \u201cFathers\u201d for a Kunoichi\u2019s <i>\u2018blank babies\u2019</i>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Graduation day at the ninja academy of Konoha and every member of the graduating class was looking forward to how this day may play out. Some were talking to friends or indulging in nervous habits, like tapping fingers on the desk or fidgeting in their seats. Others, mostly the girls, were rubbing their pregnant bellies while looking over the class, sizing each person up as a potential meal to feed themselves and their newly formed babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time one boy was sitting quietly near the back of the class letting his eyes move about the classroom while his mind wondered. This boy with his spiky blond hair, bright blue eyes and <i>\u201cI\u2019m right here so please kill/eat me now!\u201d</i> orange jumpsuit was the one and only Naruto Uzumaki. Idly, he brushed his cheek with a finger, letting the digit trace one of the three whisker marks he had on both cheeks. Just the other night he had been tricked into stealing the \u2018Forbidden Scroll of Sealing\u2019 by his traitorous ex-sensei Mizuki. As if being tricked into committing a treasonous crime wasn\u2019t bad enough, Naruto had also learned why he was so hated by the village. He was the container of the dreaded Kyuubi no Kitsune, the very same demon that had attacked and nearly destroyed the leaf village. The demon had only been stopped by their Fourth Hokage sacrificing himself to seal it inside a newborn baby, him. This of course had come just before the traitor had tried to kill him. Thankfully, Iruka-sensei had been there and Naruto managed to beat Mizuki with the Shadow Clone, earning him his sensei\u2019s headband and finally graduating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed to himself as he mentally prayed to whatever higher being that would listen to be teamed with a kunoichi that wouldn't try to eat him first chance she had. Where most of the village hated or ignored him, the kunoichi, most of all the younger ones, tried to make a meal of him. Once you were swallowed down and sealed up inside the stomach, it was nearly impossible to get free unless the kunoichi in question let you back out. In the two months before graduation exams he had had twelve attempts made on him with the only one to succeed in eating him, being a girl that hadn't even been trying to swallow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was broken from his thoughts as he heard the sound of someone sitting down next to him. Glancing over he saw the only girl who had managed to eat him; The girl in question was of 12 to 13 years of age, with creamy-white skin and midnight-blue/black hair, brushed back to a small tuff much like a swan\u2019s tail and two long bangs framing her face. The baggy tan jacket with white fur tuffs at the ends and a yellow circle on the outside of her jackets arms with a red tear-like flame design inside couldn\u2019t hope to fully cover the massive cream colored stomach she now sported. Her dark blue pants were stretch as far as they could go and only just covered the bottom quarter of her belly, leaving the middle half for all to see as she went about her day. The standard blue ninja sandals as well as white bandages on her right thigh with a kunai case and ninja pouch over her the left side of her bum completed her look. Naruto\u2019s gaze however, was drawn to the kind and gentle Lavender eyes; eyes that for the life of him always made him excited whenever he saw hunger flash through them. Naruto had helped this girl consume a number of people in the last two months and every time he saw it he couldn\u2019t help but, think that she was so hot as she ate and digested people. This girl was Hinata Hyuga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was the only girl who didn\u2019t try to eat him. He, in an attempt to get away from a girl that had been trying to eat him, had jumped off of the balcony and by pure luck had ended up landing strait into the yawning mouth of Hinata. To say it was a surprise would be an understatement. Naruto had only realized that he had landed inside a girls stomach after he squirmed around for a few minutes. Hinata however, hadn\u2019t realize who had jumped into her stomach until after the girl he had been running from came down and demanded to know which way he had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, Hinata had earned Naruto\u2019s trust. She had not only given the other girl a lie about him running off in some random direction but, she had even thrown him back up. If Hinata had wanted to, she could have simply sat back and enjoyed digesting him with him being unable to do anything but, beg and squirm as he became food for her and her still growing blank babies. Despite letting him out and how kind she was, Naruto had seen the look that would sometimes enter her eyes and knew that she had been very tempted to simply enjoy him. Surprisingly, instead of scaring him off this had only made him respect her more and had since started spending more time around the shy pregnant heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around that time that Iruka had forced him to read a few books about girls and subtle cues they gave, something that he was thankful for now. The reason being made clear as Hinata hesitantly snuck her arm around his before sliding closer and resting her head on his shoulder. The whole time Naruto made no move to get away as he had learned that this was a sign of trust where as making his hand rest on her pregnant belly was a show of attraction. Naruto still couldn\u2019t help but blush at knowing Hinata saw him as a potential <i>\u2018Father\u2019</i> for her blank babies, though he did wonder just how many the girl was carrying. She was much too big to be carrying only one but, seemed a bit small to be holding three. Then again, she was bigger than most of the girls who had twins, so it left him rather confused at just how many the shy girl was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI h-hope we are on the sa-ame team Nar-ruto-kun.\u201d Naruto smiled at the thought, even more so at the fact that Hinata had initiated the conversation. \u201cSo do I. The last thing I want is to end up in some girls stomach just because I showed them the trust we are meant to give our teammates.\u201d Complained the blond as he thought of how dangerous even the simplest missions would be with some hunger obsessed kunoichi as his teammate. Hinata however, gave him a look full of mischief before whispering into his ear, \u201cWhat makes you think I won\u2019t put you in <i>\u2018MY\u2019</i> belly. You seemed so wonderfully snug inside it last time.\u201d Naruto blushed but, didn\u2019t open his mouth as he was unsure how he might respond to the idea of Hinata gobbling him up. Hinata giggled, before snuggling closer while rubbing her belly, the babies were gently moving around; likely due to her heart beating so fast at being this close to her intended. Hinata could barely wait for the day that her babies became <i>\u2018their\u2019</i> babies.</span></div></div>",

Using this cord they can catch victims from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of the cord would be like a flower bulb that had yet to bloom. Once the target has been ensnared by the cord the kunoichi could manipulate the opening to bloom and start engulfing the victim\u2019s body. Once the target is fully inside the cord the kunoichi could decide to take one of two actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAction one would result in unbirthing the victim and nothing more. Once the target is fully inside the cord the kunoichi would retract the cord back into their bodies where once inside the uterus, the cord would open and begin to deposit the person into the womb. The cord would then latch itself on to the victims\u2019 bellybutton, affectively trapping the victim as the opening in the womb also known as the cervix uteri (neck of the womb) would close shut to prevent the new occupant from leaving. More than one person can be unbirthed into a single kunoichi though the number of occupants a kunoichi can have at one time is different for each kunoichi. The victim(s) remain captive of the kunoichi\u2019s womb until the kunoichi herself decides otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen more than one person occupies the womb of the same kunoichi, they are affectionately referred to as womb-mates by the kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second action would also involve engulfing the target inside their manipulative umbilical cord. However, instead of retracting the cord, and by extension the person inside, the kunoichi instead has the cord spasm in a manner that will cause the captive to slowly slide through the cord all the way into the kunoichi. Near the end of the cord however, is an empty sack-like chamber that is very durable. After the victim is emptied into this chamber the kunoichi retracts the cord, channeling her chakra so that the length disappears as it retracts. This allows the kunoichi to in the end only have the victim filled chamber and a small length of cord leading to the now closed opening. From here the uterus will hold the chamber tightly and begin to slowly start twitching. The twitching is to aid the chamber as it fills with an enzyme that will break the captive down into a mess of genetic material. Once the victim has been fully \u2018digested\u2019 the uterus will begin to slowly squeeze the goo up into the kunoichi where it is slowly absorbed. Physical changes can and likely will accrue slowly during this process though it is not uncommon for the changes to only start once every drop of goo has been absorbed and proceed rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorption can be permanent. If the kunoichi does not separate herself from the genetic material that she has absorbed by a certain time frame then the changes will be permanent and the person who was absorbed will be effectively gone. I the kunoichi does separate the genetic material from her body before the time frame is up than the goo that was once a person will gather inside her womb. The goo will over time reform into the person that had been absorbed. This process can however take anywhere from a week to a few months to finish, the time varies from person to person.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe by Unbirthing someone that kunoichi is affectively laying claim to that persons life and future. What I mean is, if a kunoichi manages to unbirth a shinobi or another kunoichi then the one who is unbirthed is effectively enslaved or claimed by their unbirther. A kunoichi can only have one slave/claimed person at a time and cannot claim a kunoichi who already has a claimed ninja. An already enslaved or claimed ninja cannot be taken by another kunoichi just because they have been unbirthed by someone who is not their mistress. Once claimed the victim belongs to their kunoichi until said kunoichi says otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea behind this it that if a kunoichi managed to unbirth you then you weren't really worth having as a ninja in the first place. The only rules a kunoichi must follow that relate to their claimed simply states that the kunoichi can't cause the death of nor order the death/suicide of their claimed, and that they as the new mistresses of these claimed must take proper care of them. Any kunoichi found abusing their slave/claimed will be punished to a degree equal to the abuse placed upon their claimed. Outside of this, kunoichi may do just about anything with their slave. This includes but, is not limited to; using the claimed ninja as a sex toy/sperm donor (if male), unbirthing them and refusing to let them back out, ordering the claimed to perform demeaning and humiliating chores or services (within reason), to making them act as their mistresses support or protector when out in the field of duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe methods to show ownership over a ninja can vary from kunoichi to kunoichi. Some chose to make their claimed ninja wear collars or chokers with their owners name or clan sign. Some have taken to forcefully stripping them of most of their clothes and tattooing a show of ownership into the claimed ninja's skin. Some have even gone so far as to shout their right of ownership out loud to the village just before making their claimed ninja take part in having sex in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ways a kunoichi can treat their claimed ninja differs from kunoichi to kunoichi. Some might be kind and sweet, treating their ninja as if they were everyday normal people. Some can be cruel and brutal beating their ninja for the simplest of things. Others still can act one way for the public only for their personality to make a 180 the moment they are out of the public eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how they treat their claimed ninja or for what reason they chose to claim that one in particular, all kunoichi must perform the same act in order to claim them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iruka was feeling a bit worried. The class bell hadn\u2019t even rung and he was already feeling a sense of dread. So far his students were in their third year of the academy and would graduate by passing their genin exam after a fourth year of study at the academy. What bothered him was that these 10 and 11 year olds were now ready to begin claiming other ninja or to be more accurate, other ninja in training as in their classmates. He had hoped to avoid this for another few months but, as soon as his first student walked in he had known that any hope for that was gone. This fact only seemed to be strengthened as more and more of his students walked in. Or maybe he should be saying his womb enlarged female students. The majority of his female students to walk through the door for class had shown up with large, no, with massive bellies showing that they had already claimed another student for their own. Some of said females even had their bellies shaking around due to the frantic squirming inside them. This only showed Iruka that these girls had caught their ninja victim without knocking them out or they had awoken and had yet to give up their pointless struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIruka sighed in resignation as he began comparing the students that did make it to class and making note of who had yet to show up. He hoped to keep track of who had been claimed and who was still just running late. As he made his comparison, Iruka found himself shocked to see Sasuke Uchiha walk through the door, the same uncaring expression on his face that had been there since the Uchiha Massacre. His surprise stemmed from the fact that 80% of his female students had massive sized wombs and none of them had managed to claim him. The fact that all the girls were part of the Uchiha fan club only served to increase his surprise. Others boy\u2019s to walk through the door on their own included Shino Aburame, Kiba Inuzuka, Ch\u014dji Akimichi and his friend Shikamaru Nara. Ino Yamanaka and Sakura Haruno also showed up, arguing as was normal. What shocked and relieved Iruka was how he saw no massive womb on either of them, indicating that they had yet to lay claim to any ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as Iruka waited for the rest of his students to arrive. It was only five minutes till the bell that Iruka notice something. If his chart was correct then he was still missing one Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. Again that sense of dread filled him. If there was anyone Iruka didn\u2019t want to see claimed it would be those two. Hinata was a shy and sweet girl with massive self-confidence issues. She also happened to have a Kage tower sized crush on a certain trouble making Uzumaki. Naruto was loud and brash but, he was also kind and encouraging. This did little for the loneliness he felt as the blond was hated by the village for the actions of the Demon Fox Kyubi, not that anyone was allowed to tell him this. Iruka seriously hoped that Naruto hadn\u2019t been claimed by some kunoichi with a want for vengeance. If he was then Naruto would be forced to suffer an even worse hell then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to his students he called for their attention. \u201cHas anyone seen Naruto Uzumaki or Hinata Hyuga? Anyone at all?\u201d Iruka couldn\u2019t help but, feel his heart drop when everyone gave him a negative on seeing either of the two missing students. <i>\u2018Where could they be?\u2019</i> he wondered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hinata Hyuga had pulled open the sliding door and stumbled in only moments before the bell rang. The very idea of sweet and shy Hinata being in her current condition had never even crossed his mind as a possibility. Then again the fact that she always fainted when she got too close to Naruto had made the idea of the girl actually ubirthing and claiming Naruto or anyone for that matter seem impossible. Yet here she was. Iruka still shocked at the state of his shyest student just watched as Hinata leaned against the door, panting as her baggy tan jacket and loose fitting blue ninja pants parted a little more with each deep breath. The two normally spacious articles of clothing couldn\u2019t hope to cover her massive cream colored stomach, especially as one could clearly see her bellies occupant squirming around inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sor-ry if I\u2019m l-late sensei.\u201d The poor girl stuttered between pants. Hinata then made the mistake of trying to bow to him in proper show of respect. The change in her center of gravity, plus the squirming and shifting weight of her passenger caused the shy girl to lose her balance and fall forward. Iruka couldn\u2019t help but, wince in sympathy for both Hinata, who was now greatly embarrassed and whoever it was that she had inadvertently slammed into the ground before falling on top of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his scar in embarrassment and awkwardness Iruka merely waved her unneeded apology off. \u201cHinata, you haven\u2019t happened to see Naruto anywhere today have you?\u201d he asked, though Iruka already had a feeling he knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Naruto! Um, w-well you see\u2026\u201d began the seemingly panicked response. Iruka mentally sighed as this all but, confirmed what he thought happened. \u201cIt\u2019s fine Hinata.\u201d He said in a calm and understanding manner. \u201cJust see yourself to your seat.\u201d He finished while helping the young and new mistress of Naruto Uzumaki to her feet. The girl nodded and immediately started waddling towards her seat up in the back, her face bright red the whole way. Iruka watched Hinata struggle up the stairs to her seat, nearly falling back down the stairs more than once as Naruto\u2019s struggles likely didn\u2019t make her climb any easier. Sighing he decided to simply get to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clearly no one had ever thought that sweet and shy Hinata, the girl with the kind heart and low confidence, would ever manage to 'claim' someone. In fact, most people had assumed that Hinata would eventually be claimed. After all, she had the submissive mindset one would expect in a claimed. Hinata herself had believed as much till only this morning. She meet Naruto on her way to the academy and had even spoken with him. She had had a conversation with the boy of her dreams. Naruto had encouraged her, greatly so. Though to be fair, she was pretty sure he had no idea what she had been talking about or even implying. In the end it had all worked out. Hinata had the impulsive courage needed to knock Naruto out and quickly pull him into herself before running, more like waddling, to the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave a small sigh and rubbed her belly, doing her best to ignore the rest of the world and simply bask in the fact the Naruto was hers now. From this point forward they were bonded together. A small smile made its way to her face as she offhandedly thought about never letting Naruto out. He'd be the only Hokage to run the village from inside a girl. She giggled at the image of an older her sitting behind a desk with other ninja taking orders from her massive belly. That would be quite the sight to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe busied herself by thinking of any rules Naruto would now need to follow and the pros and cons to letting him out. She rather liked having him so close to her heart after all. There was even a jutsu that would force Naruto deeper into herself, effectively hiding or shrinking her massive bulging stomach down to a small baby sized bump. If she could learn that jutsu then she could keep Naruto inside of herself without dealing with most of the negatives having him inside her would bring. She would of course still get tired sooner and find herself to be a lot hungrier than before, so she would likely gain a few pounds. Some added weight however was nothing compared to the idea of having Naruto inside of her, filling her with his warm encouraging aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day pasted by rather quickly as Hinata continued thinking on the pros and cons of keeping Naruto inside herself and letting him back out. She also had a small list of rules he would need to follow if she let him out. Nothing bad as the worst thing he had to do was wear some kind of symbol to let everyone know that he belonged to her. Unlike others, she didn't want to strip him of his free will, stripping him of his cloths however was up for debate but, only when they were alone. <i>\u2018Other than that there is the fact that Naruto will need teachings if he ever wants to be Hokage.\u2019</i> Thought the heiress. She made a mental note to make a rule for Naruto stating that he was to learn as much as he could in all areas, most of all being politics as he would need the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the academy let out another thought came to her. <i>\u2018Where are we going to live?!?\u2019</i> It was standard for a claimed and their owner to live together but, should she have Naruto move in to the Hyuga compound or would it be better to move in with him? <i>\u2018Naruto would never be accepted at the clan compound.\u2019</i> She thought as the idea of the other Hyuga tormenting him do to his status as a claimed came to mind. She would not allow anyone to make her Naruto\u2019s life miserable, not anymore. <i>\u2018Guess that means I\u2019ll have to move in with him then.\u2019</i> She thought as her hands went back to rubbing her belly, quite pleased with the knowledge that his home would soon be their home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed her at how much she was changing just by having Naruto officially as hers. She smiled and looked down at the large bulging dome that was her womb. She let her feet take her wherever as she focused herself on her belly and in turn Naruto. She couldn\u2019t help but, love his struggles. From the very first moment he had awakened he had been struggling against her for freedom. Not once had he stopped! She was more than happy to wait until Naruto finally understood that he wasn\u2019t leaving his potentially future home, and knowing him she would likely be waiting for a few days at least. Hinata smiled as she realized that would give her plenty of time to make the necessary changes to Naruto\u2019s place so they could both live there. Or she could just find a better apartment\u2026 She shook her head and decided that would be a last resort, one that she would feel better about with Naruto\u2019s approval. At the thought of Naruto she went back to running her hands over her belly. She loved the movement. The feel of him shifting and moving just underneath her skin; the sensation of her belly bulging and jiggling gently under her hands. She gave a happy sigh, wishing she had been able to do this to him years ago, as she felt so complete. Complete; something that she had never felt before. It was like she had finally found a piece of herself that she hadn\u2019t even known she was missing. She burned his movements and the feelings it gave her to memory while watching her belly contort and shift before her with a smile. Things were finally starting to look up for her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny day in the village of Konoha. The civilians where going about their day as normally while the ninja of the village went about protecting that peace. One young ninja in-training however, was not focused on the village or protecting its peace. The only thing this young kunoichi cared about right now, was getting to her passengers' home and giving it a women's touch. This young girl just so happened to be Hinata Hyuga, who was happily waddle climbing up the stairs to Naruto's apartment. Seeing how she didn't trust her family to not abuse her newly claimed ninja, Hinata had decided that she would move in to Naruto's place instead. It was customary for a claimed (basically slave) to live with their mistress so as to better serve said mistress. Hinata had used this custom to its fullest and would finally be leaving the oppressive life she had behind the Hyuga clan walls. Now she only needed to get to her soon-to-be new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at apartment 444 (In japan the number means the same thing as the triple 6 in America), Hinata blinked. She found the choice of number rather unsettling but, shrugged it off and opened the door with the key she had found in one of Naruto's pockets. The day before she had been depressed but, had amazingly run in to her secret love interest and actually had a conversation with him. She didn't known why but, she had told him about many of things that weighed on her mind. Though she still had enough sense to be vague about some of the things. In true Naruto fashion, the blond had encouraged her. One of the biggest things being that if she wanted something, then she would sometimes need to fight for it. \"Sometimes you just have to take a chance and hope that everything will work out in the end.\" Those had been his words and they had filled her with a sense of impulsive courage that was quite foreign to the shy girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed to herself as she remembered what she had done right after hearing those words come from her crush. She took his words to heart, deciding that she would fight to have what she wanted. And what she wanted, was Naruto. So with that, Hinata promptly knocked Naruto out before dragging him into a nearby alleyway. Just because some girls where willing to do this where everyone could see them didn't mean she had too. So, she quickly stripped Naruto of his clothes before removing her pants and panties. Going through the necessary motions Naruto was soon relocated to her womb. She quickly redressed and stored Naruto's clothes away inside of the many pockets in her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata giggled to herself at how enjoyable it had been to have Naruto awaken inside of her and struggle. His movement had been the best thing she had ever felt in her life, maybe even better then the feeling of taking him into herself, but only just. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Hinata was planning to clean out Naruto's home so she could move in. Expecting to get dirty, she chosen to wear some old clothes that she could get filthy and not morn over. It also meant that they were a bit small on her though not enough to be overly tight. With Naruto inside her however, they where much tighter then they would normally be. Her entire middle was exposed due to her belly, not to mention her breast had grown in size. It was truthfully a normal response to taking someone inside their bodies. Even still, Hinata felt a little uncomfortable walking around the village with her even larger breasts straining the fabric of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Hinata banished those thoughts from her mind as the only thing that mattered was cleaning her new home. She looked down at her belly. Seeing the continued struggles of her passenger made her smile. She had slept very peacefully last night as Naruto's presence inside of her made her feel safe, his struggles rocking her to sleep may have had something to do with it too, of course. The feeling of Naruto struggling inside of herself filled her with an odd sense of pride and joy. Pride at the fact that Naruto continued to fight, refusing to simply give up. She expected nothing less of him. The joy however, was from the fact that as strong willed as Naruto was, he now belonged to her. It also came from knowing that her body refused to let him go no matter how much he fought. One day he would except her as his mistress but, until that day he would remain inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her wiggling dome she asked, \"Shall we see what the damage is Naruto-kun?\" Feeling him give her uterus three hard kicks she took it as him agreeing with her. She did however know that he couldn't hear her, yet. That sort of thing didn't start happening until he spent more then a full day and night inside of her. That was one of the odd things about claiming someone and keeping them locked up. Hinata had looked into how the claimed could eventually start seeing through their mistresses eyes or hear the things they did. Sadly everything she had found was vague and seemed difficult to comprehend until experienced. One thing was sure though, the first link always was being able to speak to each other with out actually speaking. Hinata was looking forward to that and all she had to do to create those links with him was to continue having Naruto locked up inside of her, something that she greatly enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door Hinata was greeted with her first look at what would be her new home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twelve year old, nearing thirteen years old, Hinata Hyuga was in her room, looking at her reflection in her full body mirror. She would be leaving soon to head to the academy for the last time, as today was the day that they would be separated into teams and given a jounin sensei. This however, was currently the farthest thing from her mind. Right now she only cared about two things. The first was Naruto Uzumaki. A blond haired, blue eyed trouble maker who had unwittingly captured Hinata's heart and affection. The second, was the reason for her standing in front of a mirror without anything covering her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why do my breasts have to be so big?'</i>, the shy girl lamented in the depths of her mind. Ever since she was a little girl, she had started developing faster then all the other girls. When most girls where just starting to develop the little bumps that would eventually swell into breasts, she had already been wearing training bras, this however was only due to there not being a bra for her size at such a young age. Hinata still remembered how weird it felt to hear the other girls happily boasting about their boobs finally coming in while she already had breasts half the size of a tennis ball. For the life of her, she could not figure out a reason to be happy about having breasts like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly, she wondered if those visits she had to make to the hospital and all those times they had put shots into her chest had something to do with her size. When she had first been starting out at the academy, she had been brought to the hospital by one of the branch family members. When asked about why they were there, they would only say that it was orders. She hadn't brought it up with her father, thinking that he must have been the one to give the orders and that to question him would be a sign of disrespect. She had to visit the hospital at least once every month during the first three years of the academy. The whole time the doctors would speak with words that she didn't understand and would inject things into her chest, right where her breasts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the last year at the academy, the doctors had asked her if there was anyone that she liked. She apparently didn't need to say it as her body language had given her away. The doctors asked her to bring back a few hairs or something of the sort from this person to them. She saw no harm in it and did just that, feeling thankful for Naruto training so hard that he had taken a quick nap out on the training grounds. That was the only reason she had been able to get close enough to get what the doctors had asked for. After that they had told her she would have one more visit as any others would simply be checkups to insure all was well with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last visit had been only two weeks ago, nearly a full year since giving those samples to them and they had once more injected something into her chest, or more accurately directly into her breasts. Now they felt rather sore but, the doctors said they expected as much and that they would have their first checkup in three months time. She hoped nothing bad came from this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to remove those negative thoughts, Hinata grabbed her clothes and fully redressed. She made a mental not to go out bra shopping later as this one was getting a bit tight. Giving a quick check to make sure her breasts weren't overly noticeable under her heavy jacket. Feeling satisfied that her chest was hidden well enough she started on her way towards the academy, hoping she could see Naruto once more before she was forced to leave him at the academy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danzo considered himself a true patriot of Konoha. Every action he took was for the good and future stability of the village, as only he could lead his village to the greatness it so rightly deserved. He refused to allow his beloved village to grow weak and was willing to go to any length he felt was needed to insure that Konoha was the undisputed strongest of the hidden villages. Sadly, with the Kyuubi's attack on the village a large portion of Konoha's ninjas had lost their lives. The losses had been so great that even a decade later Konoha was desperately low on man power. His current projections left them with another decade before they could even think of saying that they had recovered from such a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo scowled at the thought of his precious village being left vulnerable for so long. He had been unwilling to except this and had started searching through old research notes that his ROOT forces had managed to obtain from Orochimaru's old lab before that fool Sarutobi had destroyed it. This had lead to him finding something very interesting, something that at first glance seemed to be just what his village needed to speed up its recovery to greatness. It was a half finished idea to allow a female ways to produce more children. But it had only come up as a byproduct of some other idea the mad scientist had had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo had been quick to have the idea finished only to soon get a very annoying surprise. The idea involved injecting a certain mixture of compounds into the designated area on the female. These compounds would force the body to form a uterus in the area. This left only so many areas on the human body that the compounds could be injected. After some thought it had been clear that the breasts where the only true viable option. Before he could give the green light to his forces and have this method distributed throughout the females of the village, he learned that the compounds, and the idea itself, had a number of restrictions on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that the compounds wouldn't take if injected into just anyone, only a certain group would be affected. Not deterred by this, Danzo had the mixture crosschecked against every single female in the leaf village. This was surprisingly easy to do using the hospitals records and Danzo soon had a small list of females that the mixture would work on. Then of course he learns something new, just as he's about to send his forces out to collect the people on the list. Apparently, age had a big factor in wether or not this plan would be a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning this had infuriated Danzo to no end as the only person on his considerably small list that fit all of the requirements was the Hyuga heiress. It had taken some doing but, he had managed to have the heiress visit the hospital for the series of injections that were needed for his plan to work. True it would be only one person but, if this worked out like he hoped then he could begin to keep his eyes open for more females that the mixture would work with and slowly increase the villages forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the folder containing the most recent report, Danzo was pleased to find that a fully functional uterus had developed inside the girls milk glands. With this her body would still produce the needed sustenance for the villages future soldiers while they grew inside of her. There where however, problems as no one knew when or even if the girl would birth the future tools. Orochimaru's notes had ideas and theories but, those ranged anywhere from the normal nine months to the babies growing to full size only to stop growing and never be birthed. It was quite annoying but, this girl would make for a good test. Any complications would be studied and dealt with before the next batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudying the report he couldn't help but, feel like patting himself on the back for this stroke of genius. When the girl initially brought his forces a sample of the Fox's jailer, he had been completely against it. However, he quickly realized that he could turn it into a boon if used right. The failed weapon was a orphan and would do anything to keep and protect any family it was given. If he leaked this info to the boy in just the right manner, he could have it loyal to the girl and through his hidden connections he could gain and keep her loyalty, in turn keeping the containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this would work wonderfully. Now he just had to wait and watch.</span></div></div>",

A blonde boy walked through the streets looking up at the faces at the stone wall in front of him. \"Soon\" :he thought and turned left into a street. The boys name is Naruto and his biggest goal is to become hokage to stop the girls of his world eating his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already had to witness many boys getting eaten by girls and smelled what they did to them. All kunoichi had to wear diapers because they ate their male counterparts. It was far more easier for them to do their business in a diaper than finding a toilet. So they never bothered to get potty trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was on his way to school and already thought about a tactic to survive this day. Luckily he found a friend in Hinata. The shy Hyuuga never showed a sign of hunger in his presence. She even protected him in some situations. However she herself would occassionally eat males too. Naruto often saw how the back of her pants bulged a little which meant that somebody had met a terrible fate inside Hinata's diaper. He only hoped to never share that fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly the other girls weren't like Hinata. They only saw food in him. He had to rely on Hinata if the situation got out of hand. No one would mess with the Hyuuga heiress. If Hinata wasn't there Naruto had to fear for his life. He already had some encounters with Sakura and Ino who tried to eat him but he escaped every time. But now on his way to school he didn't have Hianta around to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes someone try to eat him?</span></div></div>",

As he wiped the sleep from his eyes he noticed a familiar weight. His cock was standing at attention in all its immense glory. This sight troubled Him for you see it wasn't just big it was HUGE. So huge in fact that it was  three times as large as HE was, with a pair of testicles to complement it.<br>\r\nIt was a massive pillar of meat standing tall in all its morning wood glory. The problem was that due to its absurd size he couldn't take care of it himself was his comparatively puny hands. No this was a problem for his care taker. Which leads to his next problem. As he looked around  himself  he finally noticed the plush softness of his \u201c bed\u201d for what it really was. He was laying in the valley of the immense cleavage of a Female. In this world  women grow to immense sizes to the point  that men are like dolls in comparison. They are also unimaginably strong, growing massive and powerful  muscles  that complement their titanic forms. And finally, as if to complete them, they grow  ridiculously massive  curves,\u201c Hyper\u201d would be the proper term to describe them, that accentuates and even amplifies their vast innate fertility and strength. Meanwhile all men seem to get are disproportionately large genitals, as if they were made specifically for the so act of breeding with their vastly larger female counterparts.<br>\r\nThis is what lead to the belief that men were simply to small and helpless to be left alone and therefore needed a woman with them at all times in order to take care of them.<br>\r\nNaruto sigh deeply at this thought.  He really hated the way  things were but decided that there was no point getting upset about it. \u201c It is what it is\u201d the boy thought to himself. He turned his head to gaze at the sleeping form of his female caretaker and  decided that he might as well wake her up and get this taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he eventually got his footing he then placed said  cock over his shoulder to make it easier to carry around. He turned to get a look  at his destination, the sleeping face of Hinata, his caretaker. Hinata's relationship with Naruto could be best described a bizarre combination of girlfriend and nanny. When  the village was pairing up the male and female population , Naruto could recall one girl in particular that tried extra hard to get paired with him. This surprised him. He didn't think anyone wanted anything to do with him. She would  later  reveal that she had always admired him from a far. She was inspired by his tenacity to live as best as he can despite the odds stacked against  him, especially since he was a man. She felt that for all the hardships he had to endure she would strive to make his life as burden free as possible. He would never forget that first night she moved into his house. She held his significantly smaller body  in the palm of her hand and took his disproportionately massive member into her mouth. It was the best blowjob he ever had ( it was the only blowjob he ever had at the time but details.) She pleasured him in so many different ways even though it was supposedly her first time, it was as though sex was an instinctive trait  that she  possessed.<br>\r\nHe was pulled out of his reminiscing by an aching throb of pleasure. He cursed himself for thinking about such things in his current  state as he saw his erection grow twice as large as before! Naruto gulped, he was more dick then man at this point. The need he felt from it was almost unbearable. He needed to act fast and wake up Hinata before he was rendered immobile by the sheer girth of his own penis. He wrapped both arms around  what he could  of his meat rod to keep it from shaking  too much and then began to waddle towards his target. It was agonizingly slow going but he had to do this way, if he moved too fast the constant jostling of his dick would just  make him hornier.<br>\r\nAs he crossed the expanse of his sleeping lover\u2019s vast cleavage he briefly  mused about the sheer  absurdity of his situation. A man with a dick many times bigger then himself having  to waddle across his girlfriend/nanny\u2019s  titanic chest and wake her up just so that she can get him off because his dick is simply too big for him to do it himself. Eventually,  Naruto made it to Hinata's face. She looked like she was having  a  nice dream. He really didn't want to disturb her but he was having an emergency over here. Naruto  cleared his throat \u201c Hinata\u2026Hiiinnaataa.\u201d Naruto said trying to wake the slumbering Titaness. \u201c Come on please wake up! I'm really backed up over here and I need your help!!\u201d <br>\r\nHinata  seemed  to stir for a moment. Did it work?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as is the way of the world at times tragety struck and one by one all of this woman's children died in the line of duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck by greif the woman mourned for what seemed like an eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If only I didn't let them go. If only they still needed me.' These an many other similar thoughts ran through the woman's head until in her greif insperation struck, her children didn't want to be ninja when they were babies, her children didn't need to go away and die when they were helpless infants, what's more her children were at their most adorible when they were plump little babies. It was at this moment that the woman vowed to make sure this pain of loss would not be felt again, using her connecitons the woman quickly and quietly gathered support from other greiving mothers of fallen young ninja, then these woman dissapeared taking a number of children, and their mothers, who did not want their dear children die in battle, with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away these women established a new village, one they decieded to call, the village hidden in the nursery, there the children were pampered, spoiled, and fattened until they were as helpless as newborns. Once they made sure their own children were safe the women of the village began working towards making sure other children were saved from the life of a ninja. The grown ups who joined the village were specially trained and began performing raids on other nearby villages, taking women and children to protect them from the horrors of the ninja wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so once a year these, nanny ninjas spread out into the world finding women and children and returning them to the village hidden in the nursery to begin a new worry free existance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow are Naruto and his friends</span></div></div>",

A few days ago, she was investigating the rumors of these unknown female ninjas, as well as the mysterious disappearances of her fellow ninjas. More specifically, the unknown whereabouts of Hinata, Ino, and Tenten. However, little did she know that her investigation had grasped the attention of the Nanny Ninjas from the Village Hidden in the Nursery, where she was sedated and taken to their village, becoming the village's most recent inductee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of a few days, the nanny in charge of caring for her, Himiko Natsume, had slowly chipped away at the female kunoichi's hardened physique, along with giving Sakura some milk imbued with special herbs designed to clog one from using their chakra. Aside from that, Sakura was forced to wear these bulky diapers along with these adult-sized infantile clothes, like onesies, frilly dresses with baby booties, and fleece footsie pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't just her choice of clothes have taken a toll, Sakura's body began to show signs of \"baby fat\". In appearance, she had developed a soft chubby belly, which sat on the top of her diaper with ease. Her arms have lost a lot of muscle definition, covered in a thin plump layer of body fat. Her breasts have grown a few sizes, which was the only thing that Sakura considered as a positive to her predicament. Her face became a little fuller, with slightly plump cheeks and the small beginnings of a double chin. Meanwhile, her lower body had also took some damage as well, with her small tight rump now bloated plump baby fat. Her thighs were laden with a somewhat chunky amount of body fat, as her leg's were gently forced apart by the diaper's bulky padding, forcing the pink-haired ninja to waddle. Overall, Sakura was already past chubby, and was slowly creeping into fat territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was forced to wear a floral pink silk onesie, complete with pink silk baby booties equipped onto her two feet, all from the courtesy of her rotund caretaker, Himiko Natsume. Needless to say, this was quite the most utterly embarrassing situation she had to endure, as Sakura was also fed special herbs that forced her to use her diaper like a  real baby would. At first, the herbs simply forced her to wet or mess her diaper. But over the course of those few days, those herbs began to slowly erode Sakura's continence, regressing her toilet training bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the worst part of her captivity was the fact that she was completely unaware of where exactly Hinata, Ino, and Tenten were located within the village, let alone if they were given the same infantile treatment as well.

Hello Sakura, Anko how are my little sister's Tsunade asked as the two let go of Tsunade we're okay big sis both Anko and Sakura replied before both of their bellies let out loud growls.

Just as the rotund pink-haired girl mildly cradled her double fold belly whilst she waddled and asked, \"So... How were the negotiations with the Hidden Nursery Village leaders, Lady Tsunade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Surprisingly well all things considering, Sakura.\" Tsunade retorted, \"\"Though I'm sure you and Anko are already well-aware of the, er...\"conditions\", the Hidden Nursery Village matriarchs would like us to undergo during our stay here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Sakura knew that the 900 pound diapered Tsunade was referring to both the trio's current corpulence and infantile garments. When they initially first put on such clothing, Sakura undoubtedly felt both embarrassed and humiliated upon going back to wearing diapers. However, over time, as her waistline expanded, she began to see the appeal of basically being a big fat baby, possibly even enjoying waddling around in such thick crinkly undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, both Sakura and Anko certainly had become well accustomed to their current disposition, as the pink-haired kunoichi could vividly hear the audible crinkling sounds emanating from her padded diaper whilst she waddled alongside the obese diapered Anko and Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, Lady Tsunade. The Hidden Nursery Village want us to wholly embrace their lifestyle and culture, as a showing of both good faith and showing we have no ill intent toward them.\" Sakura answered, confirming what said conditions were for the peace talks between the Hidden Nursery Village and Konoha to be successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Tsunade cheerfully patted the rotund pink-haired girl on the head with a rather chubby hand as she answered, \"...Correct. So in order for the negotiations to succeed, we must enjoy ourselves during our stay in their village, even if it means having to pack on the pounds and going back to wearing diapers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after much discussion, they soon arrived at their intended destination: The Mother Bear Restaurant. In appearance, it was quite a large and expansive building, complete with a humongous yet babyish and welcoming sign adorned on the front of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, girls. The Mother Bear Restaurant.\" Tsunade chirped, as she soon approached the front entrance, with both the corpulent diapered Sakura and Anko waddling closely behind the rotund yet heavily diapered female Hokage. Suffice to say, all three girls were certainly going to be leaving the place with full stomach and fatter bodies.</span></div></div>",

Temari's face had a soft smile on it as she stuck what looked like an egg roll into her mouth and took a bite out it. She had chubby cheeks and a double chin her breasts looked about E-cup weren't bound but she had a large bib with three purple moons on it. Her belly looked to have three rolls to it as her belly pooled onto her lap her diaper had the same three purple moons as her bib she looked to be about 500lbs. In place of her fan Temari had a large baby bottle on her back about the size of her fan filled with milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who let out the belch however had long red hair that covered one of her eyes leaving one sea green eye exsposed. \" She's just as big as lady Tsunade!\" Sakura thought Anko let out an impressed whistle as she checked out the beautiful woman before her. Tsunade let out a light chuckle before waddling over to the woman. The woman had chubby cheeks, a triple chin and plump kissable lips she was wearing a blue bib that had the kanji for hungry one on it which barely covered her G cup breasts her belly was slightly smaller than Tsunade's. Her diaper however was much thicker and required eight tapes instead of six as her rear, hips and thighs where much fatter giving her a much more noticeable waddle than Tsunade but they both weighted the same. \" Hello Mei Terumi.\" Tsunade stated as she greeted her fellow Kage Mei jumped slightly at the familiar voice causing her whole body to jiggle \" Hello Tsunade Senju.\" Mei replied back as they both started each other down before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, the Hidden Nursery Village couldn't allow Suna in unless he was Temari's beloved. Apparently, the Hidden Nursery Village matriarchs are quite big softies when it comes to matters of the heart. Though, I can say for certain that Temari here didn't admit such feelings initially. *giggle*\" Mei retorted, as the rotund diapered Temari blushed profusely from the comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Tsunade knew who Mei was referring to: The conclave of leaders of the Village Hidden in the Nursery, known only as the \"Nursery Mothers\". They were a triumvirate of equally large and obese matriarchs who are both the figureheads and the true leaders of the Village Hidden in the Nursery. In order to be allowed into their secretive paradise that was the Village Hidden in the Nursery, one must gain and be granted an audience with such esteemed individuals before one can conduct any sort of business or leisure within the Village Hidden in the Nursery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Tsunade had to endure a lot in order to gain the Nursery Mothers' trust, which included embracing the Hidden Nursery Village lifestyle, much to her reluctance to give in to her inner personal gluttonous desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see. So, I am guessing that Suna had to embrace becoming obese and wearing diapers once more?\" Tsunade asked, which Mei soon answered shortly after swallowing a chunk of delectable ham as she said, \"...Much to my surprise, no. He didn't have to undergo the same experiences we had to embrace. He's still skinny and diaperless as you, Sakura, and Anko remember him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least some things never change. *giggle* But still, I'm surprised Suna hasn't become a big fat diapered boy yet, Terumi-sensei.\" Sakura replied, downing a large bite out of a mouth-watering hamburger after saying such a sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Sakura.

Once inside, Sakura and Anko became bewildered at how much clothes there were, from poofy babyish dresses to frilly onesies to basically anything they could've dreamed of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after wandering through the numerous colored aisles of the Pampered Ninja, the group soon came across a rather large woman.

And yet, the woman had a rather youthful but chubby face, complete with chubby cheeks and a full double chin. Looking downward, she wore a pink and garnet yukata, which did little to conceal both her rotund physique and her bulky crinkly diaper, which was barely concealed by red pantyhose while she wore fluffy blue sandals upon her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama Hiromi!\" Mei gleefully exclaimed, greeting the corpulent woman before them. Of course, in response, the woman, now named \"Hiromi\", turned around to see Mei and the others, which she displayed a warm maternal smile upon her tubby face, just as Mei rapidly waddled toward Hiromi, wrapping her arms around the woman in a loving embrace as Hiromi then said, \"Aww! My sweet, little Mei-Mei. It is so good to see you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And I see you've brought some friends with you, Mei-Mei.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started many years ago, during the times of war. Kunoichi and Shinobi were always trying to grow stronger. Many Shinobi rose to fame where as few, if any, Kunoichi were ever remembered. One Kunoichi decided to change that and though her name has been lost in the times or stricken from the records, she is the one who found a way to allow women to grow in strength and power on the field of battle to the point that even some of the Kage of old were hesitant to face her in battle. She found a way to capture her enemy\u2019s inside of her body, done in a manner that would allow her to draw upon their strength of chakra for herself. This woman was only defeated and put down after an intense battle. She had captured four men and three women with her justu and was still able to fight two Kage level ninja and their small force of elite Jun\u00edn on her own. Though, she has been forgotten, in all but stories, her justu has not. It is now used as the final test for a Kunoichi to truly graduate. So, while Shinobi simple have to pass the academy test to graduate, Kunoichi must find themselves a partner. Someone who they will be within battle and draw strength from when needed. A third is normally added to the group, as a means to insure the Kunoichi can take in her partner into herself safely when her team finds themselves in need of the extra firepower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe warned though, as Kunoichi have been known to become addicted to the sensation of their partner being trapped within them. The knowledge that they can do nothing but hope their Kunoichi will see reason and release them after a time can be, intoxicating. This is only one aftereffect from using the justu. A second effect appears when the Kunoichi has kept their partner <i><b>\u201ccaptive\u201d</b></i> for a continual period of time, meaning she doesn\u2019t let them go for days, weeks or even months at a time. The effect in itself is the syncing of the partners chakra to the Kunoichi\u2019s body. This allows the Kunoichi to draw upon her partners\u2019 chakra to slowly but, steadily restore her own chakra reserves, turning their partner into nothing more than a living recharge battery. The third known effect is that Kunoichi\u2019s will sometimes suffer from strong flashes of an increased libido or sex drive/need for sexual satisfying activities.These flashes can happen at any time after using the justu for the first time, whether they hold a captive/partner at the time makes no difference. The justu is thankfully known for acting as an anti-pregnancy justu as well, at least until the time of late-teens or early twenties, at which time they can become very easy to impregnate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe benefits for the justu when used by Kunoichi include: The ability to use their partners chakra or the chakra of anyone they have captured with this justu, The ability to amplify a Justus\u2019s power by using both Kunoichi and the partners chakra, The ability to use any elemental affinity that their partner has, (as well as on rare occasions use a sub-element by mixing both chakras). The most useful part about this justu is that only the Kunoichi can hear any sounds coming from their wombs, on top of making <b>\"any\"</b> chakra unusable by their partner or captive(s) when trapped inside the womb; meaning that any captive must now rely upon their physical strength alone to try and escape. It should be noted that the Kunoichi's body seems to draw out more chakra from its captives to strengthen itself, allowing a Kunoichi to carry a large number of people while only having the center of balance and increased size of the obvious pregnant like belly to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It has also been noted that any attempt to escape or even move around from within the Kunoichi\u2019s womb tends to be felt as greatly pleasurable to said Kunoichi.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nWith that, the small bound book was closed and returned to its proper spot on the shelves. A young girl around 12 to 13 years of age, with creamy-white skin and midnight-blue/black hair, brushed back to a small tuff much like a swan\u2019s tail and two long bangs framing her face, sat back down in her chair. She was dressed in a baggy tan jacket with white fur tuffs at the ends and a yellow circle on the outside of her jackets arms with a red tear-like flame design. Her pants a dark blue and standard blue ninja sandals as well as white bandages on her right thigh with a kunai case and ninja pouch over her the left side of her bum, completed her look. Her pale white eyes that held just a hint of lavender were closed as she thought over all the information she had about the so-far un-named justu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Graduation will be here soon\u2019</i> thought the shy girl. <i>\u2018Now that I know how to pass my Kunoichi exam I just need to capture the one I want as my partner and use the justu on them.\u2019</i> The thought of who she wanted though brought a bright red blush to the girls face. <i>\u2018There is still the fact that, too truly pass, I need to hold him inside of me for a full 24 hour timeframe. If he manages to get even a single strain of hair outside of me, then I need to restart the clock.\u2019</i> She ignored how her whole body seemed to blush at the thought of keeping her beloved blond that close for so long and continued to think out her plan to catch Naruto Uzumaki off guard. She needed him out long enough for her to strip him down to his underwear, remove her own pants and panties, use the justu and then cover her modesty before someone finds them and do so all before she faints and loses her chance. <i>\u2018Naruto managed to pass after some sort of makeup test yesterday and now we have one week to catch a partner before we are split into teams of three. One Kunoichi, which will be me; One partner, who will be Naruto; then the one aid who is there for backup and to allow me and my partner to perform the justu undisturbed when needed on the battle field. All of us under one sensei.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes and standing she made her way back home for the night making a silent vow. <i>\u2018I will have Naruto as my partner even if I have to knock him out and drag him into a dark before shoving him into my womb, by force if need be.\u2019</i> Her eyes showed a resolve and determination that had never been seen in her before. She would do everything in her power to make this vow a reality.</span></div></div>",

From the moment he had awoken too now at a half passed noon Naruto had been feeling a little paranoid. He had just gotten his headband two nights ago and now everything seemed different. He could feel the stare of someone\u2019s eyes on him but, not full of hate or cold indifference like everyone else. No, this one made him feel like he was being hunted. Shapes would move from within the shadows only to vanish the moment he tried to look for them. Catching them from the corner of his eye only to disappear, on top of the feeling that something or someone was hunting him was making him rather jumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried to have his Shadow Clones transform into civilians and keep watch for the person as they passed by but, to no luck. Whoever or whatever was following him was staying out of their sight, as if they already knew they were there. After eating a quick lunch, hoping his shadow would reveal themselves, he started on his way towards the training grounds. He planned to have some clones hidden in the surrounding trees and shadows while he trained. The idea was that maybe he could draw out his stalker once they thought he was tired. He just hoped he this wouldn't come back to bite him later.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nTrue to her word Hinata was following Naruto\u2019s every movement waiting for the right moment to strike. She avoided his transformed clones, something that surprised her as she didn't know he could do that, through the use of her Byakugan. Using her special eyes she kept careful tabs on the real Naruto and stuck to the shadows. Due to her natural tendency to be overlooked she was able to go through the whole day without being spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure there were some close calls but, she had almost four years of practice at following him without being spotted by her beloved blond. She would admit, it was tempting to try and take him after he ate but, she had seen Naruto pack away far more then that with no negative effects on his mobility, so she waited. Waiting was something that she had plenty of practice in. Seeing him walk off towards the training grounds and knowing that he knew someone was following him, made a point to stay at a distance while he trained. Hours passed as she watched and waited, plans forming for how to best get him inside her womb and keep him there coming and going through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally seeing his clones disperse one after another as time dragged on, she watched with barley contained glee as he slowly started to make his way home. She knew about the traps he kept hidden, traps ment too keep people out of his apartment and knew that if she failed to catch him before he got home, then her chances of getting him would drop to nearly non-existent. So watching the path that he took to get home she moved ahead of him, her Byakugan eyes never leaving her soon to be partner. Finding a small dark alleyway, made even darker by the sun going down, Hinata melted into the darkness and waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing he did had drawn whoever it was out of hiding nor did they seem to hold any malevolent intent. He was starting to think that the shadow had been an AMBU sent to keep watch over him. The <i>\u2018Old man\u2019</i> Hokage had been rather worried about him ever since he found out about the fox so it didn\u2019t seem too outlandish an idea. Hearing the sound of movement from the alley he just past, he found himself too slow to react in time. Feeling the jab to a point on the back of his neck Naruto silently cursed himself for letting down his guard at the worst time just before darkness overtook him.<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nThe moment Naruto had passed her she had struck. With his guard down due to him being lost in thought she had easily hit the pressure point on the back of his neck causing him to fall unconscious. Grabbing his now limp body before his hit the ground, Hinata dragged him into the dark alley, her active Byakugan being the only reason she could see anything in such darkness. She allowed herself a moment to giggle happily as she cradled Naruto\u2019s out cold body to herself, lightly swinging it side-to-side in her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly getting a hold on herself she began the preparations for her justu by laying him down and removing his jacket. Impulsively folding neatly and laying it to the side for later she proceeded to remove the rest of his upper garments. The justu kept Naruto alive by connecting him to her through a form of umbilical cord, so she needed his stomach bare to make things easier. Placing his shirt and such with the jacket she proceeded to rip off his shoes. Those she didn\u2019t really care about so she just chucked them over her shoulder and heard them land almost silently into a trash can. Looking at his pants Hinata almost wanted to rip them off but, knew that she needed to be careful about waking the boy, so she quickly but gently pulled them off and placed them with the rest of his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was tempted to remove his boxers but, stayed her hand. She didn\u2019t want Naruto to be angrier with her then was needed when he woke up inside her, even if first time users were encouraged to remove all forms of cloth, as it might irritate her womb making things less comfortable for her <i>\u2018partner\u2019</i>. Walking toward his head she removed her pants and panties with a thumb and a wiggle of her hips. Using her pants as a mat Hinata sat down with her legs spread wide, ready to take her beloved blond in. Positioning his hands nearby Hinata paused for a moment to remove his headband. It wasn\u2019t well known but, each headband was registered in a computer system using a unique bar coding hidden in the metal. With his headband in hand Hinata could officially label Naruto as her partner by bringing it to the registry center and asking for her partner to be formally registered. Looking upon the shining metal made Hinata realize that this was real, that she was about to try and claim Naruto Uzumaki as her partner. Suppressing a squeal of giddiness she kiss his headband as a sign of good luck before laying it to the side and performing the hand seals needed to use the justu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an odd sensation run through her, her uterus relaxed, and grew, becoming almost rubbery. She also felt her hymen move out of the way allowing easy access for what she was about to do, idly she thanked it as once Naruto was inside of her, her hymen would provide her with extra certainty that he would be trapped inside. She just hoped that her chakra re-enforcement excises would be strong enough to stop him should he ever get that far. She lifted his hands and brought them to her vagina. She trembled, pleasure and fear blending as she fought to retain her focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gasped loudly when she felt Naruto\u2019s fingers brush up against her sex. She pushed his fingers in, but couldn't help but whimper slightly at the feeling of it. His fingers were slowly drawn in, her muscles working to pull him in even as she pulled him in. His hands dragged against her skin and she shivered. She tried to ignore her slowly growing arousal, but couldn't, his hands finally slipped inside of her. She closed her eyes, grabbing his wrists and dragging them towards her. She moaned as his arms were being pulled in, his fingers were farther inside, curling up inside of her. Hinata was struggling to keep her breathing steady, to try to keep a pace, but her body was doing it for her, her muscles gradually pulling more and more of him inside. She could feel his hair brushing up against her legs, her hands wandered to it, her fingers slipping between his ruffled hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt his arms press up against the walls of her uterus. Opening her eyes and looking down, she noticed the small bumps near her belly. She closed her eyes and leaned back, eliciting a small moan as Naruto's hair brushing against her clitoris. She gasped, pleasure shooting through her as Naruto was drawn further in, his hair running over her again and again. Her body shuddered with pleasure and she came, barely even noticing as Naruto's head was pulled completely inside of her. Her skin stretched around his shoulders, her juices thoroughly coating the boy as he was slowly pulled closer to the moment that would intertwine his future with Hinata\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was still being dragged inside, his chest, firm and slightly toned, was dragging across her lips. Hinata reached out blindly, unable to find a grip she scratched about blindly. Her breath was rapid and shallow, the sensation of Naruto entering her, being dragged inside of her, was driving her to ecstasy. She couldn't fight it, and no longer tried, simply accepting every sensation, ever curve of Naruto's body as it was pulled inside. Her hand reached down farther, and she felt his firm ass through his boxers. Despite herself she squeezed, biting her lip to hide her happy smile, he was certainly everything she could have hoped for there\u2026 she grasped him and pulled him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found his boxers rubbing against her to be quite irritating but, dealt with the displeasing sensation for now. <i>\u2018After all, if he finds it as enjoyable as I do, then maybe we can try again later...'</i> she thought, hoping he would be willing to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed back to the dirt, drawing Naruto's hips and then his thighs inside of her. The moment she hit unclothed skin she couldn\u2019t contain it anymore, she came, moaning out in ecstasy at the sensation.... 'It won't be long now\u2026' she thought as she savored what little time remained, her hands running over her inner thighs as Naruto curled up inside her womb. Her hands grasped his feet and she pushed him inside, nearly overwhelmed as he was finally drawn inside of her. She looked down. Her stomach had grown several dozen times its normal size. She could barely see past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay on the ground for a moment panting, her hand slowly moved across her stomach, touching the edge of her shirt. The bottom had moved up as her stomach had swelled, leaving her belly completely exposed. She sat up, and took a heavy breath as she snatched her panties from the ground. They wouldn't fit the same way they had before, she was certain of that, but they should still cover her at least partially\u2026 she looked to her pants and frowned. <i>\u2018Those, on the other hand, wouldn't be quite big enough to cover me.\u2019</i> She sighed as she realized that she would have to go to the Kunoichi only clothing store to buy seal reinforced pants and panties that would fit her even after she took Naruto into herself. She gnawed on her lip for a moment in thought of how she was to get home with no pants on, only to notice Naruto's pants and blink as an idea came to her. <i>\u2018I couldn't possible go and\u2026 could I?\u2019</i> Naruto wasn\u2019t too much larger than her but...  <i>\u2018they do look like they are made of a stretchy spandex\u2026\u2019</i> She picked them up and pulled them on blushing the whole time. <i>\u2018They fit, if barely.\u2019</i> She thought and sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on unsteady legs she felt the extra weight from her Naruto filled womb throwing her off balance. <i>\u2018Looks like my body still needs to adjust to Naruto\u2019s weight but, judging from this I should be almost back to normal by tomorrow morning.\u2019</i> She thought. Steadying herself as best she could, she leaned against a wall while holding her belly from beneath. Squatting with some difficulty Hinata grabbed the folded clothes and Naruto\u2019s headband before standing back up, completely ignoring her discarded pants. \u201cNow all I need to do is rest while keeping Naruto in for 24hours before bringing in his headband to be registered as my partner.\u201d The girl quietly muttered as she mentally congratulated herself on a successful capture of her beloved blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving turned off her Byakugan mainly because, she had lost her focus while drawing him in, Hinata reactivated it and looked inside herself to insure the connection had been made. It wouldn\u2019t do to catch him only to have him die inside of her. Nodding to herself as she saw the umbilical cord connecting properly while her hymen was back in place Hinata began the long waddle home. A smile on her face the whole way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The reception she had received upon returning home had been rather\u2026 lively. Most Hyuga women didn\u2019t go through with this method of test as many still clung to some outdated tradition or belief that a pure Hyuga women is a strong one, or some non-sense like that. It manly stemmed from how many of the older generation viewed the term <i>\u2018virgin\u2019</i>. In the end Hinata didn\u2019t really care what some of the elder members had to say. So what if clan woman can skip this test, it wouldn\u2019t have allowed her to have Naruto as her partner, now would it. That wasn\u2019t to say that she didn\u2019t find some of her clansmen\u2019s reactions amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne example had would be her sister Hanabi. The younger girl took one look at her engorged belly and hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off it. She had been stunned and dumbfounded at first but, had quickly moved to curiosity. Throughout all of dinner, Hanabi had poked, probed and questioned her about how she got her belly; she had even asked if she could rub it. That had surprised her but, Hinata had quickly told her that her younger sister was welcome to rub her belly and say hello to Hinata\u2019s new partner. Her father however had given her a very different response than what she had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, cold and detached, Hiashi Hyuga had been so surprised when he heard of his daughters condition upon her arrival home that even his mask of indifference had slipped, if only for a moment. He was quick however to question Hinata and after making the girl sweat under his heated gaze for a time, he had told her to simple go to the dinning chamber to eat before she washed up for bed. He had neither reprimanded her, nor encouraged her. Hinata, though surprised that she hadn\u2019t been punished or insulted in any way, simple went to do as she was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow after eating and a quick cleaning off from a small wet towel, and some help from her sister, Hinata was currently laying in her futon bedding. Clothed in a simple white night gown, that couldn\u2019t hope to cover her stomach, and a pair of matching panties, Hinata sighed in relief. She hadn\u2019t realized just how much pressure she had been putting on her body till she laid down on her soft but, firm futon. Lying sideways to minimize the burden of her massive belly, Hinata sighed again, this time in happiness. Hanabi seemed quite pleased too, as the little girl continued to gaze at her Naruto filled womb in awe, all the while she never stopped touching the large protruding mass that was Hinata\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another half hour or so, they remained; Hinata was perfectly content to let her loving little sister run her hands across her taunt skin. Hinata let a small smile form on her lips as she realized that Hanabi would be looking forward to this when she graduated. It wasn\u2019t long after that Hinata gave her clock a quick glance before pulling Hanabi into a loving hug and told her it was time for bed. Though sadden that she had to leave Hanabi gave her sister a quick hug, kissed her belly and quietly said goodnight to both her and Naruto. Listening to her sister quickly scamper off to bed Hinata smiled again knowing that the excited little girl would return first thing after waking up. So with that, Hinata covered a small yawn and with a rub of her belly and a small goodnight to Naruto she laid her head back down. <i>\u2018Nearly three hours down and only 21 left to go. Soon\u2026 very soon you will be mine.\u2019</i> And with that thought in mind Hinata fell into a happy sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>*7 Hours Later*</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata lay in her futon, her day soon to start but, for now she remained in her slumber, curled around her enlarged womb and dreaming happily of the life she hoped to soon be living. The only movement in the room being from the girls\u2019 steady breaths but, soon they were joined by another set of movements. Movements that came from her belly, or inside her womb to be precise. The movements were so slight that unless you were looking for them they would go unnoticed. Small bumps here, outlines of a hand or foot there but, no matter how small the signs were clear. Naruto was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Naruto POV</b></u><br>\r\nSlowly he began to regain consciousness, the first thing that he noticed was that his head hurt but, was no more than a minor throbbing. Next thing he realized was that he was in some dark, wet, cramped location and that it oddly felt alive. That in its self was disturbing but, the odd thumping coming from over head only made the boy start to panic even more. Taking a few breaths to calm himself he started probing around his fleshy <i>\u2018prison\u2019</i>. It wasn\u2019t long before he found the thing latched on to his belly and he really started to freak out. Sadly it only took a few moments of panic induced struggling and thrashing about that Naruto found himself exhausted. <i>\u2018Why am I so tired? I feel so\u2026 drained. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn\u2019t know it, the reason behind his tired and weakened self was from his chakra being aligned with Hinata\u2019s. Until a full 24 hour time frame of him remaining inside of Hinata\u2019s womb or he somehow escaped, Naruto would find himself rather easy to tire. Slowly he found himself giving in to the need for rest. The odd fleshy walls seemed to wrap around him in a comforting embrace, making him feel safe for the first time in years. Despite himself he found himself thinking that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to stay for a little longer, and so, he soon fell asleep, the thumping from above him oddly helping to lure him into a dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometime after Naruto fell back asleep Hinata started to stir. The sun had decided to awaken the sleeping beauty by shining its light through her blinds and onto her face. Grumbling slightly as she awoke from her wonderful dreams of her and Naruto, she sat up and yawned while rubbing her eye cutely. She briefly wondered if she should do as she had in one of her dreams to catch Naruto as her partner, only to sigh, knowing that it would never happen and she would grow up to live all alone with only a bunch of cats to keep her company. She was brought out of her depressing thoughts as she felt an odd sensation coming from just below her stomach, it felt like something moving. Looking down she snapped wide awake as she stared at the large creamy-white sphere before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on its surface she couldn\u2019t help but feel a great deal of hope well up inside of her. <i>\u2018Could it be? Was my dream more than just a dream? Is he really inside me?\u2019</i> she asked herself. Her question was answered for her as she felt something\u2026 <i>\u2018flop\u2019</i>, for lack of a better word, inside her and roll a bit to the side. Hinata could barely contain herself as she wrapped her arms and legs around her enlarged womb and hugged it, while squealing in joy at knowing that she was really on her way to being Naruto\u2019s partner. She sort of lost herself in the joy of the moment and gave her belly a big kiss just before she realized what she was doing and blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to begin her day Hinata hefted herself up and stumbled about for a moment. She found standing was much easier than it had been the day before, only her center of balance was different. She smiled at knowing that her body was already able to start drawing on Naruto\u2019s chakra to strengthen itself. She gazed at her mound lovingly, letting one hand continue to support her belly from underneath while the other one gently rubbed the barely noticeable outline of her partner. Walk/waddling around she gathered the things she would need for a bath and began moving out of her room, not even caring that she was in nothing but, a nightgown of semi translucent material and a pair of panties. Naruto\u2019s outline would disappear once he adjusted himself to a more comfortable position inside her, and she didn\u2019t worry about not having a bra on as no bra she owned would fit her with her Naruto-belly in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stopped just before reaching Hanabi\u2019s door. A good thing to as the little firecracker jumped out of her room arms loaded with bathing supplies. Letting a small giggle out Hinata continued on her way to a small bathing area with Hanabi in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Few minute Later</u></b><br>\r\nHinata had just finished washing Hanabi\u2019s back, something her large belly made much harder than needed, and quickly dumped a bucket of warm water over the younger girl. Once all the soap suds were washed away the sisters switched places. Sitting on a small stool Hinata was forced to spread her legs and allow her belly to fall between them, after all her legs would not be able to support her enlarged womb if she sat it on top of them, not without falling backwards that is. Hanabi quickly handed her older sister a wet and soapy hand cloth, this way Hinata could wash her front while Hanabi got her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her sisters back, Hanabi moved in front of Hinata and knelt. This allowed her to begin washing Hinata\u2019s large belly or at least the parts that Hinata herself couldn\u2019t reach. It was during this time, while the sisters were both gently washing the large sphere, that it started moving. Gasping in shock Hanabi pulled away for a moment and simply watched the orb move around before placing her hands gently on the wriggling mass before her. Hanabi was awed at how she could feel the movements of the boy inside her sister so clearly. A small hum of pleasure caught her attention and made her focus on her sister. Hanabi saw that Hinata\u2019s eyes were closed while a dreamy smile sat on her sisters\u2019 lips. Hanabi watched in fascination as Hinata went from humming in pleasure to giving small giggles every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly finishing with soaping her sisters belly, Hanabi poured the warm water from her bucket over Hinata. Once all of the suds were gone Hanabi tried to help her sister up before they moved to the hot bath, and boy was it hot. After a few minutes of adjusting to the heat of the water, time that Hinata\u2019s occupant continued to wiggle around in short burst of motion, the Hyuga sisters were finally in the bath. They spent the time relaxing and simple talking as sisters would their conversation interrupted only by the movement of Hinata\u2019s belly. A few minutes before they were going to get out Hinata felt something strike her uterus wall causing her to gasp loudly before curling up and moaning into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister! Are you alright?\u201d asked the worried younger girl. \u201cYes Hanabi, I\u2019m fine. I-I just n-never thought it would fell so\u2026 so\u2026\u201d \u201cSo? What? \u201c Hanabi inquired, eager to learn how it felt. Hinata however was blushing as she answered. \u201cSo\u2026 Good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Hours Later</u></b><br>\r\nHinata was walking/waddling towards the registry center with a small bag on her back. The bag contained a change of pants for her, as she was still wearing Naruto\u2019s orange jumpsuit pants, as well as the rest of Naruto\u2019s clothes, minus his shoes of course. In another hour Naruto would have been inside of her for a full 24 hour timeframe and he would be her official partner for the rest of their lives. She was rather excited to experience the syncing of their chakra. It was some sort of state that the Kunoichi would experience for the first time once she kept her would be partner or partners in some cases, inside them for a full 24 hours. The linking between them was not finished until the kunoichi experienced her first full chakra-sync. Supposedly the more in sync they were the stronger Hinata would be when they did this for battle, and once it was done a kunoichi could not <i>\u2018partner\u2019</i> with another as their chakra was already synced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved along Hinata thought back to how peaceful the day had been, if you discount the two instances were Naruto woke up, thrashed around a bit before falling back asleep. Those had been very embarrassing, especially the second time. She had been outside in the garden with her sister only to start moaning in pleasure and eventually orgasm right there in front of the young girl. Shaking the memory form her head Hinata began to rub the sides of her stomach, paying no mind to the fact that her shirt and jacket still didn\u2019t cover her stomach. She smiled as the registry center came into view. Time was almost up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to what the chakra-sync was suppose to make happen. <i>\u2018If I remember right, It will seem as if things start moving in slow motion due to a heightened perception and I\u2019ll feel stronger and faster than ever. I won\u2019t be on Lady Tsunade\u2019s super strength level but, I will be stronger. I\u2019ll be able to start using Naruto\u2019s chakra as if it was my own or increase the strength of justu with his chakra. I can hardly wait to start missions with him.\u2019</i> Her face took a bright red as a different piece of knowledge moved to the forefront of her brain. \u201cI wonder if one of us will move in with the other, I mean it is said that partners are suppose to be close to each other at almost all times\u2026\u201d She muttered to herself. Shaking her head to clear her thoughts she decided that she would cross that bridge when she got to it. First she had to register Naruto as her partner. So she opened the door and walked in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata sat quietly in a soft chair off to the side in the registry center. She absentmindedly took another sip of the tea she had brought with her in a thermos. She stole another glance at the clock and couldn't help herself from sighing in annoyance. She mentally cursed these last five minutes as they seemed to move at the slowest pace they could. It took every ounce of control she had to not start throwing a fit at how long these final moments seemed to be taking, not that it stopped her from doing so in her mind. Currently a mental image of a large bellied Chibi-Hinata was stomping around throwing a fit much like a two year old would. <i>'Why can\u2019t time move faster? I want to be partnered with \"MY\" Naruto NOW!!!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that seemed to calm her down and end the ranting of the little mental chibi was for Hinata to start rubbing her belly. It was becoming ingrained into her just as some might un-concisely tap their fingers or chew on a pencil end, it made her wonder what she would do when Naruto wasn't in her womb. Running her hands happily across her taunt belly, she felt Naruto squirm just under the skin. She was quite happy to find that the boy had awoken inside her without panicking about half way through her time sitting in the center. Not that she could speak to him just yet, mind you but, the fact that he wasn't trying to escape was one that she greatly enjoyed.  She hoped this meant he would be at least neutral about being her partner as she had no illusion in him suddenly jumping for joy when he found out everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I did after all knock him out before putting him inside me. I know that we were kind of suppose to do it that way but, I still can't help but, feel bad about not giving him a choice in this.'</i> She thought to herself, ignoring the big bellied chibi-Hinata parading around the accomplishment in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing softly, Hinata turned her attention towards the only company she had in the center outside of the boy inside her. One who was currently running his hands across her uterus walls again, making her shiver in delight. The women was tall with long brown hair running down her back, tanned skin showing that she spent a lot of time outside and bored brown eyes. She wore the standard black pants and long sleeved shirt that most of the older ninja wore, with a custom flank jacket showing her to be at least Chunin in rank. Her belly however was still mostly covered by her shirt showing it to have been modified as most kunoichi do after claiming a partner. Said belly was quiet large, filling most of her lap and pushing her D-cup breast into her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't help but, giggle at the women as she twirled a pencil in her hand and poked her belly at random intervals, obviously doing it to annoy her partner for the simple sake of amusement. Hinata was quiet certain that the women finding out that Hinata Hyuga of all people had captured Naruto Uzumaki, had been the most exciting thing to happen to her all day. Hinata was however broken from her thoughts when the receptionist spoke to her. \u201cSo,\u201d brown eyes took a quick glance at something Hinata couldn\u2019t see. \u201c\u2026Miss Hinata. It says here that you captured Naruto Uzumaki for your test to be a full kunoichi. Do you plan on treating him as a partner or\u2026\u201d Hinata watched her lean back in her chair and give a gentle pat to the top of her stomach. \u201c\u2026Do you plan on making him into a chakra battery?\u201d Silence. Hinata blinked in shock, eyes wide at the implications thankfully the women went on rather than wait for an answer. \u201cI mean most ninja realize that the boy currently curled up inside you has massive reserves of chakra. Most would think you were after that and plan to use your advance Hyuga clan chakra control methods to become nearly unbeatable in terms of justu or chakra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Thinking quickly Hinata asked a question of her own, hoping that it would keep her from having to tell the women that she planned on being partners with Naruto but, hoped to keep him inside her as much as he\u2019d allow. \u201c\u2026You\u2026 you use yo-our p-partner as a p-p-power s-source? B-but I th-hought that w-we were suppose to-o be teammates?\u201d The burnet seemed to be amused by what she said as a smile crossed her face while answering. \u201cWhile what you say is true, there are no laws against keeping your partner or partners in my case, inside you almost all the time. We kunoichi have the ability to force another\u2019s chakra to obey \u2018our\u2019 commands simply by unbirthing them and trapping them in our womb. There are however, rules about how many we may have at any one time. This is in response to when the village was still new and the ninja academy was just getting started up. A kunoichi student used the <i><b>\u201cBlossoming Kunoichi no Justu\u201d</b></i>, as some have come to call it, to try and unbirth her entire class that year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that Hinata became intrigued, her studies of the justu hadn\u2019t provided an official name to the justu, nor did it ever imply such a thing as a kunoichi unbirthing her whole class having happened here in Konoha. \u201cS-she f-f-failed, didn\u2019t she-e?\u201d Asked the white eyed girl, her mind no longer on the clock. Hinata was rather surprised when the burnet answered her. \u201cNo actually she succeeded. Out of one whole class of potential ninja only she went on to gain a headband. As for everyone else\u2026 well\u2026\u201d The women shrugged but, Hinata would not have it. \u201cWhat? What happened to her class?\u201d Hinata didn\u2019t even realize that she hadn\u2019t shuddered, too wrapped up in the idea of a girl her age cramming a whole class of students into her womb. <i>\u2018She must have been MASSIVE!\u2019</i> she thought. \u201cWell\u2026 as it turned out the girl had a friend who was rather good with sealing methods. She had her friend draw out a paper seal that would help her lock up her partner if he or she tried to escape but, it was a permanent thing so they would never be able to get out of her.\u201d Hinata suddenly had an idea of what happened and paled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you figured it out. Well the girl did use the paper seal but, only after she managed to shove every other student of her class into her womb. The irony is\u2026 the friend she got the sealing tag from was one of her classmates so she ended up trapped with the rest of them, and without her and her knowledge of the seals design, no one could free them before it was too late.\u201d Hinata shuddered at the idea of being betrayed by a friend like that, to be crammed inside them with so many others, never able to get out. And worst of all, knowing that it was all her fault. The thought of being forced to live such a life scared her, making her hands return to her own belly and rub it in a attempt to comfort herself. \u201cS-so what h-happened to the g-girl?\u201d \u201cThe girl became kunoichi but, her arrogance eventually got her killed, as for her classmates\u2026 well, they all died not long after. Since they couldn\u2019t get out, the kunoichi became their only means of survival, with her killed, well\u2026\u201d A shrug. Hinata trembled at the idea of Naruto dying just because she wasn\u2019t strong enough to live. The burnet checked the clock, \u201cWell that at least killed five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\u2018Five minutes!\u2019</i> Hinata thought just before she sat up strait. She turned to look at the clock only to be cut off by an odd sensation coming from her chakra. Her chakra felt strained in an odd way, like something was trying to alter it but, it was holding its ground. Only for it to suddenly shift. Gasping at the odd sense of vertigo from the sudden shift Hinata couldn\u2019t keep up with what was suddenly happening. Her body felt hot\u2026 like molten lead had been forced into her blood but, it didn\u2019t hurt. With the heat came a sense of pleasure, one that had her gasping in ecstasy and moaning loudly. She didn\u2019t notice the odd clenching of her womb as it tried to shirking around her partner. Next thing she knew her arms were around her large belly and squeezing it. She felt herself trying to push Naruto down, not down to the floor but down towards her center, like she was trying to force him deeper into herself. She blocked out the words of the receptionist as she concentrated on the wonderful sensation of Naruto\u2019s chakra flooding through her. There was so much that she felt like she might explode at any moment and yet, she continued to try and force him deeper into herself, not just into her body but, her very soul was calling for him. Craving him. Wanting him closer and closer until you couldn\u2019t tell where Hinata ended and Naruto started. She could feel her skin tingling, humming, with the power just below its surface, it only increased her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of trying to unsuccessfully take Naruto into her very essence Hinata finally started to calm down. Her head was leaning against her large belly, ear pressed against its taunt skin and drool coming from her mouth. Huffing and puffing she tried to get her labored breathing under control, her face a bright red as she came down from whatever wonderful high she had been on, the rush now having turned to exhaustion. She could somehow feel that Naruto was in a similar state and trying to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I see you enjoyed it at least.\u201d Jumping Hinata turned her head towards the receptionist; someone that she had completely forgotten was there. Seeing her being looked over by the women who hadn\u2019t even left her chair was sum what embarrassing after her little episode. But seeing the women was breathing heavier and fondling one of her breast absentmindedly only made it worse. \u201cThree times.\u201d Confused Hinata simply looked at her. *sigh* \u201cYou experienced an orgasm three times in a space of five minutes.\u201d Shock was the only thing keeping Hinata from fainting as she continued to listen. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised truthfully. It\u2019s not every day you experience your first \u201cChakra Sync\u201d and \u201cUrge\u201d at the same time. The fact that you didn\u2019t take so long to calm down from it is a surprise though.\u201d She saw the questioning in Hinata\u2019s eyes and tried to answer. \u201cThe <i>\u2018Chakra Sync\u2019</i> or <i>\u2018Bonding\u2019</i> as many call it, amplifies everything your body experiences during the first Syncing. In this case it amped up your \u201cUrges\u201d for lust and pleasure to a higher level. Now don\u2019t go thinking that the \u201cUrges\u201d are completely bad, I mean it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to make your jump the bones of the first person you see. Nine times out of ten the \u201cUrges\u201d make a kunoichi seek out pleasure from either themselves or from their partner. The reaction you however had was something only recorded happening in Konoha once. The people at R&amp;D refer to it a <i>\u201cSoul Bond\u201d</i> and it only happens if the kunoichi goes through a session of \u201cUrges\u201d when also experiencing a \u201cChakra Sync\u201d for the first time. What it means\u2026 well we aren\u2019t all that sure ourselves. Just know that neither you nor your new partner are in any danger. Now get out of here and go home, I want to go to bed already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hinata quickly grabbed her things and ran out of the center. She only just heard the women say to return to the academy in three days for her team assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the little girl run home the receptionist couldn\u2019t help but wish that she had had a cutie like the Hyuga girl in her class, <i>\u2018I would have partnered up with her the moment I learned the justu\u2026 or maybe I would have waited till she was so nice and round, a girl is always so much more fun to take in when they already have another inside them.\u2019</i> She thought. Looking down she gave her belly a small glare before slapping the top. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you two be that cute when I got you?\u201d Her only reply being the two girls inside her squirming around. The women huffed and pouted cutely. \u201cFine don\u2019t answer through our chakra link but, I\u2019m going to make you girls regret it by having some hot sex with our third partner once I\u2019m done reporting Naruto\u2019s capture to the Hokage.\u201d She ignored the increased movements of her two female partners as if to protest against her actions. <i>'I wonder if I could talk her into joining us for a little womb orge during her next Urge session. It would be so cute to feel them having some \"fun\" together or maybe me and the girls could get a chance inside her womb for a day.'</i> Quickly grabbing her Swan shaped ANBU mask and putting it over her grinning face as she thought about all the fun a female orgy inside the Hyuga heiress could be before vanishing in a cloud of smoke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata was walking back home from the registry center after having Naruto officially registered as her partner. Despite the receptionist having embarrassed her with both her subject of choice on top of her having that little episode in front of the woman, she had given Hinata something to think on; even if it was inadvertently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata needed to decide when to let Naruto out of her womb. As wonderful as it felt for her to keep him all nice and snug inside her body, Hinata was pretty sure that Naruto was growing increasingly bored. And if he grew bored enough with no signs of being let out, it would only serve to make him think of his time inside her as a prisoner of her body. In hindsight, that wasn't all that far from the truth as Hinata could easily go through the rest of her life without ever letting Naruto back out; if she wanted to that is. As tempting as the thought was though, Hinata had dreams that couldn't be fulfilled if she left Naruto trapped in her womb. She couldn't have babies if Naruto was taking up all the room after all. True there were jutsu that she could use to pack Naruto deeper inside if herself, doing so would also cause her wonderfully large womb to deflate in size however. Such a jutsu was normally used by kunoichi that had to go undercover but, still required the added power and chakra their partner provided. The only problem Hinata had outside of losing her wonderfully round belly while the jutsu was in effect, was that Hinata didn't know any such jutsu and it was very hard to find in the ninja library, much less be allowed accesses to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed as she realized that these thoughts weren't helping in deciding when to let Naruto out. It would likely be best to <i>'birth'</i> him before they were assigned their new sensei and teams, this way she could explain things to him and he had a chance to accept the role he had as her partner. There was however, the small but terrifying chance that he would try to run away from her, to try and separate them so she couldn't unbirth him whenever she simply felt like it. The very idea of Naruto rejecting her and trying to break the bonds of partnership they now shared scared Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself again she looked down towards her belly. As she stared at the cream colored belly she wondered how Naruto would react or what he might say to her. <i>'Will you give this a chance or will you react poorly and force me to choose between being an effective kunoichi while earning your hate for locking you up inside me, or possible having a small chance of being your friend and letting you get away?'</i> She thought. Her only form of response was the slight feeling of movement from under her skin; the small nondescript bulges as well as the vague shapes of Naruto's body pressing against her uterus walls as he shifted about gently. The joyous feeling of butterflies fluttering about inside her left pleasant shivers running up and down her body. Hinata rubbed her belly while nodding her head as if she was agreeing with someone that no one else could hear. \"Your right.\" She whispered \"The only thing I can do is give it my all. And if you choose to try and reject this, then I just have to try my hardest to make you reconsider no matter how long it takes or how many times I fail. All I can do is try and try again until I get it right. Thank you Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her pep-talk, Hinata looked up and saw the gates of the Hyuga compound. She sighed once more but, this time from relief as she felt much better, like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Making her decision about Naruto, Hinata walked with a sense of purpose. Hinata still needed to practice using her newly enforced chakra as well as using Naruto's chakra, both on its own and in combination with hers. She had some work ahead of her before she felt she could let Naruto out. It would take at least all of tomorrow to get an understanding of how to use the chakras and applying them as well as she did with her normal chakra before this. Hinata hoped Naruto wouldn't mind having to spend two more nights and another full day inside of her. She could see about letting him out before breakfast the day after tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And not a moment sooner.'</i> She thought with a happy smile as she entered the compound and headed for her room. It was late and tomorrow would be a busy day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata groaned as she felt the dull throbbing ache in her legs continue to make itself known to her, even as she laid in her bed. She had just returned home after spending all day doing chakra exercises so she could get a feel for her newly enforced chakra and so she could get a handle on Naruto's chakra. She'd like to think that she had made a great deal of progress on using the chakras at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new chakra acted much like her old chakra but, this enforced chakra clearly had more omf to it. It had a soothing quality, much like swimming in one of the large ponds on a hot summers day. Despite the soothing feel of her new chakra it still carried a great deal more power to it then her old chakra. Comparing the two chakras was akin to comparing a slow moving creek to a fast moving river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a handle on her own chakra she went to test it. Most didn't realize that when ninja preformed their roof hopping maneuver, younger ones like genin had to unconsciously focus a small sliver of chakra to their legs in order to clear the gaps they jumped. As they grew use to the exercise, their legs would grow stronger and more accustomed to making the jumps without chakra. Using chakra to jump a distance was in fact a good exercise for measuring your chakra usage. If you cleared the jump from one edge to the other then you had a good grasp on measuring the right amount of chakra for each given situation. Using her own chakra, Hinata quickly saw the difference in power her chakra now had compared to before. Using the same amount of chakra as she normally did, now had her over shooting her jumps and quickly adjusted the amount she was using till she was jumping and landing with the same ease she had before taking Naruto into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done she had gone back and started practicing on drawing out and molding Naruto's chakra. She noted how his was much harder to control as it seemed to have a will of its own. To Hinata it felt like trying to catch and gather the wind making her wonder how Naruto had ever managed to use his chakra at all. Still, she finally managed to get it to listen to her nine times out of ten. She had taken her time working with Naruto's chakra, letting the warm feeling it gave off fill her body. If her chakra was cool and soothing, then Naruto's was warm and sunny. She could only imagine that having both chakras flowing through her in harmony would feel like the perfect spring day, both warm and soothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComparing the power behind the chakra however was very different. The only thing Hinata could compare to would be saying that her chakra was a candle, where as Naruto's felt like someone had turned a portion of the forest surrounding the village into a massive bonfire. It made her feel greatly relieved to know that he was her partner and not her enemy. She pitied anyone stupid enough to try and fight such a power and think they'd get away unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had gone by rather quickly for the girl but, she had still managed to practice using Naruto's chakra, which shot her up twice as high as she had originally intended, and had started learning how to pull both of their chakras out at the same time. Still as the day ended she had one last thing to check. When meditating on the chakras inside her, she had felt traces of a third chakra. This one seemed different then hers and Naruto's. It felt darker, bloody, endless; it wasn't that it felt evil but, sure didn't feel like anything she'd ever experienced before... It confused her. So she had the bright idea of trying to reach for it. She had learned that was not so great an idea as her conscious mind grew closer to it. If her chakra burned as bright as a candle to Naruto's forest bonfire, then this chakra blazed like the sun itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a Hyuga, every source of chakra did indeed look like a small flame, burning brightly inside a persons coils. In keeping with flames of fire, small specks would be lost from the main body and float off until it dissipated. Searching Hinata quickly found the smallest of these chakra embers coming off this mysterious third chakra. Not willing to simply leave it alone now that her curiosity had been peeked, Hinata reached out and grasped the tiny ember and pulled it up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion of raw power was mind boggling. She had been forced to release a large portion of the chakra from her body as she had the disturbing feeling she would literally explode if she didn't. Even after relinquishing over half of the chakra that tiny ember had given her, Hinata had still fell like she was overflowing with powerful chakra, oozing it from ever pore of her body. Not even bothering to look around herself at the shocked and horrified faces of the people, Hinata pushed a small fraction of the chakra out of her feet and nearly screamed as she shoot into the air. At the peek of her jump she seemed to simply hang there, as if she was able to defy the laws of gravity itself. Her eyes nearly popped out of her head at seeing she had jumped so high that she had to look down in order to see the Hokage monument. She had jumped hight then the tallest thing in the village with only a little bit of chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her mind started to catch up with this achievement she was already dropping down towards the ground at an alarming speed. Not wishing to turn herself and Naruto into a bloody smear on the ground, Hinata frantically pushed all of that amazingly powerful chakra to her legs in an attempt to cushion the fall. She learned right then that having so much power chakra in one spot was not a good idea as it quickly felt like the muscles in her legs were liquidating from the immense amount of power. A moment later she slammed into the ground with enough force to make the surrounding area shake while dust and debris flew up in the air. To the people if felt and sounded like a high powered paper bomb had just gone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust started to settle, ANBU surrounded the area, ready to strike anything that came out should it pose any danger to the village. All they got was a small girl lying in a large crater that dominated the street. Suffice to say many ANBU had to resist face palming at the sight of the supposed danger whimpering in pain at the bottom of a crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave another heavy sigh as she turned her attention back towards her large belly, a smile forming on her lips at the sight of its massive spherical form. Once the pain in her legs had subsided, Hinata taken a quick peek at the damage with her Byakugan and had been shocked to find Naruto's chakra pouring into her system, easing the pain and amazingly accelerating the recovery of her legs. At the rate they were healing, she'd be perfectly fine by tomorrow late morning. Hinata couldn't help but, give a megawatt smile as she caressed her belly lovingly. \"Best Partner <b>EVER!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the next hour rubbing her belly, taking comfort in the pressure it placed on her pelvis as she laid on her back for the night. Apparently, laying on her side was a no-no for the night due to her legs but, she couldn't bring herself to really care. She gave her belly a small kiss and whispered a goodnight to Naruto before relaxing and drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Despite the damage her legs took the day before, she felt great. Smiling she slowly eased herself out if bed and gave another stretch, reviling in the feeling of being able to move without any pain. Her bright smile turned towards her belly as she gave it a gentle pat, silently thanking Naruto for taking such good care of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the calendar on her wall, Hinata's happiness dipped slightly as she saw that it was time to make her decision. She could let Naruto out now as proof that she wished to be partners, or she could procrastinate and take the chance of never working up the courage to let him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her private bathroom rather somberly. Looking towards her tub and her eyes immediately settled on the arc in the back that was designed for the sole purpose of making the birthing process of a partner more comfortable. There were even spots on the sides for her to place her feet so her legs wouldn't get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Hinata wanted to strip off her nightgown and panties and step into the tub. The other however, wanted her to just turn around and ignore the responsibility she had to birth her partner. She could always do it later, right? Hinata was truthfully rather scared to go through with the birthing as it was suppose to be painful the first time. Supposedly this was intentional to remind the Kunoichi of the vow of partnership she had just made. If what she had read, it wasn't all that easily on the partner either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kunoichi's womb filled itself with a type of gel-like substance that acted as a cushion to protect those inside the Kunoichi. The gel was very nutritious and could even be used to amplify the healing property's of creams and salves if one knew what they were doing. However the gel would breakdown quickly after being exposed to air. With a partner being inside the womb, their lungs would fill up with this gel and need to be expelled shortly after the umbilical cord detached. If not done fast enough then the partner will suffocate as the birthing process leaves their bodies weak and unresponsive for the first few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the tub, Hinata's eyes slowly trailed back to her wonderfully large belly and she bit her lip in thought. Did she really want to go through with this when she have every right to simply keep Naruto locked up inside of her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Yes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to do this. She had to birth Naruto. As tempting as it was to keep him snuggly tucked away inside of her womb, Hinata knew that she wanted more out of Naruto than just his chakra. She wanted to see him, talk to him, get to know him, have him get to know her, and touch him with more than just the walls of her uterus. And if she didn't do it now, then she probably wouldn't ever find the gumption to do it again. Besides, Hinata always believed she would do anything for Naruto. If she couldn't do something as simple as giving birth to him...then she'd be nothing but a dirty liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to end this,\" she said as she began to slip off her nightgown, hoping her words would fill her with courage. \"It's time to come face to face with Naruto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tossed her gown to the floor. In a few short seconds, her panties followed. And then just for kicks, so did her bra. Now completely naked, the Hyuga stepped into the bathtub and laid down with her legs spread out and pressed into the divots. She was stripped. She was in the proper position. All she had to do now...was push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike giving birth to a baby, the process of birthing a partner called for it to be done naturally. That meant it was prohibited to do anything that could dull the pain. There could be no medicinal jutsus to provide numbness, and painkilling drugs like morphine were a big no-no. Both were known to cause a number of long-term effects on the partner, which could range from stunted chakra reserves, to loss of specific senses, to even outright death in some rare cases. While research was being done to find a way to make giving birth to a partner less strenuous for all parties involved, it was still a long way off. And even so, many traditionalists argued that the pain was an important part to the entire process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that really meant anything to Hinata at the moment though. That was something for women to consider in the future. She was in the present and thus had to do what every woman before her had done as well. According to the literature, which Hinata had practically committed to memory, there was only one real measure a woman could take when it came to dealing with the pain of birthing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFind something sturdy, and bite down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata brought a thin strip of wood along for that very purpose. It was hard enough to not break under strain, but not so much that it would harm her teeth. She opened her mouth and clenched it in her jaws lightly. With that done, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, hoping it would steady her nerves and rapidly beating heart. She took one breath. She took two. And then, just for good measure, she took a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't begun yet. She could still turn back. She could walk away right now and put the birth off for a little while longer. An hour or two. Until after lunch. That evening. Before bed. Tomorrow. The day after. A week from now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! I said I would do this now, and that's what I'm going to do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo without another thought, Hinata pushed. In an instant, her entire abdomen trembled and quaked as her muscles reacted involuntarily. It had begun. Her uterus was contracting. Now the only way out of this was to go forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd already she could feel the pain erupting throughout her insides! Something too massive for her body to handle in normal circumstances was being pushed through passages too small to hold it. And there was nothing she could do to stop it. Her muscles were now operating on their own accords, thrashing, pushing, pulling, and stretching to make room. And <i>OH KAMI</i>, it hurt so much, like everything in her stomach was being ripped apart violently from inside with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I shouldn't have done this I shouldn't have done this ISHOULDN'THAVEDONETHIS!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata suddenly flinched and threw her head backwards as a new sensation made itself known. Small, almost electronic pinpricks spiked up in the flesh of her engorged belly and scraped slowly downward, leaving behind small but growing rivulets of searing pain in her stomach. They almost felt like talons clawing away at her womb, and then Hinata realized to her horror that may not have been far from the truth. Naruto was digging into the walls of her uterus with his fingernails, struggling to maintain a grip on whatever he could grasp while his entire world turned into a raging firestorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't know if that was normal; she hadn't recalled reading about it. But she couldn't be mad at him for doing it to her. If anything, she was feeling apologetic. It was her fault after all. She was the one who chose to birth him at this very moment. And she was the one who forced him into her womb in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hinata could not utter or even think of any words of atonement. She could only strain her eyes shut and bite down on the piece of wood in her teeth as the pain intensified. She pushed even more, not knowing if that was even necessary anymore, but persisting anyway, hoping against hope that this would end as quickly as possible. But it had only just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spikes of pain in Hinata's stomach vanished as Naruto lost his grip on her uterine walls and slipped further down, out of her womb and into her birth canal. The plank of wood in Hinata's teeth cracked as she felt her entire gut slowly and agonizingly swell up to make room for his bulk. Her body pushed him forward without giving her a chance to breathe. She could only moan pitifully and repeatedly through clenched teeth with every convulsion she made as her insides stretched, broke, and <i>tore</i> to their absolute limits and beyond. Tears streamed down Hinata's face. She could only hope things weren't going horribly wrong for either her or Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why? Why? Why? WHY DOES THIS HURT SO MUCH?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyuga's muscles thrashed against Naruto's form violently as they pushed and pulled him further down. And as they did so, things only grew worse for Hinata. More and more of the sensitive flesh on, in, and around her pelvis was flaring up as more shifted and expanded to accommodate the boy's moving body. No longer was biting on the wood enough for her; Hinata was outright slamming the back of her head onto the wall behind her. The pain she felt there was nothing compared to what she could feel creeping up from the sensitive area between her legs. If her teeth hadn't been buried up to their gums in rapidly splintering wood, she would have screamed bloody murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. A splitting sensation in her groin, of something large bursting out. Naruto was emerging now, greeting the air for the first time in over a day. Hinata wanted more than anything to steal a glance and see him again, but the pain was now at its absolute worst. It was like she was being pummeled, sliced, and stung by a thousand fists, knives, and bees all at once. And worse, her legs were now spreading out even further in preparation for what was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparation. Preparation for what was about to come. Even in her mind, addled with its thoughts of agony, those words reverberated through her head like echoes down a hall of black iron. Yes. It was ending. It was almost over. Hinata may have felt like she was dying...hell, for all she knew, she probably <i>was</i> dying...but she would be damned if she didn't see this through to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can't give up, can't give up...just a little more...just a little more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmrrrrrhhhh!\" she half-moaned and half-growled, pushing herself much more lightly but more rhythmically than before. Hinata feared that if she moved too fast, she might very well rip herself in two. Little by little, she flexed the muscles in her abdomen, in her thighs, and within her folds. Little by little, she could feel her body stretch wider. Little by little, the stings, aches, and pains increased in intensity. And little by little, centimeter by centimeter, Naruto was squeezing out. She couldn't tell exactly how much of him was exposed now, but she was definitely past his shoulders. The light at the end of the tunnel was becoming increasingly more visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just a little more...a little more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata steeled herself. She ignored the splinters scraping into her gums as well as the thundering tremors in the back of her head. Enough was out now, and something in her was demanding she exert more force, and like everything else about this birthing, she wasn't able to stop it. So she focused. She put all of her concentration into her lower regions, where all the pain she felt, greater than anything else in her life, was gathered together. There, she mustered all the strength within her feeble little body...and gave one last final push!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeins popped up everywhere. In Hinata's temples, around her eyes, in her arms, and down her thighs. A sudden jolt of pain rippled through her whole form, from her groin, to the tips of her toes, and back up to her forehead. Her back arched, her hips pulled backward, her legs splayed further out than they had ever gone before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and with a final thrust, something large and weighty <i>flopped</i> ungracefully out of her. Hinata gasped as she felt all the tension within her suddenly snap like a severed wire, the splintering plank of wood in her mouth falling to the floor of her tub with a tiny clatter. The young girl let her whole body go limp as a steady stream of warm...something flowed out of her. She was achy all over, sticky with sweat, her normally prim and proper hair clung to her damp face, and her already blurry vision was flickering as she struggled to remain conscious. But Hinata also felt an immense sense of relief, like a great weight had finally been lifted off of her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was now birthed.</span></div></div>",

For this choice, there will be a clear difference of how much animal-like traits they gain based off of gender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys can develop anything from enhanced senses to physical alterations like: sharpened teeth, claw-like nails, greater physical strength or/and speed, animalistic habits, and ext. Basically boys can gain both benefits and drawbacks but, undergo the least amount of radical physical changes. Because of this, they don\u2019t always know what animal they take after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls however, develop more physical showing results than their male counterparts. They could take on wings or grow feathers if they take after some sort of bird, or maybe their legs fuse together and form a tail if they take after a snake or something. The amount of change if different for each girl. Along with the physical changes most take up habits similar to their animal. For instance: a girl with snake traits may start to swallow food whole some even eating things as big or bigger then themselves; where as a girl with fox traits may start to pull small pranks or enjoy being scratched behind the ears.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By using this jutsu a ninja could, temporarily, absorb an ally/friend into themselves to gain certain advantages. These advantages would be dependent upon the gender and traits of the jutsu user, as well as the gender and traits of the person the jutsu is used upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn example: A Shinobi (male) uses the jutsu on another male comrade; now the jutsu user has increased chakra reserves or enhanced bone structure with greater muscle density allowing greater strength. In response if a Shinobi absorbs a fellow Kunoichi (female ninja) then they take on other traits such as but, not limited to: greater flexibility, smaller more compact body, or even enhanced chakra control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course means that Kunoichi gain some traits of those they absorb. Kunoichi absorbing Shinobi tend to take on one of two major paths, one increasing muscle mass and density, making the kunoichi more muscular; or the extra mass from their comrade is moved towards filling out their figure without getting in the way of other traits they gain. Kunoichi would find themselves stronger no matter which way their bodies reacted to the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the physical changes; of which could include those stated above as well as anything from: changes of hair or eye color, skin tone and a slew of other things. Mental and emotional changes are possible as well. A change of personality, different temper, and etcetera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the jutsu itself\u2026 the user could find their body taking on a melting, oozing gel-like quality. This would allow the user to pull his/her chosen target into themselves through the skin, preferably by pulling them directly into the torso or chest area as this would allow the shortest time between absorbing their friend and the mixing of traits that would follow. Basically, by pulling your friend/partner into your chest, you are pulling them in as close as possible to your chakra center. This allows the changes to happen faster as there is less time being used to pull the target towards the chakra center once inside the user. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be noted that most first time users tend to experience a delay in the absorption of their victim. This is due to the fact their bodies must fully adapt to absorbing and integrating another person into themselves. The victim is pulled into the area of the chakra center or the stomach as many would call it. The user is then than left to wait as their body must properly break down their victim to allow proper absorption. All though this process is referred to as digestion, it isn\u2019t really what is happening. The details are a bit complex to get into but, suffice to say, the user merely needs to wait for their body to properly absorb their victim (the process can be measured by much of the stomach bulge has shrunk), and a few moments after the user will experience their first shift into their \u2018Empowered\u2019 form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jutsu however can only be used on people the user trusts; because of this ninja do not need to worry about enemy ninja absorbing them in order to fight their comrades. On top of this limitation, the user can only absorb one person at any given time and once the jutsu ends it cannot be used again by the same user for a period of time ranging anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. There is also the time limit to keep in mind as this justu will end and forcefully separate the user and their \u2018victim\u2019 after a undefined amount of time has passed. The time a ninja can sustain their empowered form varies from person to person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing one may wish to keep in mind is that when used for the very first time, certain traits of the users \u2018Empowered\u2019 form will remain even after the separation of the jutsu user and their friend. For example: a Kunoichi absorbs a Shinobi and finds herself with a much more curvaceous body and larger female assets as well as some streaks of her \u2018victim\u2019s hair color in her own hair. When the jutsu ends and the male is forcefully separated from her, the Kunoichi will find that she has retained some or even all of her physical changes, though to a much lesser degree, and maybe even some of her mental changes if there were any. Due to this, users are encouraged to think long and hard about whom they want as their first, as they will be carrying traits of that person around for the rest of their lives. It is also to be noted that the \u2018Empowered\u2019 form created by absorbing their first tends to be stronger and longer lasting then the \u2018Empowered\u2019 forms the user would gain by absorbing another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as a person enters the user to mix traits, so too must the person exit the user when the jutsu ends. Exiting the user can happen in a number of ways but, most find themselves either vomited up through the mouth, causes pain in throat and loss of voice for short time in beginners; or pushed out through the butt, much like one would if pooping; causes great pain and soreness in posterior, beginner users may find sitting difficult for the next few days. Women have a dis/advantage (depends on who you ask), in that they could instead have their partner/friend reemerge inside their womb but, must then birth them out; beginner users as well as virgins will find this exiting method very painful, as well most notice a difficulty walking as well as a soreness of the muscles along their birthing passage; older more experienced users have said that feeling your partner gathering themselves inside your womb tends to be a pleasant experience and that after the first few times, exiting you can be enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, is the Absorption jutsu able to be performed by every ninja? Or just those of a specific gender?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was walking along the beaten dirt paths of the Hidden Leaf village, simply enjoying the day and the weight of the Hitai-ate or ninja head band on his forehead. He had heard that the girls were suppose to convene at the academy tomorrow for some reason even though they weren\u2019t assigned their team placement till the day after. Naruto simply shrugged, it wasn\u2019t any of his concern what the girls did as it likely had something to do with their <i>\u2018special\u2019</i> kunoichi classes. He never did find out what made these classes so special but, the girls had been taking these classes for some time now so it didn\u2019t seem all that weird. Naruto stopped as a thought hit him. <i>\u2018Speaking of weird, what was with that odd warning that Iruka sensei gave? What did he mean by watch out for the girls? Are they suppose to be watching out for their safety or did sensei mean that the girls would try something?\u2019</i> Naruto sighed at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t figure out what they were suppose to be doing about this and so just brushed it off. Looking around he noticed for the first time that the streets seemed oddly empty. He suddenly couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit nervous, like someone or something was watching him and everyone but, him knew about it. He passed a particularly dark alley just before his instincts started screaming at him. It wasn\u2019t enough as Naruto soon felt something grab him from behind and pull him in to the dark alley. He struggled as hard as he could and tried to yell for help only to find that whatever was holding him had too strong a hold on him and seemed to be covering his mouth so any noise he made didn\u2019t get very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to panic as whatever was covering his mouth seemed to start spreading; only now noticing how it felt only semi-solid and rather goo-like in texture. He thrashed harder as he felt the <i>\u2018arm\u2019</i> that had been holding him around the middle also starting to spread. \u201cNow you belong to me. Please don\u2019t bother trying to get away as we will be one soon enough.\u201d a soft feminine voice whispered into his ear. Naruto knew that he had heard that voice before but, in his panic induced mind he could not place where or who it was. Not that it mattered soon enough. He felt his feet become covered in the odd mass before it started climbing up his legs and his forearms soon fell prey to the odd goo shortly after. As much as Naruto hated to admit it, he was trapped. His eyes started to shine with unshed tears as he felt his entire chest become engulfed, the goo now moving out to meet with the parts that held him limbs, as well as brushing against the base of his neck. Naruto could feel himself being pulled back towards whoever it was that had snuck up on him. \u201cShush, it\u2019s okay. Just a bit more and it will be over. We will be one.\u201d The voice cooed tenderly, attempting to comfort her victim. Naruto had nothing to say, not that he could say anything right now anyway, as he felt the rest of his body be engulfed and shifted inside the goo. Now only his head remained and that would not last long as he could feel the goo pulling him deeper into itself. His last sight was the shadowed image of a girl he knew from his class smiling down at him as he sank into her chest.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nThe mystery girl sighed in relief at finally pulling all of Naruto into her body and giggled happily at feeling him curl up inside the temporary space/organ that the justu produced while awaiting for the absorption to finish. The girl moved deeper into the darkness and hid herself and her now massive belly behind a dumpster as she waited for the next step to start. Being as this was her first time performing the Absorption or melding justu her body would soon start rejecting the fabrics of Naruto\u2019s clothes as well as the metal of his weapons, so she needed to be ready to let those objects out before her body started to properly absorb him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back against the dumpster the girl rubbed her belly, enjoying the moment immensely. Her joy only grew as she felt Naruto gather his bearings and start moving. This in turn kick started her body processes and allowed her to feel her body move as it began to reject the unneeded objects from Naruto.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nDarkness. That was all that Naruto saw as he came too. He had no idea when he blacked out but, he did know that he didn\u2019t like where ever it was that he was currently. The walls surrounding him felt soft and somewhat sticky. He would swear he felt a pulse from the walls, a pulse much like a heartbeat. He laid there, curled up in this cramped space for what seemed like hours as he tried to figure out where he was. As a stronger pulse coursed through his odd prison the memory of what happened came flooding back. Realizing that he was inside that goo or that female classmate or whatever, he began to struggle. He refused to simply give in and have his dream end or suffer whatever torment was planned for him without a fight. The walls however seemed to disagree as they pressed in against the boy, his body already forced in a fetal position being compacted further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wiggled pitifully as the walls seemed to grow only stickier while pressing and rubbing themselves all over him. It wasn\u2019t long after that he felt more then saw some sort of gel or slime start coating him. It was an even shorter time before he felt his clothes starting to fall apart. The slime somehow dissolving the stitches and binding in the material, yet did nothing to him outside of making his skin tingle. Naruto soon found himself being attacked by the walls, their movements helping his clothes to fall off. Not long after, the articles of clothing seemed to sink into the walls and disappear as did any weapons that he had on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking Naruto started punching and kicking at the walls as hard as he could. Despite this, the walls just seemed to grow closer and closer as his limbs started to stick to the walls. Before he even knew it, the walls had moved in, leaving no part of him untouched. It was almost like parts of the walls were reaching out just to try and touch him. His thoughts halted however as he felt these probing parts of the walls starting to force themselves into any opening they found on his body. His ears, nose, not even his rear end or the piss hole in his dick were spared from the probing touches as he felt the sticky walls entering him. He tried to struggle, he tried to scream but, all it got him was more of that sticky wall stuff forcing itself down his throat. It was not long before he passed out and knew no more.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nThe girl however, wiggled and squirmed in delight as she tried to keep from moaning as her body worked on Naruto. She felt the cloth and metals separate form Naruto and begin to gather at her openings for removal. The girl stood and pushed her pants and panties down before squatting and gently pushing the objects out of her. She couldn\u2019t help but blush as she felt the soaked cloths slowly pour out of her while she pushed slime covered kunai and shuriken out of her rump. The slime not only broke down the bonds in clothing but, also acted as a means of protecting a kunoichi\u2019s body by coating sharp edges and points so they couldn\u2019t cause harm on their way out. Though pushing shuriken out of her butt was still a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made to stand when she thought she released everything only to feel something still trying to come out from her front. Reaching down the girl grabbed the offending object and slowly started to pull it out and suffered wave after wave of pleasure as she did. Once the object was removed and the girl came down from her high she looked at the object only to smile widely at finding Naruto\u2019s Hitai-ate in her hands, the metal covered with the same clear slime as all other metals and the cloth dripping wet from said slime. The girl stood and pulled up her pants and panties before pocketing the headband. She would need to give it back to Naruto when her body released him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from the pile of wet fabrics and slime covered metal, the girl sat down and began stroking her stomach again as Naruto thrashed his hardest to escape. Slowly though, she felt him weaken as her body probed and violated his so as to better start breaking him down into absorbable material. She leaned back against the wall and sighed blissfully. She could barely wait to see what sort of changes Naruto would leave her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who is the mystery girl? Is it\u2026</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata gasped in shock and suddenly found herself in a seated position. Breathing heavier than normal she looked around, trying to get her bearings. She saw she was in an alley, hidden from sight by the nearby dumpster. Next to the dumpsters side lay a pile of orange fabrics and a pile of metal weapons. Both piles had some kind of clear slime covering them. It was then that the memory of what happened rushed back to her. She had absorbed her love interest, Naruto Uzumaki. Hinata leaned back against the wall of the alley as the realization of this being real hit her. She smiled. She and Naruto were one and no matter what she would always carry some of him inside of her now. This led to the reminder that she must have undergone the change. She remembered sitting here for some time while her body worked away at Naruto and she remembered how the hard bulge his body created slowly softened as she rubbed it. She remembered the feeling of building pleasure as her body soon after started absorbing the softened mass that Naruto had become. Hinata felt her face flush read as the memory of her scream out in pleasure as the last of Naruto became part of her played in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head. She wanted nothing more right now then to start looking over her new body and see what changes taking Naruto into herself had caused, but she knew she couldn\u2019t do so to her satisfaction here. This in mind Hinata quickly stood, absently noting how tight her pants were as she moved her legs. Hinata wondered if her body took the more muscled path due to how small all of her clothes now felt on her. Her tan colored jacket, which had been nearly three sizes to large on her now felt incredible small; Hinata blushed at feeling the air brushing against the exposed parts of her stomach. She pushed it away to the back of her mind and started running, noting how she seemed to be quite a bit taller than before leaving Hinata to stumble a bit as she adjusted to her new size. She hoped no one would try and stop her as she was too excited at the idea of seeing her new form to stop for anything.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nHiashi Hyuga was a proud man. One who took great pride in both his clan and in his own abilities. The Hyuga women were known to be fearsome on the battle field, it was also well known that they didn\u2019t perform the odd kunoichi ritual of absorbing someone else into themselves. The Hyuga\u2019s were strong and capable enough with their own power and abilities. They didn\u2019t need to take others into themselves and to allow themselves to fall prey to another kunoichi and be absorbed was considered an act of shame, one normally followed by seppuku or exile from the clan. At least, that was how things worked some years ago. He had noticed a small group of their women slowly starting to become curious about the process and he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he saw some Hyuga performing the jutsu on others by the time he became a grandparent. Not that he had any intention of letting that come to pass anytime soon; the grandparent part that is. This is why he felt somewhat surprised when a blur ran past him and down towards his daughters room. A lesser man would not have known who had entered in such a manner but, Hiashi was anything but a lesser man. Activating his Byakugan for only a moment he was able to recognize the so called intruder, or he recognized enough of her to put the pieces together. Sighing and shaking his head he hoped Hinata had at least chosen a respectable person. It would not do for the clan to be connected to some orphan or village outcast after all.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nHinata was amazed at how fast she now was. She had just run right past her father on her way to her room not even bothering to give him a greeting as she was much too focused on reaching her room and looking her new self over. She hoped that she gained something distinct from Naruto, something that she could look at and know immediately that she got it from him. Maybe the color of his hair, she would love to be able to get up every morning and run her fingers through such golden blond locks; or those adorable whisker marks he had on his cheeks, she wondered what it would feel like to gently rub them. However, the trait she hoped most for was his eyes. She\u2019d die happy if she could have those beautiful blues rather than her \u2018creepy\u2019 white eyes that only held a touch of lavender. Hinata had never liked her eyes as she saw them as the same cold and unfeeling that all the members of her clan looked at her with. Arriving and entering her room Hinata quickly activated the locking seal. This was to prevent anyone from walking in on her as she looked herself over. It wouldn\u2019t do to have her sister or father come walking in when she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal now in place Hinata took a few steps into her room while making sure to not look in her mirror. She wanted to see all of her changes at once rather than a few at a time and so began striping as quick as she could. While removing her clothes Hinata saw that she had definitely grown height wise as she could see how her clothes were straining to contain her body. Turning towards a full body wall mirror she had in her room Hinata looked upon her new form. A gasp escaped her and a hand went up to cover her mouth; the shock was very clear. Hinata couldn\u2019t help but think that the person in the mirror was beautiful and maybe even attractive though she was pretty sure that was due to her mind registering that Naruto was a part of this person. No matter what form Naruto took Hinata would always feel drawn to him, even if he was nothing but a part of someone else\u2019s body. She let her gaze wander over her new form noting all the changes that she could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata couldn\u2019t get over how much she had changed or how much she remained the same. The first thing that she noticed was that her skin tone was still the same cream color as before with no blemishes that she could see. Next she directed her gaze down towards her feet planning to start the viewing of her new body from the bottom up. Because of this, Hinata could clearly see how she had managed such fast speeds when running before. Her new legs were long and held the soft smooth curves that could only be defined as womanly. Despite this Hinata could clearly see the strong muscles under her skin as they moved and shifted with her. Anyone kicked by these would be in for a world of pain. Moving up, her strong thighs led to a set of hips that were much wider then she previously had. This and the firm tight peach shaped rump had Hinata unconsciously thinking of them as baby baring hips. Blushing at the mere thought of carrying babies Hinata moved on. Her ken eyes however noted the small patch of dark indigo hair hovering over her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hips and rear curved into a slim waist but, just because it was small did not mean that it didn\u2019t hold its share of muscle. Hinata could clearly see the signs of powerful core muscles, not so much as to give her a overly defined six pack but,  a quick check with her hand reviled the muscles were clearly there. Hinata couldn\u2019t help but feel pleased as she saw her body had clearly gone with the more curvaceous form if the hourglass shape was anything to go by. She felt surprised at how big her chest was though at the same time she couldn\u2019t help but, feel it was expected. She wasn\u2019t as massive as say Tsunade was rumored to be but, her breast had clearly grown a great deal. She had already been more developed then most girls her age but now she had breast that were nearly the size of her head from before absorbing Naruto. She couldn\u2019t help but, be a bit curious and fondled her breasts gently. Shivers ran through her at the sensation and cause her nipples to harden in delight. Deciding she better continue or risk losing focus, she released her breasts allowing them to drop back into place with a clear bounce to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther up was her neck, and then her head. The face was clearly hers though having clearly lost the baby fat and becoming more curved and defined. At first she thought the whiskers hadn\u2019t been transferred but, with a closer look Hinata found, much to her great delight, three very faint whisker marks on each cheek. Though sadden at how faint they were and how one would have to be standing close to see them Hinata was still glad to have them. Her eyes on the other hand made her feel almost depressed as she saw the same lavender colored Byakugan she had before looking back at her. Though she did admit that they seemed more alive now than before, likely because of how happy she was to have Naruto as a part of her. Her hair however, had some of the oddest change. The hime cut that she had before was still there though it had grown out a great deal. The bangs that use to simply frame her face had lengthened down to her breasts and the back now fell in a cascade down her back all the way to just above her rear. The oddest part of it was that it retained the indigo color from before but, she could clearly see streaks of golden blond mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply watching her reflection in awe Hinata allowed her hands to poke and probe all over her new form. She just couldn\u2019t get over the fact that she had gone from a clearly overdeveloped 12 year old body of about 4 feet 8 inches to a beautiful looking 16 year old of about 5 feet 3 inches. Yes she knew that once Naruto was forced out of her body that she would likely appear closer to her old self in appearance but, this was still an amazing transition. Hinata silently hoped that her body wouldn\u2019t force Naruto out for a long time as she greatly enjoyed the changes he made in her, and loved being able to practically feel his very essence in each and every cell of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she had explored her body enough for the moment Hinata turned to her clothes. She frowned. She wouldn\u2019t be able to go around in those for very long while in her new shape. Sighing she realized she would need to bring a lot of her clothes to the \u2018Iron Kimono\u2019 to have them altered to better fit her. The \u2018Iron Kimono\u2019 was an all ninja clothing and equipment store, though many referred to it an all kunoichi store, as it was the only place in Konoha that kunoichi could bring their clothes to be resized and modified so they would fit both their normal form, and their new empowered form like the one Hinata was currently in. She would need to let the tailor measure her new body so as to make the changes and she would need to return again in her normal form so as to adjust her clothes so they would fit that size as well. Doing this would allow Hinata to have a uniform that would shift to fit her size whenever she managed to absorb Naruto again once her body forced him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing her clearly to small outfit back on before grabbing as much of her spare outfits as she could, Hinata made her way back out of the compound and towards the \u2018Iron Kimono\u2019. As she walked she decided she would also get something to eat while she was out. The whole time a part of her wondered how Naruto would be force out of her body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Hinata had been enjoying herself would be a bit of an understatement. After bringing her cloths to the 'Iron Kimono' and getting her new measurements taken, Hinata had gone out to fill her hungry tummy. She had soon stumbled on to the ramen stand that Naruto loved and ate her fill. Imagin her surprise when the owner had taken her picture and placed it on the wall. She had unintentionally taken Naruto's place for most ramen eaten in one sitting. She hadn't thought she had eaten that much only to count the bowls and find she had eaten nearly 50 Uzumaki sized specials. The Uzumaki special just so happened to be twice the size of their normal large orders. Feeling like a bit of a pig she had quickly paid and left, picking up her resized clothes and dropping them off at home before moving towards a nearby training ground. She needed to see just what kind of enhancements Naruto had caused to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b><u>The next morning.</u></b>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata awoke in her bed feeling wonderful beyond compare. Taking a few moments to sit up and stretch, Hinata got out of bed and looked into her mirror. She was quite surprised to see that she was still in her empowered state. She had been sure that after most of the day yesterday and all night her body would have shifted back to normal in preparation for expelling Naruto. It would that Naruto was more comparable with her body then she had ever believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled at her reflection and feeling rather good about herself struck a pose. Her arms behind her head and pushing her chest out a bit, while turning her body just enough to get a good side profile of herself and sticking a leg out behind her. The pose emphasized the shape of her mature and sexy body, while the light purple nightie she was wearing only went down to just below her breasts leaving her toned stomach and lavender thong on full display. The sight caused an odd thought to enter her mind. <i>'I'd so totally do me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing at what she had just thought and the idea of using Shadow Clones, Hinata shook her head to get rid of the naughty thoughts. Looking back at her reflection Hinata pat her toned stomach then gave a mischievous grin as she cupped and lifted her breasts. \"Good morning Naruto-kun. I have to say I wouldn't mind waking up every morning to see you so close to my heart.\" She said while giggling as she played with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking away from the mirror after a few minutes, Hinata quickly showered and got dressed in her modified outfit. The only difference in her outfit, outside of its size, was that Hinata decided to leave the tan jacket open. Dressed and ready for the day, Hinata exited her room to join her family for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Later*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed happily as she entered the same training grounds from yesterday. Looking around one would think that a mini-war had taken part here with all the craters and destroyed trees. A little further off were two beaten and heavily cracked wooden training posts with the middle one oddly missing. Hinata grinned as she knew this was all from her experimenting with the benefits of her new body. While her chakra control had dropped only the tiniest of margins, her chakra capacity and reserves had skyrocketed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakra capacity was how much chakra a person could channel at one time or how much they could gather into one spot in their coils before it started straining them. Chakra reserves referred to the pool of energy that ninjas drew upon from their center, right around the stomach region. The larger a persons chakra reserves, the more jutsu they could use before passing out from chakra exhaustion. With Naruto as a part of her, her reserves were the largest in the village (she checked), and with her chakra control at such a high level she would be a true jutsu monster in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holes with the odd marks in the ground were from her, admittedly failed, attempts to use the Hyuga style Rotation. The other craters and damaged trees were from her testing out her bodies physical strength. The two wooden posts were the only survivors of her earlier tests. The one on the left was from her first test of her physical strength, which explained why it looked like it had caved in on one side. The post on the right had been badly cracked when she used a burst of chakra to it. It wasn't till later that she noticed what looked like sawdust leaking from the cracks. The middle post had all but, disintegrated when she tried to mix a hard palm thrust and the standard burst of chakra for Gentle Fist into a single move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt very proud of her achievements as no other Hy\u016bga, not even her father, could say that they could do such damage with so little effort. If this was what was standard when a Hy\u016bga women absorbed a partner, then the clan would be do for some changes in its traditional ways very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath of cool morning air, Hinata dropped the bag containing a change of her old non-resized cloths and one of Naruto's outfits, the girl stepped forward to begin a little morning training.</span></div></div>",

Stopping her stances, Hinata could feel her body shifting to its new base form. She could hardly wait to see just what she would look like from now on when Naruto wasn't a part of her. She didn't need to wait long as the feeling of her body shifting soon stopped. Curious, Hinata was quick to run to a small nearby lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing herself in the waters reflection left her feeling a bit vexed. She looked almost exactly like she had before absorbing Naruto. Admittedly, she felt a bit taller then before and her hair had retained some of the golden blond color, though oddly it only was visible in the two bangs cramming her face. Thankfully her hair was longer then before absorbing Naruto as it reached down to her shoulders. She had sadly lost the faint whisker marks on her cheeks but, she did notice that her body felt stronger then it first had; not to mention her body seemed to have matured a bit from before if the slightly wider hips and full cup size larger breasts were anything to go by. Basically she was back to her old self with a few improvements to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her observations for now, Hinata this chance to quickly change into the non-altered clothing. As she put on her old cloths she was able to confirm that her body had matured somewhat as her bra was now to small and her pants and panties were rather tight around her legs and hips. She didn't even want to mention how her panties seemed to be more wedged between her lower cheeks then covering them. She would definitely need to have a second visit to the 'Iron Kimono'  later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata waited patiently for a few minutes to see if Naruto would make his reappearance. Feeling no other change yet, Hinata figured that it would take time for Naruto's body to gather and reform inside of her. She debated for a moment if she should continue training to see what her new base form could do or go strait to the Iron Kimono and have her cloths fitted with her new base size. Just as she made her decision she felt a sudden pressure build up inside of her before her weight seemed to shift a bit.</span></div></div>",

That however would still take some time before it came about. For now, Naruto was simply happy at arriving to his class surprisingly on time. He quickly made his way to the back of the class, passing by his normal seat and sat down next to the weird girl in class, Hinata Hyuga. Without so much as a hello he plopped down into the seat next to her, making the girl squeak in surprise that her crush had chosen to sit next to her. Before she could give any thought to this though, Naruto laid his head down on top of his crossed arms and quickly fell into a fitful sleep.</span></div></div>",

For example, maybe Naruto turns into a vibrator, while Sasuke could turn into a strap-on thong. Every guy would become something different making their transformed state somewhat unique, which would encourage the girls to keep hold of their favorites, treating the guys less like people and more like the objects they are, with maybe a few girls maybe being somewhat exempt from that mindset.

They of course used this power to humiliate them and take advantage of their new form. The kunoichi didn't even care about being potty trained. The were more productive if they didn't have to stop everytime to go to the bathroom. And since the males are pretty much only diapers in their eyes it was very easy for them to change into new diapers if they use their current one's. They didn't know that the males felt everything they did to them. They only saw diapers after they turned them into diapers. Some of the kunoichi didn't turn the males they love into their diapers. They protected them from other kunoichi. But that didn't save these males from the kunoichi. There was still a posibility that they ould end up as a diaper. Soon the males feared the kunoichi. The kunoichi took the chance to get the powerful positions in their society. The schools teached the girls how to turn the males into diapers and didn't even care to teach the boys how to fight back. Going to school as a boy would certainly lead to being wrapped around a girls waist. And the boys were ordered to go to school. Some of the boys however found a way to learn jutsu's without going to school. But they had sneak out of the school in order to learn something. Jiraiya one of the sannin's organized secret meetings to teach the boys some jutsus to defend themselves. He himself had alot of experience with escaping the kunoichi. His big goal was to form a alliance that can fight back but in order to do so his pupils had to spread this information to other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should be our protagonist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto: He only recently heard about Jiraiya's secret meetings but he isn't sure about going there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke: He didn't have to fear being turned int o a diaper because most of the girls love him. However he trains alone to never let that happen.</span></div></div>",

After a long day of missions and training she wanted nothing more then to eat and then take a nice hot bath before falling on her bed. Her dreams filled with her and Naruto awaited her. Giggling lightly to herself she continued walking mindlessly down the dirt road towards home. Having not been paying attention she didn't notice the object laying out in the middle of the road until she tripped over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Tumbling as gracefully as one would expect, Hinata shook her head to try and clear out the cobwebs of her mind. No matter how tired she was, it was no excuse for not paying attention to her surroundings. Looking back at what she had tripped on she saw a small black air tank with a silver nob at the top which was just large enough to hold in her hand. Crawling over to it, she picked it up and examined it more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the air tank up she turned around in her hands, trying to figure out why someone would just leave this out in the middle of the street. It seemed ordinary enough to her, though she did wonder about the odd gauge on the side that currently had its arrow pointing towards empty. Turning it over once more she noticed a small piece of white paper near the nob. \"A note? Why would that be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the note in hand she quickly read it over. \"Who so ever breathes into this air tank will deflate into a wearable skin suit that any person may put on over their own skin. Once the air tank is full of the deflated one's air anyone may either breathe his or her air from the tank and assume their body shape, height, and voice, they may wear their skin and take their appearance, or they may do both and become a complete duplicate of the victim.\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Is this one of Naruto-kun's old pranks?'</i>, she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next?</b></span></div></div>",

They were so caught up in the joy they didn't even offer her any hot water to attempt to turn back into her male form. Granted Ranko was thankful for that, since it let her enjoy her time with everyone without having to drop the bombshells she had with her. However that wasn't to last forever... \"I'll get you some hot water Ranma.\" Kasumi said as she stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Actually...\" Ranko started, causing Kasumi to pause as everyone grew silent, \"It's best you don't.

He's been searching all over for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Pop isn't here... That'll make things easier.\" The mood hadn't left Ranko yet, causing everyone to be concerned as she continued, \"I suppose I should start with the glaring part. I can't turn back into a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... can't?\" Akane asked as she and everyone else stared at Ranko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... The technique used on me by weird martial artist did a lot of things. It sent me to another world and since I was in my cursed form when I was sent... I got locked this way. It also turned me into a toddler again.\" Ranko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toddler? But its only been four years here.\" Nabiki countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it myself, but I know that I spent sixteen years growing up again there.\" Ranko explained before she took a sip of her tea, \"I remembered everything that had happened, but I couldn't do anything about it. Master Sarutobi couldn't promise he would find me a way home either after I explained everything to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... a lot to take in Ranma. What was this world like?\" Akane asked. Not that she didn't trust Ranko, but at the same time Ranko's claim was really far fetched.</span></div></div>",

Growing up, a lot of things happened and... well... I got married.\" She said as she showed the wedding band on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" All of the Tendos screamed at once. They couldn't believe what they had just heard. Ranma got married?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I got married. My name is now Ranko Uzumaki. I got married to Naruto Uzumaki, the current leader of Konoha and the strongest person I know.\" Ranko said as the Tendos stared at her. Ranko fidgeted a bit under the stares, \"I didn't know if I would ever make it home and had to start my life over. One thing led to another and in the end, he helped me through it all. Soon I found myself in love. Believe me it wasn't a walk in the park for me either at first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoun couldn't manage to keep a hold on his tea cup as it slipped from his hand. To Soun, the engagement was ruined. Akane wasn't angry. No she was both sad and joyed. Glad Ranma... er Ranko found someone to love considering everything that happened to her, but sad that Akane wasn't the target of that affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki wasn't to bothered by it one way or another, but was still as shocked as the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi seemed to be the only person happy things worked out for Ranko, \"Oh my, congratulations! Are there any other surprises you want to share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like having a child or being pregnant?\" Nabiki said in her usual attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe... One child and one on the way.\" Ranko admitted with a nervous smile. At that Soun fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi tended to her father but that didn't stop her kindness, \"Congratulations again! What is the first child's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanko smiled at the fact at least Kasumi was taking her news so well, \"Kushina Uzumaki, named after my husband's late mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... I need a moment too... take this all in...\" Akane said as she set down her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So our resident trouble maker settled down?

He should be arriving shortly.\" Ranko also took the time to undo the bun in her hair, letting it fall freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to get to meet them?\" Akane asked, being snapped out of her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanko nodded with a smile, \"I decided that if this all went well, I'd like for you all to meet them. Akane hasn't hit me with a mallet yet and since my father and that old lecher isn't here. Honestly with all my training I might accidentally hurt that pervert if he tried anything...\" Ranko stated with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to meet them!\" Kasumi stated with a happy clap, \"Also I must say your hair looks lovely Ranko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks.\" Ranko said with a slight blush. She still wasn't use to being complimented as a girl even after all the years that went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd... like to meet them too.\" Akane said with a bit of resolve. Ranko was happy, so she'd be happy for Ranko. Besides, knowing her dear friend was alright was enough to help her move on. Unknown to them all the infamous P-chan had also overheard the entire conversation from the hallway. Needless to say the little pig was rather excited at all the news and rushed off to find some hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he should be here...\" Ranko starrted before hearing a knock at the door, \"Oh that must be him. I'll let him in.\" Ranko said as she stood up and rushed to the door. Everyone sat in anticipation as they watched as Ranko returned holding a toddler in her arms with a tall, blonde haired, blue eyed man in tow, \"Everyone, this is Naruto Uzumaki, my husband.\" The man gave a nod and large grin as Ranko turned the toddler in her arms, \"And this is Kushina, my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got up and walked over to the family. Kushina only stared at the strangers for a moment before bursting into a fit of laughter. She shared her mother's hair color and looks, but her fathers whisker marks were clear as day on her cheeks. The Tendos looked between the toddler and Naruto before Nabiki asked, \"So what's with the birthmarks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply chuckled as he rubbed the back of his head, \"Long story I'd rather not share until I know you all better honestly.\"</span></div></div>",

Anyway, so after four months of being teamed up, I was still confused on how I felt about guys and girls. So... I took a leap and went on a date. It was the best way I thought to get an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you found your answer then.\" Soun chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at first, though it was entertaining to see Naruto act all flustered and embarrassed over the smallest things. Our first date he took me to a ramen shop I'd never been to before, given my past experience with Shampoo.\" Everyone nodded in understanding except Naruto, who simply scratched his cheek nervously as Ranko continued, \"The man and his daughter were very nice though and I'll admit that was the best ramen I've ever tasted. After that he took me to his favorite spot on top of the mountain right behind the village. We just sat there an talked until it was dark. Over all... not a bad first date for a couple of thirteen year old kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Nabiki said as she looked at Naruto, \"Color me impressed.

Long, wavy blue hair that reached her thighs, golden eyes, a nice slim body with large breasts, between a D and E cup. Her pointed ears barely poked out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when she stopped to rest that she spotted the blonde, \"Hm... this one is awfully young to be out so late...\" She said in a sultry voice as she looked over Naruto, \"I wonder if this is the fabled Jinchuriki I've heard about.\" Sanai put her finger to her lips in thought as she floated above him, \"If the rumors are correct... he has no parents. If that's the case there is a good chance no one is looking for him. I could take him in but after so long he'd have to leave... Unless...\" Sanai smiled as a planned hatched in her head. With that, she picked up Naruto and flew off to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto rested in Sanai's bed, Sanai was busy at work on a concoction in the kitchen, \"A bit of ginger root... and one last thing. A simple bit of hair.\" Sanai said as she plucked a hair from her head and dropped it into the pot. It gave out a puff of smoke causing Sanai to smile. The dipped a glass into the concoction and walked back into the bedroom. There she set the glass down on a dresser away from the bed as she grabbed a book to read while waiting on Naruto to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later her patience was rewarded. Naruto groaned as he sat up, \"Where... where am I?\" he asked in a sleepy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my home dear boy.\" Sanai answered as she set the book down, \"My name is Sanai, and I am a succubus. Do you know what that is?\" Naruto shook his head no, making Sanai smile more, \"Well... to put it simply, my job is to make others feel good over night. After I finished for the night, I was enjoying a night flight when I found you.\" Sanai twitched her wings as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have wings.\" Naruto stated the obvious leaving Sanai to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tail too.\" Sanai added as she lifted the tail, \"So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" Naruto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, where are your parents Naruto?\" Sanai asked. She had to play the role of clueless if her plan was to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't have any...\" Naruto answered as he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanai gasped in fake surprise, \"Oh... I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... I never met them.\" Naruto added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanai placed her finger on her chin in fake thought, \"Hm... well you know... You could live with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up in surprise. Being nine years old he took this at face value, \"Really...?\" The hope in his voice was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I would love to raise you Naruto... Although there is a problem. I don't know how to raise a boy, only girls.\" Sanai said, feeling bad at the dejected face Naruto made, \"However, I do have this.\" Sanai said as she grabbed the glass off the dresser, \"This would turn you into a lovely little succubus like me Naruto.

Her hair, now down to her hips, was tied into a braid while her slept. She stood up from her bed, completely naked, and walked to her own bathroom. Her large B-cup breasts, an impressive size for the recent thirteen year old girl if she were just human, bounced with every step. Naomi was a succubus however, so her size was relatively normal. Once in the bathroom Naomi stopped in front of the mirror and undid the braid, letting her hair free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four years...\" She muttered as she raked her fingers through her hair to ensure it wasn't tangled. She then stepped into the shower and began to clean herself, \"Four years since mom adopted me. Since I became a girl and a succubus.\" Naomi smiled as she rubbed the soap over hear breasts, letting out a slight moan before talking to herself more, \"I don't regret it one bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi fondled her breasts a bit more before she snapped out of her pleasure, \"Oh yeah its my birthday! I can't waste time tonight! Mom promised after all!\" Naomi said as she sped up her cleaning. Once clean and out of the shower, she dried and brushed her hair before putting a scrunchy on it at her neck to tie it together. She then split it into a pair of pony tails at the base of her wings. This made flying much easier on her hair. Once done with that she started to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanai knocked and entered the room as Naomi dressed, \"Hey I was just about to wake you Naomi.

Naruto's manhood shank down to a clitoris as his testicles retracted into his body. His face contorted in discomfort as his testicles moved inside his body, reforming into ovaries. They attached to the newly formed womb, finishing Naruto's change from male to female. The changes seemed to spread from there. The gel itself seemed to keep Naruto in a state of unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's hips widened as her waist slimmed down. Scales appeared all over her hips and goes up her sides, leaving her stomach bare. The scales also covered her back as a dragon tail grew out of spine. A bit of hair was seen growing at the tip of the tail as well as small spikes. Spines appeared on the tail going all the way up to her neck. All of the changes occurring on Naruto's back causes more discomfort, making her subconsciously roll onto her stomach. Once on her stomach, little numbs could be seen coming out of her shoulder blades. Her wings were forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto's wings grew in, claws formed on the tips of Naruto's fingers, replacing the finger nails completely. Her pinky and third finger had fused together as scales covered it completely. The scales went all the way up to biceps, stopping halfway up. The same type of claws appeared on her toes as her feet started to stretch while her calves shrank. The joints of her ankles moved up as her toe joints bent and locked Naruto to where she would always stand on the balls of her feet. A large claw grew out of the back of her heel as scales completely covered her legs. Her toes fused together until only three remained. By this point her wings had completely finished growing, now lying completely stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her face changed, becoming smaller and more feminine. Her ears grew longer, pointing at the as scales formed on the outside and edges of the inner ear. Small spikes appeared on the tips of Naruto's ears almost giving the appearance of jewelry. Her hair grew longer, stopping just before her shoulders in length. Scales grew on the back of Naruto's neck, going around to her face over her eyes. Lastly two sets of horns grew out of her skulls from above her ears, going towards the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last few changes occurred to Naruto, though they couldn't be seen. Her tongue grew a bit longer as it forked. Her teeth became razor sharp as glands formed in the back of her throat giving her the gift of natural fire breath. Her chest pushed out a small out, giving Naruto budding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was now a dragonness</span></div></div>",

Naruto, who was now completely naked thanks to the gel, groaned as the dragon's tongue ran across her face, \"Hm... huh?\" Naruto's eyes opened, revealing pure blue dragon eyes. She looked up at the dragon licking her and was a bit surprised. Surprised... yet not afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female dragon noticed her child was awake and stopped the grooming, \"You're awake sooner then I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat up and immediately realized she was different. She looked down at her dragon hand, her feet, the tail, her wings... all of it. She took in every bit of her new appearance. She should have been mad. Angry they changed her but... she wasn't. In fact, she liked it. She could feel the strength in her body, the raw power. She took a deep breath in, only to hiccup a small blue flame. This made her slam her hands over her mouth in surprise. The dragon only chuckled as Naruto slowly took her hands away from her mouth. She turned to the dragon and simply asked, \"Why... did you do this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mate and I found you in the woods, abandoned. We took you in and decided to raise you. However dragon law dictates that those adopted must become dragonkin or dragonness. You were then changed by me into a dragonness, for the number of females are low.\" The dragon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you made me into a girl just to even the numbers?\" Naruto asked, feeling used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. Do not mistake me on my intention dear child. You would have been adopted regardless. However we must ensure the species will survive.\"The dragon said. Naruto nodded, managing to understand. Maybe this change had made her smarter as well? The dragon continued, \"Do not worry. I will teach you everything you will need to know to be a fine dragonness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Does that mean I can call you \"Mom\"?\" Naruto asked sounding a bit hopeful. Never having a mother before, she may as well make the best of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smiled warmly as she nuzzled Naruto, \"of course dear. You are our beloved daughter now after all. Now what do we call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Naomi. Naomi Azure.\" The newly named Naomi said as she looked at her scales. Just then the sound of the male dragon could be heard landing by the two. Naomi was about to stand to greet her new father when she felt her mother's tongue run over her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished cleaning you dear. He can come to us.\" The mother said before she continued to lick Naomi clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male dragon walked up to the two, looking between the two before it set down the two dead deer in its mouth. He licked the blood from his mouth for a moment before speaking, \"You are adjusting well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... still taking it all in... father\" Naomi said as she felt her own tail, adding the father part after a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've explained the basics. We can explain the rest after she's settled in.\" The female dragon stated before reaching over to one of the deer and dragging its carcass over. She then pinned it down with her claw while biting down on its hind leg. The dragon tore the leg off, setting it down in front of Naomi, \"Eat young one. You must be hungry.\" </span></div></div>",

The smell of the fresh blood was so clear to her that her stomach rumbled at the prospect of food. She took a bite of the deer leg from where it was torn off, trying to avoid the fur. Chewing the meat, she slowly sped the pace of her chewing up before digging into the meat. Her hunger being so strong she didn't even care about the fur. Wisps of flame escaped Naomi's mouth as she tore into the deer leg, cooking it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male dragon seemed impressed when he spotted the flames, \"Already breathing fire. She is a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi was to engrossed by her meal to listen to the two adults as they talked. The female dragon smiled, \"That is not all, she already shows control over her wings and tail also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the tip of Naomi's tail patted the ground repeatedly as she ate. Her wings would twitch on occasion as well. It was clear the dragons had made a fine choice in adopting Naomi. With that the dragons decided to eat as well, digging into the remaining deer meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-An hour later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father. Mother.\" Naomi spoke after some silence. The dragons had left her alone to her thoughts so that she could settle in. The two dragons turned to their child as she spoke, \"Thank you for this. It's still... new, but so far I enjoy everything.\" It wasn't a lie. The strength, the fire breathing, the wings... heck even being a girl felt nice. Also having parents that seemed to show some care was so... nice. Naomi never knew how much better those other kids had it. Still, that being said she couldn't leave the Third Hokage and the others wondering where she was, \"There is someone we should tell about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... have family still?\" The mother asked concerned. If this was true then they may have made a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not exactly. The village leader would take time to ensure I was alright though, as well as a man and his daughter. I don't feel right leaving them wondering where I am so...\" Naomi said as she gripped her hands together nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons relaxed at knowing they hadn't taken another person's child. The father spoke first as he stood up. His form shifted and changed until a large human male with horns and wings stood in front of Naomi, \"I understand. I will fly to the village and speak to this leader for you. If things go well, you may even be given permission to visit these people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi looked surprised before she stood up. Her feet wobbled a bit at first as she walked to her new father, but her tail kept her balanced. She embraced her father gently with a happy smile on her face, \"Thank you father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father smiled as he rubbed Naomi's head, \"You are welcome Naomi. I will return shortly.\" With that Naomi let go of her father and walked over to her mother, who she sat down and nestled in with. The father walked over to the entrance of the cave and opened a chest hidden within the rocks. Taking a robe out, he shut the chest and flew off towards Konoha.</span></div></div>",

Once he had time to organize his thoughts, Sarutobi spoke, \"I must say I'm not happy about these events... However... if Nar-.. Naomi is happier with you then he... she was here, then it will be best if I simply let things progress as they have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male dragon smiled a bit at this, \"That is wise. I can see how you became the leader of this village.\" The dragon stood up, making sure his robe wasn't slacking, \"Since you have been so understanding on this matter, I feel comfortable allowing her to visit. Once she has had time to practice with her new abilities, she will be allowed to visit at her leisure unless circumstances prevent it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... appreciate that. Believe it or not I do care deeply for her...\" Sarutobi started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need not explain.\" The dragon interrupted, \"One man responsible for thousands. It is easy for one for fall from sight. You are only human and cannot be everywhere at once. Take solace in having the wisdom in knowing when to give a charge to one who can care for them instead of holding onto pride.\" The dragon stopped for for a moment as he stroked his chin, \"Hm... perhaps we can work out another arrangement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What kind of arrangement?\" Sarutobi asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a dragonkin or dragonness reach a certain age, they are given a test. Should they pass, they are given the ability to become a full dragon. However the numbers for both types of dragon kind are low. Not dangerously low, but low enough for the elders to notice. We are stable, and will most likely recover as we have in the past. However we cannot continue to hope that we will find stray children in need of homes. So... what I propose is a pledge of protection for your village. I will bring this pledge to my elders. In exchange, we would like to hold trials for your young to become of dragon kind.\" The male dragon stated. He was high ranked in the elders council, which is what gave him the authority to make this proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I would need more details on what this would entail.\" Sarutobi said as he took another puff of his pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest assured we would not force the young to take this trial. It would be voluntary on their part and the parents. The trials would be tests of strengths and of character. Nothing dangerous for them.\" The dragon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I will consider it. I will have an answer for you in the time it takes you to get approval for this proposal.\" Sarutobi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Until then, be well master of the hidden leaf village.\" The male dragon spoke before he left.</span></div></div>",

The first and foremost important task to master for Naomi was her ability to breath fire. After all can't have her accidentally burn things just by sneezing or coughing. \"Now flex your throat muscles. You'll feel the glands that give you the gift of fire breathing.\" Naomi obeyed her mother, flexing the muscles in her neck until she could feel the glands. Once felt, she took a deep breath and exhaled. A large plume of fire came out of Naomi's mouth, disappearing quickly when she stopped. The mother dragon only smiled, \"Very good Naomi. A fine first attempt. The glands we have converts chakra into fire and barely uses any at all. There for the biggest restriction is the control and amount of air you exhale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi nodded and took another breath before trying again. The mother watched as Naomi's breath steadily lasted longer and longer until Naomi could hold the breath for a full six seconds. Rather impressive for a fresh dragonness. Naomi was going to be a remarkable member of dragon kind. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple years passed with Naomi learning all there was to learn about her new home. How to fly properly, a proper fighting technique that incorporated her dragon strength, and knowledge of the world many didn't know about such as nature chakra. She was growing into quite the beauty as well, having a proper diet for a change. For one, her hair was now down to the base of her wings and her body was slim to the point no one would think she could uproot a medium size tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi took a deep breath and blew fire into the pile of stones in the den, making sure her mother's eggs were kept at the optimum temperature. Once that was done, Naomi took a quick flight just outside the cave to gather some fruit to eat. Only being gone a couple minutes at the most, she walks back into the cave and sits next to the egg incubator. Her parents were off at some dragon meeting and she was tasked with watching over her future siblings. Not the most exciting thing she's ever done, but considering how protective her mother was of these eggs she knew how important her responsibility was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching on the fruit, she let her mind wander, <i>\"Hm.. Maybe I should grow my hair out more. Though it will be hard to fly without it becoming a mess... Oh I should probably visit Old man Hokage soon. It's almost been a month. Though I need to make a bigger vest...\"</i> Naomi thought as she looked down at her own chest. She was an early bloomer, already having large A-cup breasts. Soon she'd be at a B-cup and she knew it. <i>\"I hope I don't get too big... Flying will be very awkward for a while if I do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's thoughts were interrupted as she heard her parents land outside the cave. She hopped to her feet and ran out to greet them, \"Mother! Father! Welcome home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear.\" Mother said before giving Naomi a gentle kiss on the cheek, \"How are the eggs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and toasty just like you said too keep them.\" Naomi said cheerfully as her father gave her a quick nuzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Naomi. Now we have something to tell you. Remember the offer I told you I made to the leader of you old village?\" Naomi nodded with a puzzled look on her face, \"Well the council has decided to go along with it. In two years a few dragonkin and dragonness will be chosen to represent us and scout potential candidates. You're Mother and I would like to offer you one of those positions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...?\" Naomi asked, seeming rather conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You once lived in that village. You would be the best judge of character for the females of that village. Of course you won't be required to stay in the village. You can come home at any time.\" Father said, causing Naomi to relax, \"Of course you don't have to if you don't want too. We just thought you'd appreciate the change to venture out and meet some new people. Have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Naomi pondered this to herself. It was true that she didn't have many friends since there weren't many dragonkin or dragonness near by. Most were nearly half a day away and she couldn't be gone that long at her age. She wouldn't be far from home so coming straight back once she was done for the day also helped. Plus one other thought she had. Her mother and father took her in and looked after her. It was only right she honored their wishes and looked for others who wished to become of her kind and flourish their numbers, \"Alright. I'll do it for you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the dragons smiled and nuzzled their daughter with affection before all three went back inside the cave. </span></div></div>",

While they played, Naomi was preparing for her first trip to Konoha as a judge for new potential dragonkin. She and a number of other dragonkin would be observing trainees in the ninja academy to see if they were worthy as her parents explained to her. Needless to say however this required her to wear clothing, which was a slight problem given her recent growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe currently stood a little over five feet tall with a fairly sexy body for her age. Her bust, being roughly around forty inches with C-cup, caused her to have to make a larger vest out of the leather hide she had made over the last couple of months, as well as a new skirt. The skirt had been finished the day before thankfully. Naomi's hips were a decent size thankfully, not being overly large or small along with her butt. Her thighs were a bit thick, but that was just due to her dragon side. Her hair now ended at the base of her tail, but it kept its wild spiky nature. She ground down her horns to where they just long enough to reach the edge of her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished sewing up her vest, she stood up and stretched. The one annoying thing of going to Konoha was going to be getting use to clothing again. Still, at least she didn't have to be covered like the humans do. She checked on her siblings again to see them still wrestling before she noticed a pair of shadows pass over head, \"Alright every come over here! Mother and Father are back!\" The dragon hatchlings all stopped and ran back to the cave, laughing along the way. Soon enough both parent dragons landed in the clearing. The dragon hatchlings immediately ran up to their parents to greet them while Naomi simply walked up to them, \"Mother! Father! Welcome back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear\" Mother dragon responded as they greeted their children, \"Any problems while we were away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\" Naomi answered, \"I just worked on my clothing while watching my siblings play. I'm ready for my first day tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Naomi.\" Father dragon said as he walked up and nuzzled her, \"Are you worried?\"</span></div></div>",

But when Hagoromo created the tailed beasts, he could only recreate the six Akuma. So when they roamed freely for milennia, that when people started sealing them away, the jinchuuriki took on physical aspects. They would become tall, peak physical condition, and even take on animal characteristics of either their Akuma or their summon. But none of this matters compared to their immense power.

At least he was free for the rest of the day to goof off. Naruto shifted a bit before he felt something in his back pocket. Fishing the item out, he looked at the Transformation Notebook he had found earlier that day, \"Oh yeah this thing. Some kid's poor attempt at a joke. Probably wanted to mess with his friends with a transformation jutsu or something.\" Naruto said with a chuckle. It would be cool if he could turn people into anything he wanted too. \"Heh, maybe I'll write something down just for fun.\" Naruto said as he pulled a pen out. The only reason he even had the pen was due to a paperwork based mission today. \"Now what to write...?\" Naruto asked himself quietly before he spotted Sasuke walking by. Naruto immediate scowled before an idea hatched in his mind that caused a grin. He quickly started to scribble down into the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sasuke Uchiha will turn into a cute female version of himself named Satsuki Uchiha that lives as a maid to Naruto Uzumaki. This change comes from the Uchiha clan not being a clan of master shinobi, but a clan of all females who are compelled to find a person to serve someone. The spend the years of their early lives learning how to be a proper maid then are allowed to seek a master to serve. To an Uchiha, the highest reward they can receive from their master is the gift of bearing the child of their master and will strive to always please said master in hopes of achieving this goal. Sadly, an illness claimed the lives of all the Uchiha except for Satsuki  years ago and while wondering the woods in deep thought she was nearly killed by a training trap. Thankfully Naruto arrived and saved her before anything could happen. Satsuki was grateful for this rescue and after seeing how kind the lonely Naruto could be she pledged her eternal servitude to him and even invited Naruto to her much larger home to live in.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Satsuki is 150.1 cm tall with a BHW measurement of B99 C-cup W58 H91 cm. Her hair goes down to her butt and is always in a braid. She has a slightly perverted nature and always dresses in a maid outfit of various colors with a corset that shows her figure. All of her outfits show the same generous amount of cleavage. Her skits are all short enough to where when she bends over she gives a slight panty shot through her stockings. She always wears heels at three inches minimum of different types. She'll occasionally mix things up with some jewelry or headbands with animal ears and a belt with the matching tail.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was laughing as he finished writing what he felt was a ridiculous short story of Sasuke becoming his maid. He looked down back and Sasuke and froze as he watched all of the changes he wrote down take place. The first change Naruto saw was a pair of breasts growing out of the now Satsuki's chest as her hips widened and waist pushed in as a corset appeared on her. She shrank in height a bit as her hair grew longer and braided itself as her face softened and changed shape to that of a teenage girl. Her outfit changed almost instantly into her maid uniform. Satsuki blinked in confusion before she smiled, \"Time to get groceries for Master Naruto's dinner!\" She said cheerfully as she resumed her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't believe it. The notebook had worked. It made Sasuke into Satsuki. He looked at it as memories of him and Satsuki together filled his mind. They were actually very good friends. More than just masater and servant. This made Naruto smile a bit as he stood up and put the notebook away. He may as well see this day through to the end. If anything he could try changing Satsuki back to Sasuke if this didn't work out.</span></div></div>",

As he took off his sandals he could smell the scent of fresh food being cooked along with hearing a wonderful melody from a lovely voice singing in the kitchen. \"I'm home!\" He announced as he set down his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singing stopped and hurried footsteps echoed before Satsuki entered the apartment den, \"Good afternoon Master Naruto!\" She said with a bow, showing her generous cleavage to her master with a smile, \"Dinner will be finished shortly master. I hope you will like it once it is finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, remembering from his new memories that Satsuki could do virtually anything housework related with ease to the best quality. \"Don't worry Satsuki. I know it will be amazing as always!\" He says before giving her a hug. Satsuki blushed and quickly returned the hug, reveling in the close contact with her master who she loved. However Naruto always treated her like this, so short of a kiss, Satsuki couldn't be sure of Naruto's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon were enjoying dinner, having casual conversation about their day. As they did, Naruto began to wonder if he should keep Sasuke as Satsuki. She seemed happy, and he was definitely happy to have her. Thanks to his new memories, he could feel the love for her swelling in his heart. Naruto paused his eating and stared at Satsuki for a moment before deciding too...</span></div></div>",
