You'll do fine\". Of course she made it. I did not. I was happy for my friend, but I could not help but see that little green enveous monster. That night, I found my parents standing in the kitchen with my older brother Mike and little brother Jake. Mike is fairly cool, for a 19 year old big brother. I give him points for trying. Jake. That's another story. I swear that little pervert was in my stuff again. Like, what's with him? He was a brat as a kid, and a bigger brat at 13. Anyway, mom and dad told us they were going on a cruise for a year, leaving the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were a blur. Mike filled in as the 'parent', mostly leaving me and Jake to our own thing. School was getting worse too. Although Bri was nice, life was tough for a failed cheerleader. It was no surprise, I came home crying. As I when up to my room, I saw the door open. \"Jake\" I muttered furiously. He did everything to annoy me. he read my diary. i swear, I even think he tries on my clothes, not that i've ever caught him. I rushed up to catch in the act, only to stop dead. A woman was sitting on my bed. She had raven red hair, and looked in her mid thirties, styled nicely in a bun. Her clothes were stylish, and make up perfect. I wish mine was. Again I suspect Jake's involvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what are you doing in my room?\" I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked up. \"my name is unimportant, Miss  Jeffers. But what I'm going to tell you is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, unimportant. You're a first witch, Penelope Jeffers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?! Are you okay?\" I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfectly. It is common for a first witch such as yourself. You're the first in your family to be able to use magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't believed in magic..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you was 10. I know\" the woman said</span></div></div>",

I find that a bit hard to swallow.\" I told the woman but she just looked and me and then took out her hand and showed me a bright blue flame from her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You are a first Witch, but you aren't alone I too am a witch as this flame indicates. Feel free to touch it if it satisfies your curiosity.\" The Woman said. I was amazed and shocked at the flame, thankfully my curiosity was even greater then my shock and much to my amazement as I put my hand in the flame I found it didn't burn, how brightly lit it was, I'd expect to burn, but I felt no pain from her flame at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It doesn't burn...but how?\" I asked. The Woman simply smiled and then began to answer my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The Flame Test as we call resembles a flame but is not actually fire at all, it signifies the amount of power a Witch has the brighter the flame the more power she will have, of course naturally through training a witch can increase there power. Why don't you try to summon your flame.\" The woman then told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She gave me a bit of instruction on how to summon it all I had to do was concentrate and imagine a flame appearing in the palm of my hand. I concentrated as hard as I could and much to my surprise I was able to summon a flame however it looked more like a candlelight to me. What really surprised the woman however was the my flame wasn't blue like hers, instead it was....</span></div></div>",

Especially if they don't interest you.\" She explained to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Alright so now that we figured that out, what am I supposed to do from here?\" I ask her once more unsure of what to do at the moment.

Too bad I didn't know of any witches other than the one that just jumped out of the window. I then looked at the book that witch left for me and began to read it. I would hope there would be something in the book to help me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The first few pages of the magic book contained no signs of an spells instead just a lot of reading about the rules that a witch must follow. The rules were simple. The first one was that witches were not allowed to use magic in public without a good reason. The Second rule was that all witches would be tested in one way or another. The Third however was that no transformation may be permanent unless under life threatening situations.  After reading that one I hoped to avoid being in life threatening situations.  The Fourth rule stated that a New Witch will be evaluated by the Head Witch after one year of training.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Wonder why a new witch must be evaluated after a year of training?\" I asked aloud without even thinking. Much to my surprise however the book had seemed to answer back as if to respond to my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Every New Witch is evaluated to ensure the know all the basics and guidelines as well as to determine how well they do against various scenarios that could end up causing a lot of these New witches to go Rogue.\" The Book responded.  The book responding to my question however gave me an idea. While I did not know  where a could find a witch that could tutor me the book probably did. With that thought in mind I decided to ask the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Okay book, I am a new with and I am seeking the best mentor for me? Can you find one?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The book glowed and revealed an address almost as if the book knew exactly where it wanted me to go. I decided to go and head out to the place where the book told me. I took the book with me and left a note for my two brothers that I had left home and will be back shortly.  I walked until I came upon a rather old house. I then went and knocked on the door. A woman came up to the door and greeted me. She had brown hair and blue eyes. Her look was rather ragged and worn as if she had literally been working all kinds of hours and I just caught her while she was sleeping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hello? Who might you be?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" My name is Penny Jeffers? I am curious about you a bit because a book lead me to you. I believe it said you could help me as well.\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You mean a phone book?\" The woman asked. I quickly shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No, not that kind of book. The Other kind of book.\" I told her. She then looked around and once she was sure no one was around she gestured for me to come inside.  I nodded and then went inside her house, once I was in her house she began to introduce herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" My name is Annabelle Springs, I am what some would call a Witch Detective now what brings a novice witch to my place?\" She asked. She was right on the point and even pointed out that she already knew that I was a witch. Without a doubt I was sure I would be able to learn something from her. However somehow I also knew she wasn't the person who gave me the book in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I came to learn from you. I asked the magic book and brought me to you. Can I ask you something what exactly is a Witch Detective?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" So you came to learn magic from me then, Alright I'll teach you but in exchange you will have to do some favors for me. As for what a Witch Detective is. Well that depends on who you ask. To some I am just an ordinary detective trying to make a living. To Others I am a Witch. However I am both in certain circumstances.\"  Annabelle told me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Thanks for helping me, Guess we will start with lessons tomorrow then?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I will actually give you an actual one right now, Although it may not be what you think. What is Magic to a Witch? That is your homework for our first meeting. Tomorrow we will begin with Basic Witch Training, Flexibility Training and Meditation. I trust you will leave at least three hours each day I will give you one day of your choice to rest each week. As for the things you will do let's just say there's a lot of stuff around the house that needs to be done.\"    Annabelle said.  After meeting and hearing her give me homework before I even done any training under her. Three hours a day seemed a lot however knowing that I failed to be picked for a cheerleader gave me plenty of time. Of Course I didn't understand why she wanted me to go through the flexibility training as well as the meditation at this point.</span></div></div>",

I didn't quite understand what she was trying to tell with this particular question. At least not yet I couldn't answer it, because even though I am technically a Witch, I never really thought of myself as one. It was at this point I had found my answer at least. Unfortunately I didn't even know if it would be the right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I knocked on her door once again and she was quick to answer.  \" I see you came back, Have you found the answer to your Homework?\" She asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I never considered myself a Witch before, So I don't think I can give you an answer.\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You just did, it is a question I asked of you, but I am rather proud that you found your answer.\" She told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" But Didn't I just tell you I never considered myself a Witch? So how can that be an answer?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Most Witches now a days usually focus a whole lot on gender spells, whenever I asked them the same question they always were excited about that prospect of magic. But often forget about the other magic and hardly ever work at anything else. My training how ever doesn't focus on that. \" Annabelle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" So what does your training focus on then?\" I asked.  It was then she quickly replied....</span></div></div>",

It is rather refreshing to teach a young witch who isn't overly interested in turning their sibling into girls. Although I am pretty sure, with more practice you are bound to be doing that at some point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I looked at her a bit confused but glad that she had took a rather peculiar liking to me. Despite her liking aside form her being both a detective and a Witch I was eager to learn more about her. So without further delay I decided to simply ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Miss Springs, can you tell me a bit about yourself?\" I asked. She looked at me and smiled back as  she quickly began to answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sure, what is that you wish to know about me?\"  I thought long and hard there were so many things I wanted to know about her, who her parents were, how she learned she was a witch and a whole lot more. I thought about all the things I would like to know about her, I decided to ask the one thing I was the more curious about than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" How did you become a Witch Detective Miss Springs?\" I asked. She looked at me and gave a slight smile, yet it wasn't a reassuring smile or a comforting one, in fact it looked like asking that particular question reminded her of some fond yet rather remorseful memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" That is a good question, I don't want to get too big on the details and take much of your time. So I will keep it short.\" She then looked at me and continued with her story. \" I was once a Rogue Hunter a Witch that hunts Rogue witches, I had me reasons for doing such a demanding job, but back then I believed the Rogue Hunters were the symbols of Justice in the witch world. I was rather na\u00efve for thinking that. At that time I simply never thought the Rogue Hunters could do anything that would be more beneficial to them. I always believed them to be fair and just. However that changed one day when I caught one of my partners implanting evidence onto the suspect!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You had a partner and they planted evidence on the person you and them were trying to catch? Was the Witch really someone they needed to do that with?\" I asked curious about Miss Springs story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No they didn't have to, she was actually innocent, but they wanted to make her guilty of the crime anyway. I couldn't stand to see them do that so I went to my Supervising Officer and told her about it. I thought she would call my partner out on that. However I was shocked to learn that my Supervising Officer was the one who told my partner to do so!\" As I was listening to her story I found it to be quite interesting. Although she had yet to get to the part of how she became a Witch Detective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What happened after that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" After that I had to go to the Head Witch and talk to her about what my Supervisor and Partner were doing. Neither of them wanted me to do that, but I don't believe people should be punished if they haven't done anything wrong. Fortunately the Head Witch agreed to me. She was kind of still new to being the Head witch back then, but eventually with her help I was able to prove that my partner and Supervisor were implanting evidence on to this witch. Once that was proven all charges upon the witch they were framing were dropped and my supervisor and partner were fired. I could have continued on with the Rogue Hunters, however after that experience I didn't really feel like continuing down that path so I went back to school and learned to be a detective. I don't want any one witch or non witch to face any type of injustice like that ever again.\"  After that point I could tell that there was more to the story than what she had told me. She didn't seem like she wanted to speak about it anymore though. Fortunately I then decided to ask a somewhat easier question, rather than press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Do you know anything about the witch your partners were trying to frame?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Not much, only that her name was Samantha. Other then that I don't know much about her. How about we get on with today's magic lesson now?\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Fair enough, what is it you want me to do this time?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" This time will be quite different from your previous one. First I want you to summon your flame.\" Annabelle Springs told me. Without further delay I began to summon forth my crimson red flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Now what am I supposed to do?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" This training will be a lot more tricky then the first lesson, but all the worthwhile  now that you summoned it I want you to change it's color, like this.\"  Miss Springs then went and brought fourth her own blue flame and then changed it so that it matched the color of my flame.  With her story however at the time I was rather disappointed that this was the next step she would have me take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What is the point of doing that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Simple, you already know that a different color flame can bring different abilities or in your case enchantments you could use. By learning to change your flames color you will be able to master a variety of spells. You will never know when a spell your unfamiliar with will come in handy. I expect it should take you about seven days to learn to change it into seven different colors.\" She replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The rest of the day I spent training trying to change the color of my flame, but so far I wasn't able to do it today. It was then I remembered that it was my turn to make dinner for my brothers Jake and Mike. I had been so focused on my magic that I practically forgot, it didn't exactly help that I was late either. I waved and said my goodbyes to my teacher and quickly headed home. As I got home I found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't really want to bother Mrs. Springs after all. Plus I did have to learn to change t he color of the flame so I can cast any other spell. This way I could at least try a spell and perhaps finally get it to where my brother would stop sneaking in and trying my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I looked in my spell book and fortunately I found quite a few spells that I could use. But each of them were very different from them. down side is  certain one's had potential side effects. So I looked at the first one was basically a simple spell where I use an enchantment on my clothing which prevents any one but me from wearing it. This one sounded perfect only problem was according the spell book this spell would last about eight hours maximum. Meaning it was somewhat limited and I would have to cast it on ever single piece of clothing I owned. Which Could take quite a long time. The spell was simply called Enchanted Wardrobe, the great thing about it was that I wouldn't have to change the color of my flame for this one since it required a crimson red flame for me to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Curious to see if there was a way I can find a way to enchant all my clothes at wants I eventually found an invisibility spell. Which then gave me the idea. I could try and make my closet or dresser invisible! That way he wouldn't be able to see my clothers, so there would be no way to try on my clothes if he can't find or see them. It even included the words for the spell but because it was an illusion it required a blue flame and me saying words which were unfortunately in latin perfectly without messing them up. The words in the spell were \"facti sunt invisibilia\".   The problem with this one however was that it required a lot of power and wasn't recommended to do without someone watching, al least according to the book.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Fortunately I deicded to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However what I wanted to do mostly was keep him out of my clothing, Not make him fit more into it. It was then I realized that as long as my clothes are in my room, if I could somehow make it to where he couldn't get into my room then he wouldn't be able to wear my clothing in the first place. I then quickly looked in the book and found the perfect spell for just the occasion. It did require me to change the color of my flame to blue however in order to cast it. However the basic description as exactly what I wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The spell would prevent anyone from accessing my room without my permission. I thought about only adding it to my closet, but this spell would do well to protect my entire room from intruders. So I began my preparations and began casting the spell. I successfully changed my flame form it's crimson red color to a cool blue flame and recited the words in the spell book. \" <i>I cast thy spell, to make my room guarded well. Protect from the uninvited, So my family will stay united.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After my words were spoken I felt like all the energy was drained out of me. I was sure the spell worked but I needed quite the rest after that. I also had decided that I would confront Jake about his obsession with my clothing, so t hat I can finally understand why he keeps trying my clothes on. There was also another part of me that wanted to test the strength of the spell I cast. However at that time I was too exhausted to care about it.  After a short afternoon nap I decided to....</span></div></div>",

She scanned the pages for at least two minutes before she finally found her answer. \"Ah! So that's what it means...Well I should prepare appropriately then.\" She then turned to me and finally responded to my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Dear Girl, sometime people have different color flames, it doesn't signify the amount of power you have, rather it signifies your magic specialty.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I was a bit confused at her answer but from what I could guess from her actions, this was most likely her first time encountering a different type of flame. \"What do you mean magic specialty?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"To put it simply your gifted in divine magic, which is unusual but not unheard of.\" She then continued. \"Divine Magic to put it simply is things like finding lost item's, healing, and dealing with evil spirits, which means you will need training eventually but for now I will leave you with a basic Spell Book, study it carefully and be warned your power is rare others will seek it for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She then instructed me on how to turn off the flame in my hand and gave me a  Spell Book, then she simply vanished as if she had never been in my room at all, with the exception of the spell book. I decided that now I would finally try one of the spells in the Spell Book. The First spell was simply something that had to do with putting on my make-up. I could try that spell it seemed easy enough, or I could try the second spell which was a simple levitation spell. Both of those spells seemed interesting I wonder if I should try one of those or perhaps find a spell to use on someone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Eventually I chose the...</span></div></div>",

Surely enough it was simple enough to use however the spell had no direction in which to go so I ended up messing up the spell and looking absolutely ridiculous w hen I saw myself in the mirror. Apparently although I had used it correctly I had learned that I would still need a mirror to see myself in when using it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Good thing for me that spell wasn't too hard for me to learn either but just as I was about to head to the bathroom. I saw one of my brothers coming out of the hallway. My heart panicked and my chest pumped vigorously as I anxiously awaited to see who would be coming out and hope they wouldn't see me.  In my desperation of not to be seen looking like a crazed clown I quickly cast another spell, I didn't exactly know what I was doing at that time I just didn't want to be seen, so I quickly recited an invisibility spell hoping it would hide me from who ever it was coming out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  However the spell didn't work as I expected and it...</span></div></div>",

It seemed that Invisibility took quite a bit out of me as I felt exhausted from just using it once. What was worse was now I looked completely naked!   Worst yet my brother was coming down the hall this way.  It was my brother Jake who came out of the shower and worst yet he saw me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"  Yours could be a bit bigger.\" Jake said to me with a grin. It was almost as if he was glad he got a sneak peak of my body. I was infuriated!  I tried a spell and it didn't work like it expected. Not only that but that invisibility spell was exhausting. As I thought about it further and further, I had magic powers now, but I had no clue on how to use them or prevent embarrassing incidents like this. I decided to continue to go to take my shower and read up on the magic book a bit further before using any other spells. I was too tired to cast a single one anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When I read the magic book further I find I wasn't reading spell's but rather rules. Apparently there were a lot of rules, some of which stated that I can't transform anyone permanently unless their life is threatened. This confused me as how would other people's life be threatened? I quickly remember the woman who was in my room and realized that perhaps not all Witches would have good intentions.  That brought me to conclude that there are other witches out there. Probably some even more experienced than me. It also occurred to me that the woman who told me I was a witch never did give her name. For the moment I just slept on it and waited until morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The Next morning came and unfortunately it was another school day, however I felt much better after a nights rest. I held off on try casting the spells but decided to take the book with me. Hopefully today would be a better school day than yesterday, knowing my luck I doubt that's the case.</span></div></div>",

My first period I had Geometry with Brianna there as well. Thankfully she was there because I don't think there is anything more boring than geometry first thing in the morning. my second period was World History I would have loved to have Brianna hear for this class as well unfortunately that wasn't the case as we had different second periods and third periods. Thankfully we had the same lunch period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Unfortunately the one I had shared my second period with was the school bully Joe, he was about five foot and nine inches tall, had short brown hair and green eye's. His body wasn't too overly muscular or too thin, it was about average. For some reason however he seemed to enjoy picking on me. or at least that's what I thought especially since this is where my torment began today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Well if it isn't the Cheer Failure!  Can't believe someone can actually fail at cheerleading. Perhaps you'll set a new record of the most failed to try out by the end of the year. \" Joe said with a smirk on his face. It was that smirk that really ticked me off. He didn't have any right to do that to me! If it wasn't for the head cheerleader being a bossy prick who knows, I might of actually made the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You already failed several times before, as you've never tried out before.\" I said to counter Joe's remark about yesterday's failure. Somehow I think he expected me to come and cry and beg in to his arms. However he's yet to learn that I am not that kind of girl. I was really tempted to  use my spell book on him, but for now I restrained myself.  Thankfully the class ended and we were both on our way to our respective third periods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Biology was rather quiet and I was thankful that we didn't have to dissect anything. I didn't want to take a look inside the insides of an earthworm or a frog or any other animal for that matter. Unfortunately I was required to attend biology despite my not liking certain aspects of it.  Fortunately third period was over before I knew it and then it was time for lunch or fourth period for some.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I went and sat at the same table my friend Brianna sat out and we began to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I can't believe Joe said that! Making fun of me just because I failed tryouts it's not like I'm the only one who failed. And how can you stand being on the same team as that prick Brianna?\" I asked while complaining about stuff she wasn't yet aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" She's not as bad as you think Penny, and as for Joe I think he may have a crush on you.\" Brianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" He's picking on me Brianna he can't possibly have a crush!\" I exclaimed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You never know, he might just be thinking about asking you out one of these days.\" Brianna said. I shuttered at the mere thought of me going out with that brutish person.  It was at this point where Brianna saw that I had an extra book in my backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What is that other book for? \" Brianna asked. I went and looked at her, where she was pointing was at my magic book. I had almost forgotten about it then. If she hadn't pointed out I might of not of made the mistake that made my day much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I'll tell you about it later, right now I kind of can't. Let's just say if I told you, there is no doubt in my mind that you wouldn't believe me.\" I told her. She was satisfied with that answer but with the lunch hour almost over we began to clean up our plates and head back to class. It was then that I saw Joe again this time he was picking on some kid named Tim. I had no idea what there deal was but I was tired of seeing people be picked on. So I decided I would teach him a lesson. I carefully got out my spell book and looked for a spell that would be good.  I found two one was a spell that would turn Joe into a little girl that would surely teach him a lesson. The second spell I could use was some kind of Karma spell? I didn't really get it at that time. But either way Joe would get what he deserved for picking on that kid. </span></div></div>",

Make this teenage boy one of the girls.\" I said. the spell went right to Joe and turned him from a Joe to a Josephine I guess.

I didn't think that would have any consequences after all. I did help him even though I had no idea what frightened him so much. It was then that the once bully Joe began to pull upon my clothing and began demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Change me back now!\" He demanded as he puffed and I couldn't help but to think how cute he looked as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why? You look so cute and adorable like this, Josephine.\" I teased him. He however was not amused by my teasing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I am a guy! Not a girl! I demand you change me back!\" He said he was looking angrier at the moment. I look at him and replied to him firmly despite his demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No I am not going to change you back! You keep picking on people so perhaps it's time you learn what it's like to be picked on!\" I told him. It was then a teacher's hand had grabbed just as I was about to leave the situation as it is.  As soon as I caught glance of it I knew who she was it was Mrs. Snow a teacher who many of the students in class referring to as one of the coldest, and toughest teachers in the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Where do you think you are going Mrs. Jeffers No magic is allowed on school property!\" Mrs. Snow told me. Her words were a bit surprising to me, Mrs. Snow knew about magic and also explained a rule to me t hat even I didn't know about. Which got me to wonder who was she really?  The only thing the students knew about her was that she was very strict and usually harsh upon every punishment she gives. Some would even say she just liked giving out punishments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"  How do you even know about magic Mrs. Snow?\" I asked a bit curious of how she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" This isn't about me, it's about your mess. Now how about you clean up by changing him back! You have no idea of the consequences of your actions!\" Mrs. Snow told me evading the question. Her telling me to change him back made me realize that all thought I had change from a boy to girl I really had no idea how to undo my spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" How do I change him back?\" I asked. Mrs. Snow stared at me with an icy glare like she expected me to know that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Of all the irresponsible things, you cast a spell without even knowing the consequences. Then I am going to have to call your parents or magic teacher about this.\" Mrs. Snow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's not going to work my parents don't know anything about magic and our away for who knows how long, and as far as magic teacher I don't actually have one.\" I told Mrs. Snow. She was infuriated by my words but yet also now understood why I had made so many mistakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \" Then who gave you your book then?\" Mrs. Snow asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" A woman just appeared and told me I had magic abilities I believed her and then she ran off.\" I told her. However the look on Mrs. Snow's face from that point looked like she had known who the woman who gave me the book was, yet she was still infuriated.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n      \" That complicates things a little, but I do know how to resolve that little issue. One you go to a school dedicated to training you in your magic. Or you get training from me.\" Mrs. Snow said. Just as she said that she removed your spell that turned the bully into a little girl and he was finally  back to his former self. Mrs. Snow not only removed the spell but also removed  his memory of all the events that lead up to the spell. Yet oddly enough you noticed that like yourself Mrs. Snow also had a white flame or at least that's what I thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I wont punish you for your ignorance this time, but know that if you do cast any spells on school property again. I wont be as lenient. For now I suggest you at least try to get someone more knowledgeable than you in magic, so you don't look like an idiot again.\"  Mrs. Snow said before finally letting go of my arm.  Surprisingly Mrs. Snow was more fair in her judgment and punishments than I thought she was. At least from what I heard, knowing she also had magic too was quite a surprise, I decided to think about Mrs. Snow's offer and the option she had given to me. I wasn't sure which one I would pick, I thought about it and eventually chose too...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I sighed, frustrated, then turned to my new sister. \"Looks like you're going to be a girl for a while... sis.\" I said, wincing. \"Apparently that woman wants me to learn magic and, making you a girl was her guarantee that I would.\" pausing, I asked, \"What was that about my clothes being more comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica winced. \"For over a month now, my clothes have been feeling too rough.\" she said. \"They were rubbing my skin raw, making it hurt to wear them.\" she gulped. \"I guess I was desperate when I found an old pair of your panties in the laundry because I tried them on. They didn't hurt my skin so I started wearing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were going through my stuff to find clothes that would fit you?\" I asked, concerned and disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, looking embarrassed. \"For some reason, your clothes don't hurt me.\" she replied. \"I've been going through your room to try to find out why. I tried your body wash, your hair conditioners... \" she winced. \"I even tried your makeup and perfume. So far, nothing seems to make my own clothes feel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's odd.\" I said, intrigued. \"Why didn't you just say something to Mike or me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shed a tear. \"Would you have believed me if I just told you that my my clothes suddenly hurt me but yours feel just right against my skin?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Point taken.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do, sis?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out.\" I said. \"But first....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jessica's room was now suited for a teenage girl with pink walls, a canopy bed, white dresser, and white vanity.

He gave a slight sigh as the sun set. <i>Get a grip Mike</i> he scolded himself. <i>Werecats and nekos only exist in those animes</i> He wondered if he should call the police, tell them that there is a lunatic with a Jedi complex running around town. That thought brought a slight smile to his face, as he thought of the other place nekos are found; those comic con events. His smile quickly turned into a frown as a slight pain ripped through his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?</i> Mike thought, wondering if something he ate disagreed with him. He stood up, only for him to double over again. As he recoiled he felt his chest itch. As he slowly stood up, he realize what happened. \"Arrrghhh. My chest... The... they're breast!\" he screamed, seeing two lumps jutting out of his chest \"That woman....\" Frightened, he moved his hand from his breast, to his crotch, and realized that 'he' was the wrong desciption. Mike screamed even more as she realized she had turned into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H how?\" she stammered, as she slumped to the floor. Trying to calm herself, she started to say her thoughts aloud \"That woman.... She said to say hi to Penny and Jessica... Did she change them both into girls? Oh my god... What if she did? I've thought of them as being my sisters... What if people think I've always been a woman... What if the guys see me... What would happen if I start acting like a girl... \" Uncomfortable with that line of thoughts, he started to think more of the cloaked woman. \"Shit.. She said catgirl...\"  Mike leapt up, just as she felt a tail burst out of her ill-fitting jeans. She looked at her hands, and saw orange fur begin to sprout out of her skin. \"I... I got fur...\" she said as she fainted.</span></div></div>",

He came in, wondering if I told him, but I mouthed the words 'break up'. He slowly nodded, glad that Jake couldn't see either me or himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to be alone...\" Jake said, rushing off. I looked at my older brother and said, \"This isn't going to work. How can i keep my magic secret from my own brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't had to use it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I will. Jake is distraught, but even he will notice my books and new found interest in witchcraft. Probably next time he comes in to mess with my stuff\" i said.
