I say WAS because not to long ago he left the life he knew behind and has now become little more than \u201cCommunity Property\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had a strange fascination with magik and the occult, also with the curiosity of shrinking. He often wondered about what it would be like to be so tiny in a world of giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 18 year old College Student was on his way back home from the store when he spied a new shop that opened up along Main Street. A Magik shop. His curiosity getting the best of him he stopped in. There were books and candles and items galore. Filtering thru the store in amazement he was surprised by a strange man that came up from be hind. It was the shop owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee anything you like young man?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust browsing\u201d Alan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle aged man just smiled then said, \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous road to want to take\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Alan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrinking\u2026\u2026..you should be careful what you wish for\u201d he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. How did you know?\u201d a puzzled Alan inquired.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe young are easy to read and hard to discourage.\u201d The caretaker replied. \u201cAnd I may have just what your looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind him to the top shelf he pulled down a dusty old book. \u201cHere it is. Haven\u2019t had any buyers of this book in quite a while. This book is all you need to fulfill all those wild fantasies running around in that head of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took Alan to the register to pay but offered these words of advise. \u201cThis book will allow you to make those dreams of yours come true, but be warned. Any dream, if careless, can become a nightmare from which there may be no return.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning did freak Alan out a bit but he thought that was all it was meant to do. He actually only thought the book was going to be a novelty anyway. Spells and stuff don\u2019t really work anyway. DO THEY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan took the book and headed\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My clothes didn't shrink with me either.  Damnit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squints a moment as his eyes readjust, looking up out of his worn, blue Nike Shox.  Alex sighs and falls back into a sitting position, pondering what just happened, \"So.  Now I'm impossibly tiny and stuck in my own shoes.  That book is out of reach... but this is still pretty nice.\"  He looks down towards the toe section, admiring the imprint of his size 14 shoes, \"Man, hard to believe my foot used to be in here... I'm not even as large as my toe used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex chuckles at the thought, still a bit overwhelmed but liking this situation for the most part.  He'd always admired Shox and now he got to see a pair in the most intimate way possible, but his euphoria came to an abrupt halt as he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex?  You up there?  I'm looking for you buddy!\"  Alex looked pale hearing the voice of his best friend, Jaron.  he wasn't sure what to say, if he could even be heard at all.  Being back home from college, they two had made plans to hang out since Jaron was moving to the opposite side of the country for college.  Alex had completely forgotten he'd invited Jaron over, and in a panic, Alex ran away from the entrance of the shoe, settling near the toe section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaron looked around and saw the clothes on the floor, \"Man, same old Alex.  Leaving his clothes thrown around.  I guess he's in the shower?\"  He poked his head in the connecting bathroom only to not find his friend, \"Well hell.  I wonder where he went.  He never leaves his phone behind,\" glancing over at the desk.  jaron laid back on the bed and closed his eyes, murmuring to himself about a nap until Alex got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a little courage, Alex walks up towards the entrance of the shoes and looks up at Jaron...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sighs and sits were he is, looking up at Jaron, waiting to see what he'd do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Alan though, Jaron had a huge foot fetish, and had always wanted to be at Alan's feet.  Cracking open an eye, Jaron calls for Alan one last time before getting a devious look on his face.  Fishing in the pile of clothes Jaron pulls out the socks, raising them to his face and taking a long sniff from them, \"Oh god Alan has some hot feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was floored.  He'd had no idea whatsoever that his friend was into his feet, and while normally he'd be aroused by this, he didn't get to enjoy the moment too long before Jaron started to put on a show for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping one sock over his cock and sniffing the other, Jaron started to masturbate furiously, enjoying the still fresh smell of his best bud's socks, \"Oh god, I missed this, Fuck!\"  Alex just stared at Jaron as he laid there, eventually releasing himself in the sock, then collapsing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sly fucker,\" Alan murmured aloud, \"I had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaron laid there a few minutes to collect himself, gently gnawing on the other sock as he took a few last sniffs.  With no mess to clean up, he finally sat up, bored and impatient, \"Well, fuck.  I'll just try and catch up with him later I guess... but first... heh.\"  Jaron looked down again and cleared the clothes away, eying the size 14 Shox, \"A size too small, but that tight fit will be pretty hot.  I'll just tell him I came in sandals and wanted to go run, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan grinned at the irony, because he had a foot fetish too, and despite being floored by what his friend just did, he'd been using Jaron's socks for his fantasies for years.  He'd always wanted to be at his best friend's feet, and today his dream was going to come true.  Alan's eyes widened as he saw what Jaron was planning, but with his size, he had nowhere to run except back down.  Running as fast as he could do towards the toe section, Alan looked over his shoulder to see the magnificent sight of Jaron's right foot sliding into his sneaker.  Alan was instantly aroused as he watched his friend's toes spread out slightly under the pressure as the slid in, overtaking his body and pinching him underneath Jaron's toes.  Alan wanted to scream in fear and ecstasy as he felt his buddy's sweaty toes cover over his body, dripping that sweet smell he's longed for so long all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneaker went dark, and Alan heard Jaron overhead, muffled, \"God this is hot.  Think I'll go take a run in these.  They're a tight fit but damn I've always wanted to do this.\"  Alan panicked as Jaron taped the toe of the shoe on the ground, managing to reposition him between Jaron's big toe and the next, \"Oh god. What if he... he...\" His thoughts where interrupted as Jaron squeezed his toes, forcing Alan to lose his form and actually mold up against Jaron's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" thought Alan, \"This will be pretty interesting.\" </span></div></div>",

Jaron started with a few leg stretches, jogging in place a few moments, then started down the track at a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan didn't mind, that's for sure.  After Jaron got the shoe on and Alan lost his form, he actually relaxed quite a bit.  There wasn't anything he could do to hange the situation he was in - after all, he was oozing between his best friend's toes in his own shoes.  Alan simply accepted things as they were, enjoying the increasing warmth all around his as Jaron started a fast jog towards the nearby public track.  He'd always wanted to get at Jaron's feet, but Alan had no clue whatsoever that his chance at this would be as a living odor eater.  He chuckled to himself slightly at the irony of the situation.  Alan felt his new home warming up quite a bit, the outside thudding getting louder and more frequent, \"He must be starting at the track.  Awesome.\"  Jaron's feet were mildly damp already, but this opened the water-works.  Alan was almost immediately dripping in Jaron's footsweat, his already pliable form losing what little remained as he started to slide around and between Jaron's toes, aided by the generous footsweat from the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaron, meanwhile, was in the zone.  He couldn't quite figure out what was so different, but he was charged up already from having Alan's shoes on.  After all, he'd always wanted at his best friend's feet, but his shoes would do for now.  The time behand to pass, one mile, two, three, four, and finally five.  Jaron came to a stop, trying to catch his breath as he leaned forward on his knees, \"Phew.  Man, I should do that more often.  I might keep these or something, haha.\"  He sat down a minute, finishing off the bottle of water while checking his cellphone, \"Man, I wonder why Alan hasn't checked in.  The loser probably went somewhere and forgot to text me, lame.\"  He was only mildly irritated since the two tended to do that by accident, but quickly got up heading back to Alan's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, on the other hand, was still roasting inside his own shoe.  He was loving every second of it, slowly drinking Jaron's sweat as  he cushioned his buddy's toes as best he could.  He was shocked, somewhat, that Jaron didn't check the shoe since he wasn't wearing socks and was so soft.  He didn't care though, he was loving every second of his ironic little prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaron eventually got back to Alan's house, perplexed where everyone was, especially Alan.  He went upstairs and decided to wait while taking a nap, slipping off the sweaty clothes from the track and putting on his normal clothes again.  With a slight stuggle, Jaron slid off the tight 14s, exposing his tired 14.5s, \"Oh man.  I'm surprised I didn't blister, no pain!\"  Much to Alan's dismay, he'd come out of the shoe with Jaron's foot, still molded under his toes - and being body temperature still, not noticed by Jaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" thought Alan, \"What am I going to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jaron laid back in Alan\u2019s bed, he contemplated what to do.  He was certainly enjoying being Jaron\u2019s living toe jam, but didn\u2019t have the slightest clue on how to get out of this particular mess.  Jaron, meanwhile, continued to snore, mumbling softly in his sleep as he tossed and turned a bit, his mind far off while unconsciously flexing his body.  Luckily for Alan, that included his toes, which gave him time to reform, albeit slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alan\u2019s body started to get a somewhat normal shape back, he clenched himself around Jaron\u2019s middle toe to keep from falling off onto the floor.  Once his tiny, half-inch self fully reformed, he held on for his dear life as Jaron flipped over, exposing his back and soles to the ceiling.  Alan sat there in the crevice of Jaron's toes, \u201cHow am I going to get myself out of this mess?\u201d  He sighed and looked around at his now gigantic room, mostly blotted out by his larger-than-life friend\u2019s toes, \u201cAt least this isn\u2019t too bad, I guess.\u201d  He leaned in and gave his friend\u2019s toes a kiss, then a lick.  Jaron didn\u2019t seem phased by it, not even moving in the slightest as Alan\u2019s tongue slid along the bottom of Jaron\u2019s toe.  \u201cGuess I may as well enjoy this too!\u201d  Alan wasted little time as he grabbed hold in fear of falling and began to worship Jaron\u2019s feet.  Slowly making his way over to the big toe, he began licking between the toes, closing his eyes and enjoying the flavor of Jaron\u2019s feet.  Despite having been forced to drink the sweat earlier, Alan hadn\u2019t minded then, and he certainly didn\u2019t now.  Jaron\u2019s feet reeked of the sweat, but it wasn\u2019t a bad smell, just strong.  He continued moving his little tongue around the base, worshiping between each of Jaron\u2019s toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaron, meanwhile, was enjoying this more than he realized.  Despite Alan\u2019s tiny size, he could feet the warm tongue on his toes, and gently flexed them every once and a while.  A few hours of this went by, unbeknownst to Alan, when Jaron began to wake up.  He scrunched his toes and started to get out of bed, trapping Alan once again.  Jaron looked around, \u201cOh man, it\u2019s eight?  Damn.  I shouldn\u2019t have taken that nap.  Oh well.\u201d  Without hesitation he reached over for his own shoes and put them on, tying them and sealing poor Alan inside them.  With a stretch and a yawn, Jaron stood up and started to walk out, \u201cDamn Alan, it\u2019s not like you to disappear like this.  Hope you\u2019re alright man.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan panicked as Jaron woke up, losing his form once again as Jaron\u2019s sweaty toes scrunched up.  It didn\u2019t seem very long before Jaron flipped around, watching in horror and odd pleasure as the black shox of his friend started to replace what little of his vision wasn\u2019t already dominated by Jaron\u2019s toes.  The cool, bright room was suddenly replaced by warm darkness as he heard Jaron start to lace up and tie the shoes, cursing slightly knowing that he still had no plan for getting out of this.  He calmed himself down though, hearing what Jaron said, albeit extremely muffled.  With his friend concerned, Alan started to relax and enjoy the situation again, hitting a level of ecstasy as his tiny body started to ooze between Jaron\u2019s toes again, sliding up between them and already absorbing his friend\u2019s sweat \u2013 eagerly gulping it down as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaron stepped outside the front door, he frowned and looked back up to Alan\u2019s room; he raised his foot behind him and tapped the toe on the ground, sighing slightly.  He thought he might\u2019ve felt something, but was slightly preoccupied with the sudden disappearance of his friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the jab, Alan dubbled over as if he had been punched. Of course, at his size, he pretty much had been. \"You almost got us caught!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan didn't know what to say. If he said what he wanted to say to Josh right now, he would undoubtedly be feeling much more pain, and that was the last thing Alan wanted right now. He was already well on his way to being Josh's willing slave, even before the matter had been brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't wait for Alan's response anyway, and said, \"Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to punish you for that, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan cringed as Josh's other giant hand swung toward him again, but this time, he was not jabbed or squeezed, but simply lifted with a light pinch of his shirt. Josh held the hanging Alan in front of his face, showing him a malevolent grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how you enjoy the ride home in my...\"</span></div></div>",

His breath made the tiny teen move slightly. Alan was careful not to struggle. A fall from his height would be a certain death. Suddenly, Josh spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how you enjoy the ride home in my underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan screamed in horror as the hand that gripped his back began to lower down. Almost distinctly audible over his tiny yelling was Josh laughing happily. As Alan looked downward, he saw Josh's other hand opening his zipper, pulling open the jeans and the briefs. As his eyes adjusted, Alan saw the groin below. The cock, a large 36 feet from his perspective, seemed to inch outwards, growing with the excitement of current events. At about 6 feet (for Alan) from the top of the dick, Josh let go his grip on Alan's shirt. Alan plummeted onto the penis. He grabbed onto it tightly as darkness came over his world, Josh closing the briefs and jeans. He heard a faint zip as Josh did his fly, then a faint rumble as Josh started the car and began driving.</span></div></div>",

Josh shot Alan an evil grin before dropping him into the open sock. Alan fell all the way to the toe, damp with Josh's sweat and considerably odorous. A moment later, Josh's giant toes appeared in the opening at the top, and the sock was quickly pulled tight against his foot, with Alan begin jammed between Josh's big and second toe. After another moment, Alan's sight was taken away from his as well as Josh pushed his foot back into his shoe and tied the laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Josh began walking. As if the smell wasn't enough already, the movement was making Alan horribly sick. It was all he could do to keep from throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stink and sweat of Josh's foot washed over Alan as the walk continued. Alan quickly became sure that he would never be able to wash it out of his clothes, that it would always be there to bring his mind back into Josh's ratty old wrestling shoes. He wasn't even sure if he would be able to wash the smell off his skin after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, something strange happened. Alan began to like it. He liked the horrible smell that was wearing off on him. He liked the feel, the smell, and even the taste of Josh's sweat as it seeped into his mouth. He liked it so much, he actually found himself licking between Josh's giant toes. As he began rubbing his body against the giant foot, he started taking off his clothes. His hard-on could not be contained. He rubbed it between Josh's toes until he came, his cock spewing cum deep into the crevices of his master's giant toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had taken a walk around the block just to make Alan suffer, but he couldn't believe what he was now feeling between his toes, and he walked quicker back to his car, got in, and removed his shoe and sock again. Alan couldn't have been more disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you little faggot. Did you just have sex with my toe?\" said Josh meanly, but not without a sense of enjoyment either. He continued without waiting for a response from Alan. \"Well, since I guess I've already gotten you off, it's only fair that you return the favor while I drive home, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Alan knew what was happening, Josh's pants were unzipped and Alan was being set upon his giant cock.

He rang the bell and waited a few moments, Martin's parents and brother were going to see something or other, leaving the house all to Martin and him. The door squeeked as it opened, barely noticable to Josh, but in his pockets it was shrill and horrible, even when muffled by the fabric. The door was opened by a tall young man, with very short reddish hair. \"Martin, I have something you wont believe!\" He was barely able to contain his excitment. \"Ahh?

He slipped into it and, getting in character, slowly stomped towards Alan. Each trod caused Alan to fall to the ground, and made Josh and Martin his the door even harder.

All at once they say, \"What???\"<br>\r\n  Nick riches into his pocket and pulls out Harvey! And boy is he horny as hell! He pushes Harvey's snout up against the glass of the hamster cage. Harvey's eyes get really big and he starts squealing violently with excitement when he sees Josh, Martin, and Mike. Harvey begins trying to run violently and as fast as he possibly can even though his feet are not on the ground. If they were on the ground he would be charging at Josh, Martin, and Mike. Harvey's penis throbs it is so hard right now.<br>\r\n  Nick lifts Harvey up and places him on the floor of the hamster cage. Mike, martin, and Josh all scatter. Josh hides behind the rock in the cage, Mike climbs up to the top of the hamster exercise wheel, Martin burries himself under the woodchips at the bottom of the cage. Harvey CHARGES!</span></div></div>",

Yeah, I have to say, I never would have seen this coming....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan has not moved from the sock since Rick dropped it on the bedspread beside him. Now, as Rick is sleeping, Alan thinks it could probably be an ideal time to move, but... what's the point? The cum is drying around him. The air he breathes is a mingled odor of feet and cum, which Alan is disturbed to find pleasant. Disturbed, yes... but still pleasant. And thus, all the more disturbing. Do he doesn't move. He simply lets the cum dry around him. If he gets stuck... Well, he guesses he should have moved when he had the chance... BEFORE his father unintentionally jerked off with him. In a few seconds, Alan is going to decide he should have at least learned from the first time... and moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it is that Alan is still sitting in the dried cum and crusty sock of Rick when the bedroom door opens and the face of Danny peaks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Alan snaps, seeing Danny's face. He forgot Danny would be over this afternoon. Danny is a young college kid Rick hired to clean the house a few days a week. Alan suspects Rick actually just hired this young stud because he liked to look at him (Alan always suspected his father was... that way). Worse yet, Alan also suspects Danny knows about this... and likes it that way. (Danny also strikes Alan that way.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny is a young computer geek college kid, though it's clear he spends a fair amount of time in the gym each week, as his muscles are small but well-toned. His blondish-brown hair is cut short in a buzz-cut, and he wears thick, black-rimmed glasses. Per usual, he's wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and a pair of flip-flops. And of course... he's carrying a laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan quickly begins struggling to extracate himself from Rick's dried cum, but he already knows it's no use. Danny is already picking up Rick's other dirty sock on the floor. Alan spies from the interior of Rick's still-damp sock as Danny holds the sock up to his nose and sniffs Rick's smell in deeply before tossing it into the basket with the other clothes. Then, Danny's eyes are on Alan... or more accurately, on the sock in which Alan is hiding. Alan instantly stops moving and balls himself up as much as he can just before Danny's giant hand closes around the sock. Alan can feel the sock being lifted. Danny is going to smell it. He's going to find him. Alan just knows it!</span></div></div>",

Danny still wonders how long it will be before Rick starts noticing his socks disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny's fingers wrap themselves around the moist sock, though, he feels something he wasn't expecting. It's slightly heavier than normal, and he can feel something inside it. He applies the tiniest amount of pressure, squeezing it ever so slightly, wondering what Rick could have put in his sock other than his cum, but he can't figure it out. So instead of sniffing the sock as he usually would, Danny peeks in the opening instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny nearly screams when he sees Rick's son, Alan, lying inside, covered in Rick's drying cum. He manages, though to keep it in, and just gapes at Alan, who stares complacently back at him. That's when Rick begins to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Danny's fingers clutch themselves back around the sock, and he hides it behind his back just as Rick opens his eyes and lifts his head. Danny looks at Rick nervously and doesn't miss Rick's eyes glance momentarily to the spot where his sock was a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Danny,\" Rick greets. \"Cleaning up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

And all he could think about as Rick's sweat drenched his mashed, formless body was: How could his own father do this to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rick returned home and went straight to the living room. It was there that Rick finally removed his shoes and socks and dropped Alan into his open palm. He waited a few minutes for Alan to regain his usual (though shrunken) form, and then gave him another stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you like that, young man? Did that make you think twice about messing around with forces you don't even understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan hardly even heard his father's question, though. He was in a rage. The moment Rick finished speaking, Alan was screaming his head off at him. \"What's wrong with you?! What kind of father crushes his own son beneath his foot? What kind of father--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rick's thunderous voice interrupted, pouring out of Rick's throat with such force that Alan was knocked onto his rear in Rick's hand. \"A good father! That's what! A father with a son too stupid to realize when he's in over his head! I should leave you like that! That's what I should do! See how you like living like that for the rest of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's whole body went numb and he moved forward on his hands and knees, prostrating himself in Rick's palm and begging, \"No, Dad!

Maybe a night of begging at my feet... I could use a nice massage after that run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hope, Alan agreed quickly and eagerly, and Rick instantly reached down and set him between his enormous feet, propped up on the table in front of him. Alan instantly reached out and started rubbing Rick's giant soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, Alan, but I still don't think your heart is in it. Maybe... if you used your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Alan finally gave pause. He leaned his head to the side, looking over at his father's face questioningly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rick steps out the front door, Alan is still screaming desperately between breaths. \"No! Please, Dad, I've learned my lesson! Just let me ou--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan wouldn't know whether Rick could even hear him or not as he was abruptly cut off when Rick began to jog. The combination of the up and down, flattening under Rick's toes, and how Rick's stinky foot sweat was swallowed down Alan's throat as he ran quickly caused Alan to become very sick as his father ran. He retched, vomiting up a small amount of bile containing the sweat before it mixed with the new sweat from Rick's foot and more of it found its way down Alan's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought the torture would never end, but after only ten minutes or so, Rick started slowing down, allowing Alan to recover, if only slightly. A few moments later, Rick stopped all together, and Alan faintly heard a doorbell being rung. Alan could only wonder where his father had gone in the minutes before the door was answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick readjusted his weight, lifting his weight from the foor under which Alan was crushed so he could curl Alan under his toes a few times, just to sink in his punishment. Finally, the door was answered, and a man whose voice Alan didn't recognize answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick,\" said the man in surprise. \"I didn't expect to see you today. Come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick greeted him as he stepped into the door. A dozen steps later found him sitting on the couch in the living room. The other man was right behind him and sat beside him on the couch. Very close. Rick started untying his shoes while the other man spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing here? Not that I'm not happy to see you but I thought you said you couldn't come over today,\" the other man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick slid off one of his shoes and then prepared to pull off the one Alan was in, as he replied, \"Well, Hank, I didn't think I would get the chance, but when I got home from work today, I found something... interesting, and wanted you to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Rick pulled off the remaining shoe, Alan still clutched under his curled toes, and then pulled his foot up to rest on his knee. He pulled his flattened son from his foot and held him in his hand for a minute to allow him to restore to his normal shape before he held the hand out for Hank to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank's eyes widened as he saw the tiny teenager in Rick's hand. At the same time, Alan appraised his father's friend. Hank was a handsome, well-built man, apparently in his mid-twenties. Alan was pretty sure he had seen him before, though he had never met him. He had had no idea he was his father's friend, and wondered how they knew each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wonder was quickly answered as he spied a certain mischevious grin being traded between the two men (their ages about as far apart as Alan's and Hank's probably were). In disbelief, Alan's eyes wandered downward, spotting their hands clasped on their laps. There was no space on the couch between them. Alan couldn't belive it: His father was having an affair with another man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick smiled to himself as he saw the shocked expression on Alan's face and started to explain. \"I wasn't going to tell you like this, but... Well...\" He turned to Hank to include him in the explanation. \"Alan, here, got himself shrunk while playing with forces he didn't understand. I should have known he'd do something like this to himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan tried to interrupt. \"But, Dad, if you just get the book from my room, you should be able to turn me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, boy,\" said Rick unkindly and went on to explain his punishment to Hank. Alan felt betrayed by his own father and stopped listening, though is ears perked up again when his father added, \"So I figured, as part of his punishment, you might like to... Er... Teach him a lesson of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the giants grinned wickedly, and Alan shuddered. He didn't bother trying to voice his own objections. He was quickly learning how useless his own voice had become since being shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun,\" said Hank. \"So, are you going to help me, or am I just going to have to think of things to do with him by myself?\"</span></div></div>",

Not to mention, you could have a little fun with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank grinned, his eyes fixed on Alan as he took the tiny teen into the palm of his own hand. As Rick put his shoes back on and got up to leave, Hank barely even noticed anymore, his mind suddenly racing with the possibilities for his shrunken captive. A minute later, Rick was gone, and Hank and Alan were finally alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank wasted no time bringing Alan up closer to his face. He held Alan beneath the caves that were his nostrils and took a deep breath in, savoring the odor which had sunken deep into Alan's skin during his time in Rick's shoe.

Mike snaps more pictures. \u201cLet me try again\u201d Mike says handing Jimmy the camera. He takes me and holds me near his armpit. Jimmy snaps a picture. Then he lifts it and holds me closer to it.

You can hear his giant socked feet banging loudly against the floor far beneath you, and the opening and closing of doors. Then, finally, the hand turns palm-up and opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight shining in through the window blinds you at first, but then, as your eyes adjust, you see you are in Mike's bedroom. Just then, Mike's hand turns slightly and you go rolling onto the bedspread before him. The bed is soft enough, but the short drop was still a little rough for you, and you rise with a little painful effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike is sitting on the bed, his massive legs surrounding you. You are at eye-level with is crotch, which you can already see through his jeans is swelling. He's clearly enjoying this power trip a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as I'm supposed to take care of you, I don't see why we can't have a little fun,\" Mike says in a voice you really don't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to reply. You want to yell up at him and order him to stop this. You want to cuss him out. But you don't dare. Anything you say right now could just make the situation so much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike apparently wasn't waiting a response anyway, and continues, \"You know, I think the first thing we need to do is get a little more comfortable. Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you refrain from responding, too afraid of what he might have meant by that. His intentions, however, are quickly realized, as his hand settles behind you and gently starts lifting your shirt with his index finger. You try to fight against it, but you can do nothing as your tiny shirt is pulled over your head. He tosses over the side of the bed, never to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike continues to undress you as if you were simply a doll, and you are forced to bid farewell to each article of clothing one by one. Last is your underwear, which you are clinging to as if for dear life, trying to keep him for tearing it off you, but of course, it is no good. Even while being gentle, he is immeasurably stronger than you, and in a moment, you find yourself utterly naked and tiny in front of your younger brother. And judging from the bulge in his pants, your whole body isn't even as big as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so big now, are you?\" he laughs, fingering your tiny, limp cock. It gives a shiver of feeling as his giant finger crosses it, but it dies again immediately as his finger moves away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Mike begins to get more comfortable himself. When he takes off one of his socks and drops it directly on top of you, you don't know whether to be revolted at the smell of the crusty sock or thankful for some covering. The sock is pulled away shortly after being dropped on you and Mike is already naked, once again sitting with his legs around you like enormous walls. His giant hard-on is full-on directly before you...</span></div></div>",

I can see exactly how excited you are already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you mutter under your breath, trying to hide your own hard-on. Feeling utterly betrayed by your own body, you slowly begin to approach Mike's massive cock. Your own cock continues its betrayal, growing larger and more firm with ever step you take until you find yourself standing direcly in front of it, your face to its... \"face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike giggles in gleeful anticipation and urges you on. Unable to believe yourself, you watch yourself act almost like a spectator, though inside your own head, as you reach up. Your hands grasp Mike's giant \"head\" and Mike's entire body shudders excitedly. The shudder seems to extend right through you as if you were a part of his body as well, and you start rubbing your hands up and down, and all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike moans in pleasure and reaches down to rub his shaft while you carress the head. You lay your head forward against the giant cock and wrap one of your arms as much around it as possible to continue the rubbing, while your other hand sinks down to grasp your own cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all lasts mere minutes before Mike cums. The how sticky liquid floods all over you and you fall down on the bed beneath Mike's cock as you also cum, your small amount mixing into the pool of Mike's. You swallow it, practically bathing in it. You refuse to admit to yourself how much you just enjoyed that, but at the moment, your own pleasure is undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then... it's cut short. Mike quickly plucks you from the pool of warm cum and dangles you in front of his face. He licks his own cum off your body in several long licks and then, sets you in his outstretched palm. His grin was wider than ever as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun... For both of us, I think. But, now it's over, and sorry as I am to tell you this, I have places to go and things to do.

Ten seconds later a guy came along and picked up the gym bag, taking his clothes and an unwilling passenger along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Eric returned feeling all pumped up and refreshed from working out and taking a shower.

He had landed in the owners jock strap but his head hit the guys cup that was next to it.  Two hands reached in and picked up the jock and as Alan came to his senses, he sees some cock and balls heading right for him.  With no time to react,  he became part of the \"team\".  The customary tight shorts are put on next followed by the ancient art of zipper closing, sealing little Alan in for the duration of the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"teams\" owner lifted for about an hour and then headed for the bathroom.  During that time, Alan was packed in very tight so even if he wanted to move he couldn't.

After two years of going to this gym he has only gained twenty pounds and as he looks at himself in the mirror he can hardly tell where it went to.  The lord blessed him with a near genius IQ and a large, for anyone's size, cock and balls but he missed out in the physique department.  Fred has a Monday thru Friday 9-5 job as a website designer and he'll play an occasional game of weekend football with the gang from his old high school.  Now as it was then, someone is guaranteed to make a joke about his small size but Fred just leaves their mouth hanging wide open when he pulls down his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trying to notice a change in his biceps, Fred needs an ego boost so he opens his shorts and takes his mighty love muscle out of his jock.  Alan slides down under Fred's balls and as he tries to stay still, a huge finger comes near him to scratch the \"itch\".  Alan starts to panic and holds his breath as the giants finger comes close to his face.<br>\r\nAs quickly as it came it goes away and he takes a breath of the musty smell.  The cock is reeled back in to it's home and the shorts are once again zipped up.  Fred is so disgusted that he skips a shower and goes right home.  Alan is packed tightly and Fred is driving home thinking about the huge guys in the gym wishing that he had the muscular arms that could tear shirt sleeves and shoulders that would be wider than a door frame, a massive chest and back, all sitting on top of tree trunk legs.  As Fred day dreams Alan is finding his quarters getting a bit more cramped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred can't get home soon enough. He doesn't want to explode in his shorts but the mechanism has already been set in motion and his cock is growing thicker and longer. Alan takes advantage of the \"tenting\" of Fred's jock and shorts to move around but there aren't many places he can go. He does manage to touch the expanding member and the sensation is felt causing Fred to wonder what the hell is in his shorts. Alan is covered in cum as the massive cock erupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred runs into his bathroom and pulls down his shorts and jockstrap to find.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's surprised as the ring holding him snaps open with little effort and he tumbles down onto Mike's crotch.

If this wasn't among the top ten list of situations Alan never expected to find himself in, he didn't know what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill being able to smell the stink of Mike's feet on his body, Alan submitted to the pure erotic pleasure of it, and stopped trying to restrain his own hard-on, and just went with it. Mike was over all too quick, though, and Alan was soon dropped before he could reach his own pleasure too. Mike could care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it up,\" Mike ordered, referring to the puddle of his cum that Alan now found himself kneeling before. Alan groaned, but was too tired to disobey and just did as commanded. To his surprise, he actually found this task arousing as well, and soon found himself making his own addition to the puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Alan over an hour to finish, and by the time he was done, he was ready to puke... again. He had already puked twice before that, and each time, Mike had ordered him to lick that up with the rest of it. Alan grudgingly did as he was bid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Mike dropped him into his stinky sneaker, telling him that would be where he spent the night. Alan briefly considered allowing himself to throw up here, but as Mike stuffed a dirty sock in to block him there, he decided not to further spoil his accomadations. Mike was bound to just punish him more if he found puke in his shoe the next morning anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days contained much of the same, and so much worse. Rather than waking him up in the morning when Mike got ready for school, he just left his older brother in the shoe and wore it to school with him in it. He took to going sockless and having Alan switch shoes each night, so he could service Mike's feet each day while Mike was in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike didn't bother to feed Alan until dinner time, and Alan was already growing weak, pale, and scrawny from the treatment. He didn't know how much longer he could go on like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, about a week after his original enslavement, Rick, their father asked about Alan for the first time since he had given Alan to Mike. Alan had been horribly angry and upset at his father's carelessness before, but now that he finally asked, Alan found that he no longer cared and was just thankful for any sort of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mike reluctantly pulled Alan out of his shoe and dropped him on the breakfast table for his dad to see, Alan didn't even care at the slight smirk his father gave him at seeing his state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're making use of him,\" Rick said as he surveyed his older son. He didn't move too close. Alan smelled horrible. He had spent most of his time in the last week in Mike's shoes, with his feet. And he hadn't gotten to bathe once. Finally, Rick continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really have a problem with you keeping your brother as a pet, Mike,\" Rick began. At that, Mike grinned, and Alan's frown deepened in a horrible defeated sort of way. \"But if you don't start taking better care of him, I am going to have to take him away. He's gonna need three meals a day, and he can't spend ALL his time in your shoe, you know. He needs a little fresh air and exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's grin widened at the exercise instruction. Alan knew exactly what he was thinking about: every night when Mike had Alan get him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want you to start taking him in the shower with you... at least some of the time, if not all the time,\" Rick continued. \"You do that, and I don't see why you can't keep him... Well, that and as long as you hand him over to me every now and again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's grin twisted deviously. Alan couldn't believe that he could have been broken anymore after all the torture he had already received at the hands of his brother, but that single smile broke his spirits all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he knew. He was a slave, and he was nothing more. He had lost all hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the complete shock of both Rick and Mike, Alan dropped dead right in that instant. The loss of that last bit of hope killed him just as surely as Mike's foot would have had he stepped on him.</span></div></div>",

From his place on the bedspread, Alan shuddered, and quickly looked around for a way to escape. He had no desire to find out what Robert was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very second that Robert's foot began to lift as he moved toward the bed, Alan jumped up from the bedspread and ran wildly. He didn't even bother to think about which way he was going or what he was going to do. There was no time to think. All he knew now was that he needed to NOT get caught by Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stopped moving, dumbfounded, when he saw Alan's mad dash for the side of the bed. Had the little man's IQ shrunk as well. Robert didn't know whether to laugh or panic as Alan ran right off the edge of the bed without even the slightest hesitation. He could do nothing more than stare in disbelief as Alan plummeted to the carpet, squashing himself only slightly before regaining his form and continuing running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thought had completely left Alan's head so that he didn't even wonder at himself for running straight off the edge of the bed, or for picking himself up and running straight toward the very giant he was trying to escape afterward. Luckily, though, coherent thought seemed to have temporarily escaped Robert as well, as he neglected to make a single move to stop Alan running directly between his bare feet toward teh closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was under the door before Robert had even begun to grasp what had happened, and it was a full mintue before Robert got himself the single step back to the door and through it, giving Alan plenty of time to get to the end of the hall, though, unfortunately because of his size, no farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan through a glance over his shoulder at the lumbering giant behind him, both of them panicking for the first time since the whole bizzare action sequence had begun. Alan's brain kicked back in now, as if knowing automatically that the time for cunning had now come. Unfortunately, in all his cleverness, Alan never could have foreseen what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan's head swiveled back around to look ahead of him, he saw it all too late, as an enormous foot in a heavy boot came down direclty over his head. In seconds, he was flattened under the heel of someone new he hadn't even gotten a good look at. Robert tripped over his own feet, falling to his knees and crying out in defeat as his prize disappeared under the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan could barely hear the scream from his crushed position, but managed to make out the word, \"Dad!\" erupting in Robert's voice.</span></div></div>",

He had only meant to lay his foot down in front of it, blocking its path, but it dumbly ran right under his foot and crushed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as Scott held the tiny creature in the palm of his hand, he could hardly believe what he was seeing. It was a tiny teenager, mere inches tall. It should have been destroyed under Scott's enormous boot, but had just been flattened, and was now returning to its normal shape. Scott held his breath in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his spot in the palm of the new giant's hand, Alan too held his breath as he surveyed Robert's father. He was a handsome man in his thirties. Tall and well-built with bulging muscles. His hair was a rich and full brown with only the first flecks of gray at his temples. Alan was shocked to find himself holding his breath, no longer out of fearful anticipation, but out of a lustful awe of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott finally recovered his senses, and forcefully twisted his face into a look of sternness as his eyes reluctantly moved from the shrunken teenager to his own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to explain this, son,\" Scott said, a threatening edge to his voice, as he held the tiny teen out a little toward Robert. Robert slowly got up from his knees, never taking his eyes off Alan. For a second, Alan actually thought he was going to grab him right out of his father's hand and make a run for it, but his fear of his father held him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Well, you see...\" Robert stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it!\" Scott roared, and Alan thought his head would explode with the force of the man's shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert gulped, opened his mouth, and in a flash was spilling the whole story about Alan being Mike's brother and the spell book and Alan's escape from his bedroom. Amazingly, he had told the whole story hurriedly in under a minute before his mouth stopped moving again. Even more amazingly, Scott seemed to understand ever word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" he said after a moment. He looked at his son, then at Alan, then back at his son again. \"All right. This is what you're going to do. You're marching right back to your room, you're gonna get on that phone and get Mike back over here. I don't care what you have to say, but you get him back here. And make sure he brings that spell book with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert gulped again, nodded and turned to leave. He took no more than a step before turning nervously back again. He spoke in a small voice, as if afraid to speak too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him,\" he said, pointing a shaking finger at the tiny teen in his father's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him. Just go call Mike,\" growled Scott. Robert rushed down the hall and pulled his door back closed in a hurry. With Robert gone, Scott finally returned his attention to the shrunken teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to help me?\" asked Alan hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott didn't answer but just smiled. Alan wasn't entirely sure he trusted that smile...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott carried Alan into the living room and set him on the coffee table without speaking another word to him. He then sat down on the couch directly in front of Alan. His eyes focused on Alan and began to scan Alan's tiny body repeatedly. Alan dared not move, no matter how uncomfortable the big man's gaze made him. He had no idea what Scott's plans for him might be, and he feared the possibility of angering him in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, Robert finally appeared in the doorway from the hallway. Scott didn't see him as the doorway was behind the couch, but Alan could see him cowering there as he gathered the courage to enter the living room. Robert's reaction to his father was what scared Alan the most. Somehow, Alan got the impression from the way Robert acted around his father that his father could be a potentially dangerous man. Alan just hadn't decided yet whether Scott's intention toward him in particular was good or bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked just about to finally push himself through the doorway when his father spoke up. \"Oh, just get in here already, you little punk! Stop cowering at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's face drained of color, but he quickly obeyed and shuffled over to the armchair sitting to the side of the room. His eyes never dared venture too far close to his father, though Scott's raptor gaze fixed attentatively on his skulking son the moment he came into view. Scott's eyes finally released their intense hold when Robert sank into the chair, and Alan was considerably displeased to find them settled back on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called Mike?\" Scott's harsh voice cut through the silence. Robert squeaked a barely audible yes. For a moment, Scott looked as though he was going to jump down his son's throat just for that, but instead, he asked another question. \"He's coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" squeaked Robert in the same mousy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's bringing the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother squeaky, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott growled his approval and returned the room to silence. Alan detected a scarcely audible sigh of relief coming from the direction of Robert when the questions ceased. Alan couldn't believe he was actually starting to feel pity for this teenager who had thought to use him as his own personal toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about another five minutes before the doorbell rang. Robert didn't move a muscle, afraid that any action, even to answer the door would only further upset his father, until Scott told him direcly to answer the door. A moment later, Mike skulked into the room along with Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott eyed the ancient book in Mike's hand and indicated for him to set it on the coffee table. Mike did so and then sat in an armchair opposite of Robert. Neither, it seemed, wanted to get too close to Scott. Scott, it also seemed, noticed, and ordered them both on the couch, while he stood up to pace on the other side of the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys hunkered down nervously on the couch while Scott picked up the book and started flipping pages. His eyes frequently glanced toward Alan or the two boys, but mostly just scanned the many pages of the mystical book. He finally found what he was looking for, put a finger in the book to mark his place, and then turned his full attention back to Mike and Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" he began, \"... you two thought you would just shrink Mike's older brother and amuse yourselves with him, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not really...\" answered Mike. As he paused, Scott glared at him angrily, and he rushed the rest of his response, \"I mean... Sir... H-he shrunk himself. I just found him like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" Scott said, turning his intense gaze down to Alan. In his fear, Alan could only nod his head slightly, though Scott's raptor eyes apparently picked up even that tiny movement and nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes turned once again to the two boys. \"And just what exactly did you two plan to do with him anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy braved to answer this particular question. After a minute or so, Scott nodded again as if in confirmation of some silent response, and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you two have in line a punishment for your actions. In fact, I think you deserve a very special punishment,\" said Scott, his face growing ever more dark and menacing, \"A taste of your own medicine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, both the teenagers eyes locked on Scott. In a flourish of movement, Scott brought the book up toward his face, opened it back up to the page he had marked and began reciting the words of the shrinking spell. Neither Robert nor Mike moved from the couch. Both were apparently paralyzed in fear, and as a light, barely visible mist formed around them, they both began to shrink down to the same size as Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only seconds before both the teenagers were teetering on the edge of the couch cushions, only inches tall. Alan across the gap between the couch and the coffee table watched in amazement, then spun back around to scream up at Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What about me?!\" Alan shouted. \"Aren't you going to turn me back?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's head lowered so his eyes could focus back on Alan. His gaze was as evil as ever. \"Why should I do that? You shrunk yourself. You chose your fate. I think if you're going to return to normal size, it should be by your own merits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to cement his meaning, Scott walked over to the nearby bookshelf and slid the ancient book into a free spot on the highest shelf, near the ceiling. Alan would never be able to reach it. Scott walked back toward the couch and coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And until you do manage to find a way to turn yourself back, I don't see why you can't join these two in whatever I decide to do with them...\" As Scott finished, he scooped up the shrunken Mike and Robert in his right hand and Alan in his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were at the mercy of this frightening giant now...</span></div></div>",

With all three clutched together in his large sweaty hand, there was barely room to breathe, and they were all relieved when Scott reached his room and dropped them all at the foot of the bed. Their relief quickly vanished, though, as their minds returned to the presence of the giant, and they all watched carefully every move he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott first sat in the center of the bed, resting his legs wide. His feet came to rest not far from them on either side. Still without a word to them or between them, Scott began untying the laces on his huge black boots. He slipped them off and the world of the shrunken trio was filled with the intense aroma of the man's sweaty socks. Each reacted in different ways. Robert gagged. Mike gagged only a little, actually seeming to enjoy the odor a bit. Alan, who had already spent some time stuck in an enclosed space with his brother's stinky foot, showed no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott spoke as he started pulling off his socks. \"Now, we have plenty of time to enjoy this. You guys should get used to your current state, 'cause you're going to be like that for a very long time, so I don't think I'm going to rush you into anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's wicked grin widened. \"No, tonight, I think I'll just have fun with one of you.\" This time there was a sharp intake of breath. They each held that breath as they waited for who he would pick to \"have fun\" with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott pulled his son apart from the other two, and without further word dropped both of them in the same dirty sock, which he then stuffed into his boot.</span></div></div>",

They had been in the sock for about five minutes by that point, and neither had said a word yet. At first, they both just sat there trying to hear what Scott might be doing with Robert high above them on the bed, but they quickly realized that all the outside sound was effectively muffled inside the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that realization had sunk in, Alan's mind quickly turned back to how he had gotten into this mess in the first place. True, he had shrunk himself, but he didn't REALLY think it was going to work, and besides, how was he to know that everyone he would meet thereafter was going to enslave him and use him for their own sick purposes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own brother... HIS OWN BROTHER... had wasted no time stuffing him into his own shoe with his stinking foot just to torure him on his way to show him to his friend Robert, and then had just left him there, not caring one bit about what Robert might do to him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan seethed with every thought and just as he was about to start screaming his head off at his brother, the most unexpected thing happened... Mike started screaming at him instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!\" Mike screamed at him suddenly, taking the words right out of Alan's mouth. Alan took a moment to make sure it really was his brother who had just said it and not himself before countering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" gasped Alan. \"WHAT?! My fault! You can't be serious! How is this my fault?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hadn't have bought that stupid book, none of this would ever have happened!\" Mike spat out instantly, as if knowing exactly how Alan was going to respond before he even said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he did have a point, though he certainly wasn't going to take the blame for their current circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never knew my own brother would care so little for me that he would just take me and use me and make me his slave, instead of trying to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I was going to hurt you! I was just having a little fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's all Robert's dad is trying to have with us now too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one struck Mike silent for a moment, but he recovered quickly. \"Yeah, well, this still wouldn't have happened if you hadn't gotten that book in the first place! It still all your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault, huh?\" said Alan. \"And I suppose I brought MYSELF over to YOUR best friends house, gave myself to him, got caught by his father...\" Alan left out that it was in fact himself who got him caught by Robert's father. \"... and then actually brought the book and gave it the man who would then use it to shrink you! Face it, Mike. You have no one to blame but yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well... Maybe, but if that's so... you have no one to blame but yourself either, you know...\" Mike replied after a moment, sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ended the argument. They both had their points. It was as much either of their fault as the other. For the first time, they both started coming to terms with the fact that they really did have no one to blame but themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next ten minutes in absolute silence, wondering what the other was thinking, wondering if they would spend the rest of their lives like this, and worst of all: wondering what was happening between Scott and Robert far above them on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mike spoke again. \"I'm sorry, Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... you know... for treating you like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thing,\" Alan supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" replied Mike quietly. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan remained quiet again, choosing not to forgive his brother just yet. Thoughts of whether Mike would still feel this way now if he were regular-size again were too dominant in Alan's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike didn't seem to need his brother's forgiveness, nor expect it. Instead, he continued speaking without waiting for a response from Alan. \"So... Maybe we should start talking about who we're going to get out of this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked up. His eyes had adjusted to the dark, and although it was pitch black in the interior of the shoe, he could just make out his brother's shape sitting across from him. For the first time, he felt an absurd sense of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could reply, though, the boot shook and both boys braced themselves for the movement as Scott pulled the boot back up. As he reached in and pulled out the sock, Alan and Mike both tumbled to the toe of the sock, falling on top of each other. They both just managed to look up as the sock was pulled open at the top...</span></div></div>",

He didn't think he could handle anymore of that stink. The silence dragged on for a moment, feeling like an hour of torture to Robert and Mike.

Mike successfully attached himself to the skin under the tongue, quivering in fear. Robert was less lucky as he slipped towards the throat. He was a second away from the fall before Scott hacked and the boys flew into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering and terrified, neither could find the will to speak. They could barely dare to glance up at Scott's amusement at their pathetic forms. They could see below their perch. Miles (compared to themselves) down they saw Scott's socks were off, with one held loosely open. Scott dropped a boy in each of his socks. As he slid the socks on, he gave them a bit of a shake to get the boys positioned right under the front of his feet, tucked right behind the toes. No sense of relief, and plenty of weight to get Scott some very nice cushioning for his achy feet. With a laugh, Scott walked to the closet to pull out a pair of tight, smelly sneakers. He unlaced them before putting them on, retying them firmly to his feet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sets you gently on the carpet and begins to remove his shoes, revealing two gym socked feet glistening in sweat. Mike then stands over you, obviously enjoying this new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe what our gym teacher makes us do for warm-ups. It's tough, and my feet are killing me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, wai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're cut off as Mike begins to lower his sweaty socks on to your feeble body. His foot smashes you into the carpet, and forces you to ingest his masculine sweat as it seeps into your mouth. He then twists his foot from left to right to test your pliability, which isn't doing wonders for you at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as you begin to suffocate under his mighty soles, you finally see the light once again.

Instead you begin gasping for air, as you haven't had any fresh air for a good five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we need to have one more test done in order to support my theory on your pliability, but I'll let you choose this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are the choices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, swallowing your pride, you manage to muster up the few words that you'd be regretting for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I'll go with being smothered under your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? Holy crap, that option was a joke!

The only air your getting has been filtered through Mike's ass, and sweat is already accumulating, making it even harder to breath than it already is. It's already become a common event for you to accidentally inhale Mike's ass sweat, causing you to cough desperately for the limited air there is. And with the current situation, you're always forced to swallow it. By now your stomach is churning, and you feel like you might hurl, but you don't have any time for hurling when you've got to keep yourself alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Mike lifts his butt up off the chair, only to find you still stuck up his ass crack.

Alan was too busy coming to terms with the end of his life as he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the back of his head, an annoying voice nagged him that it was all his fault, and while that was technically true in that he had shrunk himself, how was he ever supposed to suspect that his own brother would care so little about him that he was just give him away to this collosal teenager?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Derek, there was actually very little going through his mind while Alan contemplated his fate. Derek was a giant even among regular-sized people. At sixteen, he was already 6'4\" and still growing. His natural blond hair was cropped short, and his face was shaped like the steriotypical jock's, square-jawed and all. His hands were hams, their mass probabaly being the only thing really from saving Alan from being squeezed quite as tightly as he probably would be if he were just a little bit bigger. Far down below where Alan was secured in his fist, Alan could see his enormous size 15's pounding against the hard floor of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was no closer to coming to grips with his situation when Derek finally reached his room, but he did manage to stow his thoughts for the moment while he paid extra attention to what Derek might do with him now that he had reached his room. To Alan's surprise, though, Derek didn't really do anything with him. He didn't even speak to him. He just dropped him onto this dresser and then went to his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan quickly surveyed his surroundings, looking for possible escape routes, but being so high up, he didn't think he could safely get away from the giant jock just now. He decided to wait for a better opportunity while he watched Derek pull something from his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a duffel bag. Derek started thrusting clothes into the bag indiscriminitely. He seemed to stuff in clean and dirty ones alike. And he did it so quickly and from all over the room, that Alan wondered whether he was even bothering to make sure all the clothes he gathered were his own instead of his room-mate's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bag was about full, Derek finally returned to the dresser. He grabbed Alan in one hand and a stick of deoderant in the other, and to Alan's surprise, he was deposited at the top of the duffel bag right along with the stick of deoderant. Derek pressed the clothes hard into the bag, barely missing crushing Alan, and then zipped it up quickly. Alan's hopes of escaping the bag were quickly dashed as he was pinned between the over-stuffed clothing and the inside of the bag itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan found himself in disbelief yet again! He had been packed in the boy's things just as carelessly as the dirty pair of underwear he was pressed against!</span></div></div>",

Instead, he just dropped the duffel bag carelessly on the floor at the foot of his bed. As excited as he actually was about his new pet, it didn't seem to occur to him that he should try to take better care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bag, Alan wasn't even surprised when he realized he had just been left. Instead, he decided to try to make use of the time and attempt to escape. The duffel bag wasn't in very great shape and in fact, did have a few holes in it, but Alan had no idea the holes were there, let alone where they were. Besides that, with how Derek had packed the bag, it was extremely difficult for him to move inside it. He had to force himself along inch by inch without any way of seeing or knowing where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, he didn't really get very far, and only really succeeded in tiring himself out. When Derek finally returned to his room, Alan finally stopped struggling, and heard another voice in addition to Derek's in the room beyond Alan's prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan strained his ears to hear the conversation. He couldn't hear very well, but he decided the second voice sounded younger than Derek. Probably his younger brother, Alan decided. Then, Alan made out the words he had hoped he would't hear Derek say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ricky, wanna see something really cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he finished, Alan could feel the duffel bag being lifted from the floor and set someplace higher up (on the bed, as he would soon see). A moment later, Derek zipped it open and light flooded in direcly onto Alan, completely exposed in the opening of the duffel bag. Derek scooped him up in his hand, pushed the duffel bag back to the floor with his other hand, and then dropped the tiny Alan onto the bed by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan's eyes adjusted to the light, he saw the exited face of a boy who was probably thirteen, or possibly twelve, though he seemed a bit big to be either. He was tall and well-built, like his older brother, with a head of shaggy blond hair. He looked like he could easily have been Derek a few years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" breathed Ricky, kneeling beside the bed to get a closer look. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a person, dumbass!\" replied Derek as he sat at the foot of the bed beside his new pet. \"He's mine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Derek slapped him upside the head before he answered. \"He shrunk, idiot. Duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky just rolled his eyes and continued to watch the tiny man in awe. \"Can I play with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's entire body tensed up as he looked up to Derek, awaiting his response...</span></div></div>",

His eyes were fixed on Alan, and he wore a wicked grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All mine,\" he repeated to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan just stood where he was at the foot of the bed, trembling as he watched Derek start his way. As he stepped toward the bed, Derek kicked off his shoes and stripped down to his boxers. The boxers were open and Alan could see his massive cock hanging out the front. It was more than twice Alan's size, and it wasn't even fully hard yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek sat down in the middle of the bed, surrounding Alan with his huge size 15 feet. Alan couldn't believe the size of them. Even at normal size, this guy's feet were enormous. To Alan now, they were like skyscrapers. They stank of sweat. Being so close between them, Alan couldn't help but get hard himself. He had always had a thing for other guys' feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing Alan's attraction to his feet, Derek moved them closer in around him and started rubbing him between his feet. Alan couldn't believe it. He was being rubbed between this giant's soles, and he was loving it. Even more to Alan's surprise, Derek was being gentle with him. From Derek's earlier behavior, Alan was sure he was in for a rough time, but this actually felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rubbing continued, Alan's cock grew stone hard, and he started licking as much of Derek's soles as he could get his tongue too. Derek moaned above him as he pulled his feet closer into his body. He had pulled out his cock, which had also grown hard, and was stroking it as he rubbed Alan between his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing rubbed and licking, all while watching Derek's massive penis hovering mere inches above him, Alan could hardly contain himself any longer. He shot his load, spurting it against Derek's sole. At the same time, Derek shot his own load. It shot all over his own feet and Alan, pressed between them. Alan continued licking Derek's feet, even as he came himself, and soon was licking Derek's own cum off the giant's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ecstasy seemed to go on forever, and yet ended all too soon, when Derek finally pulled Alan from between his soles. As he raised Alan up before his face, he wore a huge smile on his face. A face which Alan suddenly found much more attractive than the brute he had seen in it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liked that too, didn't you, little man?\" he said to Alan. He gently reached his tongue out and stroked it a couple times across Alan's tiny body, licking his own cum off Alan's chest. \"I told you we were gonna have fun this weekend, didn't I?\"</span></div></div>",

Alan went right back to his feet and started to press his bod up against them. Derek was clearly amused by this and let Alan go for a few more minutes.

Even though you can feel the shoe grinding on you, it isn't even the slightest bit painful. He brings it up, checks the bottom, and looks back down at you angrily. You break into a run across the room. Bryan just lets out a tense sigh and picks you up by the collar of your shirt, and brings you up to his face to look at you. When he sees you dangling in the air, he drops you and steps backward so fast that he falls on his butt and his feet kick up and land on top of you, knocking you down. A wave of the aroma hits you as you lean up and you fall backwards from the strength. \"MIKE! OVER HERE NOW!\" Bryan screams, and your brother, who was taking a leak in the nearby bathroom, jumps in shock and you can hear piss splatter on everything. \"What is it?!\" He shouts as he comes in, zipping up his pants. Meanwhile, the bulge in your pants is growing from the aroma of Bryan's feet. \"I think it's... No.. It can't be... Just look!\" Bryan said, pointing at his foot. He slid his foot away so Mike could take a look, and Mike, who was crouched on his knees, fell to the floor, mouth wide open. \"Th-that's my b-brother!\" he shouts, and he reaches out to pick you up. \"Dude...\" Mike says slowly, his lips slowly curling into a malicious grin. \"Do you realize what this means...?\" he says, as his head whips to Bryan's direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get that out of there !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy. I am not ready to change you back just yet.

He dropped Allan on the floor and said 'You're gonna love this idea'. Allan's breath of fresh air was cut short by Martin pounding him into the ground with his naked sole, trying to make him stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Martin was repeatedly stomping on Allan, Ryan and Brent, two of Allan's team-mates came over to him. 'uhh what are you doing' said Brent who was 6 foot 4. 'Look what I've got!' shouted Martin, a little too loud. He picked Allan up and showed him to Ryan and Brent. 'No way! Wait, he can't die?' said Ryan who was 6 foot 2. 'Nah, he could take any beating, it's hilarious.' answered Martin. 'Yo! We gotta share him with everyone!' suggested Ryan. 'Yes! Let's fucking do it!' Martin replied. Brent brought Allan close to his face and said 'We're gonna fucking break you bitch boy!' He laughed as Martin reached the intercom and announced the situation to the entire gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllan, unable to speak through his pain from being stomped on by Martin was now laying in the middle of the gym with 32 barefoot guys grouping up around him. 'All right boys', said Martin, 'What should we do first?' One of the boys in the back yelled 'STOMP THAT BITCH!!' All 32 boys started screaming and pushing to get a chance to crush Allan under their giant soles. Some boys were jumping both feet on Allan, others were driving their heels into his head one by one, others were sticking their feet in to get a chance to pummel Allan into the floor. All he could see were bear soles driving into him and all he could hear were screams and taunts like 'TAKE THAT BITCH' and 'TASTE MY FUCKING HEEL'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomping went on for 30 more minutes until Brandon, one of the taller boys standing at 6 foot 9, walked into the gym late. 'What's going on here!?' he yelled. The boys filled him in on the situation and he responded with 'No way! Ayt boys, it's time for kick training and I got an idea on how to make things interesting.' Every practice, they would kick around a soccer ball to train their leg power. This time though, the boys used Allan as the ball. They wrapped him up in a bundle of dirty socks and started passing him around. All Allan could smell was the sweat of different boys all together. He had felt so much pain that he was almost numb and yet, somehow, he wasn't injured at all. An hour of training passed and Allan was left in the ball of socks, untouched for half of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, he was pulled out of the ball and saw Martin, 'Wasn't that fun?' he said, smiling menacingly. Martin grabbed Allan and started heading towards the lockers when Ryan shouted from behind him 'Wait! You're not just gonna leave with him are you?' 'What do you mean? He's mine.' said Martin, defensively.  The other boys started to gather around the two of them. 'Bullshit! I'm having a party tomorrow and I wanna use him there, give him!' said Ryan. 'Well I got school tomorrow and I wanna show him off to everyone else!' answered Martin. 'Guys, let's just put him on the floor and let him crawl over to whoever he wants to go with' said Brandon. 'Fine!' they both replied in unison, unsatisfied with Brandon's idea but accepting it anyways. Martin placed Allan on the floor and eagerly waited for his decision.</span></div></div>",

He wanted to try a spell, and the sooner the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest place would be his brother Ron's house. Several years older, Ron worked in construction. \"If I get lucky, he won't even be home,\" Alan thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan got along reasonably well with Ron, who was sort of the family renegade, always going his own way. At age 25, he was several years older than his younger brothers. He was 6 feet tall with light brown hair and an incredible body. Huge muscles. Broad shoulders. Strong legs. Powerful chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan reached his brother's place and used his key. \"Ron? You at home, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got no answer, Alan threw himself onto a couch and began to eagerly scan pages in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he found what he was looking for. \"It can't be that simple, can it?\" Alan asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recited the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. He was certain he had followed the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I should have known. Book's worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated, he got up and started toward Ron's kitchen to get himself something to drink from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked past Ron's washer and dryer in the hallway. There were piles of dirty laundry waiting to be washed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alan felt very strange. A nova of colors burst in his brain. He felt dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, he found himself trapped in some dark tunnel. He began to look for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, a tiny, naked Alan crawled out from beneath his own T-shirt. Except now the garment could have been converted into a circus tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Alan squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking around, seeing everything so huge, he repeated the words. \"It worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was only a few inches tall, at the most.

He never thought for a moment that Ron would do anything other than help him. He was sure that Ron would think the ability to shrink cool, and would want to try it out himself too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his size, crossing the kitchen took a few mintues, even though he was sprinting, and by the time he got to the door into the hallway, Ron had already closed the front door behind himself and was on his way into the kitchen, throwing off his jacket and starting to kick off his shoes as he went. Alan froze in the middle of the doorway, unsure of what to do. Ron wasn't going to notice him standing there at that size, and the way it was looking, Alan would probably be hit by one of Ron's flying workboots or by Ron's giant foot itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boots both flew clear of Alan, who was still frozen in the doorway, apparently unable to decide which way to run, and as Ron's sock-clad right foot starting swinging right for him, Alan leaped out of the way at the very last second, landing cenimeters away from Ron's huge foot as it crashed down onto the floor beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan breathed a sigh of relief as Ron finally passed him, headed for the refridgerator. While Ron rooted around in the fridge for an after-work snack, Alan regrouped and considered a new plan of action. Unfortunately, before he could really formulate anything in his mind, Ron, now holding a soda in one of his hands, was walking right back toward him again, and once again, Alan narrowly missed being crushed underneath his older brother's massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan gathered himself once again, he heard Ron sigh comfortably as he sank into the couch in the living room. The sigh was shortly followed by the sound of the TV being turned on and the pop of his soda being opened. Alan smiled to himself, glad for an opportunity to try to get Ron's attention while he was sitting still, and started running toward the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Alan found himself beside the couch in the living room, standing between Ron's huge feet, resting comfortably on either side of him. He wondered how he should do this...</span></div></div>",

As hand touched the soft fabric of the sock, he moved his other hand onto the toe as well, and slowly hardened his grip. Ron didn't seem to feel it, and Alan slowly moved to start climbing, but the moment, he started to push himself upward, putting the pressure of all his weight onto Ron's toe, Ron's foot gave a sudden jerk, and he went flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan crashed back down on the carpet, he barely felt the pain, but quickly looked up to the heights of Ron's knees, hoping that his older brother would look down, but apparently, it hadn't actually been enough to catch Ron's attention, but was just an involuntary jerk of the foot. Alan got back to his feet and cautiously approached Ron's mountainous foot once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, as he began to push himself up, Ron's foot gave only the slightest twitch, and Alan managed to hold on. In a second, he was on top of it, looking up again hopefully for Ron's face, but he apparently still didn't feel him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan walked the short distance up Ron's foot, until he came to the cuff of his jeans, wondering how he should climb up from here. If he went up the inside of the pant-leg, he would be touching Ron's skin, and then Ron might feel him. But what if Ron still didn't respond to his touch? He could get all the way to Ron's crotch, and not only be trapped, but be trapped with his older brother's hot, musty privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to test it to see if Ron could feel his touch, and pressed his hand firmly to Ron's bare skin at his ankle. He left it there for a moment, and even moved it around a bit, but apparently, he was small enough that his touch didn't warrent even the tiniest of flashes in Ron's head, as his brother gave no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back again, once again contemplating his options. Ron was bound to be more sensitive even to his small touch higher up his leg, and it seemed like touch was probably going to be the best way to get Ron's attention, especially with the TV blaring. But if it didn't work, and Alan was trapped, even temporarily... stuck in his brother's underpants for even the shortest period of time didn't sound like too appealing a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do? he wondered again.</span></div></div>",

He had to go up the inside. If he wanted to get his brother's attention, it was the only sure way. Even if his touch still didn't get Ron's attention all the way up his leg, he would just have to bare a few moments at his crotch. After all, it wouldn't be longer than that: what more sensitive area was there to get Ron's attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way up the inside of the pant-leg wasn't easy. Ron's jeans were baggy, so he only ever had one wall to cling to, and as it was the easiest to hold onto, he climbed from the fabric of the pants. After what seemed like a very long time, though, he finally reached Ron's knees, and his trek became much easier. As Ron was sitting, he could now simply cross through the remainder of the leg by walking. All the time, he had a hand on Ron's leg, hoping that Ron would respond to his touch. The further Alan got, the more he wondered if his brother was even awake, as he wasn't giving even the slightest twitch to Alan's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Alan had reached the place to which he had so dreaded going. And it was so much worse than he had imagined. The hot, sweaty space between Ron's legs, where his balls hung, and his cock lay limp had a stench that was unbarable to Alan's miniscule size. Not to mention that Alan now knew something he never cared to know about his brother: that he preferred commando to boxers or briefs. Alan shuddered, his hand still firmly placed on the fleshy wall of Ron's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few steps closer, his eyes never straying from the giant cock lying directly in front of him, mostly because there was really nothing else to look at. He breathed in, nervously, and held his breath, forcing his hand forward, even more tentative than his orignal touch to Ron's big toe just a short while earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much the same thing happened as with the toe. The cock gave only the slightest response at Alan's touch, but stiffened a little, as Alan touched it with his other hand and both hands tightened their grip. Alan was never more aware of his nakedness than right there, right then, as his his own cock stiffened along with the giant one he was grasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan quickly became sure that his older brother was asleep as he heard him moan dreamily, and the pressure of one of his hands was laid upon his growing hard-on in his sleep. Alan wondered what to do. To his complete horror, he was actually enjoying what was going on, and wanted to continue. At the same time, he thought that it might be a good idea to continue just in order to get his brother's attention, as he was sure Ron would probably begin to awaken as things progressed. On the other hand, though, Alan was completely aghast at the situation, as well as with himself. How could he be doing this? He should just retreat back down the pant leg now and try something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Alan was at an impass, unable to decide what to do...</span></div></div>",

He began stroking slowly, moving the tiny Alan up and down with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was beginning to wonder if his brother was still asleep in this new action, but either way, he still didn't seem to be feeling Alan, so Alan assumed that he was probably still half-asleep or so. Surely, if he were fully awake, he would wonder to himself what exactly it is that he's rubbing between his cock and his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ron's strokes became faster and faster, Alan's own hard-on started throbbing somewhere between pleasure and pain. And then, Ron's giant cock exploded like a volcano, spewing from it what seemed like an endless stream of hot, sticky cum. Ron loosened his grip and Alan felt himself slip from his position and fall into the puddle of Ron's cum. He was drenched in it, swallowing it, and before long, he realized he had released his own load as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired and spent, Alan let his eyes close as he lay in the pool of warm, wet, sticky substance.

Then, Ron's lips slowly curled into a friendly smile that made Alan smile too in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe this! This is great!\" said Ron excitedly, starting to stand up. \"I've gotta see this book. It's in the laundry room, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" replied Alan, somewhat uncomfortably as he saw that Ron was turning around and lifting the toilet seat. \"Er... What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just gotta use the toilet real quick. Hold on,\" said Ron as he set the tiny Alan on the rim of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you couldn't just set me down on the counter where I wasn't in the line of fire?!\" said Alan angrily as a stream of piss started shooting over his head. Ron just smirked at him mischeviously and aimed his piece a little lower so his piss missed Alan by mere inches. Alan scowled, resigned to suffer his brother's whims, though he shouted out again when Ron's stream began slowing and falling, and hit him directly in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan spurted piss out of his mouth as he screamed at his giant brother, who had fallen over laughing at him. When he was finally finished laughing, he picked his tiny brother up by the feet so as not to touch his piss-soaked upper body, and then, deposited him in the sink, where he let him rinse off with soap and water. Then, they set off toward the kitchen and laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan spoke up from Ron's hand as he was carried along. \"So, you're going to turn me back now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked Alan directly in the eye, the mischevious grin on his face again. \"And why should I do that?

And worse yet, sound was muffled both in and out of the sneaker. Ron and his friend, Matt, could neither hear Alan's screams, nor could Alan seem to hear them talking. At least, not clearly. As Alan pressed himself into the damp sock, he strained his ears to hear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could just barely make out their voices, but not what they were saying. Of course, it didn't really matter. It would only be a matter of time before Ron told Matt all about his shrunken brother, and then, Alan would be at the mercy of both the giants. Alan could do nothing but wait for his brother to reveal him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt followed Ron into the living room, and sat on the couch next to him. He had been surprised when Ron called, inviting him over. He had talked to him earlier that day when Ron had said he was too tired to do anything that night. He didn't look tired now, though. In fact, when Ron answered the door, Matt thought Ron looked more lively than he had looked as long as Matt had known him. He even had a special gleam from some unknown excitement just bursting to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Ron's obvious burning desire to reveal some secret or other, he still started out the conversation light and mundane. The longer the conversation went on that way, the more maddening it became to Matt. He had known Ron for over a year now, and he had never seen Ron quite like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Matt decided to put a stop to it and force Ron into revealing his secret. \"All right! Enough, Ron. I know you didn't bring me over here to talk about nothing. You obviously have something to show me or tell me, so just get on with it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's grin grew impossibly wider, but he seemed to agree and reached under the couch. Matt prepared himself to react in surprise, astonishment, fright, or whatever other reaction whatever it was might cause, but as he saw what Ron pulled from beneath the couch, he just didn't know how to react at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a book. Just a book. It had a thick leather cover and the pages were thick and yellowed. It looked to be very old. Matt was utterly confused. Of all the things he had expected Ron to show him, a book just wasn't anywhere near the ultra-exciting thing he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ron started explaining what it was. And Matt became even more disbelieving. Ron said that it was a book of magic, with all types of spells in it to change your form or your appearance. He said that with this book, you could make yourself as tall as a sky-scraper or as small as an insect. Matt just stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon saw the look of disbelief on his friends face, but instead of becoming discouraged, he just seemed to become even more excited. That's when he reached down again for something else. This time, Matt didn't bother trying to prepare himself for the excitement or any sort of reaction at all, and actually found himself somewhat unsurprised as a result, when Ron pulled up one of his sneakers from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was seriously beginning to consider committing his friend as Ron pulled a dirty sock from the shoe, now unable to contain his excitement. But then, Ron held the shoe up so that the back of the shoe faced toward the floor and held his hand out beside the opening. As he tipped the shoe forward a little, Matt couldn't believe what he was seeing. There was a tiny naked man tumbling out of Ron's shoe into his hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gasped and choked as his eyes grew big enough that they looked like they would pop right out of his head. Ron just beamed as he looked from his friend to the shrunken man in his hand. The little man just sat in Ron's hand, resigned to whatever fate that may come to him at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch him,\" Ron urged. Matt looked at Ron, then at the tiny man. Tentatively, he reached a finger out and touched the tiny man's chest. A light turned on in his head as he recognized the shrunken figure. It was Ron's younger brother, Alan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron...\" Matt breathed, \"... You... you... shrunk your little brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon laughed. \"No. Not really. The dumbass shrunk himself actually. He came over here so we could have a little fun with the book, I guess, and managed to get himself shrunk before I ever even got home. Apparently, I even nearly killed him a couple times before I found him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Matt, finally beginning to calm down. \"This is unbelievable... But... Why did you call me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon shrugged. \"I don't know. I just thought you'd get a kick out of it. And I thought we could mess around with the book a little. You know, see what else we can do with little Alan, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna turn him back?\" Matt asked, at which Alan looked up hopefully. Ron's grin faltered for the first time. Though it held, it started to look a little strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Yeah,\" began Ron, though when Alan looked at him, he added, \"maybe... But the whole point was to play around in the first place. That's all I want to do: play around with him a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt still looked unsure. Ron's smile was looking more and more strained. Matt's fingers found the book. Ron saw them. He grabbed the book away from Matt, closing his fist around Alan at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?!\" Ron yelled. \"You trying to steal the book from me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Matt started, \"no, Ron. It's just that the magic in that book could be dangerous. I mean, just look at what happened to your brother. You said you almost killed him already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accidentally!\" screamed Ron, as if that were an appropriate excuse. \"That was before I knew about him. I wouldn't do that now!... You just want the book for yourself so you can shrink me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" shouted Matt, poised beside the couch as Ron moved around and away from him. Matt was ready to pounce if he needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not going to work!\" said Ron. He carelessly deposited Alan on a nearby endtable so he could hold the book with both hands. He quickly flipped to the page he had seen the shrinking spell on earlier while Matt stumbled over the couch toward him. Matt was just clawing his way to him when Ron shouted the magic words into the otherwise quiet house and...</span></div></div>",

The moment Ron started speaking the words, Matt somehow knew it was already too late. There would be no stopping him. Matt was to join Alan in his current state, and both of them would be at Ron's whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ron finished the incantation, he closed the book triumphantly and slammed it down on the same table Alan was currently standing on, very nearly crushing his tiny brother beneath the thick book. Neither Ron nor Matt noticed as Alan dashed out of the way of the book and nearly toppled over the edge of the endtable, narrowly saving himself from a horrible end, yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon stood where he was, chin-up, as he watched his friend intently. Any moment, Matt would begin to shrink, and then, Ron would have two new pets to play with. He realized for the first time just how excited the entire prospect actually made him. He could do whatever he wanted with them, and with anyone else for that matter. The book held limitless possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these thoughts ran through his head, though, thoughts of doubt quickly started flooding in with them until they had drowned out all the others. Nothing was happening! Matt was just standing there, frozen, both of them, staring at each other, waiting for something to happen, and nothing was happening. And then, he noticed it. The expression on Matt's face. It was no longer an expression of fear for what Ron would do to him. It had turned into something like... amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Ron's mind went blank as he puzzled over Matt's expression. And was Matt actually getting taller? It had started to seem so. In fact, he was getting taller. A lot taller! The rest of the room around him also seemed to be growing, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's suddenly felt very sick as he finally grasped what was happening to him. Somehow, he had just managed to shrink himself, instead of Matt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ron finished diminishing and was the same size as Alan, Matt, Ron, and Alan looking down at his now-shrunken brother from the endtable, all remained still, not sure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted all of a minute before Matt suddenly made to grab Ron from the floor, Ron bolted from his spot with surprising speed, and Alan started screaming his head off for Matt's support in returning him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire scene was a sort of restrained chaos.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As fast as Ron ran, he was no match for the giant chasing him. Matt caught him with relative quickness and ease. Holding Ron in his hand before him, Matt spoke to his shrunken [former] friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you thought you were gonna shrink me?\" said Matt wickedly to Ron. Ron could only stand, quaking in Matt's giant hand. Alan wondered if he trembled entirely out of fear, or partially because he had also lost his clothes when he shrank right out of them, just as Alan had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt continued, \"Well, guess what, buddy. You made a big mistake. A really BIG mistake!\" Matt's eyes glared at his tiny friend ferociously. \"You know, I've always wondered what a human would taste like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what Ron had done to him and had been planning to do to him, Alan felt a chill of horror run down his spine as he heard Matt utter those words. It was nothing, though, compared to the terror that ran through Ron's entire body. His heart instantly started pumping so fast, he was sure it would burst out of his chest at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan and Ron both could only hope that Matt was joking or making idle threats just to scare Ron, but it quickly became obvious that Matt was in no joking mood. He tossed his shrunken friend into his mouth without hesitation, just like a piece of popcorn. Alan desperately wanted to look away, but couldn't tear his terrified eyes away from the giant as he savored the taste of Ron's skin in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolled his tongue across Ron's skin, enjoying the taste of salt. He let his saliva pool in his mouth, soaking Ron in it, potentially drowning him in it. Matt didn't give him the chance to drown, though. He used his tongue to push Ron directly under his teeth. He held him there, his teeth pressing his neck gently enough not to snap it off. Matt looked at Alan on the table, spread his lips to show him his teeth. Alan could see his brother's head, poking between them. And then, suddenly, Matt's teeth snapped together, and Ron's severed head flew out of Matt's mouth. It hit the wall behind Alan and thankfully fell behind the table instead of on it. Alan puked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt apparently enjoyed the taste as he chewed Ron's body into mush. He didn't bother retrieving the head. Instead, he picked Alan up off the table and went back over to the couch. There, he sat down, holding Alan in his hand as it rested in his lap. Alan was trembling even harder than his older brother had been a few moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt finally finsihed chewing, he looked down at Alan and gave him a sympathetic smile. \"You don't have to be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan gulped and stared up at him with obvious mistrust. How could he say such a thing to him? He had just eaten his older brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry I made you watch that. It wasn't my intention to hurt you by it in any way. It's just... well, I was mad. Really mad. He tried to shrink me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan somehow gathered up the courage to speak. \"But... but... you ATE him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt whinced slightly. \"Okay, so maybe I overreacted. I was a little bit emotional about it, okay? I'm not gonna do the same thing to you, all right?...\" His tone changed suddenly to an icy seriousness. \"At least as long as you don't piss me off, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan felt none-too-comfortable at being at the mercy of this madman. He wished he had his brother back to torture him with his horniness and smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to change me back?\" Alan asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt seemed to think about it for a second. A very short second. \"Sorry, buddy, but I don't think I can do that now. I can't risk you getting out and telling people what I just did... Besides, now that I think about it, I'm kinda starting to warm up to the possibilities, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Alan asked, \"What are you going to do with me?\"</span></div></div>",

Alan was still a human, even if he was small. An idea popped into Matt's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan just stared up at Matt in terror, letting out a high pitched yelp when the giant raised his hand. He tried to back up when he passed Matt's chest, getting closer and closer to the mouth that had killed his brother a couple minutes ago. Oh god, was Matt going to kill him too? Alan screwed his eyes shut, trying not to tremble. He felt Matt's hot breath blow over him. Then something wet ran from his feet up to his neck. It wiggled around before rolling back down to his groin. His cock was quickly growing hard and he could barely hold back a moan. Alan's eyes snapped open, placing his palms on Matt's nose. His tiny fingers dug into the firm cartilage when the wet muscle disappeared and his cock was sealed in a warm vacuum. Matt flicked his tongue over Alan's cock again, looking down at the pleased micro man. That pleasured look was much better than the terror from before. Giving another hard suck, a splash of liquid hit his tongue with just a tang of salt. Alan went boneless against Matt's hand with a shaky moan. The giant didn't stop though, kept flicking his tongue around Alan's weak cock. Alan screamed, kicking at Matt's chin and trying to claw his way back to sitting. Matt finally pulled back, licking his lips. Alan flopped back again, panting.</span></div></div>",

This went on for all of 30 seconds before Alan burst out in tears, mourning the death of his brother Ron.  \"Hey, don't cry,\" said Matt, earnestly wanting Alan to feel better.  If he was honest, Matt did regret eating Ron, but he wanted to have fun with Alan, and his being upset was getting in the way of that.  On the other hand, Alan never felt smaller, and it wasn't the change in size that was making him feel this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can I do? He thought to himself.  My brother's dead...He's dead! Dear God. And the person responsible is my only way back to my normal size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan continued to cry with Matt trying in vain to calm him down.  After about eight minutes, Alan began to compose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Alan whimpered, wiping away his tears, \"I mean. For God's sake, Matt, you just killed my brother, how do you expect me to feel!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Alan, I'm sorry. I wish I hadn't had done it.  But you know what's gonna make you feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asked Alan.  Matt began to unzip and reveal his absolutely monstrous manhood that towered Alan three times over.  Alan got an instant boner that Matt could feel in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that?\" Matt asked cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he do this, Alan thought to himself.  He just finished mourning his brother and in response Matt wants him to pleasure his cock?  What was he thinking.  But Alan's own member had a mind of its own, and as much as Alan would miss his brother, some insidious lust filled his mind and all of a sudden the thing he wanted most in that moment was to serve Matt's penis.  The urge was too great.  He would finish mourning another time, but for now, the mission was to appease Matt in any way possible, for that was the only way back to a normal life.  And if the way to that life mean going through the erotic splendor and nirvana of becoming one with a giant's cock, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do like that,\" said Alan stupidly, \"I like it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Matt, as he lowered Alan to the base of his cock, \"Now. Serve your new master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan got to work immediately, rubbing his entire body against the already rigid manhood.  Matt began to groan in pleasure as Alan would thrust himself onto the penis.  He began to climb it so that he was just under the top and massaged the girth of the member.  He could hardly fit the circumference of the man meat between his thighs, but he certainly tried, and massaged it as precum started sprouting everywhere.  It wasn't long before Alan could feel the cock bucking, and Matt screamed, \"I'm gonna cum!\" This was enough for Alan to blow his own microscopic load over himself, but before he could even registered what was happening, Alan was lathered in Matt's cum, and slipped and fell off of the penis and into his pubic hair, where he nearly drowned in the hot cockjuice.  There, he reveled in the cum of his master, awaiting further instructions, utterly satisfied, and instantly forgetful of the pain he had just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alan, that was beautiful,\" Matt said, \"Now what to do with you?\"</span></div></div>",

You hit the side of the hamper then bounce landing at the feet of your Brother and his Buddy, Steven. You look up just as they stop in their tracks and looks down. There are four huge work boot clad feet infront of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit that\u2019s one big bug\u201d Steven says and lifts his boot to stomp you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you raise your hands but its too late, his boot slams down on your. You feel the pressure exerted by the 6 foot 4 inch tall man but no pain. You lay there Pressed flat as his foot grinds side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStange\u201d you think. You should not even be thinking at all, you should be dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven lifts his foot and turns it to the side, exposing your flattened body on his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s one weird bug\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon leans in to take a closer look. \u201cThat\u2019s no a bug, that a little guy !\u201d He looks closer. \u201cOH my God\u201d I think that\u2019s my little Brother !\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds you begin to regain your shape, yet still greatly reduced.

He carries you to the kitchen where he and Steven sit at the table where you are also deposited. You explain how you go the size and apparent consistence you have become.  Ron shakes his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know dad forbid you from all that witchcraft and spell stuff. I mean, Look you almost ended up as a smudge on the bottom of Steven boot\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was rubbing his crotch under the table, at the power trip he was having thinking about that. He loved picking on guys younger and smaller then him and you could not get more of either at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \u201cI know I see that now. Help me get back to normal and no one needs to know about this. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee I don\u2019t know, Steven says. \u201cI think you need to be taught a lesson. Maybe you should stay like that for a while. I mean its like you can really get hurt apparently.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou implore your brother to help you. Instead you watch as he walks into the living room, picks up the spell book and sets it high atop the bookshelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon then grabs a jar and drops you into it. You yell at him shouting to have him take you out. He just shrugs and gets a beer for himself and one for Steven. Steven then pick up the jar looking at you like you\u2019re a bug caught for a science experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comments, \u201cBack in high school for science class I had to catch bugs like him and pin them to a board. I always did mine while they were still alive to see how long it would take for them to die.\u201d He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drink their beer trying to decide what to do with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The decision was made for him as the giant leaves without seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan runs as fast as he can and catches a view of Dale entering another room.

There is also a big screen tv and a lounge chair.  Dale has stripped down to his briefs and is doing sit ups on the floor.

The memory of what he saw in the bathroom is very fresh in his mind. As Dale pounds out the reps, his cock is stretching his shorts.  Alan walks straight between the massive thighs, his steps to the rhythm of the giant's breathing. He enters the narrow gap between thigh and shorts and takes a deep breath as he climbs up and lays face down on top of the expanding member.  \"This is where I want to be,\" he says out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale completes his sit ups and relaxes in the lounge chair still oblivious to his cocks new \"friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Alan is sporting his own tiny erection as Dale turns on the TV with the remote and watches a muscle porn tape.  Still sitting on the chair, he picks up a dumbbell in each hand and starts doing curls while concentrating on not only making his biceps bigger but making his cock stiffen up.  Alan is trying to hold back his load as the shaft starts to expand both in length and girth.  He is at the base and from his vantage point the big man's cock extends for yards.  The smell of man sweat is intoxicating to him and he wants to lick it all up but he doesn't want to be discovered until he can experience the giant's orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale is \"hot and heavy\" into the video and watching his arms pump and feeling the pump in his shorts and when he senses the end is near he lets his body take over.  Alan is lifted up to a sharper angle as the huge cock bucks and fires it's payload all over himself and Dale's shorts and groin.  Having accomplished it's mission, the \"turtle\" goes back in to the \"shell\" leaving the little man still holding on and both Dale and Alan catch some zzzzs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a few hours and things in the crotch area have gotten kind of crusty.

Finally, Alan began screaming his head off, trying to get the giant's attention. He hesitated only once as he wondered what his panic was really all about.

He had a standard military buzz cut and kept in top physical condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride into the desert took only a couple of hours from the base.

He stood and walked to his tent. Accommodations were very spartan. He spread out a blanket over the sand, pulled off his boots, stripped down to his boxers, and settled onto the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had used the last couple of hours to manage an escape from the interior of the duffel bag.

Alan began to run, convinced that he would remain healthier by putting some distance between himself and the giant soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flight took him outside the tent. By now he realized he had been transported out into the desert. Looking around, he saw the glow of a campfire and saw several huge, dark forms around the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he return to the tent and try to contact the huge soldier there or advance toward the campfire and try his luck with those giants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just him, should be easy enough to get his attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan got into the tent, unaware of the titan's near indecency, easily enough as the tent was left open weirdly enough. While he was getting through however, a strong gust of wind blew him foward leaving his face down in some sand that had blown inside of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, the cocky army titan, was annoyed for a second after realising he had left the tent flap open. Getting up, he walked towards the entrance clad only in his boxers, the others were at the campfire after all, and zipped the tent shut. Finally alone he finished off the undressing, ready for sleep, by hooking his thumbs into his tight boxers and releasing his mighty package from its cotton prison. Giving his package a little rub he turned off to head to bed when another annoyance occured, mosquitoes had gotten in and leaving his most sensitive area uncovered seemed stupid. He sighed, turned back got his legs in the holes pulled them up and finishing off gave his imprisoned package a squeeze and got into bed. Unknown to him his package had a fellow \"cellmate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was I'm shock and awe. He looked up from his sand faceplant to feel massive rumbles and a almost naked titan suddenly looing over him. The titan leaned over to close the tent, and his boxers stretched out giving Alan a full view of the titan's testicles! A drop of sweat dripped down into him covering him in the titan's salty man liquid!

Suddenly his world lurched and he felt himself flying up! Screaming going unnoticed he put his hands toward, and felt himself grab onto something fleshy! It was the soldier's...</span></div></div>",

Foolishly, he let go of the fleshy ballsack, unaware that his grip had given him room and what to his titan was about two inches of ballsack and to Alan was from this proximety a gigantic fleshy wall suddenly flew down to him and left him pinned beneath the titan's most manly part. He didn't have time to examine his position as soon the fabric he lay against was undergoing an earthquake for Alan but a small pants adjust for the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went from being chaos and apocalyptic to still in a surprising amount of time! When things had finally calmed down he stil felt extremely uncomfortable and opening his eyes he could only see huge red and blue lines above him. Confused to his surrondings it began clicking together when he saw the biggest drop of liquid run down the surface with the coloured lines on it. Dreading the truth of the situation he took a deep breath but all it did was confirm his placmement. It was the unique musky smell of another man's greatest teasure, his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything about his predicament though he again felt movement though. This time however it was a swaying motion and he felt raw power exerted around him as the muscles around him worked to bring the titan movement. If the titan walking exerted this much control over him, then Alan had no chance with what was soon to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom  lowered himself into bed and began to think of his plans for tonight. Everything had lined up for him, and he would probably never get a chance like this ever again. His tent partner had happened to be Tom's favourite man in the entire squad, no barracks, as well as most attractive and fit man in the entire barracks, and this was common knowledge not based on opinion, would be sleeping, quite deeply if the pills that Tom managed to slip into the man's drink had worked, in a hot desert. He was getting hard just thinking about it, and he lowered his hand into his loose boxers for a little alone time. Fondling his balls he imagined plans for tonight's show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing approaching footsteps Tom snapped back into plan and pretended to be asleep. His unaware lover for the night, Jeremy, was the leader of the barracks and decided to accompany the low ranked men for their survival training. Being the leader of the army, he was heavily ripped and didn't lack on looks either! Shivering with anticipation, Tom waited until he heard loud snores from Jeremy. Getting out off his bed he crawled over to Jeremy's double bed, best beds for the leader huh, and giving Jeremy a few pokes just to make sure he was in a deep sleep began his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew this would probably be his only chance to do this so made sure to save the best for last. He hooked his hands through the head part of Jeremy's vest and slowly took it off him. With Jeremy half naked, Tom crawled into the bed with him and laid on top of him thrusting against Jeremy's covered package. Meanwhile Tom's hands were smoothing out Jeremy's armpit hair and getting his hands dripping with sweat in the progress. Tom moved onto Jeremy's chest, finally getting to admire his toned and incredibly muscluar chest! He moved his mouth over one of Jeremy's nipples and began sucking on them. When the abs were rock hard and Tom felt Jeremy's erect cock underneath his hand he moved onto the final part. Almost tearing Jeremy's tight boxers off, Tom cradled the Commander's ballsack in his hand and began giving Jeremy a blowjob. The cock didn't need anymoe persuasion and reached it's climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was the happiest he had ever been in his life, and reclothing Jeremy and tucking him back in finished the job. CLimbing back into bed Tom smiled. He would never forget that. However Alan got stuck in Toim's hand during alone time and his hands had heavily interacted with Jeremy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alan awoke he knew almost immediatly he wasn't on Tom anymore. Perhaps he had spent so long in Tom's manliest place he knew his scent? However unknown to Alan he was on the barrack's most muscular, biggest and attractive man's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tried to stand up, but found himself being held down by strands of hair, he first thought that he was stuck to another man's pubic hair or maybe ballsack, but it didn't have the same layout or aroma a soldier's pubes would, the hairs were almost two times as long as well! Suddenly the ground beneath him began leaking? Alan wasn't the smartest of men, as shown by getting into this problem in the first place, but he put two and two together, and realized the only place he could be was on the armpit of whoever this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before he could act on this, the armpit he was stuck on began shaking violently, and he looked to see a wall of flesh hurtling towards him! The soldier was closing their arms! His tiny shriek unheard, this muscular soldier closed his arm and turned over in his sleep. Alan now found himself squished between a sweaty armpit and a torso. Before when he could kind of move but was still stuck to armpit hair, was now looking ideal for now he couldn't even move. All Alan could hear was the loud bangs of this soldier's heartbeat due to his close proximity to the soldier's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was awakened by his personal alarm clock. Grunting in annoyance he had a splitting headache the drink that Tom had given him must have been dodgy. He was going to have a go at the much lower rank soldier for serving him an off-date drink but decided not to blame him for that. Stretching with a yawn, Jeremy continued with his everyday routine, he got out of his bed and used his deodorant, he searched for his usual spray deodorant but was annoyed to find it had ran out and gave a light puff on his armpit before dying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Jeremy walked over to the lower rank soldier to find him asleep. Well he was a much higher rank, the soldier is legally required to help him to the best of his ability. He turned to the soldier's suitcase and opened it and searched through uniforms and underwear before he found the only deodorant in the suitcase and it was roll on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter roll on than none he guessed, and he turned away from Tom, twisted the lid off and raised it to his right armpit and began rubbing it on his armpit. Jeremy never used a roll on, so decided to just roll it over each armpit for about a minute. It felt really weird on his armpit and Jeremy rolled it on his left Pec for a second just to see how it felt and shivered at the cold touch. Putting the lid back Jeremy tossed it back into Tom's suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan woke up with the soldier he was stuck on. He felt the soldier's body began to speed up and heard all the movements inside the body due to the position he was in. He had been here for a hour and was blinded by the sudden light he was seeing as the armpit he was stuck to was now facing the light due to the stretch of the arm it was attached to. Alan could briefly see the tent he was inside and saw Tom on the other side still sleeping confirming that he was no longer on Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he was then forced into darkness as the arm went back to it's original position leaving Alan to gasp for air. He felt the titan he was stuck to move and Alan could hear the bones and muscles contracting and expanding to move this enormous mass. He briefly saw light though more dim than before and could see a bunch of uniforms and underwear inside what appeared to be a suitcase. With Alan's small and more observant eyes he could see specks of semen that washing machines couldn't wash away still attached to the underwear of whoever owned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pressed back into the soldier's torso as the titan found whatever they were looking for. However, when he saw light again, it wasn't what he was expecting and with horror found himself face to face with some sort of gel! It came closer and closer until Alan realized what it was. Roll on deodorant. Scream cut off by the awful gel, he was pressed against it and constantly run over by it again and again for what seemed like hours but was actually a minute. When it retreated Alan screamed as he came with it. Now the right armpit was done, the titan moved onto the left and Alan saw it approach at mach speed before he was slammed against it and rubbed against the sweaty muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this time he wasn't stuck to the armpit and moved with the roll on deodorant and felt himself go into the container before he rolled into light again. This continued for a minute until Alan luckily found himself in the open of the deodorant. He was raised suddenly and was now looking into the face of his unaware captor. Alan's breath was taken away and he saw the perfect features of his captor. Short blond hair, cocky grin, war scars, lush lips and sexy stubble. However Alan was too shocked to take the moment to attract the commander's attention and cursed himself as he was lowered. Alan was now staring at the titan's vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused as to where the commander was going with this, Alan suddenly saw the vest raised and was left to stare at the titan's incredibly muscular chest! Alan had caught a glimpse at Tom's chest and was impressed, but this was something else! Everything was perfect and no fat remained on this commander's chest. Suddenly he was rushing towards the huge, perky, muscular and hard pec of the titan and felt himself rubbed against it! The pec almost seemed magnetic and it snatched him off the gel and left him stuck to the pec of the commander! The vest came on again and left Alan to dry against the pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy stood up and decided to exercise his already perfect body. He didn't even need to change, he decided to work out at his private gym, he was the top commander after all, catered to his needs. He was much bigger than most soldiers after all. Leaving in his pants and vest, Jeremy walked across the sand to his private gym and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to take off his pants and vest to maximize workout time. Picking the weights, he took his Ipod on the way, stuck his headphones in and played it at max. Nothing to distract him during his workout sessions. Lying on the table he picked up the bar and lifted dumbbells for a hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan felt the titan he was stuck to move. The pec he was stuck to was being thrown about violently and he almost vomited from the ride he was stuck on. He could see faintly from outside the vest, and saw the tent door open. He could see a few structures in the desert they were in, and he saw himself move towards one in particular. The door flung open and he saw a bunch of exercise machines. Did this guy really need to work out any more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the vest was thrown off. He looked down to see the titan had already took his underwear off. Blushing he saw the titan's package which was almost twice the size of Tom's. He saw himself move towards weights. And his world flipped as the titan lied on the steel bed and began lifting weights. He was still stuck to the commander, though this was to change as the pec he was stuck to began sweating and he found he could move again! He got up and could see very far down the huge dick and ballsack of the titan, it was still flaccid! Maybe he could change that? Much closer though was the titan's face. He had earphones in but maybe Alan could attract his attention?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stars looked so overwhelming to the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir light, and the glow from the campfire a few yards distant, provided enough illumination that he could make his way from the outside of the tent into the open. Keeping his eyes fastened on the fire, he started toward the titanic soldiers seated on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't gotten far. The expanse of sand was littered with pebbles \u2014 or boulders from his perspective  \u2014 that forced detour after detour. He was coming around one of the boulders when he happened to catch sigh of something that caused him to freeze in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desert tarantula looked three times his size. The monster spider scurried across the sand on its eight legs. Alan didn't dare take a breath for fear of being discovered by the terrifying creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan could still see the campfire. One final sprint \u2014 and he could try to attract the attention of the giant soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled deeply and began to run. The instant he moved, the spider's finely tuned senses picked up the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eight-legged arachnid had the advantage in a race across the sand, especially after Alan stumbled and fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spider closed in, the tiny man screamed for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something huge moved between Alan and the glow of the fire. The enormous soldiers were on their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" Alan screamed. He struggled back onto his feet, but the spider was now between him and the soldiers. The creature moved methodically, moving closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alan heard a loud, surprised voice. \"Look at that ugly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it!\" Another loud male voice declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan watched as a soldier's huge boot crashed down, obliterating the spider.

Turning to his buddy with a smirk on his face he joked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stupid thing would crawl into these sweaty boots! I don't think air itself can actually get through the thickness of these combat boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom then began massaging his thick-skinned feet. His buddy taking his boot and sniffing it then exaggerated a dry retch and replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus man! What do you do in there! That boot could probably kill hundreds of soldiers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed and replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? A hard working man like me needs to get rid of the sweat somehow! Sometimes I feel like I'm walking in a puddle with how much sweat is made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom then put the boot on then turned to his other boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least that boot is tattered and the sweat doesn't pile up too much! This one is in normal condition and always needs to be kept in fresh air when not used because it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbuilds up a huge stench!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the boot with his hands he slowly slid his massive foot into it, unaware of the wimpy teen below his foot.<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\nAlan woke up to the sound of the titans that brought him here conversing. Waking up on top of leather he was confused for a moment, but then with horror he remembered. He has foolishly chose to sleep inside the titan's rubber combat boots! Still groggy, he threw himself up and began running ,or in his condition more like stumbling, towards the light that seemed miles away. He was lucky that the boot was still sideways however his luck soon ran out as an unfamiliar face popped over the boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world flipped as he found himself falling and it seemed forever till he finally hit the rubber sole of the boot with no broken bones, but more bruises. The face went away and he heard the titan converse with another titan. He could only make out words like, boot, sweat and puddle, and as he lay on the rubber sole, suddenly the stench kicked in. If the titan said that the fresh air kept the stench away, that must only be to his titan nose and not to Alan's sensitive tiny nose. Alan couldn't see anything and tried to touch the ground he was on but he could only grip onto small parts of the sole, and when he did that he squeezed sweat out of it and it stuck to his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the boot he was in began shaking violently and Alan screamed as he gripped onto the sweaty sole tighter than he had before. The titan's sweat went into his mouth after he released it from it's prison inside the sole. Alan gagged as the salty liquid went down his throat, choking in vain. Suddenly the world he was in went dark. And a monster could just be seen in the dim light as in slowly came down onto Alan. Alan screamed in vain, his voice blocked by the massive form of the titan's foot and he eventually found himself...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other one was much younger, surely just a rookie, and had short blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan staggered slowly out from beneath the bench, between the two giant cops, thinking about what to do. They were cops. Surely if there was anyone who would help him in his current plight, it would be them. He decided to try to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said then done, though. He was mere inches tall. Even shouting at his loudest, it didn't seem he had any hope of getting their attention. But then, he had a flash of hope. As he was screaming, the young cop with the blond hair glanced down, seemingly in response to his screaming, and though he looked back up, Alan was sure he had seen him. His rational brain had surely just rejected what he had just seen as truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, a moment later, the cop looked down again, this time narrowing his eyes to see the thing on the ground between their feet better. Alan breathed a sigh of relief as the young cop's eyes widened, and he looked up at the other cop again, an alert look now on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...

The little man he had found beside the park bench hidden inside his pocket, Bryant reached his hand in periodically just to check he was still there. He couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in the back of his mind had told him right away that he needed to show the little man to his partner and try to help him, but it was as if all rational thought left him when he looked at it. He felt like a kid at Christmas, who had just gotten a new toy. In fact, he felt that way in more ways then one. He couldn't shed the idea that he had just found a wonderful toy for himself that he just couldn't wait to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed forever before Bryant returned home to his apartment late that night. His room-mate was already asleep, and Bryant went straight to his room, closing the door behind him and kicking off his shoes. He reached a hand in his pocket and pulled out his wonderful discovery as he jumped onot the bed, bouncing a little as he got himself into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought he seemed quite the over-grown child as well, and he didn't know how he liked it. He couldn't deny the man was handsome, and he was somehow even attracted to him, but what kind of weird psycho world had he gotten himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryant set Alan down between his legs on the bedspread. His feet in black socks were close behind Alan and his thick, muscular legs surrounded Alan on all sides like walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" said Bryant excitedly. Even his voice sounded childlike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Alan,\" said Alan, adding, \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bryant,\" answered Bryant, apparently very proud of his name. \"Don't worry, Alan. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm here to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan breathed a sigh of relief. The young cop really did just want to help him then. Though, Alan thought, he never should have taken him away from the park bench then. That was where the book was and how was Alan ever going to get back to normal without the book. Alan told the young cop all of this, and Bryant's smile just widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would like to see this book. I guess we'll have to go back and try to find it. I hope it's still there,\" Bryant replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, you're gonna help me get back to normal size?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryant's smile faltered a little. \"Well... I don't know about that, my little friend. I'm gonna help you, yeah. But I don't know about normal size or not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's hopeful expression faded to something between despair and confusion. What did this guy intend to do with him? Were they going to get the book now? What the hell was going on?!</span></div></div>",

He went in the backdoor and stopped to hang up the dogs leash in a mudroom so Alan thought he better jump off before the kid saw him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan quickly hid behind a broom while the boy went through the next door and started yelling \"Dad, I'm home!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked around the mudroom and saw typical items such as cleaning fluids, washer and dryer, and shoes and boots laying on the floor.  He walked over to some huge black boots that tipped over and Alan looked inside one of them.  It smelled of fresh foot odor and was still warm.  He looked at the tag inside and it said \"size 13\".  Wow, Alan thought, these must belong to a big guy.  Alan walked around the boot and looked at the soles which had large rubber lugs with some pebbles embedded in between them.  He wondered how many bugs and leaves and twigs had been crushed under these huge boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Alan was 8 inches tall, he had to be careful not to be seen since hiding was not easy at that size.  Alan heard walking in the kitchen which was right through the door.  He walked up to the door frame and peeked around the corner to check out who was in the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan peeked, he saw a tall, short brown haired, muscular man.

The very hunky man, wearing gray sweat pants, yellow tee shirt with some writing on it, a white backwards ball cap with a \"B\"  on it, and very large athletic shoes, brought Brian a sandwich over to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic book was on the kitchen table Alan saw.

He could see their tight asses press down upon and between the slats on the wooden bench. They were, by his best guess, over 6 feet tall, both dark featured and built. He listened as both giants talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, someone left a book here\u201d the one said closing the book and looking around for the possible owner. \u201cProbably some punk kid\u201d the other replied. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, probably right\u201d he said tossing it to the ground in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dressed in form fitting uniforms and tall black combat style boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy feet are killing me\u201d the one said. I need new insoles for these boots. \u201cDo your feet sweat as bad as mine?\u201d He continued and asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they do and smell something terrible too. I sure do stink up the place when I take them off. In fact maybe I\u2019ll air them out while we eat lunch\u201d he said taking them off and dropping them to the ground. One fell upright, the other fell to its side. The smell poured forth and the light summer breeze carried the scent to my nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuck ! It smelled like something dies in there. Alan could see a size imprint in the shaft of the boot. (14) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer stretched his legs out before him, crossed a the ankle and rested them upon the closed book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, whosever book that is, is not gonna be happy with all your foot stink all over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, well lets see how they like this\u201d he said and began rubbing the book all over with his wet smelly socks.

He at least halfway thought that the cop who had just covered the book in his foot-sweat would, just as he said, cover him in the sweat as well if he tried. Alan assured himself that he was being ridiculous, though. They were cops afterall. Their job was to help people. Right now, they just didn't know that anyone was around to hear and so were letting off steam. Surely, though, if there was anyone who could help him, Alan thought, it was the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan decided to act quickly. At his size, there was no surety that he would even be able to get the cops' attention. He saw only one opportunity. One of the cops was currently barefoot with his feet propped up on Alan's book. Alan was sure he could get the cop's attention if he could just get over and pound on the cop's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he moved. It was a short run to the book where did, in fact, meet a problem. The book was pretty thick, as tall as he was, so Alan had some difficulty pulling himself on top of it. Apart from that, the book stank of the cop's feet, and Alan had a hard time concentrating at the task at hand with that intoxicating aroma filling his nostrils. He made it, though, and ran over to the heel of one of the giant's feet. Without hesitation, Alan starting pounding on the sole while screaming his head off for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--?\" the cop said at once, and lifted his feet as he shifted forward to look down. Alan kept on shouting and flailing his arms even as the cop's feet moved away. He saw immediately that the cop was looking right at him, and in fact, noticed the other cop's eyes also focused on him. Alan couldn't keep the grin off his face as he continued yelling at the giant cops. He was sure he was saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that--?\" the second cop muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little man,\" the first cop finished for him. His hand was already reaching unconsciously down, and he grasped the tiny man between his fingers. Alan immediately stopped yelling and moving his arms, but he could feel his entire body shaking with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the second cop, and Alan saw his eyes wander back down to the book, \"Hey... That book... The title on the front...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second cop was already picking the book back up and paging though it. \"He must have shrunk himself with this,\" the second cop finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" said the first cop, nearly dropping Alan in his excitement, grabbing the book out of his partner's hands. He started looking through it thouroughly and allowed his partner to take the shrunken Alan out of his hand. \"Do you have any idea what we could do with this, Joe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the cop apparently named Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first cop looked up, a grin forming on his lips. \"Whatever we want... Whenever a civilian gets on our nerves, or we run across another punk-ass kid driving drunk at night, or... This is like something I've only dreamed about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's own smile had vanished and he was now looking back and forth from one cop to the other. The one named Joe was not looking incredulous as Alan would have hoped. He was becoming as excited as his partner. That's when Joe looked back down to him and said, \"What about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't let him go, can we?\" said the first cop, his eyes gleaming as the stared down at tiny Alan.</span></div></div>",

Ricco then pulled him out and put him back in the rank sock, placing it in his boot so Alan couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tom, let's hit the showers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two officers finished disrobing and cleaned up, both of them thinking about the poor kid trapped in that sock.  Meanwhile, Alan, who had been slowly reforming, had just about been broken by the experience.  Looking around depressively in the darkness and stench of Ricco's sock, \"They... they didn't even want to help me.  I'm just a thing to them...\"  He raised his newly formed hand to wipe a tear from his eye, \"Why won't they just help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's thoughts, however, were jarred away suddenly as a burst of light hit him, having not noticed the sounds of the locker opening.  Ricco's face peered in over the entrance after checking to make sure the coast was clear, \"So.  Tom and I have been talking and we figure punks like you should be made into an example.  Since this isn't supposed to be a good thing for you, and I have the smelliest feet, Tom agreed I should keep you for a while.  Therefore, I'll be your judge and jury.  I sentence you to a year of being my personal insole and toe-toy.  If you try to escape under any circumstances, your sentence will increase by one year for every attempt.  I hope you liked being my toe-jam during my beat today, because that's what it's going to be like everyday, bug.\"  Tom and Ricco laughed again, and poor Alan simply sat there in the sock, staring up in disbelief at the two officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan finally spoke up, tears nearly in his eyes, \"But... why?  I didn't do anything wrong.  I just wanted to try out shrinking a little.  You... you can't do this!\"  He wiped away a tear, \"I'm still a person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco grinned and raised Alan up to his face, \"No.  You're not now.  You're just a little, pliable toy that can talk.  Luckily for me though, you can talk much in my sock.\"  To drive the point home, Ricco balled his hand around Alan, forcing him into a ball-like state, loosing his ability to talk back, \"See?  You're just a thing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom laughed at this, leaning over to Ricco, \"You know... we haven't been ot the gym in a while.  I know we just took showers, but I'm sure you wouldn't mind starting the poor thing's service.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco's eyes met Tom's and he grinned an evil grin, \"Why the hell not.  It'll help our rightful prisoner find his place at my toes, haha.\"  And despite being balled up, Alan's senses worked fine.  He could see the looks on both of their faces as Ricco looked back down at him, \"Yeah little thing.  You can be my jam again tonight while I work out.\"  If he'd had a face, Alan would've looked horrified.  There was little time for Alan to react before Ricco tossed him back in the sock.  He continued getting dressed, pulling his workout clothes from his locker and slipping them on, moving his wallet, keys, and such into the sweatpants.  He then pulled a pair of black Puma running shoes out and set them on the ground.  Ricco grabbed the sock and slide his right foot in, trapping Alan again as Ricco positioned Alan under his toes again, pressing down hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's prison was already hot again, and he could hear Ricco laughing at him again with Tom over his 'sentence.'  He was infuriated, but there was little he could do as Ricco's weight forced his body between the toes.  His senses were overwhelmed with the smell, feel, and taste of Ricco's size 14 foot.  Before sliding on the shoe, Ricco crossed his leg and leaned in so Alan could hear him clearly, \"Now, this day won't count against your time served since this was initiation.  I hope you like how my feet taste and smell, because like I said, you'll be my living toe jam for the next year.  That'll teach you to mess with things you shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco then slide on the shoe, grinding his toes into the ground and smiling at the raw power of feeling poor Alan oozing around his toes.  He turned to Tom and smiled, \"You know... I know you kinda 'gave' him to me, but you should get one of these too.  I can't tell you how powerful you feel under your foot.\"  Tom laughed and agreed, patting Ricco on the back as they headed out of the locker room to their respective cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could've cried in his form, he would've.  He'd lost all sembalance of form under Ricco's toes, unable to stop the sweat from getting in his mouth, forced to drink it as fast as it came, even the formed lint with it.  He was saturated with the smell, wondering if he'd ever smell normal or even remotely clean again.  He didn't have much time to think between Ricco's steps, the officer making a special effort to make Alan ooze around with each step.  At this point, he covered inbetween all of Ricco's toes, the rest of his body sliding under the sole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco got to his car and started it up, grinning wildly again as he put the gear selector into reverse, looking in his mirrors as he started out of the parking space.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He flashed his membership card to the doorman and quickly headed over to the treadmills, eager to really feel Alan under his toes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was already beginning to break from the experience.  It was pretty obvious to him that he wasn't getting out of this predicament easily, if at all.  He'd already started, willingly to lick up the jam and sweat, rationalizing to himself that it would be the only 'food' he might get while in there.  Just as he started to think that things couldn't get any worse... they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco immediately set the machine for 15mph and started on a 5 mile run.  He let himself relax and braced his arms on the side rails of the machine, letting his mind wonder off as he watched the tv.  Running had always relaxed him before, but the feeling of Alan in his sock was, for him, one of the most relaxing thigns ever, among other feelings at the moment.  For Alan though, it was starting to turn into a literal hell.  Ricco's shoes weren't well ventilated at all, and as the workout continued, the heat stayed put, causing Ricco's feet to sweat much, much more than earlier during the beat.  Alan was literally inundated with sweat as the heat continued to bake him in that sock.  He tried his best not to think about wht was happening to him, to remember even earlier today before he shrank... but he had little success as the sweat and heat continued to build up.  His poor, little body beginning to absorb the sweat like the good little insole and jam that he is.  Alan felt like crying again, but it would've been useless.  His 'eyes' were already covered in sweat and it couldn't have been noticed, not that he ever would be in Ricco's sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco continued his workout, feeling a charge he'd never felt before as his run came to an end.  He hopped off the machine and leaned in on his knees, catching his breath a moment while curling his toes, chuckling slightly as Alan's form oozed around again.  He took a swing from his waterbottle and looked around the gym, hoping to find something else to torture Alan with.  After all, this was 'prison time,' not a vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked down and the malformed man with a grin, \"You look good down there, comfy too.  You're doing your city proud by helping out with the local police force.  You may be a worthless little punk, but you're still making up for it.\"  He chuckles and finishes peeling Alan out from between his toes, watching the poor kid stretch a little before he snaps back to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was excited though, his torture was done for the evening it seemed.  He 'laid' there in half-fear, half-relaxation as Ricco stared him down, watching Alan start to reform into his old self.  Alan was just happy that he was out of Ricco's sock, able to breathe fresh air despite the fact he still positively reeked of Ricco's footsweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco huffed, annoyed slightly that Alan wasn't trying to beg for mercy, somewhat unaware that Alan was simply happy only because he was out from between Ricco's toes.  \"You know, in prison, inmates don't really get much freedom or time.  I'm pretty tired from work and the gym, so tonight I'll just tie you up in the sock.  I might find a more creative place for you later, but that's where you'll stay tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan sighed, a little broken already by the experience.  He simply bowed his head and waited to be picked up; Alan knew there was little point in struggling given his two-inch height.  He actually managed a chuckle though, given the irony of 'height', seeing as he was more flat than tall now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco grabbed Alan and slipped him down the sock, tying off the end and slipping it into the gym-shoes he used earlier.  he sighed in content and laid back on his bed, picking up the phone to call Tom, eager to let him know about the experience.  Alan could barely make out the conversation, but it lasted quite a while.  Alan's poor, little heart sunk when Ricco got to a certain point in the conversation, \"Nah man, he's mine.  I don't plan on ever letting the kid go.  It's not like there's any evidence... the park was empty and I have the book with me.  ...  Sure, you can borrow it.  We'll have to find someone for you too.  My little toe-jam can serve his new life sentence for playing with things he shouldn't have, yours can... hmm.  He can be brought in for questioning... that will never end!  Haha!  Hm?  Yeah.  I'll wear him tomorrow too.  I wasn't joking man, I plan to keep him as my living toe jam.  It feels so good having him down there...\"  The conversation droned on for a while longer, but Alan stopped listening.  He laid down as best he could, sighing, nearly in tears again as he contemplated what exactly Ricco meant.  His life was over; he couldn't go back.  Would anyone miss him?  Would anyone find him?  Would Ricco ever let him go?  He took a deep breath, already somewhat used to Ricco's footsmell, and slowly began to doze off.  Sleep was the only thing that could keep his mind off of this.</span></div></div>",

He jumped up in shock, looking around in amazement as he saw normal-sized trees, plants, people... everything!  He smiled and ran up to one of the people, greeting them, asking the time.  He figured he'd simply passed out and only just now woke up.  The blurry-faced person looked at Alan and murmured something uncomprehensible, and Alan was confused.  He asked again, but receieved the same, jumbled response.  Alan looked around... everything else seemed normal, what was wrong with this one person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything.  Everything was wrong with him.  Alan screamed and woke himself up in the process.  He jumped up and tried to look around in the darkness, taking a few moments to realize he was still tied up in Ricco's sock.  \"It... it was a dream.  I... but... it was so real...\" Alan trailed off.  He felt a rumble and began to see some light as Ricco opened the sock back up, \"Morning jam.  Time for day two.\"  Alan only saw Ricco's face for a moment before the long, now trimmed, toes started to block out the light.  Ricco pulled the sock on tight before finishing getting dressed, taking his time to feel Alan oozing around between his toes, sock, and the cold, hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco found his boots and crossed his right leg over, speaking to the sock, \"So, I hope you're growing to like my feet.  I mean, I know they're everything a foot guy would want - size 14, long toes, slender sole, smell kinda strong.  Even if you don't, like I said yesterday, you're mine to keep.  You better do a good job today keeping my toes comfy and drinking up my sweat.  If I'm not happy at the end of the day, I may just keep you on as a perma-insole.  After all, all justice systems allow for extensions of incarceration.\"  He laughed hard and started to slide his foot in the boot, stomping the sole on the ground before lacing it up tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan listened and sighed.  After yesterday's humiliation, he was already quite a bit broken.  The tears weren't there, the panic was going away.  All he was starting to know was darkness, heat, and Ricco's feet.  He was almost getting used to this, almost enjoying it.  Yes, Alan did have a foot fetish, but this experience, so suddenly, was too much at once.  He did his best to catch his thoughts up as Ricco began walking to work.  His poor little body once again sliding up and in between Ricco's toes, absorbing the sweat.  His mind was filled with the thoughts of last night, but with a new one - What if... if I grow to like this?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicco arrived at the station, his feet sweating profusely.  He wiggled his toes and grined as he felt Alan moving around his right toes.  He began to think to himself, \"Ah.  That little kid makes such a good little sweat absorber.  I'm never going to let him go.\"  He opened the door and walked up to the desk, smiling at the secretary before grabbing his assignment for the day, 'Beat patrol at the mall.'  \"Oh man,\" Ricco thought to himself, \"Eight hours of that?  Fuck.  At least my living toe jam will help me suffer through it.\"  He grabbed the keys to a cruiser and started to get into the patrol car, sighing, \"God I hope this doesn't suck too much.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He found himself stretching out his arms to embrace Jake's huge erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, he didn't struggle to resist. After all, part of the reason he had wanted to shrink in the first place was the tempting prospect of encounters with huge, powerful giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the spell, though, he might have remained stubborn. But, with the spell cast, any vestiges of resolve against obeying his new master disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to embrace Jake's huge cock. He slid his body up and down its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was of impressive length, stretching out twice the size of Alan's current four-inch-tall height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan even entertained doubts that he would be able to obey Jake. He hated to think of the possible consequences of failure, so he renewed his effort with extra zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny man rubbed himself along Jake's aching erection, he felt his own tiny cock stretch and harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, feeling very close, Jake got into the act, moving his hand down and grasping Alan. The giant began to move his hand and tiny Alan along the length of his cock. He released titanic moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's huge hand positioned tiny Alan right in the path of his awesome ejaculation. He came with another strangled cry, and his load hit with a splat against Alan's bare chest and even in the little guy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake fell back, spent, and tiny Alan, the giant fingers unfurling, dropped off onto the sofa cushions. He, too, was exhausted, but his own erection was still straining, unfulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without thinking, Alan began to pull on his tiny cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon heard Jake's loud laughter. \"Oh, did I forget about you, little man?

As Jake insisted, Alan could do nothing to stop himself from telling Jake of his fantasy to be rubbed violently between the giant's giant, sweaty feet, even to the point of crushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake listened to Alan describe the details of his fantasy, a peculiar smile began to form on his face, and an even more peculiar feeling began to form in Alan's stomach as he saw that smile. It was a feeling half of fear and half of excitement. Jake was liking what he was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alan finished, Jake just sat quietly for a moment, apparently thinking over what he just heard. Then, he got the spell book back out and started flipping through the pages. Alan wondered what this could possibly mean, but didn't dare ask. The feeling in his stomach, oddly enough, was turning more and more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Jake suddenly, \"Here's something. I think this is gonna work, my little friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without waiting for a response from Alan (which was good as Alan had become to excited about the possibilities to think about responding), Jake began to read from the book again. As he read off the new spell, another feeling started to form in Alan's stomach, this time queazy and sickening, though it didn't become powerful enough to erase the excitement, and it quickly vanished when Jake finished with the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Excited,\" replied Alan, quite honestly. Jake grinned and scooped the tiny Alan back into his massive hand. Alan's excitement began to quell for the first time as Jake's fingers began closing around him, forcing Alan to bend in ways that simply weren't natural. To Alan's surprise, though, it caused no pain whatsoever, no matter how mashed up or stetched out Jake made him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jake spread his fingers open once more, and Alan quickly reverted to his normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should help. Now, there's no limit to what we can do with you,\" said Jake, and once more, another feeling shot into Alan's stomach, this one of dread for what Jake could possibly mean, but as Jake started removing his socks and set you on top of one of his feet, the feeling left Alan with only the excitement once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my feet are kind of smelly, as per your fantasy, though they aren't as sweaty as you described. I could go for a quick jog first. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought about this quite seriously. He really wanted this, and he wanted it right now. All he wanted was to be rubbed between the giant's massive feet now, whatever their state. Then, Jake added, \"Of course, you'll be wedged between my toes as I run, if you like. That should be an interesting feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought about this hungrily, wanting it, though he didn't know if he wanted it all that badly.

Then, Jake stood, carefully applying the pressure of his weight slowly onto the tiny form beneath his foot. Alan was squeezed slowly and carefully, flattened to the skin.

Furthermore, despite his flattened state, he actually felt his piece hardening as his crotch was positioned perfectly in Jake's arch, so it had a little extra breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pounding of Jake's feet to pavement began, Alan only felt a few moments of nausea before he got used to the feeling and relished the feeling of Jake's hot, stinky sweat pouring across his body.

No, not exactly a tree. The massive plant was a flower, perhaps a daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, looking at the trunk-sized stem and the spacing of massive leaves, Alan dared to hope he could climb the gigantic flower in order to regain access to the spell book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to try!\" Alan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They head to the bench, tired from their walk in the summer heat. Alan looks up as four giant feet come to rest in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Jock had his sneakers tied. One wore a dirty pair of black high top converse chucks, the other a leather high top pair of reebok sneakers, also very dirty and well worn.  All Alan could imagine is being crushed under the giant soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one jock leaned down to set his water bottle on the ground and saw the spell book. He reaches over and picks it up. They flip thru the pages seeing the pages Alan tabbed with an ear mark. \u201cShrinking?\u201d they laughed. \u201cPliability?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Alan knew was that he needed to get help and these two guys are no in possession of the book that is his only hope of returning to normal. Looking over he saw a shoestring dangling from one of each of the jocks sneakers. Now which to choose????? What to do????<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
