You are fairly tall, about 6'2\", so it is really awkward at school with everyone shorter than you, and then, at home, everyone everyone except your younger brothers and youngest sister are taller than you, even your 14 year old sister beats you out by an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to sleep, and you have a weird dream.

I can change the size of anyone I want. However, I have a good number of restrictions on my powers. The other gods don't let me do much. However,  I can give some of my power to other people, as long as at the end of their life I clean everything up. I have decided to give my power to you. You have an awkward life, one of the most awkward I have seen, so I am giving you part of my power. Feel free to do what you want with it. Just don't screw up the universe too badly in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surrounded by a weird light, and once it disappears, you wake up. Hoping maybe it wasn't just a dream, you decide to test it on yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow yourself by a foot. You are now very close to your ceiling, and you can see the furniture around the room changing size, as well as the clothes around the room. You also see things added to your room, like instead of a ceiling fan, you have a desk fan, most likely due to a constant habit of having your head smacked by the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down stairs, and see your mom. She comes up to you, and says, \"So how is my big boy this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback by the fact you can see over your mom's head, as you never could before. \"Uh, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back to drinking her tea, and you...</span></div></div>",

Given it was growing again, your friends cautiously walks back onto a more safe distance, since the moth was getting quite the bit of place. Seeing it started to grow bigger than the buildings, your friends started to grow weary and scared, before their visage started to look neutral again, as it started to be changed into the reality. One of them sighs, visibly not quite happy to see the moth, but without any hint of fear anymore. What actually bothered you was the youngest's reaction: He was bolstering a large smile and was visibly marveled at the sight, confirmed as he exclaims, 'Woah! So cool!'. You couldn't be help but being shocked at his reaction, given you couldn't tell whenever it was because of the moth, or if he noticed that you enlarged the insect with your powers. You were about to ask about that when one of the friends says, 'Billy, are you alright..?'. Out of surprise, you stutter, 'B-but... T-the moth..!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the insect was peacefully basking in the sun, just behind you, meaning you could speak freely, when you feel a change in your mind. For whatever the reasons, a few parts of your memories had blurred out, without being really impactful nor meaningful whatsoever, and, before you could go through your mind, the youngest says, 'I never thought thoses actually existed at that size, given i've only seen them in movies, especially that remake of an old movie.. Err.. What it was..?.. Oh yeah! \"Mothra returns\"!'. You thought said movie would be actually called 'Godzilla returns', but rather than to point out mere details, you prefer to disregard it. Then, one of the other boys says, 'Of course they do. It's just that the huge ones are pretty rare, at least, near cities. I wonder why this one's here though. There's not a lot of flowers for him to feed off. At least, not of the huge ones. Insects sure loves thoses ones.'. Giant flowers!? Although, in a sense, it does make sense, given the moth has to feed somehow.. Then, one of the boys add, 'I wonder if this moth actually befriended someone. I heard thoses would managed to befriended one of thoses were considered as being among the luckiest. But then, even smaller insects makes fine pets too! I might even have a slug if i work well at the school.'. You couldn't be helped but blinking. 'Wouldn't it be better to have a cat or a dog instead..?'. The comment caused your friends to go into an awkward silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally break up the silence by implying, 'You're sure that you didn't felt off your bed..?', 'Why?', 'Because we never heard of 'cats' and 'dogs'.

You could even tell that it was a female despite your lack of knowledge, at least, from before the change. And that she wanted you to ride her, seemingly.<br>\r\nYour friends, out of shock, yells, 'WOAH! SO COOL!'. You ask, 'Why she's doing that..?', 'Why are you playing dumb?', 'Why..?', 'You told us that you met her years ago.', 'That's why Billy's garden's so big?', 'Yeah. And if she's here, it means it worked?'' You ask, 'What worked..?', 'The plantation! Which try it was..?', 'Fourth!'. Something tilts in your head as you sudden had the feeling that you should head back at home with the moth. As such, you say, 'It was certainly nice to see you guys again, but then, i need to leave.', 'Yeah, don't worry! We'll tell the teachers'. You smile, and, without the need to say anything, the moth lowers herself so you could actually ride her. 'Don't forget that tomorrow, we do our homework together, okay?', 'Oh.. Hum.. Y-yeah! Sure..!'. What they says surprise you, making a solitary tear running onto your cheek, 'Don't, change Billy.. Okay?'. Then, before you could actually add anything, the moth flies away with you, while your friends waves toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight to your home was pretty much uneventful, but when you actually have it in sight, you notice that, while your home was the same as before, the garden is as big as a small park, thanks to the towering tree-flower. It's trunk is roughly as wide as the wingspan of the moth, 300ft, its height turning around 2000 ft, and its flower being 1600 ft wide. The moth let you go down onto the ground before it flies onto the tree-flower, leaving you the time to go into your room so you could get your computer. On your way there,  you notice some family photoes, especially one of them that caught your attention. On it, you see yourself, your parents, your brothers and sisters, your moth friend and a brown spider, roughly dog-sized. You wonder why she wouldn't be a dog without knowing why and shrug it off, given there was a few things you wanted to know. You lead outside and start to do some research on internet when you feel moth going down and laying on the ground behind you. You wiggle your body and make yourself comfortable on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, cats and dogs didn't existed anymore, so did most non-insect furred mammals, excluding predators, remplaced by more insects, some having gotten bigger over time. Birds weren't existing either, changed into their feathered arthropod counterparts. On the other hand, reptiles and amphibians, such as frogs, snakes, and crocodiles, were untouched, and same for the aquatic wildlife, if you exclude the fact that there is plenty more of aquatic insects living in the lakes, rivers, and oceans.<br>\r\nFor food, the eggs, milk and meat mostly came from insects, with supplements from the aquatic wildlife, such as fish. Funnily enough, and even then human regularly eat insect meat, eating bug-class insects, thoses who were still at their normal size, is still considered as being gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you search more information on the oversized moth. It turns out that, not only moths can get into the kaiju, or titan, class size, more or less the gigantic insects. Even if, statistically wise, the kaiju-class moths are more prolific and bigger on average than the other kaiju-class insects. It also seems that all kaiju-class insects have the possibility of making special bonds with other living beings, including humans, and excluding other kaiju-class insects.<br>\r\nIn your case, you had first met the moth when she was still in her coccoon, when you were only 9-years old. You were always curious about why some of the insects would change so much, and, as such,  tried to understand why, by actually trying to wishstand the situation and finding them. One day, you had found her, and, out of curiosity, you touched the silky protection. Apparently, you had fainted out afterwise, and that, when you were rescued and woke up, the newly hatched insect was already guarding you. Since then, you were like the best buddies in the world, until your family moved out for a more properly suited home for the whole family. Thankfully, you and your family could have sold the silk, being not needed nor used anymore. Unlike regular silk, or even its higher quality counterpart, the silk from the kaiju-class ones was highly prized, selling even more than gold! As such, your family could their new property with ease, including their home and garden. The only problem was that, to allow the moth to live with you, it would need at least one tree-flower nearby in town, and, given the conditions to actually grow and keep one alive, you couldn't pass all the time you wanted with your friend and familiar, until now.<br>\r\nLastly, the rest of what you wanted to gather was about your moth friend. As she started at a wingspan size of 120 ft, she grew with you as you did, meaning she'd reach, in thoery, 400 ft within 5 years, before she'd reach her mature size. Also, there was a name. The moth's name is \"Xialamelya\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you feel like all you wanted to know, you want to try that bond, without undoing your work. So, you try to shrink down the tree-flower, but feel a resistance as you do. You blink and notice what actually occured: Rather than to size the size of the tree-flower, another one, around 60% as tall as the present one, had sprouted in the garden! Also, two things were different.. Xialamelya had a family herself, and the bond you shared with her had been reinforced. Knowing that, you decide to..</span></div></div>",

Most of it was gotten back, but some of it somehow ended up into the drinks of the girls nearby. Scientists brings up some kind of graphic that would should what would be the potential effects of said unknown substance. Strangely enough, some of it had also leaked into the earth, and from their estimations, it would cause the earth to grow as well, which would more or less make the planet five time as big. Almost like it was mean to allow giga giantesses to live well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe the unit that was used, given it went up to two digits.. [i]*of miles*![/i] for the girls, and soon after, you could feel another stomping.. But much stronger than before. All the present girls were growing taller before you, quickly getting past the mile milestone, while they knelt down, grinning and giggling as they see the town getting smaller and smaller, all of it, while leaving humongous craters. Soon, though, their pretty quick and sudden growth came to an end. And by what you could tell, they were around 25 and 80 miles tall. But given even the smallest of the girl's feet were over 5 miles long, even the town looked like but a mere speck to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you snap of your staring of the colossal girls as you remember that they said that the earth grew as well, meaning there would be potentially structural damage to all the surroundings buildings. But, to your surprise, there were.. Seemingly only minimal damages left. And, given how it looks, it felt like they were expecting it as most of the city had gone under major repairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news were still being broadcasting as you see what looked like a huge..  Temple? It was hard to tell given the angle.. That they says it is their new home, so the newly grown giantesses doesn't try to bring destruction to the planet. Then, they also said they settled up a communication line, so people could actually acts with them. And, given you knew the girls, you rush at your home, hoping you could actually inquire from them how they were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven some of the girls were your sisters, your home had been furnished with a special access to their line.

You also decide that you woudn't grow yet, given you doubt that you would be able to dodge the statue if you were bigger. You walk off, toward the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the place is actually some kind of large park, with fountains, benches, patches of grass, flowers and tree. There is even some birds that were chirping! But, surprisingly enough, it was empty of human presence. Only a few stands could be found around. You understand quickly enough, afterwise, as you spot a large signboard. A date is on it, seemingly for 2 weeks later. It says, 'Commemoration of the kaiju exposition! For all the family, small and big! And maybe you will be able to reveal the kaiju that is within you! More information at the town hall.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue on your way when you notice representations, made of tiles, of kaijus and monsters, most in situations where they are shown as good and/or gentle. The  rest, shown as evil, are represented being beaten. The most surprising, though, is a representation of a pink-scaled godzilla, wearing a bikini that support a nice pair of breasts. You couldn't be helped but smirk at it, given she was doing a V-shaped symbol with her fingers as a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that there isn't anyone or anything around that you could damage and/or harm, you decide grow up. After all, the girl is nowhere in sight and there is still a long way to the manor. You focus your powers onto yourself, after you relax yourself, given you weren't in a rush. As you grow up, you close your eyes, not really bothering to watch the changes, given you didn't wanted to change things, nor to bother with what wouldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach a size of 9500 ft, you stop your growth and peer around the town. While no buildings would be even close to the manor's size, even if you compared the manor to a house, you notice that some of the buildings are bigger than they should, making you wondering if you didn't made more things bigger because of your mishap. Regardless, you decide to shrug it off, given you goal is the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally make it to what seem to be the main entrance of the manor, at least, from what you can see. The walls and pillar, while still pink, weren't of an overly aggressive shade. More implying to soothe people, rather than to be a girl's whim.<br>\r\nYou move toward the large double wooden,  and as you stand in front of them, you were about to knock at the doors, when they open up on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery cautiously, you step in the manor, to check if anyone was behind. No one. And far from reassuring you, it actually scares you, given you have no idea of what would occur. But, given what you wanted to know, you decide to steel your nerves and peer around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looks like a large main hall, with a huge stair, made of marble, standing in the room, leading to an upper floor. More doors can be seen around the floor you currently stand, leading to unknown locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo statues stands in the room. One on the left, and one on the right. The statue on the right represents Godzilla, oversized compared to its 'normal' size, but still smaller than you. The thing that bothers you about it, though, is its sheer amount of details and realism. You'd swear it could suddenly move, or jump and fight.<br>\r\nThe statue on the left also represents Godzilla, but with a scaled pink skin, looking strangely similar to the one you saw back in the park. Weirder even, the statue looks like some kind of plush.<br>\r\nThe statue/plush bolsters a black bikini, supporting a healthy pair of D-cup breasts, a slightly chubby belly, as well as a large backside, on which stands a thick, heavy and long tail. The tail is as thick as the chest, and longer than the whole body. You could also swear it looks like more an anthropomorphic hybrid than a dinosaur, given its arms looks like one of a human, while her legs, looking more reptilian and digitigrade in shape, are long and thin, much like an atheltic female human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to explore the rest of the manor, when you felt compelled by the statue/plush. Disregarding common sense, you walk toward it, when you notice a post-it on it, saying, 'Big Sis!'. <br>\r\nA peer to its back reveals a zip, implying that the statue/plush is actually a costume, maybe for cosplay? But then, why it is as tall as you? It wouldn't fit the girl. You feel like you should wear the costume, but prefer to ignore that, given you have no idea of what would occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to resume your exploration, when you hear the voice of a girl. Turning around, you notice that it was the girl that you had grown previously. Given you didn't hear what she said, you had no idea of what she meant. But before you can do anything, the girl says, 'What are you going to do?'. The question is odd, given you entered in, probably without authorization, yet, you thought of the costume standing behind you. Feeling an urge even stronger than before to wear it, you turn back, and unzip it, so you can wear it. Surprisingly, you smoothly wear, when you heard a zipping sound, while the post-it disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your hands on your back, trying to unzip the costume, when you feel a warm wave going through your body. The costume started to feel tight, as.. Your feeling started to shift. Starting with the hands, you idly rub then, and shiver. You could feel the rub, like the scaled skin was your own! The feeling spreads over your whole body, causing you to feel a weight dragging you down when it hit the breasts and tail, a temporary hearing loss when it hit the head, and makes you fall down when it struck the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, some kind of powers goes in your veins, causing your heart to beat frantically, and you to breath heavily. Your body, now being the pink anthro dinosaur, grows up, until you reach a size of 13000 ft. An impressive growth on its own, but a mere inches gain from your size. After your heart calms down, you manage to stand up, noticing that the previously heavy tail was now like part of you, as nimble as your body, despite its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had been watching all along, and she was now crying. And, when you stood up at your new size, she ran toward you, jumping on you, and hugging you as tightly as she could. She whimpers, 'Big sis! You're finally back..'. At first, you blink, and remain still, shocked. But, eventually, you end up hugging the little girl back, not wanting her to remain sad. You even gently rub her head and says, 'Don't worry..'. The girl's cry wear off and get slowly remplaced by a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl say, 'Hey. Big sis.. Will you remain like that?'. 'What do you mean..?'. 'I know that you can.. Undo the change..but you won't, right? Even if i would accept it if you would.. I-i could always try to make more friends..'. You sigh, then you say..</span></div></div>",

When you opened your eyes, the entire world had changed, a poster hung on the wall \"New York Giants crushed by ruler.\" Your sole though was a string of profanities in trying to curse understanding from the situation. Gazing around, everything had become darker and gloomy, even people's dressing. It was like the world was in a depression with no end. Everybody in sight was barefoot and in rags, the best dress had jeans torn at the knees and patched everywhere else. Stepping forward on a piece of broken glass, you found yourself in the same dress as you bounced up and down holding the cut foot. When your hands came away, they were coated in black dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around, you found Andy, at least part of him. Far in the distance, you saw pink flesh stretch for miles and never seem to end. It curved in and then came out to continue again. For a second, you thought it was his hand, but then it picked up to reveal it went on for  hundreds of miles, holding five mountaints attatched to an enormous one.

As much as you wanted, no . . . as much as you NEEDED to fix this, you couldn't do so without first knowing more about this world. You could easily make things worse before they got better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the city to get a better look at the situation was your first priority.   You managed to 'borrow' a dirt bike to ride to the city's edge, only a few one story houses now blocking your view of the titanic teenager that dominates most of the sky.  Even while he sat there, motionless, his scraggly hair half hidden from view by clouds as they whisped past him, either inhaled by his breath or caused by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice cracked as you tried calling up to him, the name on the tip of your tongue  . . . damn.  His name was already lost to you as your memories re-knit themselves.  You can only remember him as your god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scarcely mattered now though.  You revved the bike and drove closer yet, maneuvering around the 'danger' signs that marked the road you'd chosen as destroyed by the giant.  Within a few more miles, the road had ceased to exist.  A single crater of a footprint, hundreds of feet deep blocked your path now. Half buried cars, crushed like aluminum foil under his tread, were barely visible, intermingled with pulverized stone from the remnants of the road.  Undeterred, you drove the bike down into the crater and across the footprint, emerging on the other side with a soft gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot had shifted, those five enormous pink toes now filling the horizon before you, the ground soft and squishy under your feet from the constant presence and pressure of the miles tall giant looming overhead.  That's when you realized he was looking right at you, despite the fact that you were so small in comparison you may as well have been a flea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Apparently you people don't get the 'stay out of my land' rule still.  There's a GOOD reason I demolished all those roads.\"  The god-boy lurched to his feet suddenly, the ground beneath you rippling like a wave under the change in pressure, knocking you from your bike as you looked straight up at the dozens of miles of clothes-free teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed the lump in your throat, your head spinning as he leered down at you, his open palm filling more of your vision as he reached towards you and your overturned ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was it he destroyed all those roads again?</span></div></div>",

You remember now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n\"Billy? What are you doing here?\" Andy asks you with an odd mix of fear and happiness plastered on his face. You are both seven years old.<br>\r\n\"Andy, can you come play yet? I haven't played soccer in a long time.\" You smile at your innocence at the time.  This was the year things went sour for the entire world. Andy was once a normal kid. If anything, he was a little on the short side for his age, while you towered over all the other kids. <br>\r\n\"Sorry Billy,\" Andy answered with a pout. \"Mommy says I can't because the doctor said so. He said I have to stay inside until they can make me all better again.\" Billy crosses his arms with a huff. It wasn't fair you thought at the time. Nothing looked wrong with Andy. he looked healthy.<br>\r\n\"But why?\" you whine. Andy looks down. His body begins to tremble. you remember feeling a little scared. Andy looks back up at you. You might have thought you were seeing things at the time, but now you knew better; Andy was growing right before your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Billy,\" Andy begins while you stand frozen in fear, \"can you keep a secret?\" You nod your head enthusiastically. Andy smiles a bit before you trembles again, growing ever so much faster. \"The doctor says I'm very special. He says I'm gonna be real big someday like, a gajilllion feet high. But...\" Andy begins to grow even faster. You remember a sense of fear flowing throughout your body as you see your best friend's clothes tear off his expanding body. \"...I don't wanna be big.\"<br>\r\nAndy looks down at you. DOWN at you. A look of realization spreads across his face. That's when it goes black.<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\nYou are brought back to the present . You look around you and see only a flesh color all around you.<br>\r\n\"...and you people insist oncoming to see me! Leave me alone! It's for your own good!\" You can sense the sadness in his voice. You can hear how hard he is trying to mask it with a sound of anger, but he fails miserably. He begins to set you down, when you start to wave your arms wildly. In this reality, Andy was your best friend. And you'll be damned if you leave your best friend when he needs a shoulder to lean on... metaphorically of course. <br>\r\n\"WAIT! Andy! Look at my face! It's me, Billy! Wait! I need to talk to you!!!!!\" You try desperately to get his attention. He almost doesn't see your miniscule movements. Luckily for you, however, he does. He looks confused, but he brings his face closer to yours. You can feel his hot breath on your body. It's so powerful, you almost fall down. He notices this, and elongates his breaths, so as to hold more air for longer periods of time. He studies you with the most intense eyes. You keep still, as to allow him to get a good look at you. His eyes squint, but then widen, is if he realized something. He opens his mouth and speaks in an oddly quiet voice.<br>\r\n\"...Billy... is that you....\" he asks in a shaky voice, as if he was afraid of being told no.<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes Andy it's me! You're best friend\" You feel the tears running down your face, but you don't care. You have reunited with your best friend, who everyone else labeled as an angry, bloodthirsty god. He tilts his head and cups a hand to his ear. 'oh, right,' you think to yourself. 'I'm to small for him to hear me.'<br>\r\n\"Billy...if that is you... could you run to the right? Your right, not mine!\" You begin to laugh. You sprint as well as you can to the right of the hand of the massive giant teenager, who you note is beginning to shake. You look up into the face of the young giant, who has tears running down his face. <br>\r\n\"It is you Billy! It is you!\" He's full on sobbing now. you wish you could hug him or comfort him. Your friend is broken and it's all your fault. He lifts you up to his face and \"hugs\" you (or press you to his giant cheek, either one works). He falls to his knees, destroying more of the crumbling street. <br>\r\n\"Billy. I missed you so much.\" he continues to sob. You can feel the water works too, as tears roll down your face. He pulls you away from his face, laughing shakily. \"Wait, let me take you to the radio tower. They have a speaker there that is loud enough for me to hear. It's... err...abandoned now, so you shouldn't have trouble finding the intercom. Come one. I'll be extra safe with you, i promise.\"<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n\"Andy, I missed you!\" You speak into the microphone. You found it easy enough, and it was still in working order. Andy's eye fills the window in front of you. It's watering, as if he's still crying.<br>\r\n\"I missed you too little guy. I missed you too.\" You and Andy had been repeating that same phrase for at least five minutes. You can feel the vibrations run through the building. \"Wait, why are you here? I told everyone to leave. It isn't safe around me anymore...\" you can feel the sadness in his voice. Like, you can actually feel it. The vibrations were actually running through your body. You lean into the microphone.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see my best friend.\" He starts to cry again. The building shakes gently with him.<br>\r\n\"...I'm still you best friend?\" You smile.<br>\r\n\"Forever and always dude.\"<br>\r\n\"...Even though I can kill you with a sneeze...?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, you'd be my best friend if you grew another head, too.\" He laughs. You laugh. Pretty soon, you're both on the floor laughing. Andy leans back to fill the window.<br>\r\n\"I'd hug you if you weren't so small.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd hug you if you weren't so big. But, we'll settle for smothering my body against your cheek. A laugh escapes Andy. He turns solemn soon after.<br>\r\n\"But... isn't it dangerous to be around me? Shouldn't you be far away from me? I'm sure all the people are afraid of their so-called 'god of wrath.'\" You can sense the anger in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Andy, living in a stable house is dangerous. And i have no problem living in one of those.  Now, if you're trying to get me to leave, I will. But if you want me to stay, I'll do that too. Take your pick.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were about 20 three mile high siblings.  The athletes themselves were huge, the guys at 8 miles, and most of the girls were at 6 miles tall.  Andy went to take a step and you realized how colossal he was.  When his foot came down the earth shook, and bigger 100 ft wide sweat globs rained down.  These globs were almost half the size of the football field and landed in the nearby streets, flooding them.  Of course you could barely tell Andy's footfalls amongst the earthquakes caused by the massive team.  It was practice time, and many atheletes were running \"laps\".  You saw Dave, the team co-captain run up, breaking the sound barrier, and kick a soccer ball that was now about 3000 ft tall.  His kick caused a shockwave that blew out all the nearby windows.  A massive goal was built up near your school.  The poles of the goal easily dwarfed the school.  The soccer ball flew through the air and hit the the ground just short of the goal, causing cracks to form in the streets.  The ball, rolled through the abandoned town, flattening all buildings in its path. One of your friends Jen was guarding the goal, and dived to block the ball.  She caught the enormous ball using her 2500 feet long hands.  She landed with a big BOOM on your school and many surrounding city blocks.

Somehow she noticed you and thundered BILLY, THERE YOU ARE, COME JOIN THE TEAM WE'RE PRACTICING FOR THE \"BIG\" GAME!!!  At that you rose past her ankles, her chest, her breasts, until you soared up way past the expected height, she only came to your crotch.  GUYS OUR CAPTAIN HAS ARRIVED! Jen boomed.  Everyone was excited, but you wanted make this interesting.  The team had destroyed the city, there were gaping holes from their cleats and many flooded streets from sweat.

By sheer accident, they created a virus which would cause the reduction in size of any who contracted it. The disease attacked genes that regulated cell sizes and the base form of cells altogether. Some people however were completely immune and could only carry it, midgets and the shorter people. Anyone born normal was safe until puberty, then they were fair game. Born to a carrier an not immune, you'd be tiny one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaws were enacted that any carriers walk around in isolation suits. The virus lived only minutes beyond their body and spread by touch. So long as they didn't touch people, the disease would not spread and eventually, die out. For a great while, this plan worked, until modern times. The 'big people' teased the shrimps, not everyone but a few. Some got angry and started to take their vengance until it became common place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour team had all teased Rick, until on one occasion he couldn't take it and got his revenge. He enjoyed the next days and weeks, watching his tall friends dwindle in size until they could not even see beyond his toes, until a single muscle was miles of it. Your homes and things grew into miles as did your 'little' siblings, who got their fair deal of pay backs too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe law in the end stated that Rick would have to keep watch of you and that he would have to move to an isolation city, no longer capable of being trusted around normal people. That is where you all were now and why he wasn't in an isolation suit. Welcome to life where even a little kids 100 miles tall.</span></div></div>",

Dinner is coming soon.\" \"Okay mom.\" You take off your shoes and go to your room to change one's clothes. You go into your room and notice that it has changed again. Your bed and your desk got bigger. In addition, the order is larger than usual. As soon as you open your closet you will discover the reason for this. You have significantly less clothes now. At least you will find a clean clothes faster. You change you clothes and fall down on your bed. You only have one white shirt and one black shorts. You comfortably reach for the bed and wiggle your toes. Your youngest brother comes into your room. He was always your favorite brother. \"Are you playing with me?\" He asks. \"After dinner, maybe.\" You answer lazily. He walks over to the edge of the bed and starts shaking your foot gently. \"Promise me. Please.\" You're not paying attention to him. Then he suddenly topped the edge of the bed. He holds one of your feet in his lap and begins to tickle heavily. \"HAHAHHAHAHA Stop it! Stop !!\" You sit up and try to get your foot off from him but he won't let you. You're not trying harder because you don't want to kick your brother. \"All right, you won.\" He grins with satisfaction and stops your torture. \"Ahhhhhhh.\" You sigh in relief. \"You always get what you want.\" As you look at it, you notice how comically the situation is. Your 4'3 tall baby brother holds your size 22 foot in his lap. \"You are very willful of how small you are.\" You say funny. \"I'm not small.\" He is against it. \"Sitting like this you're just barely bigger than my foot.\" You say as you increase your feet by 2 inches. \"I'm not small but you are too big.\" Cut back. He jump off the bed and run out of the room. After a few minutes you get up and go into the kitchen for dinner. Your huge barefoot clicks on the floor. You look around the kitchen and you see everyone is sitting at the table. You sit down and start eating. Your little brother is constantly watching you. Waiting for you to finish. As soon as you finish eating, he jumps up, grabs your hand and pulls you into his room. \"No escape.\" You think to yourself. You play a dozen different games together. Your brother really enjoys spending time with you. \"It's been enough by now. It's time to go for a bath.\" \"We couldn't go together.\" He asks you. \"I can't even stand alone in the tub.\" You're upset. \"Let's try it.\" Then you pick him up and go to the bathroom. You like your brother but what would your siblings or friends think about you if they find out you still bathe with your little brother. That's why you grow a little and sit in the bathtub with clothes. You can only get there if you completely kick one leg out of it. \"You see. I'm sorry but you have to bathe alone. \"He doesn't like it but accepted it. For you, bathing is unusually complicated. First you sit in the tub. Then you put your right foot on the floor beside the tub and wash yourself. Then you turn around to put your left leg out of the tub and wash your right leg.  For some reason, you find it very funny. When you're done you go back to your room. You lie comfortably on the bed with your new 7'10 full height. You close your eyes slowly and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Then you sit comfortably on the sofa and put your feet on the coffee table. You start watching TV. Your youngest brother Will comes into the living room. \"Can I watch a cartoon?\" He asks you. \"Now? What do you want to watch?\" You ask. \"I don't know, I'm just bored.

You think Will deserves to play. But Sam, though only 12 years old, is 6'3 tall. That's why Will really isn't a good opponent for him. \"But I can help with that.\" You think to yourself. You focus on Will and you start to make him taller. Your 7 and a half year old brother will instantly be 5'6 tall. \"I don't think you are small, in fact you are very big compared to your age. You play with Sam.\" \"Yes. You're right. Thanks super big brother.\" Will runs out into the back garden. \"Then I can continue the movie.\" Then your older sister comes home and stumbles into your huge shoe. \"Why can't you put these shoes on properly? Everyone stumbles upon them!\" She exclaims angrily. \"Sorry but they are by the wall. I can't put them any better. Look in front of your feet.\" \"So just because you're huge, do I have to avoid your huge and stinky shoes?\" \"First, my shoes don't smell. My feet don't sweat like yours. Secondly, you better get used to it now because I'm still growing and my feet are just getting bigger.\" \"That's good. If your feet get bigger then we certainly won't pay a lot of money for bigger shoes and you can walk barefoot.\" Your sister wants to cross your shoes when you raise yourself to 8'3. Your shoes adjust to your larger foot size so your sister stumbles again. \"I hate your feet so much!\" Then she goes up to her room. You giggle with satisfaction. You will notice that your feet are hanging from the coffee table. \"And I was right. I grew up again. And my sister was wrong. I still have shoes.\" When the movie is over, you turn off the TV and get up. Your head is only a few inches from the ceiling. \"Looks like I have to be careful not to hit my head.\" \"Your head will soon reach the ceiling.\" Cheered Sam, who had just entered the room. He's very sweaty. His light brown hair holds a braid but a few strands adhere to his face. \"I see you play a lot.\" You say with satisfaction. \"Will is young but good to practice with him. I have to practice a lot if I want to be a famous basketball player. You would be a good basketball player too.\" \"You know I don't care about basketball.\" \"But at least you're very tall. It's great that you are my brother. I can't wait to see how big you are. I'm going to bring water to Will now.\" Then he went into the kitchen. When he came out he was 6'6 tall. \"Good practice for you.\" You cry after him. \"Thanks super big brother!\" And he went out into the garden. \"Sam's got some fetish. But it's only good for my brothers to like me. And if Sam likes my height, I can easily give him more in the future. But now it's time for lunch.\" You eat alone in the dining room. Your siblings are not hungry yet and your parents are working until night. When you're done you'll be surprised how much you ate. \"There was a lot of empty space in my stomach but I was able to fill it.\" You go out into the garden and sit under the big cherry tree. You lean your back against the tree trunk and continue reading one of your favorite books. You like to read after lunch in the summer. You're reading for a couple of hours. Then your brothers come back from lunch and go to you. \"The weather has become very hot now.\" Sam says. \"It's a pity we don't have a pool.\" You say. \"But my feet don't sweat even now. My sister could smell them now. Unlike her feet, mine wouldn't smell.\" You say it when you remember your morning conversation. \"What?\" Sam is surprised. \"Vivien said in the morning that my shoes stink. Which is impossible.\" Then Will kneels and smells your feet. \"I don't smell anything.\" He says. \"Anyway, we just wanted to ask what are you doing this afternoon?\" Sam asks.</span></div></div>",

But then Sam would be happy.<br>\r\nMaybe I'll just try it and if it's not good I'll do it back. \"You go out into the garden and start growing. Your head is getting higher and higher.

Will is the size of an average tall man, but now his head is barely touching your navel. \"Billy you still play with us? Will asks. \"I just came out stretching. There is not enough room in the house for this. \"Certainly our parents didn't think when they bought this house that one of their boys at 15 would be 9 feet tall. You're the tallest person ever and you're only 15 years old. By the end of puberty, you could be a lot taller! Maybe I'll just barely reach your navel.\" Imagine Sam.\" By the time you grow up.

I like to be tall and I hope to grow a lot but I'm even more pleased that my brother is a giant. \"He said as he hugged your waist.<br>\r\nNow your brothers seemed to like you even more. \"I wonder what my sisters think about me.\" You think to yourself. You say goodbye to your brothers and you go into the house. You are stooping down because you were one head taller than the ceiling. Your gigantic barefoot barely fits on the steps, with two-thirds of your feet hanging down from it. You want to go into your older little sister's Lucy room, but her door is gone. Then you look into your room and you find out why. The two rooms have been converted into one. You need the space for your huge bed and a desk designed for your size. The floor is now covered with carpet. You are sure to be able to sit or lie down comfortably on the floor if you are no longer able to stand. It turned out that Vivien and Lucy had the same room. \"The girls certainly don't like me.\" And you were right. Vivien was still angry with you about the shoe incident. And Lucy was just indifferent to you.<br>\r\n\"Because of my size, my two brothers love me and my two sisters don't like me. That means ...\"</span></div></div>",

She grabs a bottle from the fridge and serves you a glass then says, 'Be good, you want?', with a smile, before she heads to her own business. You drink the orange juice then go to Lily's chamber with an idea in your mind. Once there, as expected, you see plenty of costumes. She sure loves thoses, with a preference to mythical creatures, insects and dinosaurs. You know that Lily wanted to grow, but wanted to do it differently, by growing her belongings, which would very likely affect her. Also, when you spotted a fairy costume, you wondered what would occur if you animated them.</span></div></div>",

As they reaches roughly 10 ft tall, they get off the pool, to discuss like nothing occurred, progressively walking outside the property as they shoot up in size, with, seemingly, no visible changes to the surroundings.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to grow the lizard, poked by two girls, but at a careful pace. That way, you would be able to revert the growth if anything goes wrong, you would see the changes at a tranquil pace and you would be able to focus onto more things if you wanted to, like all the lizards, potentially.<br>\r\nSlowly, you make the poked lizard grow, but, at first, doesn't do anything aside from the fact it was causing the girls to walk backward, only so they could poke it from a safe distance. It's only when the lizard had grown to the size of a dog that you start to notice that things were changing. The girls drop their sticks and starts to rub the lizard, who went from anger to a seeming pleasure as it closes its eyes, letting even a hearable happy murring. Continuing to grow it, the girls would also ride it when it was the size of a horse, all that while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it goes further on, you notice that, while there is less and less people traveling by, some cracks and holes that looked like the lizard's feet appeared around. A loud growl could even be heard, given that, as its size went up, so did its hunger. Thankfully, under the innocent watch of the girls, you were in no danger whatsoever. And yet.. You had no idea of what would occur at you grow the scaled beast further on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lizard's length reaches 150ft, it's like it had disappeared with the girls, before you are forced to close your eyes as the light suddenly went harsh, or so you think. When you could see again, you are greeted by the girls, while looking strangely different..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamellia, the 16-years girl, has become a 150 ft green anthropomorphic lizard. Wearing a white t-shit on which is written 'Motherly dragon ahead~', as well as an awfully short skirt, given it would hardly conceal her pink panties, she stands onto a digitigrade stance, barefooted, thanks to her new body. Alice, 14-years old, is her little sister. Being a human-lizard hybrid standing at 130 ft tall, she only wears a teal bikini. And while most of her skin is human, some patch of scales could be found here and here on her body, as well as a scaled white underbelly. <br>\r\nMuch like her big sister, her hands and toes bolsters small claws, while onto their backside stands long tails, both dragging onto the ground. You also notice that they have an equally sharp dentition as they gently smiles toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the previously grown lizard had shrunk down to its normal size and climbs your body so it would actually be able to lay onto your head, causing you to have a flashback. You and the girls were younger, about 10 years younger, you think back then. Loud whimpering could be heard, so, out of curiosity, you follow the sound trail. Turns out it were coming from the girls, as their lizard beings, if you exclude the fact that they were only 30ft and 26 ft tall. Both girls were sitting onto the grass, while Camellia tried to soothe her sobering sister. You inquire, 'Are you alright, girls?'. In answer, Alice yells, 'We're not size freaks..!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around them, noticing that Camellia, trying to look tough, was crying too. As such, you placed yourself between the girls and said, 'Dry your tears, girls. Big Brother's here!'. It had an impact given the girls' cries had weakened up. 'Y-you won't make fun of us..?'. You grinned, 'Why i'd make cute girls like you crying? Besides.. I'll protect you!'. Both girls giggles, then Camellia said, jokingly, 'What a cute little doll!'. You blush at the comment, before a lizard climbs on your head, making you grumble. More giggles could be heard from the girls, as Alice added, 'Sunny on lil'bro!'. You sighed, then grinned again. Little you knew, back then, but you had unofficially had became their brother, with your new pet lizard, 'Sunny'. Since then, your family and the sisters' had acknowledge each others, entertaining friendly relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flashback end, knowing that 'Sunny' stands onto your head, the girls says, 'You're coming, little brother?'. 'Yeah, pick me up, okay?'. <br>\r\nFrom there, you ponder what you could do. You could just tag along, eventually inviting some of your brothers and sisters, eventually messing their size and Sunny's up. Or you could shrink them. Although, you had the feeling that if you tried to shrink them directly, it would undo their transformation.</span></div></div>",

Only the speedy ascent of the hover-thing had kept you from being caught on the dirty mass of sweat that made up the creature's foot. Still over it, you looked up along his whole body to see him looking all around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is my counter-part?\" the giant asked Tom, and then, realizing it was your room he occupied changed the subject, \"never mind, up for  wrestle buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't good, you were still an eternity from safety, the formerly nano-scopic feet still blocked your path, in the past twenty minutes, you'd made it across the left foot and now occupied the miles between the feet. Luckily for you, the giant twitched his foot just a bit, it created a wind so strong it would have made hurricanes look like average winds. The result hurtled you across the cap, nearly hitting the enormous right, big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch lower now, you looked up at the enormous grooves filling the skin, the things that made finger and foot prints. They were HUGE! Easily deep enough to hold a sky-scraper that was one thing for sure. Slowly you cranned your neck up at the sheer height of the five mountains called toes, trying to imagine yourself from this view. Within minutes, the craft was upward and over the first gap between the mountains, below you saw a boulder that had to be at least a mile tall, mud, dirt and yuck. Briefly, you bent over and found your feet to be in a similar status anyway.</span></div></div>",

Minutes ago of course he would simply have wiggled his toes and that would have been the end of the match, but the adversary was as big as you had been. \"Outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" the giant said, stepping up and capturing you for just a second. You were on the huge foot and then went flying as the step went forward. For a few seconds you flew over you clothes, big enough that your socks would easily cover all of New York city and likely crush it. After that, your path continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's \"little\" feet were right in your path. They were long enough to crush a city with ease at nearly 6 miles where before they had barely been close to 7 inches. On your approach you could see the spot of dirt left from stepping on them. To him though, your feet were truly microscopic, at 1/5600th of an inch long. If he did to you what you'd done to him, you'd be a bloody stain on his foot and maybe the bottom of a half-mile deep crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you pulled out the rules list again, wondering if you'd misread anything in your hast:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny creatures are everywhere. As we cannot avoid killing them, it is not a crime to do so, even to a shrunken one of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked up, you caught sight of your new home for a while. The hovering machine slammed into the rock-hard side of the titan Tom's toes. It was somewhere on the inside part of the little toe, at least you hoped it was. Either way, the hovering machine was a wreak and now you were the shortest in the family, even to the former shortest thing in the house. From a section of toe-print you sat down, held on by gravity as the titan ran outside, it was a world to put any forest to shame.</span></div></div>",

From your perch, you examined the area, grass stalks miles tall that you had crushed beneath your feet not all that long ago, mud that was now miles deep, bugs bigger than cities. Oddly, there even were cities, the tinies lived even in the yard, despite the odds of being trampled there, they were far, far below you though and far spread, though you could imagine all the destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mud, trees and the titan enemy, if you didn't get thrown off or escape, the dirt would surely bury you. First you'd get flung towards the enemy who might as well be an iron mountain. After that, the enormous foot would come crashing through the forest of grass and smash down, sinking into the mud, taking plants around with it. Following that, either a repitition of the first thing or getting trampled by the enemy giant as he attacked. Enormous stuff would be shot into the air to impact on both fighters not to mention the flexibility of human skin, making you practically totally exposed, to top things off Tom preferred to attack with his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, just as the game was about to begin, another titan approached, dressed like you were except for a bracelet around his ankle. He ran at Tom and with the force of colliding planets, he slammed into him. He went down and both were on the ground, you were nearly crushed by the attacker's feet as they slammed into Tom's. You wondered how many tiny bloodstains were on your own feet, it would probably be impossible to find out though, nothing was small enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand up, you hear the giants talking overhead, \"Pad in your bro's room?

At least it was until he decided that he needed to be more active and that lounging was for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles were covered in seconds as the titan toes were shoved forward and off the bed, from here you got a view of all the low stuff in the lowest city to ever exist. Under the bed, you saw a pair of skating shoes, socks, sweats and a shirt that somehow you knew were yours from other stays. This room was yours for life so long as you didn't destroy it, it was the tiny's peace offering so that in normal form you let their city be. It was a small part high up in the buiding that was given as no giant expected to live in a room smaller than a thread of their socks and have to pay for it. The enormous clothes weren't the tiny's though, they were shrunk with you in a prior trip so there'd be something to where and then you left them here for safe keeping and to be sure there'd always be something to wear here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat would be going back to his house the next day, millions of miles away to you right now, so it was far better to stay here in this room than go with him. When he came by the shoes again, you saw the bright white lace of one of your shoes sticking out. At this size, gravity would have almost no pull on you, so with quite  a deal of fear and no thought, you jumped over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnormous distances shot by, you were lighter, but smaller so it was to scale just as fast as if you'd fallen at normal size down the same distance. That string down below was gonna be like concrete, despite the numerous times it had been soft as clothe sitting in your shoe.</span></div></div>",

It was just dangerous and would probably leave you, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant disappeared from sight and you went back to looking around. Built into a piece of leather, you find a computer terminal, of all things. In search of answers, you immediately start poking at the touch screen interface and eventually come upon a history by the tiny's. Apparently, every giant born has a tiny twin and several tiny siblings, but being as big as they are, have yet to discover the microscopic creatures. As far as advancement, the Tiny's are quite advanced around the giants and build their structures into every day things and sometimes on the people themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can be dangerous, but there are about 500 tiny's for every giant and even a baby is bigger than a planet. That's a lot of ground, and on them, because of that size there are very few laws of physics to look out for. A wall generates enough gravity to hold people and some structures to it, as does the roof and almost everything. The biggest fears are being crushed, drown or eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny could be crushed easily, often the imperfections in everything help survive, but not nearly half the time. Around the giants, there's a million liquids to drown in; sweat, water, cereal, chemicals, spit and more.

The difference was quite major, for one, you brother wasn't bigger than the Earth, for another, the tiniest population on Earth was your size and not giants, a tiny kindergartner was not bigger than you, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, memories came to of what had changed. The shrinking pad in your house was down, so you had to use Mat's, it had been almost immediately after his shrinking. An idea came to mind and quickly you sat down, then began to look at your foot through a magnifying glass. Around you middle toe and the next smallest, you found a wrecked hover-platform, being far larger than a person it was the easiest thing to see, though was also a speck. A much more powerful magnifying glass would be needed to see Mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out your window, you see that you are in your room and its night time, all the lights in the house are out and the only thing for you to see by is the moonlight.

Then, when you are out of danger, she snarls at you, 'How often should i tell you to not stand in the crossroads!? You had me worried sick for a moment!'. You answer back, 'How i could've know..? It's the first time i'm meeting you, an-..!'. You blink. First, you were talking to <i>*a dinosaur*</i>, that, at second, you could understand! And last, your voice sounded unusually loud and heavy, like it wasn't english. Or even an human language, but more like your... Mother's.. Language..? She growls again, 'I know that you love to explore, but..-!'. You couldn't hear the rest, as you hold your head. An excruciating pain runs in your head, so much you faint out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you see that you were back into your bed. Surely all thoses dinosaurs, especially that raptor, were but a dream, right? Given that a wet towel is neatly standing onto your forehead, you place it away and sits on your bed. As you place your hands onto it, it feels.. Oddly soft: Rather than being a mattress, it is multiple layers of feather, which might explain you had the feeling you slept so well. Nevertheless, your mind was still confused, given things are different from what they should be. Also, the pain in your head was still present, even if it was more supportable, while it still make you let off a 'hnnnng...'. A raptor steps into your room, probably after it heard you. Turns out it was the same raptor that saved you before you fainted. But now, you have the time to get a better view of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at 10 ft, the young adult brown raptoress has certainly a marvelous body. Lean and athletic, it was like her body was made in a mold, if you exclude her generous D-cup breasts and the large and healthy long tail that proudly stand onto her backside. She's currently wearing a black sport bra, on which is written 'Rawr!' and a black jean, while she currently stand barefooted. And while her hands looks like much like one of a human, aside from the small claws, her feet are more like what you'd expect from a raptor, making her standing onto a digitigrade stance, while her claws down there would certainly make a predator proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, with a motherly tone, 'Are you alright, my little raptor?'. You stutter, 'L-little raptor?'. The raptor giggles, 'I know that you're not one, that you've grown finely, but to me, you'll always be my little raptor!'. She grabs you so she can hug you, then you notice that her eyes are closed and that she is crying, 'Don't scare me like that again..! Okay..?'. You blink, then relax and hug the raptoress back. You add, 'I will, mom...'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was uneventful as you roam around the house. Aside from dinosaurs, only a few details here and here are actually different, like the set of chairs in the garden, given they are of various size, implying that size difference between the different present species is deep enough to justify such. Knowing that, and remembering why things had gotten into that, you experimentally grow your raptor mom by a good feet. As expected, the house scales up. What wasn't, though, is that you <i>*grew</i> as well, making you wonder how your powers affects this world. You try, this time, to grow only yourself, by about a feet again, as to not overdo it, this time. Turns out that nothing change, at least noticeably, excluding, obviously, the fact that you are now 8'2\", while your mother is still 11 ft tall. You undo your last growth, but keep your mother height as you didn't wanted to shrink her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to explore the town, you...</span></div></div>",

You stand in front of your mirror and look over your body. Smiling to yourself, you begin your transformation. Slowly, you inch upwards. Your formerly six foot frame is expanding before your very eyes. The mirror, being nailed to the wall, begins to morphology before your eyes. It grows longer and wider while inching up the wall to keep up with your sprouting body. Within a minute, your nine feet tall. Your head brushes the ceiling before the ceiling moves upward to give you some growing space. Pausing your growth at nine and a half feet, you look around your room. Nearly everything has grown to accommodate your size: the bed is longer, the doorway is higher, the desk chair has grown AND changed from wood to metal to support your weight. You notice the ceiling fan is gone. It must be to prevent you from bumping your head. You do, however, spot a new A.C. in the window.  Despite all the accommodations, however, you realize that you don't want to feel normal. You want to feel big everywhere you are. Focusing, you will the room to shrink ever so slightly. As you concentrate, you see the room begin to shrink. In about thirty seconds, your head is pushing on the ceiling. You stop the shrinking of your room and look it over once more. The mirror is touching the ceiling so that you can still see yourself. Your bed looks smaller now. The A.C. is still in the window (THANK GOD), but you appear to have a broken ceiling fan. A memory sweeps your mind as you see yourself slam your head on it in a half-asleep state of mind. With that memory gone, you bring your attention back to your room. As odd as it sounds, you like being to big for your room and decide to continue your growth. But since you don't want to have to stoop, you sit down on your bed. It creaks loudly under your weight due to of not being up to scale with your size. Brushing that off, you resume your growth.  Watching the floor move away from you, you continue to inch up. Passing eleven feet tall, you loon ridiculous in your room. It was like looking into a carnival room with a giant freak. The only difference being a teenager with an honest smile on his face. You continue to grow until you hit fourteen feet tall, where you force yourself to stop. You are literally bouncing for joy at this point, you fail to note the ominous creaking of your bed. With a snap!, the bed posts snap and you land with a heavy thud. Realizing this, you note that you should focus more on being careful. Cautiously standing, your head bumps the ceiling gently sooner than you expected. A<br>\r\nstretching your legs, your entire back is pushing up against the ceiling. Smiling, you make your way to the mirror. You can't even see your entire body anymore. It's amazing! But, you also notice something: you look almost ...older. a new wave of information sweeps your mind. Puberty was apparently much kinder to you than before. Not that you weren't good looking before, but now you looked more masculine than a 16 year old would normally appear. Not only do you look older, but you notice your shorts are a nit tighter than before. You begin to fidget with you shorts to make yourself more comfortable.  As you do...</span></div></div>",

If it weren't for him being your brother, you simply wouldn't be able to tell what gender he was. Even his voice, still untouched by puberty, was perfectly androgynous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh popped off your house's roof like a tupperware lid and placed a hand in the center of your room. \"Hop on\", he said excitedly, \"Our show's almost on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at his hand with mistrust. Josh was the nicest of your brothers and the two of you got along just fine, but his sheer size compared to you was a little offputting. Still, you calmly step onto it and sit down in the middle of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you sit down, fingers the size of tree trunks curl around your legs, holding you firmly in place as you're lifted high into the air. Though he's clearly excited, Josh makes an effort to walk slowly for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point in Josh's hand you get a pretty good look of his room, and it looks very different from the version you're used to. Looks like your parents used all the money they saved from you being so small to pamper themselves and their children a bit. In Joshua's case, this meant a giant TV ganging on the wall, a huge beanbag chair and a bunch of anime figures. Apparently, somewhere along the way this version of Josh had turned into a massive otaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh lowered himself onto the bean bag and reached for the TV remote, then plopped you down on his belly. The show Josh was talking about was apparently some sort of magical girl anime. You have no idea what's going on in it, but it looks interesting enough so you sit and watch it. During commercials, one of Josh's hands pulls up behind you and strokes your back with one fingertip. This gives you a very pleasant feeling and every time the show came back on you found yourself hoping for the next commercial break to come quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the credits finally roll about half an hour later, Josh turns off the television and looks down at you. \"Well\", he says, ready for...\"</span></div></div>",

Realising it would be easier, you shrink yourself again so that you can ride your plane.

From here, it would be best to try and leave his shirt through the neck hole.

Thankfully you avoided the collision by flying up to his face, where he almost sucked you into his mouth a few times.

Deciding it was too dangerous to be around him right now, you sheltered in his left ear.

I wanna see you for myself!\" he said, his voice echoing through the caverns in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but you'll have to be really careful. My plane is almost germ-sized after all. Hold on, I'm going to leave the communicator here in your eardrum so I can talk to you without having to be in your ear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the plane down, you climb out into the surreal world of Tom's inner ear and begin to set up the communications unit against his eardrum. Once this was done, you clambered back into your plane and prepared to leave Tom's head. Then you had a really cool idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom, when I give the signal, I want you to open your mouth.\" you didn't wait for a response from Planet Tom and flew past his eardrum and down a different tunnel. You arrived at the back of his throat as planned and flew your microscopic plane through the dark interior of his mouth. You dodged around his uvula and landed on his massive tongue. \"Okay Tom, I'm in your mouth right now. Whatever you do, don't swallow. Yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the plane once again, climbing out onto the alien landscape of Tom's tongue. Being microscopic made it seem like you were exploring some vast unknown place. The soft flesh beneath your shoes, the moist, warm atmosphere... it was unlike anything you'd ever experienced. Having spent a moment in the strange land, you decided it was time to hop back in the plane and leave. \"Okay Tom, open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew right out of his mouth to the world outside.\"That was awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out? Can I swallow now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom swallowed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I was only kidding! You just swallowed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I'm sorry, you said you were out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm in your stomach! It's gross down here!\" you teased, actually flying a good distance from him to try and gauge his reaction to your fake story. It was working. You watched the boy lift his shirt to expose his belly, worriedly talking to you as if you were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, looks like I'm stuck in here. Until you poop me out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm sorry bro...\" he said, patting his stomach. \"I didn't mean it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little guilty for tricking him like this, so decided to give up the ruse. \"Tom... I'm not really in your stomach. You didn't swallow me, I got out of your mouth. I was just seeing what you'd do...\" you confess, flying close to his eyes. \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the impression he had seen you, his moon-sized eye casting it's gaze on you. \"Bro? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see I got out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... you really are small! I'm gonna have to be real careful around you.\" he said. \"We could play some fun games. Where do you want to explore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom decided to lay on his bed, his shirt lifted half way up his mountainous belly. More than ever, he was a living landscape. \"You can explore my body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whizzed down over his face, making your way down to his belly. Landing by his navel, you climbed out of the plane and stood on the soft, fleshy plain. The ground rose and fell beneath you, with every massive breath Tom took. You could faintly hear and feel the subterranean activity deep down inside his gut, his belly rumbling occasionally. You stared out into the massive chasm of his belly button, which resembled something akin to the Grand Canyon at this size. Having seen enough, you got back into your plane and took off once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying low over his belly, you zoomed across his expansive torso and toward his face. Tom craned his neck down at the last minute as if to check on you and you flew straight into his mouth, this time inadvertently careening down his throat. \"Woah! Tom! I'm going down your throat, for real this time!\" you called out as you descended through his dark interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum! You were delicious bro!\" His voice echoed around you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went all the way down his esophagus and arrived in his stomach. It was a massive living cavern of unimaginable size, wrinkly walls of flesh stretching for miles around the endless ocean of bubbling stomach acid below. Foul gases steamed off the surface, creating an overbearing warm atmosphere. \"Oh my god... this is your stomach... I'm in your stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool, what's it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gross... but kinda cool. I wonder how I'm gonna get out of here though...\" you trail off, flying low over the gross sea of gastric nastiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I think I know.\" Tom said, squeezing out a small fart. \"That way probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross! I guess this is karma for my little prank earlier, huh?\" you say, dodging past a gas bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the way out, like it or not. You can try to fly out of there now, or you can take the chance to explore inside my tummy. While you're in my belly, how about we have some more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game. You have to dodge the food I eat! Or I can just lay here and wait for you to make your way out of my butt. Well, what do you wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to weigh your options. On the one hand, you could leave Tom's body as soon as possible. You weren't crazy about the exit strategy but you'd be out of his body. On the other hand, you could live a little and play a fairly dangerous game in Tom's stomach, prolonging your stay in his belly. You eventually come to a decision.</span></div></div>",

This little girl was quite active, she was walking and playing all day and sweated a lot. But you didn't care, you were still enjoying yourself! As the sweat poured from the toe, you simply licked it up and enjoyed its salty taste. The girls foot smelled awful, but that only made you more attracted to it. Finally, the little girl got home, and she took her sandals off right away. But when she lifted her foot out, you discovered that...</span></div></div>",

You look up to figure out what's going on, only to find your brother's godly face looking down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey bro,\" Tom said with a voice louder than any thunderclap you've ever heard. \"I figured it was you down there.

I'll try to stop you with my feet, ok? Oh, and if you make it there in less than five minutes, I'll even give you a special reward. Ready, set, go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this isn't really a game, it's more like Tom toying with you. At your size, Tom could easily stop you from reaching the coin by just pinning you under just one of his toes. But you've got nothing better to do so you figure you might as well play along. Who knows, maybe you really do like spending time with Tom's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start jogging just to see what Tom does to stop you. Almost immediately, you're knocked off your feet by the impact of Tom slapping his feet against the ground around you. Far above you, you hear Tom giggling at you. \"You're so weak, bro! I didn't even touch you and you fell down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back up again, expecting your brother to pull the same trick again. Instead, he lifts his feet high above you and begins rubbing the soles together. All of a sudden, grains of sand the size of your fist that had been stuck to your brother's feet begin raining down on you. A few of then hit your body, and one of them almost makes you trip, but other than that you make it though the storm just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're about a quarter of the way there, Tom stops rubbing his feet together and places one of them back down on the floor, its massive sole hanging over your head. His titanic toes wiggle overhead as Tom slowly lowers his foot down. You start running faster, trying to get somewhere safe, just barely making it under the curve of Tom's toes as his sole comes crashing down behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way out from under Tom's foot, crawling out though the gap between his second and third toes. \"So you made it though ok, huh?\" You hear Tom say behind you. \"Okay bro, just one more obstacle to get though.\" Tom's foot lifts up behind you and comes down between you and the coin, heel to the left and toes to the right. \"You have to crawl under it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate and turn around to look at your brother. \"Go on. I promise you'll be safe down there,\" Tom said, gently smiling down at you. Feeling more confident, you approach his foot with a light jog. Your brother might like to tease you, he would never do anything to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the foot, you continue jogging under the inner arch. Tom's sole is still comfortably high above you, letting you walk upright without any issue. As you progress, tough, his sole comes down closer and closer untin you have to get down and crawl under it. Eventually, you get to the place where Tom's foot meets the ground, and you're left with no choice but to flatten yourself on the ground and try to crawl though to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on your back, using your hands to grab ahold of Tom's skin to pull yourself forward. You do this many times until, finally, you make it out of though to the other side. Exhausted, you lay down on the ground, breathing heavily, as Tom lifts his foot up to get a look at you. Good job bro! I knew you could do it! Just a little bit more to go, don't give up now! In fact, let me help you out a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom placed his foot over you again and brought it down until the big toe was resting on the penny. He slides the coin towards you. The coin is so close now, you manage to touch it just by reaching out. \"Congrats, bro! You made it though in just eight minutes!\"</span></div></div>",

But that never bothered him, because he enjoyed being so big and playing with all his little big brothers. He covered his eyes and started counting so you quickly look for a place to hide. The possibilities are literally endless as there are multiple places to hide in, under, or behind. You turn to the thirty foot tall teddy bear and burrow under it, completely hidden beneath it's furry bottom. You curl up in the warm fur and listen as Tommy stops counting and starts looking. He's an enthusiastic seeker and you can hear him pulling things down and looking into boxes, in his search for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bear is lifted off of you and Tommy grabs you bringing you to his face. He grins and said, \"Found you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and say, \"Good job Tommy! I can never hide from you for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother laughs, glad for the praise. He sets you down and you hide again for about another five rounds, each with little success at hiding. Finally, Tommy gets bored and lays down on his bed with you sitting on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it as you look around the room.

But, you realize that you would have to do it right if you wanted it to work. Like, one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to keep the same size ratio between you two, but have the room seem enormous to both of you. So, the only thing you can think of is to grow the size of the room, while focusing on keeping everyone in your family the same size. It was going to be a strain, but it is going to be worth it. You begin to concentrate on what you need to do. You know you must keep your eyes open, for fear you may overdo it, or even do too little. You watch, from Tommy's giant chest, the room rising high above both of you. The bed expands as the seconds go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your head begins to hurt, but you endure for a bit. You wait until Tommy would be about a foot tall in this room, so everything is four times as large to both of you. After you stop, it feels like you have a headache, but it quickly leaves you. You turn to Tommy, and ask him why the room is so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responds, \"Huh, why are you asking?\" You realize the idiocy of your question, considering what these powers do, but you yourself don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like being reminded. It still blows my mind.\" You think maybe that will get an answer from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Mom and Dad expected me to be much bigger than I actually am when they requested it to be built. Normally, it would have cost them a fortune to build something this large, considering it is so large, but they were able to get the money through funds from some labs interested in my growth.\" He stared off into the room, somewhat pensive. \"Though, I love that it is so big. It is the only place in the house where I feel small.\" He smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get back to your game, you look around the room again to see what you can do. You see that most of the wooden furniture inside the room now have etchings in the m that look like you would be able to climb them. Plus, given Tommy's size, he could probably climb to where he wants without the etchings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that hide and seek could be much more fun in this room, but there is also tag, which may be hard, considering the size difference, but it could be fun, considering the size of the actual playing field.

A memory slaps you full force. In it, Tom and you were skating when a group of drunken teenagers begin to harass you. Despite your height, they all outweigh you. Tom to the rescue! however, the owner of the park sees the action and assumed Tom was the one who started the fight when in reality, he was the one protecting you from angry drunks. All of you were banned from the park for a full year. your vision clears as you see Tom starring down at his large skate board. you reach up to pat his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I shouldn't have brought it up. I'm sorry,\" you say in your most comforting voice. Tom's hand moves until it completely envelops your own, pinning you in place. He looks down at you meeting you gaze. A small smile spreads across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as your okay, i'm fine.\" He continues to smile at you. you smile back. You vaguely remember all the times that the two of you have been there for each other. All the times you included Tom in the fun you two had at recess when all the other kids were afraid of him. All the times he protected you from the bullies when they would make fun of him for being the shortest in elementary (a phase which didn't last long as his growth spurt was a good foot in one year). You two always had each other's backs, and you would stick together through thick and thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntom finally lifts his hand off of yours while he continued to smile at you. Laughing a bit, you climb onto the couch, which feels almost second nature to you now. He looks down at you, a tower of comfort. Leaning against his arm (which you notice isn't as muscled as your own, despite the size difference) you think about what else the two of you could do. An idea strikes your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How about we go the beach! We can still go there and if you skate, we'll get there even faster!\" Tom's eyes light up. He picks you up in his hand , which frightens you a bit, and hugs you to his chest. When he pulls you away, you see the biggest smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That sounds great! Let's go get our stuff, and we can go!\" He quickly, yet gently, places you on the floor and he scampers to get his things together. You smile to yourself. Despite making him as old as you, he's still very childish. A thought crosses your mind. Tom was apparently always being picked on for his loft stature, and you always want to be there for him to comfort him. why not grow yourself a bit taller, enough for people to give you looks as well, but not so much where you as tall as Tom. You like knowing that you can depend on each other for different things, and if you were exactly alike you wouldn't have that. concentrating, you slowly increase your height. You inch your way up until you hit a solid seven and a half feet. You stop there. memories sweep your mind. you and tom are still close, if not closer. You both get bullied at times, but you still have the same friends. More people are wary of you personally now and you're still banned from the skate park for the same reasons, but that doesn't matter to you. You and Tom have new bonding moments that strengthened your relationship. Looking around, the family furniture has remained almost the same size. A few differences are seen, such as less ceiling fans and a new dining table for you and Tom so you don't crush the one for the rest of the family. A memory surfaces as you recall crushing the table when you tried to avoid tripping over your little sister. Since then, you and Tom have your own things that are heavy duty for your respective sizes. the memory fades just in time for Tom to come back into the room. He's wearing his trunks and looks down at you with an excited face. You notice that you come up just over his mid-thigh. you look down and notice that you were wearing your trunks as well. 'Was I always wearing these/' you thought to yourself. Shrugging, you look back up into the face of pure eagerness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Tom asks with an incredibly child-like face. You grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!&gt;\" Tom's grin widens as he kneels down to pick you up. You brace yourself as he lifts you up onto his shoulder, a lofty 25 feet in the air. You settle yourself as he ducks out the door, which you notice is a foot to low for Tom. Once outside, tom stands fully erect. You both smile into the wind. Tom towers over most homes, and you can see a brief look of hesitance in his face. another memory surfaces and you see most of the neighbors looking at a younger version of you and Tom with looks of discomfort. they were nervous having such large boys around. You rub his cheek. He glances down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright tom,\" you say with a smile. \"Let's just go have fun.\" Tom grins again, nodding to you. he puts his skateboard on the cement. As he skates with you on his shoulder towards the beach, you notice...</span></div></div>",

You didn't care how humiliating it was- you were so terrified that would've said anything to get out from under there. His foot completely dominated your torso, and his big toe was comparable to your face. He wasn't not standing up, and as a result you couldn't see his face from the ground as his legs bent at the knees over five feet in the air and disappeared over a massive sofa throne.His foot relieved its pressure and settled down next to you with an ominous thud. You didn't even look back as you sprinted  out of the room. You hear one final booming command from your titanic brother before you leave: \"And make sure you bring my shoes with you! Hey Josh, get me a Coke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowed down as you walked to where you remembered the front hall of the house being, and then stopped suddenly when you entered. It was still a front hall, alright, but i was like you were in an entirely different house- a much larger, more expensive one. It must have been made for Jack's size, because everything was bigger. The ceiling vaulted almost thirty feet in the air, over an expansive wooden ground that almost seemed like a basketball court, and the door looked like it belonged in a cathedral, with massive wooden panels and a heavy-looking but shiny metal knob fitted into it. Below, level with the ground, another smaller door had been built into it, probably for normal-sized people. The overall look was somewhat comical, like a fancy dog entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall that family policy had you taking off your shoes as you enter and putting them by the doorside. You saw that this has not changed either, though it certainly was stranger to look at. Next to you and your other brothers' normal 13 shoes lay Jack's sneakers, obviously custom-made, white with a dark-blue Nike swoosh on them and the size of trash cans. You bent over and briefly try tugging one up... and found that they were almost as heavy as fully-packed trash cans, too. Even when he had his foot on top of you, it hadn't given you a good impression of how strong your brother's size had made him. Now you had perspective. These shoes you were struggled with were weights he didn't even recognize. He donned them  any time he walked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your right and see another massive door, slightly ajar and leading to what must be your brother's room. You shudder as you think about what Jack and his rotten personality could do with that kind of power.</span></div></div>",

You certainly felt much more frightened now than you ever had while watching a movie!  Of course, just like with a horror movie, there's a great sense of relief in knowing you can turn things off at any time.  That's why it's fun to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Jack's trashcan-sized shoes, you try to carry them back into the living room, but they're simply too unwieldy.  You're forced to lug them in one at a time to your gargantuan giant of a younger brother.  There is a smirk on Jack's handsome, billboard-sized face as he idly watches you sweat and strain to bring him his shoes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You're such a puny pipsqueak!\" he sneers.  \"Better start lifting some weights, bug; I'm gonna need even bigger shoes soon.  Now get going to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were curious about how Jack's room looks now, you don't really want to spend the rest of the day cleaning it, especially since everything in there is bound to be way too big for you to handle.  Also, you were getting pretty annoyed by how high-handed your younger brother was acting.  Of course, what else could you expect from Jack?  Maybe it's time to cut him back down to size.  You concentrate, focusing your attention on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get moving, shrimp, or I'm gonna pound you!\" he threatens.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled at this, in the knowledge that a single blow from his boulder-sized fist would completely pulp you.  You really were like a bug to him!  Thanks goodness he's only so strong because of his size, not because he was better built than any other twelve year-old.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did this errant thought cross your mind than Jack's shirt changed to a muscle shirt and his blue jeans became jean shorts.  With so much more of his body now revealed you saw clearly how fantastically fit and mega-buff this behemoth was!  His hill-sized biceps bulged with endless, pure power, while his chest was a wide, towering wall of carved, rock-solid muscle!  He rose to his feet, mammoth muscles rippling across the towering young boy god's fantastic physique!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in mingled fear and awe as you stared upwards at the muscle-bound, He-Boy juggernaut named Jack.  You couldn't even have begun to imagine how unbelievably mighty Jack has just become!  The monstrously muscular twelve year-old colossus looked literally strong enough to heft a skyscraper overhead!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt torn between worshipping this twenty-foot, preteen monument of gorgeous, godly muscle and using your powers to reduce his inhumanly glorious magnificence.                        </span></div></div>",

A shell-bra..? Weirder even, on her backside had sprouted a large black tail, much like one of a killer whale. Before you could try to get anything more, you feel a hand grabbing you. 'There you are, big brother! I knew you couldn't resist my offer~.'. You stutter, 'W-what offer?'. 'Exploring the ocean, obviously!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your sister toward the ocean, you ask, 'How come you have a tail?'. She giggles, 'I already told you, didn't i? Well, you know that it was since i sneaked in that weird lab.. They were doing all kind of wierd thing! But they didn't wanted me to stay, so they tried to catch me! Given i had no idea of what was around, i blindly run through and trip.. I landed into a large water pool with glass walls. In it, there was that big black and white fish, a 'killer whale' they said. But it was anything but dangerous! Actually, i even befriend her.. And in exchange, she shared her powers. The men in white coat were trying to make human-animal hybrid things, or something. For some reasons, my tail quickly grew afterwise, but then, i fainted.. When i woke up, i was outside, onto the sand. My clothing weren't the same, then i saw my whale friend again! She waved at me, so i joined her! But for some reasons, she was smaller than me.. Or rather, everything looked smaller! So much i couldn't see people anymore.. Thankfully, i can hear them! Makes walking so much easier.. Even if i prefer being in the ocean!'. That explains things! Aside from her size, but given you were now standing in front of the ocean, you could see said 'whale' friend. The killer whale was actually twice as big it should be, while still being smaller than your 'little' sister. Wanting to have some fun, you.. </span></div></div>",

However, you would like to see if anything else about your home will change in the event of the Husky growing beyond that size. In other words, you would like to experience life with a gigantic dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUsing your powers, you start to steadily increase Angel's size, keeping your eyes on the two containers of growth-inhibiting pills that lie on the table a few inches away. The Husky lolls out her tongue as you further increase her size, her bowl, bed and number of dog food bags growing with her. When she reaches 10 feet, her pill boxes suddenly fuse into one. You pause her growth and examine the tub of supplements. On it is a label that proclaims that it is \"the pill to stop your dog from becoming 'Zilla\". Chuckling at the obvious reference to a certain Japanese monster, you turn back to Angel and resume her growth, except this time, you decide to speed it up. The dog quickly inches upwards, hitting the 20 feet mark in a matter of seconds, and then breaking the 50 feet barrier in another minute! The room you are in expands in height, length and width as the colossal dog gets bigger and bigger! You also notice that a dog house the size of a two-storey home now neighbours yours to the right, and even that is still expanding in size! Your eyes focus back on Angel, now 90 feet tall and growing still. Dissatisfied with her current size, you throw your hands up in the air. This causes a monumental surge in growth, in which the canine gains hundreds upon hundreds of feet in height. You finally stop her growth at an awe-inspiring one-and-a-half miles tall! She is now so big that even her paws tower over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou take a look at your surroundings, only to discover that your home is now a colossal mansion. The bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen and living room are now situated at the top of a broad, fairly steep staircase. Backing away from the intimidate form of Angel, you look around and spot a giant bone, far larger than ordinary. The shadow of the bone looms over you as you rub your hand on its surface. Just as you start pondering about where it came from, your eyes catch sight of the right side of the room. A fully functioning catapult stands dormant there, holding in its cup a tennis ball the size of a large boulder. Suddenly, it hits you: this large room is actually a play area for the dog, with the necessary objects being tremendously oversized, of course. Suddenly, you hear the voice of your mother calling you from the kitchen. \"Billy,\" she says, \"why don't you take Angel outside? She'd love some exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

How ere you going to do this? You couldn't see a collar and leash on Angel's scale anywhere; were you meant to just walk alongside her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Angel! Uh... Walkies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel instantly grows excited, and suddenly bounds off to a different part of the hypermassive mansion that was now your house. Several seconds later, miniature earthquakes and deep booms signify Angel's return, and she re-enters your field of view, a collar on her scale secured around her neck, a one and a half mile long leash dedfending from it to the ground, allowing you to grab it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently scratch on one of Angel's paws. \"Good girl... you're well trained, aren't you, girl?\" Responding well to the praise, Angel lowers her sky-filling muzzle and opens her mouth, a massive tongue rapidly making its way towards you. Cringing as the tongue approaches, you are surprised to feel the texture of Angel's tongue when she licks you; it is similar to soft, if admittedly slobbery, velvet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping Angel's leash, you run into another problem. Your house had to be a few dozen miles long at the least, in order to contain Angel and offer enough space for her and your family to live comfortably. However, this problem seems to solve itself; before you can react, you are somehow caught harmlessly in Angel's jaws - something that should have pulverised every bone in your body within a millisecond - and tossed upwards, high into the air, coming down on the top of Angel's fluffy white head with a soft thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to explain the violation of pretty much everything you knew about biology, you are taken off guard when Angel starts to bound forward, her powerful legs allowing her to tear through the house towards her destination, the door. A massive doggie door, equal to Angel's one and a half mile scale, stands between Angel and her beloved walkies. A playful growl escaping her immensely thick throat, Angel leaps through the doggie door, emerging into the outside, whereupon she presses her muzzle to the ground and tilts her head upwards, allowing you to harmlessly roll onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you realise that immediately in front of your house is a titanic dirt path, stretching as far as you can see in both directions. On the opposite side of the road, twenty or so miles away, is another house, much like your own. This one, however, exceeds the scale of your own by a significant amount; it's almost twice as large! It seems Angel wasn't the only dog that got blown up and up and up to godlike sizes, and if what you were seeing was correct, she was by no means a particularly large dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into the cool blue sky, you are once again reminded of Angels sheer scale when most of your vision is filled with white fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Angel! Walkies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to walk, grasping the leash as Angel waits, seemingly amused by your behaviour. Every now and then, the leviathan sized husky moves a single paw, shaking the earth as she creeps forward a fraction. It was slow, but it was fun. Angel seemed to be enjoying it even more than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting within the fluff and fur of Angel's right paw, you can't help but feel... Slightly dizzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, make that... Very dizzy...</span></div></div>",

She proceeds to swat you with her paw again; this time however, she places her other paw in your way to catch you.

Not wanting to have the toy grow out of control, and partially because you didn't wanted to play with a toy too huge to move around, you try to jump onto the inflating toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly, it was, at least to some extend, working, given the building wasn't scaling up anymore. Rather, it started to <i>*shrink*</i>, unless it was you who was growing? You can't tell, given you couldn't have a peek outside the building. <br>\r\nLast when before you jumped onto the toy, it was 40 ft tall, but the roof seemingly was at around 75 ft tall, meaning that, since it was starting to strain onto the building's structure, you can only assume its bigger.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the roof needed reparations, given parts of it crumbles away, meaning you and the pooltoy would safely grow outside, at least, until you both started to get squeezed onto the roof's newly made hole. <br>\r\nFor unknown reasons, right after, the growth had ceased, leaving you into the aftermath of your doing: The pooltoy was around 120 ft, meaning you got around 18 ft and 6 inches in size by error. More strangely enough, you were standing near your house, except there was a huge pool next to it, 50 ft, 550 ft long, and.. No idea, given you can't see how wide it is from your point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to see what changed, and given you were *still* stuck, you, with extreme cautious, grow the building, making sure it doesn't affect you or the toy, and by just a tiny amount, so you can force your way onto the toy, and climb out, with it. That being done, you head your way toward the pool. It had three ladders onto the side you were facing. One ladder meant for your size, and two others, smaller. Probably for others, if only for cleaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide in the pool, and notices that.. The pool was actually a small aquatic ecosystem. Fishes, dolphins, sharks and others were found in it, wierder even, the pool was actually connected onto a river and toward the ocean. Your surroundings, that you somehow missed, were thoses of a shore. Next to the pool stand two computers. One for regulations and information, from what you could gather. The other one was a regular one, albeit bigger. Probably meant for you. A quick search on it tells you what occured to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day that you were at this beach, with your family, playing, all alongside other people, an abnormal decrease of water was occuring, alongside a dangerous storm that was whipping up, causing people to scurry off the place. During that, you were playing with your favorite pooltoy, the oversized inflatable dragon. Some enterprises were running interest tests onto huge pooltoys, to see their potential commercial value, and you, was one of the Lucky kids that won one. To 'test' it, your parents had brung you, the toy and the rest of the family at the beach. Unfortunaly, the flow of water had caught you, sending you away from the shore, with nothing but the pooltoy to hang onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway in the ocean, as the storm transformed into a tempest, you get caught into a maelstrom and, would have drown, if it wasn't for the miraculous apparition of a water dragon, strangely similar to the toy. Still hanging dearly on the toy, the water dragon grabs you by the chest with its maw, as it lacked any other means to move you, and made you and your floater swim through the tempest, onto a calmer land. <br>\r\nShivering and completly wet, you could quickly meet up some help and get safely back at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, you notice that your body had certain.. Oddities. Your were taller, stronger, and patchs of scaled skin had appeared onto your body. You also grew fins onto your back. Doctors tried to understand what affected you. It turns out that the dragon that had bitten you to save you also had infected your DNA, making you into a human-water dragon hybrid. That much would also give you better regeneration skills, given that the wound on your chest had wounded at a spectaculat rate, leaving only mere scars here and here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the pooltoy, you had it back soon after the doctors' diagnostic, and for the pool, it was in exchange for some testing and some advertisements, giving you the means to build it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish the search, you notice that the water dragon is paying you a visit. You decide to..</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, what bothers you is the sheer amount of insects around you, like they are attracted to you, including the overgrown grub! If only you could understand them.. As such, and to a fault of helping to get what they want, you decide to shrink yourself down until you are just slightly smaller than an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insects circles around you, before you feel lifted up and placed onto the back of an ant. Then, the insects, or the ones you can see, at least, and aside the huge grub, goes and lead you inside the tree. Once inside, you marvel at the sight. Inside the tree, you see that it is settled much like a huge insect nest, with multiple openings leading outside, and multiple tunnels leading underground. You are lead through an unknown way toward a room, strangely furnished similarly to your room. You could even see a bee plush in it.

You quickly check if the plush was still here, then you lead back toward the trunk of the tree. It feels wider and more lively than before, without being able to tell for sure. On the other hand, you notice why some of the insects looked strange: Some of them had became anthropomorphous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that there was still no human to be found, you lead outside the tree to understand why it didn't worked as intended. But instead of finding the farm of Fred, you spot some kind of forest, with, seemingly, no trace of human or human's work.

Placing it in a wheelbarrow, you start wheeling it into the enclosure. The gorillas have come to like you over time, and you're allowed into the enclosure without any kind of safety gear. You wheel the food into the enclosure and head towards the back, away from the view of people who might be watching, and begin to distribute the food. Several gorillas appear and walk over to you, sitting together as they eat the food you've brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne gorilla in particular comes up closely, and tries taking food right from your hands. This gorilla is Kala, a young female with brown fur who bonded with you easily. You get a little annoyed by how much attention she gives you, as she frequently follows you and tries to play with you. As you watch her, though, you start to consider that she might be a prime candidate for using your powers, seeing as she is very friendly with you and likely won't hurt you, even when giant,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a hand, palm facing the female ape, and concentrate. The gorilla looks around, seemingly feeling something weird, and lets out a series of surprised grunts as she suddenly grows in size. You watch as she grows bigger and bigger, soon looming over you. You stop once she's a few times your size, not wanting to overdo it, and grin as she glances around, intrigued by her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to hear loud grunts from behind you, though, and turn to see that the other gorillas have all grown too, each of them almost the size of King Kong. Apparently, your size changing power had a side effect. They are all looking around confusedly, though some start to glare down at you, seeming to think you're responsible for this change. You back up, fearing their wrath, when you bump into something warm and furry. You look up to see that you've bumped into Kala's now-massive arm, and she is looking right down at you... With a gentle look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you notice that she's moving up the arm you bumped into, and glance over your shoulder to see her giant hand coming up behind you. The human-like hand presses into you, palm pushing you forward slightly before the fingers curl around and wrap about your body firmly. Your arms are pinned to your sides as Kala snatches you up in her giant fist. Overtaken by fear, you start to squirm, but it's no use as the gigantic female ape lifts you off the ground and way up to her face, turning you around to look you in the eyes. You stare in fear at eyes the size of your head, and silently beg the beast to not hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear more grunts from behind you, and look over your shoulder to see the other gorillas are glaring at Kala now. To your surprise, the female gorilla tightens her grip on you and lowers you to her chest--awkwardly close to her bare breasts--and roars loudly at the other gorillas. Your ears are hurt, but not much, and you look back at the other gorillas to see them start to frown and turn away, moving away from Kala. Apparently, she was announcing her intention to protect you and her desire that the oer gorillas back ofd. The ground shakes with each step that the other gorillas take, and you suddenly realize that these gorillas could cause serious issues if left to roam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Kala and order her to release you, but the female gorilla does not listen. She simply raises you to her face again and gazes at you, her eyes so gentle that you can't help but stop worrying for a bit. You start to wonder if you should even care about the other giant gorillas... Maybe you should just spend time with Queen Kong here, since she seems genuinely kind, and is almost certain to not hurt you...</span></div></div>",

Yellow caution painting marked that it was a danger zone, do not cross, yada yada.<br>\r\n By your view around the bird in front of you, it seemed that the habitat had been sunken down a good fifteen feet so that the trees weren't so dense at eye level to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the turning, you found something else changed. For starters, you were dressed in some sort of leather get-up like an indian might wear, it had a short-sleeve shirt top and shorts, but no shoes. Apparently clothes weren't made this small so something had to be made by yourself.  Additionally, you had a tail! A frigging tail! Imagine being mouse-like and the size-change will work to fit your needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Billy!\" a shrilly girl voice says from behind, at least normally shrill, now quite a deal deeper. Then there came a push that came at the lower half of your body, you turned and saw your eight year old cousin, but of course more like a titan than a 'little' girl.</span></div></div>",

She seemed nervous about being at this edge but clearly wanted you to do something, otherwise she wouldn't have about bowled you over with... her... oh boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time your view had been moving down her body and had just reached her feet which she had nudged you with a second ago. The rubber toe of her pink sandals was an inch tall normally and it came up to your chest, not much lower than your arm-pits and shoulders. Her toes stood above you, it took cranning your neck up to see the nails sticking just over the edge, while looking at them at all showed masses of dirt  on and between the behemoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis settled it all, whatever breed of mouse you were based on, was a small laboratory type. A second later, the crowd started to cheer, \"fly! fly! fly!\" Something in this new body made you run forward, up the back of the bird and land in some sort of saddle amidst the soft feathers while grabbing reins sitting there. On a human - animal scale, the movement was faster than a human's on your scale and was somewhere between squierrel and mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle dwarfed you at almost the size of a football field, at 216ft long and its wings would easily clear that by far. Against it you were absolutely tiny, but yet when you kicked it, the beast obeyed, leapt forward and flew. Into the skies you soared, giving the crowd a show as you buzzed them, did loops and more to an announcer's narration. It was like being in an airshow with something the size of an airline but as manueverable as a fighter. It couldn't be explained, but the more you flew, the more you knew of this universe and of what you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to touch an eagle!\" the announcer called as you made another pass over the crowd, instantly everyone's hands shot up in a wave to stand out to you, a boy and girl by the front row rail were standing out at the moment. You guided the bird that way and while there weren't any cameras quite catching you (there were three huge screens getting close-up camera feeds),  you slipped into the feathers and clung under the bird, totally hidden. From here, you guided the huge flyer into a landing on a metal railing right in front of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titans immediately started to stroke the bird, their huge fingers quite larger and stronger than you moving all over the feathers. Eventually, a hand came to the chest and knocked you off,  falling a few thousand feet, as you went some odd wings came out of your sides, and you landed safely. Then came the answer, your squirrely movements from earlier were of course some part flying-squrel. To get this small, the genetic mashup that was you, needed stuff from a squirrel and that gave you a flyers skin-wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the huge kids, then the loud explosions of their bouncing feet brought you to a bigger problem, the iminent possibility of death. The two were as big as your cousin and in flipflops, they stood on their toes trying to get closer to the bird but every few seconds their feet wouldn't take the billion tons and dropped back down for a second. This left you barely above the bottom of the flip-flops and far shorter than the toes, trying to avoid getting crushed by things shooting 15 feet in the air in bounces every few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you knew what it felt like to be a bug in a kid's sights, what it was like to be one of the many tiny creatures that had been crushed under your feet throughout your life. You darted around like a rodent though, doing your best to avoid the crushed part. With the tons of foam shooting up and down though, it was hard to avoid it, yet at the same time you made out odd details like the blue image of the boy's footwear and the pink of the girl's or the massive black that coated the bottom's of their feet.</span></div></div>",

There were the huge binocular things all around the cage, you went to one and looked in at him all those miles away. He was in front of a toe looking up 300 feet to see the tip of a claw, a distance that had been perhaps an sixteenth to a thirty-second of an inch before. The cat was looking down and showing its teeth, which were just enormous, bigger than sky scrapers. You weren't sure if the behemoth could hear him, but it seemed bent on attacking something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your view goes black.

They were in a way, tree huggers and would not permit the Earth's natural life to be wiped out by man. By force and negotiation, an agreement was reached. Humans would be given materials necessary to survive and build, but would not be permitted outside of their cities. Going anywhere near a natural environment requires a reduction in your threat to it, that reduction was done by shrinking. Any cities outside designated areas were shrunken and arranged at that size out of the way.

Before you can step forward, there's a flash of light and what you presume to be a transporter of some kind sends you beyond the walls. After the transport, your vision is remarkable and nothing seems all that far from focus. Then you wish it was blurred as you recognize an ant and watch it walk over you a perhaps 3000 foot climb to its body. Which meant 2 millimeters was 3000 feet and that an inch would be 37500 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a booming hiss from behind you, turning you see the chamber doors open for your brother, so he didn't shrink.

Older and with a boost of strength from feline creatures, you were nothing next to him and dubbed unfit to survive on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up the massive creature, you consider approaching and climbing him or otherwise getting his attention.

Winds stronger than any hurricane on Earth blew you high into the air, your miniscule body blown about by even the faintest breeze, eventually bringing you to rest right between Tom's first two toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in awe at the titanic toes. The big toe was easily as tall as Mount Everest, and the second one was not far behind. That these monstrous things were only some of the smaller body parts of your younger brother impressed on your mind just how insignificant you were next to him. How could you possibly manage to get his attention at this size? You might as well try to drain great lakes with nothing but a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a tremendous noise coming from far above interrupts your thoughts. Looking up, you see your brother pressing some buttons on his watch, which were making a loud beeping noise when pressed. Pretty soon he finishes with whatever he was doing and then the same beeping noise, but not as loud, starts coming from your wrist. You raise your arm up to your face and find that you were also wearing one of the same wrist watches as Tom was. Only it isn't really a wristwatch, it's something much more advanced than any technology from your original timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a message on the screen, from Tom, asking you where you are. You type out a reply \u2013 \"I'm between your toes, Tom\" \u2013 and hit send. Tom's device beeps once to indicate that he received your message. Your brother reads it quickly, the he crouches down and begins inspecting his feet with the device. He finds you in hest to no time and lets out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Look at you, Bill! You're absolutely tiny!\" Tom's voice booms down at you. \"I mean, you're like a speck of dust compared to me! You could get crushed from one of my hairs falling on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince at your brother's crude reminder of your fragility. You write him a message saying, \"Tom, quit messing around and get me somewhere safe.\" Tom looks at his device and back to you. \"Aww, are you scared? Don't worry, Bill. Your big, strong brother Tom is here to protect you from those monster cats and squirrels. Though the way you are now, maybe the cats would just take you in as one of their own, eh kitty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cat-like growl escapes your lips, surprising you from how unexpected it was. You're glad your brother couldn't hear it, or else you might have died from embarrassment. \"Anyway,\" Tom continues, \"what do ou say we get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Tom carry you?</span></div></div>",

His clothes are leather as well, but he's not as thoroughly dressed, your in pants and a shirt, he's got shorts and a big baggy shirt.

In a flash, he's bending down looking and listening for you. This gives you a close up of his teeth, something like seven miles tall for the front fangs and between three and five for the rest, that was just plain scary. After they passed though you saw him with some sort of computer-enhanced glasses, displaying something on the lenses. Now you weren't so sure it was a good idea to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the distance, a wall reaches to the sky, it closes in and spreads into five. At the end of each there's an inch long claw, more like 8 miles long that to a titan comes to a sharp point, to you, its a dull, flat, point. You turn and run as fast as your tiny tiger body will take you, but when the giant can move 300 miles in under a second without a bit of effort, your not going to escape him. \"Come on, 'big' bro\" Tom booms, a second before your thrust into darkness. When the light returns, your on a mountain of dirt on his center palm pad. \"Guess its little bro now. I got ya' course', with those puny claws and limbs you couldn't hurt a fly. I'll just step on em'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a lot of things you wanna say to the 'big' brother, but you don't wanna risk taking a 200 to 300 mile drop or any of the cruel things he could do now. Payback would come later. The hand continued to move and over the left arm turned to dump you on a continent of fur. After miles of falling you it down on semi-soft skin, though it was more like concrete, still though, you survived. Standing, you found yourself on Tom's upper arm, his massive muscles under you pulsing a bit as his arm moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took off at a run, to him, average for a young tiger. In his fur, the micro-you took cover behind one of the towering strands for cover from the wind. You saw what of the forest you could, but when 12 to 14 mile tall fur barred you view in all directions, it was hard to see anything.</span></div></div>",

I thought your parents banned you from coming out here anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the memories started rushing in, synapses jumpstarting to fill in experiences you've never before had.  There were entire cities out here, in the wilderness that had been abandoned in the great reduction, left to crumble when the humans moved into the protective enclosures.  Alot of the younger teens used them, against common sense and their parent's wishes, as club houses and gathering spots.

I'm a 'troublemaker'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tom smirked, wrapping his arms around his friend in a hug that buries you in their conjoined fur again, miles long strands of fur flattening you between the impossibly soft, pliant pillars. \"I just learned, thanks to my brother, that there's ways to get around security.  You could always come back as a tiny.  He's on me right now and y'all didn't even know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gasps, laughing as his ears perk. \"Oh my god. That would be awesome!  Get me inside and then unshrink me after the alarms won't be scanning.  Dude. Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, the two separate from their friendly hug, the already huge tiger striding back to the portal to scale back up to titanscale while the fox takes the other exit.  Within moments, the tiger is 320 miles in height again, the fox scrambling through the barren plateau of cool dirt beyond the expansion pad to reach his toes safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you're trapped in the dense, soft white chestfur of one of the two anthrofurs. . . </span></div></div>",

Doesn't have to be large scale, just something.

The only exception is family members, as I have pretty much covered all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)This is Shrink/Grow only. Age change is allowed for how it affects the universe, just no weight gain. The concept bothers me. EDIT: If you want, you can directly change age, just hold back a bit on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)Yes. Clothing changes as well. It doesn't mean a 2000 foot giant has to be wearing normal clothes, just have him wearing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6)Finally, The main character is generally unaware of the change made, until he sees it or hears of it. So, that means he himself won't know how something happened, or what it has done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, to the story: You are Billy, a 15 year old male, and one night, you gain the ability to change the size of objects, people, creatures, anything, and even turn inanimate objects into living breathing creatures.

Whenever a change is made, no one notices because to them, things had always been that way. I appreciate the additions, but please follow the basic idea of this story.
