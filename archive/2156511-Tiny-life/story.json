He was awestruck at the lush, rolling hills and the white, puffy clouds; the closest thing he\u2019d ever seen was Central Park, but even that didn\u2019t compare.

He had been exploring the area for several hours, and had several more to kill before then big start-of-year assembly. He\u2019d said hi to a few people, but hadn\u2019t had a conversation lasting more than 5 minutes. Seeing a pretty young woman reading on a bench, he decided to go up and introduce himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jack.

She didn\u2019t look up, not breaking her concentration from her sketchpad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m Jack. Hi,\u201d he tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, you just looked like an interesting person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \u201cLook, buddy, I don\u2019t... where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here,\u201d Jack said, not for the first or the last time. She followed the sound of his voice, eventually finding his tiny form. Jack gave a slight wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see her eyes glaze as she went through The Process: trying to figure out if she was hallucinating, wondering if she was dreaming, searching for something to say, etc. He\u2019d seen that look as much as his own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating. There really is a three-inch man at your feet. I\u2019m Jack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Brooklyn,\u201d she said, reaching down with her pinky. You shook it. \u201cIs this your first day, Jack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I\u2019m still trying to figure this place out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn gave a slight laugh. \u201cSame, and this is my third year. You need any help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping to find a ride to orientation. Would you be willing to be that ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to ride me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her hand, and Jack climbed on. She set him down next to her on the wall and picked up her artwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready to go in like five minutes, just let me finish this real quick and then we can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, no rush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brooklyn finished, Jack took the opportunity to get a good look at her. She had long brown hair which almost reached her waist, framing her face and intense brown eyes. She had (comparatively) small breasts (though they were still huge to you) and a magnificent ass. She was wearing jeans and a brown leather jacket over a black Metallica shirt. She wore little to no makeup \u2014Jack couldn\u2019t tell which\u2014 but she didn\u2019t need it. Blushing, Jack realized his little trooper had made an appearance. He was suddenly glad she was focused on her art and not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Brooklyn said, closing her sketchpad. \u201cIt might be dangerous to carry you in my hand, so how about my jacket pocket?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, anywhere\u2019s fine. I\u2019m pretty much indestructible. Believe, me, after 18 years, I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, slipping him into a jacket pocket near her waist. It was shared by a large eraser almost half his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d She called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack poked his head out. \u201cReady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed over to the auditorium, where orientation was being held. On the way they talked about various college classes, with Brooklyn recommending some and not others. Jack listened, but he also made an effort to make his erection go down. He didn\u2019t want to be caught with an erection in the pocket of a girl he barely knew, and he definitely wasn\u2019t going to rub one out. After a few minutes of thinking about his turn-offs, it went away, to his relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they arrived at the auditorium. The receptionist was a little old lady who looked like she\u2019d been there since the university\u2019s founding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName?\u201d the old lady asked I\u2019m a deadpan voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m Brooklyn Calvert, bringing Jack...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaker,\u201d Jack chimed in, \u201cJack Baker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Enjoy the orientation.\u201d The old lady looked like she couldn\u2019t care less about whether or not he enjoyed the orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orientation itself was pretty dull. Much of it was about the importance of community and respect and a bunch of other stuff no one cared about. It didn\u2019t help that in the blistering August hear, it was pushing triple digit heat. Jacks mind wandered, but he snapped back to reality when he looked up at Brooklyn working on another piece and realized she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No big deal, </i>he told himself. <i>It\u2019s a bra. Not like she\u2019s naked.</i><br>\r\nBlushing, he turned back to the presenter and tried to focus, failing miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the presentation was over. All the new freshmen filed out with the same lack of enthusiasm that they\u2019d entered with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Brooklyn, putting her sketchpad back in her bag and turning to face Jack, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, most of the freshmen are getting roommates now, but the university didn\u2019t assign me a place to stay. I guess they figured I\u2019d find one on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have an apartment that I share with a roommate. If you\u2019d like to stay with us you\u2019re welcome to. You don\u2019t look like you take up a lot of space, and I know Izzy\u2019d love to split the rent three ways instead of two.\u201d Brooklyn gave you an indecipherable look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure, that won\u2019t be a problem. We\u2019ll just need to swing by the administrative building to grab my stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later you were settling into your new apartment. It was a studio apartment, with Brooklyn and her roommate\u2019s spaces separated by bookshelves. It looked like what he\u2019d expected of an artist\u2019s space: lots of art hanging, both Brooklyn\u2019s and other artists. It was kind of messy, with dirty laundry on the floor and unwashed dishes in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the mess,\u201d Brooklyn apologized, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know there\u2019d be anyone else here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ve seen worse,\u201d Jack assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a space for you just yet, but I\u2019m sure we can carve out something. Are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks stomach rumbled loud enough to be heard across the ocean. \u201cA bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get something started. Hey, Izzy!\u201d Brooklyn called, \u201cI\u2019m making dinner! Want anything?\u201d There was no response. \u201cShe must be in the zone. She gets like that when she\u2019s working on her art.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn picked Jack up and carried you to the kitchen counter, where she set you down. She walked to the mini fridge and bent over to look inside, giving you another look at her gorgeous ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s an artist too?\u201d Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmhmm. That\u2019s how we met. We took a ceramics class together, which we both <i>hated</i>. We kind of bonded through our mutual suffering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Jack said, since he had no idea how to respond to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Jack and Brooklyn sat down at the table (which was just an old wooden crate) with a plate of eggs. Jack walked over to the plate and took a bite, making a face. They were over cooked to the point of being inedible, and there was enough salt in them to recreate the Dead Sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re not the best, are they. I\u2019m not a great cook, but believe me,\u201d Brooklyn said, taking a bite and mirroring Jack\u2019s disgust, \u201cIzzy\u2019s worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Jack and Brooklyn watched Netflix on Brooklyn\u2019s iPad, since the tv had been broken in an indecent involving oranges, a candlestick, and a fuckton of butter. Jack decided not to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Jack looked up at Brooklyn, who was again drawing. Half an hour later she fell asleep, and her sketchpad fell next to him, showing a picture of Jack on her lap. He smiled, finally falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

He looked around, trying to figure out where he was before remembering the previous night\u2019s events. He looked over st the direction of the sound and saw Brooklyn\u2019s roommate, Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in old pajamas covered by a pink bathrobe. She was African-American, and, from what Jack could tell, quite tall, though he wasn\u2019t the best person to be the judge of that. She was picking up and stacking a bunch of pots and pans that she had apparently knocked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi!\u201d he called loudly. She didn\u2019t seem to hear him. \u201cHey!\u201d He yelled louder. She looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha- who are you?\u201d she said, walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jack.

Um, how do I...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be gentle, really. You can put me in a bag or your pocket, whatever works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy thought for a moment, then seemed to get an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait here,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dashed off, and Jack heard her rummaging somewhere. A minute later she returned with a huge pair of hoop earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver ridden in an earring?\u201d Izzy asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say that I have,\u201d Jack admitted, \u201cYou sure that\u2019s safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Izzy said, her smile growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough for me,\u201d Jack chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy ducked into her room (bookshelf-space?), emerging soon after wearing sweatpants and an old KMFDM shirt, which made the earrings look as out of place as a elephant in California. She picked Jack up and set him in the left earring. She let go of him, holding her hand under him in case he fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. I wish I\u2019d thought of this year\u2019s ago. Would\u2019ve saved me a lot of hassle,\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou set?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked (or rather, Izzy walked) to the dining hall, Izzy pointing out various buildings and landmarks on the way. A few people did a double take, but the walk passed without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the dining hall, Jack discovered, to his delight, that it was a buffet format. He and Izzy agreed to get a little of everything, because, as she said, \u201cThe food here\u2019s like Russian Roulette. You never know what you\u2019re getting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining hall was almost full, but they found an empty table and sat down. Jack walked around the edge of Izzy\u2019s plate, sample food as he went. She was right; some of the food was quite decent, while some of it wasn\u2019t fit for a dog to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you know your major?\u201d said Izzy, the sound muffled by the pancake in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t decided. I like literature, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do with a degree in it. My parents are pushing me to a career in law, but that\u2019s not really my taste, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. But don\u2019t worry about getting it figured out just yet. I thought I was going into sculpture. Took one class and found out I hated it. Now I\u2019m painting and I\u2019ve never been happier. You\u2019ll find your passion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast they cleared up and started heading back to the apartment. On the way...</span></div></div>",

He was either an older student or a very young professor, though no professor would have been caught dead wearing stained sweatpants and a snapback. He had light brown hair that was cut short, but whoever had done it had left it uneven.

I\u2019ll kill you! I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy got out her phone and started recording Dave\u2019s threats, which got more and more violent. A crowd started to gather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and your whole fucking family! Huh? Are you recording this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Izzy tapped the screen. \u201cAnd I just sent it to the Dean. If you feel like damage control, now would be the time. Otherwise I\u2019d just start packing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave looked terrified, but didn\u2019t say anything. After a moment he ran off, leaving Izzy and Jack behind. Sensing that the drama was over, the crowd started to disperse. Izzy exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m ok. What was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my ex-boyfriend. We dated for a few weeks my freshman year, his sophomore, but I figured out pretty quick he was a creep. He\u2019s been stalking me ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYikes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But now I\u2019ve got evidence, so they\u2019ll have to listen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned home to find Brooklyn painting. She was wearing baggy clothes which seemed to be more paint than fabric. She had rock music blaring, and seemed oblivious to their entrance. Izzy walked over and turned the music off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me? Why- uh oh. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Izzy filled her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least you have proof. He can\u2019t exactly accuse you of lying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.</span></div></div>",

He was born small, but has survived because he is, to the best of his knowledge, indestructible (yes, I know this is cliche, but just roll with it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses in this story aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be sadistic or evil. They can be angry (because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a natural human emotion), but they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t James Bond villains. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just people. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer them to be written in a more gentle light, but how far you take that is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purpose of this story is to give an alternative to people like myself who have been dissatisfied with other interactives. I want this to be a character-driven experience.
