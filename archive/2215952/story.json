            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As far back as anyone can remember, the life of a ninja is not an easy one, but compare it to the life of a tiny, then the ninja life is the easiest life, for at least they don't have to worry about getting stomped, crushed, eaten, enslaved, used like a new version of guinea pigs for experiments or as living targets for genin to jonin's weapons and jutsus. But it wasn't always like this, let's turn the clock back, back to the days of the first hokage Hashirama Senju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHashirama was just sitting in his office bored and he was about to go to the Kage-Summit to form a lasting peace with the new villages by sharing the tailed beasts Konoha had acquired with them, thus balancing power among them. Then afterwards he would return home to continue to spoil his first granddaughter, Tsunade and hopefully have more children with his beautiful wife Mito but as soon as he got up from his chair a Konoha shinobi entered with a horrified expression on his face as he said, \"L-l-lord Hokage I bring you terrifying news from border patrol!\" Hashirama raised an eyebrow at this and said, \"Alright calm down, take a deep breath and tell me what's the matter, you look like you just saw someone just disappear right out of their clothes right before your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shinobi did as he was told and said, \"That's exactly what happened!\", Hashirama had a stumped look on his face while he asked, \"pardon?\", The shinobi continued, \"My whole troop was just doing our shift watching over the border, then a strange fog bank rolled by us covering everything in it's path and when it fully passed us, at first we just thought of how odd it was until...until it happened, Mei suddenly began to shrink right before our eyes! She was shrinking fast until she was practically buried under her clothes at one-inch, and it wasn't just her Kenshin was then shrinking too, fortunately he stop at the one-inch mark, then Meko, then Yumi at one inch they were all shrinking around me and even now I'm beginning to feel the affects of the fog, I just dropped them off at the hospital\" and as he was talking he really was shrinking fast right before Hashirama's eyes, before he knew it, he literally had to dig through the shrunken shinobi's clothes to see him curled into a ball, naked at exactly one-inch tall placing the shrunken shinobi into to his hand Hashirama asked, \"Can you tell me where exactly did this fog come from?\" The shrunken shinobi said, \"That's the thing lord Hokage, I Don't know it just appeared out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Hashirama took the shrunken shinobi to the hospital to see if the medics can find a cure, he left for the Kage-Summit to hopefully get some answers, when he arrived to his shock and horror he saw that some of the other Kages have shrunken to exactly one-inch tall too. It was then they came to an agreement, until they discovered an antidote for this strange epidemic, no village was to attack each other under a forced ceasefire and true to Hashirama's word he even shared the tailed beasts Konoha had acquired, thus balancing power among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he returned to the village, he was further horrified at what he saw, apparently the fog didn't just affect shinobi and kunoichi, it also effected the civilians at random many people normal sized or shrunken were running around the place, the normal people who were looking for shelter against the fog and the shrunken people who were trying not to get crushed by the people's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHashirama then called for a immediate council meeting and began to try and think of a solution. They deliberated over it until they finally came to an agreement, one which Hashirama didn't like at all, first they were going to separate the shrunken people from the normal sized people by giving them a new name, the new name shrunken people to be known by was now \"Tinies\" second until they found a cure for the tinies they were to have to pay less than the normal people because of their new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHashirama knew that this was not going to end well, but it was a majority vote so he didn't have a choice. Fortunately for him and his family seemed to have been spared from the fog and as the years went by, things were not so bad for humans and tiny alike, until Madara Uchiha his old friend and rival eventually returned to Konoha with the Nine-Tailed fox under his control, challenging Hashirama to one final contest. The Nine-Tails' power, as well as Hashirama's efforts to capture and contain it, devastated the landscape, carving out what would later be called the Valley of the End. Hashirama spent the duration of their battle trying to reason with Madara, but Madara ignored his pleas and continued fighting until he was too tired to even keep his Sharingan active. This enabled Hashirama to distract him with a wood clone while the real Hashirama stabbed him in the back. Madara collapsed and, before dying, noted how much Hashirama had changed from when they were children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Tobirama hid away Madara's body and Hashirama's wife, Mito, sealed the Nine-Tails within herself in order to contain it's great power to Konoha's benefit. But the peace Hashirama had worked so hard for between not only the villages but also between the \"humans\" and \"shrinkees\" was starting to unravel; at some point in time Takigakure sent an assassin named Kakuzu to assassinate him. Although he defeated Kakuzu, many other wars began to break out and many more people began to shrink under the effects of the fog at random, and it was during one of these wars that Hashirama ultimately died. Before his death however, he had passed the title of Hokage to his brother Tobirama, but also instructed him not to mistreat the Uchiha clan or the tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the years rolled by, Tobirama would work tirelessly to achieve political stability and implement the institutions that made the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and prosperity, Tobirama's role as Hokage included helping Konoha's shinobi transition from valuing their clans above all else to valuing the village and everyone in it including the tinies. To this end, he created such institutions as the Academy, the Anbu, the Shrinkee Research and Development and the Chunin Exams. While largely successful, enough that other villages adopted the same organisations, the Uchiha clan resisted the loss of their autonomy. Already wary of the Uchihas because of their history with Madara, Tobirama created the Konoha Military Police Force for the Uchiha to run, publicly as a sign of trust, but primarily so that the Uchiha could focus their energies into something beneficial. Others however, would come to see this as a way to marginalize the clan. Like Hashirama before him, Tobirama tried to foster good relations with the other villages. He planned an alliance between Konoha and Kumogakure, but during a formal ceremony, he and the Second Raikage were attacked by the Gold and Silver Brothers and left near death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the First Shinobi World War, Team Tobirama, as well as Danzo Shimura, Torifu Akimichi, and Kagami Uchiha found themselves surrounded by Kumo's Kinkaku Force. With no way for all of them to escape, Tobirama volunteered to act as a decoy in place of Hiruzen. As he departed, he passed the title of Hokage to Hiruzen, before being killed by Kinkaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during Hiruzen's reign as Hokage that the relationship between humans and tinies in the village began to even worsen, while not his fault that the \"Humans\" were becoming more upset to see that these \"creatures\" were getting all the benefits while they had to pay at full price and they constantly demanded change, at one time a group of tiny oppressors suddenly launched an all-out attack on the tiny research and development building and ironically destroyed what they thought could've been a cure as well as all the notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hiruzen stepped down from being Hokage, the civilian council with full support from the village elders elected Danzo Shimura to be the forth hokage and thus began to make the leaf village into his own image and also made a law that tinies were no longer to be considered as equals with \"PURE\" humans and anyone who killed a tiny without prejudice was forgiven and pardoned. But thanks to the efforts of Hiruzen's two students Jiraya and Tsunade (who are tiny supporters.) they drove Danzo and his root anbu out of the village, but the damage he made has already been done even when Tsunade took over as hokage. She could not undo the law that Danzo created without the full approval from both sides of the council as well as the elders approval which she knew they would never do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time of Danzo's reign as Hokage ending and Tsunade becoming Hokage, inside a building that specializes in training tinies from birth, to become pets or sexual toys that will put dildo making companies out of business, was a young tiny boy at the age of eleven with lightly tan skin, blond spiky hair and blue eyes, while inheriting the shape of his mother's eyes and face. His trademark characteristic are the three whisker markings on his cheeks sitting in the corner of a cage with other Tinies who just finished their training awaiting the day when they well be shipped out of here to be sold to the humans for their pleasure. While he may not have been raised by his parents, due to them both already dead, he knew he had to get out of here and he wasn't going to be re-named by some human, he already had a name his mother gave him with her dying breath, his name was Naruto Uzumaki and he was going to get out of here one way or another...</span></div></div>",

Naruto was able to use \"some\" chakra, but only for wall walking and water walking. No other tiny never before him had any of these abilities. Why he was different, he had no clue, but that wasn't important right now, what was important was that he was going to use his chakra to escape from this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd carefully kept his ability to use chakra secret from the tiny breeders and trainers. No telling what they would do with a tiny capable of using chakra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his control over his chakra was bad, seeing as being a tiny, he was never trained as a ninja, so Naruto wasn't taught how to control his chakra. Which side or branch of his family his chakra came from, he had no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny minute now, the head tiny breeder would be here soon, to ship his cage-load of tinies off! Naruto glared at the bars, He grabbed them and tried to spread the bars just wide enough to make a hole to escape from the cage, Naruto struggled with all his might, until he felt the bars start to bend, until he fell on his butt feeling tired from his task, his hands were going to be very sore for a while, but when he opened his eyes and saw that he made the hole he needed to escape with his fellow tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just about whooped. He did it! \"Come on guys! We're getting outta here!\" he said, stumbling as he got to his feet. As he rushed towards his self made opening, he noticed none of the others were following his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Naruto stopped and turned to them, they were still sitting in place, He didn't understand. \"Everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're dead if we go out there...\" one tiny said as they all looked solemn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we stay here, we'll die faster! Don't you see guys, this is our only chance! What's wrong with all of you?! Freedom can be more than just a myth, more than a just a word, more than a dream! All we have to do is take it!\" Naruto pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other tinies grabbed Naruto by his shoulders, glaring at him. \"You stupid kid! Don't you get it?! What's the point in going out there?! If we stay, we at least have a chance of ending up with tiny supporters! Out there, what do we have you stupid kid?! NOTHING! But if you wanna throw your life away, then I'm more than happy to oblige!\" With that, Naruto was then forcefully thrown out of the hole he'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too tired and confused and he was sent flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto fell, he noticed he had fell off the shelf the cage was upon and he headed for the floor. When Naruto was about to impact, however, he was suddenly sucked into the air vent. Tossed around in it, Naruto was occasionally slammed around, absorbing the painful impacts, before the air current shot him out into the air outside the tiny breeding/training facility and his small, light body flew into the air, until gravity kicked in and he was brought down for a painful impact...</span></div></div>",

While he was asleep, a member of the Akimichi clan saw Naruto asleep and says, \u201cOh, would you look at that? It seems one of the entrees has escaped.\u201d The Akimichi member then plucks Naruto up from the ground quietly between their plumped index finger and thumb bringing him up to the Akimichi member's face and says, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just have to get it back to the kitchen.\u201d the Akimichi then takes Naruto inside the Clan restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Naruto finally woke up feeling he was being swayed back and forth until he realized that he was now in someone's hand and he looked around, his eyes widened and his skin paled at the sight, he was in a restaurant, and not just any restaurant as he saw the kanji for \"food\" on the walls of the place and he knew right then and there that he was inside the Akimichi clan's restaurant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto has heard of this place while he stayed at the tiny breeding/training facility from when he overheard the breeders talking about it, and if what he heard from them is true, then this place was said to not only serve BBQ and other meaty dishes, but it was mostly popular for serving tinies as a menu item, either alive or cooked. Naruto then struggled with all of his might to get out of the Akimichi member's hand, but he couldn't get the Akimichi's plumped fingers to even budge a centimeter, while his captor walked straight into the kitchen, When the Akimichi made it into the kitchen, the Akimichi up walked to a holding bin and then opened up a see thru bin clearly labeled \"Young Males\" and dropped Naruto inside and left. Naruto collided with a pile of naked and frightened boys roughly his age and they all had horrified looks on their faces. Naruto was scared to death too, as he now knew that very soon he was going to wind up as a part of some girl or guy's lunch. Everyone then started screaming as a few minutes later when they saw a female Akimichi member in a white chef\u2019s uniform, puffy hat and all, opened the bin and reached in and extracted five of them and Naruto was one of those five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, please, I\u2019m not supposed to be here! This is all a mistake!\u201d Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me neither!\u201d One of the other four boys cried, soon all the boys were screaming the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Akimichi chef just simply ignored them. Humming to herself she started to knead them like dough. Naruto felt her fat and plumped fingers probing and prodding. She rubbed and massaged his muscles in a very uncomfortable manner. She seemed to be \u2018tenderizing\u2019 him and weakening him so he wouldn\u2019t be as physically competent. Naruto knew that from the shrinkee training facility, for shrinkee live dishes, some chefs have to weaken and/or injure the shrinkees so they won't be able to escape from their plates or have enough strength to injure a customer's throat while going down to their stomach. A lot of times shrinkees would make it off on to the table and/or the floor and that didn\u2019t please customers. No one likes to eat dirty food. The five boys after being rubbed all over, were then set on a plain white dish. The only other things on the dish were two small containers. One was filled with dipping sauce, most likely BBQ, and the other was mustard. It seemed like they were going to be served like chicken nuggets. They wouldn\u2019t be cooked or placed in bun but instead to be picked up one by one, dunked in one of the sauces, and then swallowed down. Naruto prayed that he would end up on Shrinkee Supporters\u2019s plate by accident though he could have sworn that they\u2019d order something else and the chiefs just checked his plate before sending him and the others out to be served. His muscles were so sore that he could hardly even move. It was then that Naruto did something very uncharacteristic of himself, he began to cry. The five boys were then taken back out to the dining area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019m starving! Wait!, What!, only five!?\u201d A customer's voice boomed in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted more you should have ordered a bigger portion then.\u201d The waitress told the customer impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I just assumed there\u2019d be more. I mean, look at how scrawny they all are! Would any of them fill you up?\u201d The customer questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can bring you a second order if you want.\u201d The waitress suggested slightly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then I have to pay you even more of my hard earned Ryo!? Don\u2019t even bother!\u201d The customer yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress just set the plate down and left, angrily muttering to herself. The customer then drummed their fingers on their belly, the customer then glared down at their entree as if it was their fault that they weren\u2019t a large enough portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto in his pain as he raised his head only look up so he could see the face of the person(s) who would be eating him alive...</span></div></div>",

She wore a forehead protector with a single music note symbol. A pale olive green, sleeveless vest somewhat similar to a flak jacket; urban camo-patterned pants featuring a mixture of large and irregular patches of white, black and grey with a matching patterned skirt over it, and also an urban cammo patterned scarf around her neck. Finishing the look were black arm warmers and black sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then saw the giantess look down at him and grinned a sinister smile at what she just found before she moved to her hair and undid the bow. Then with Naruto in her hand, she tied his naked body with her bow and then re-applied it back into making a ponytail, making sure the battered Uzumaki Tiny was completely hidden inside her long black hair before she kept on walking thinking of all the things she will now do with her new pet...At least, before handing him over to Orochimaru! Exiting Konoha, she started going top speed for home, aiming to give the Tiny a ride a roller coaster would envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see much, Naruto could at least feel how the girl's hair flowed with each of her movements: his prison bounced when she jumped from tree to tree and when she make a quick turn, Naruto was whipped with her hair as she zoomed from one direction to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a well in the afternoon since Kin left the leaf village with the tiny she acquired in her hair and she saw she'd made it about half way to the boarder and no one had pursued her. So she decided to take a rest in a nearby hollow tree, she then undid her ponytail and grabbed her bow with the tiny she got and held him in her hand, she was a little glad she caught herself a male, she was getting bored with catching only female tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tiny, we're now halfway from the border of the land of fire, and since I'm resting, maybe I should tell you my name. I'm Kin Tsuchi; and as of now, I'm your goddess!\" she grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ARE cute, even by Tiny standards, I'll give you that.\" Kin said, looking him over. \"Now...what to do with you before we get home, Cutie?\"</span></div></div>",

Now line up my little tinies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 'Fasto' got in line she held up a bag that said on the cover \"Super Value Tiny Feed\" which is just bread crumbs, dried fruit and vegetables, nuts and pieces of dried meat for them to eat, and the breeder then said, \"Whose hungry? Come on now, beg nicely for me, That's right, aren't you all SUCH good little tinies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then poured the feed into a food rack that was outside the cage while the other side of it of it was inside of the cage and the tinies and Naruto began eating and the breeder said, \"Now don't eat too much, cause remember you have an inspection and final examination after you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some of the other tinies ate the feed, Naruto was getting himself a big drink from the drinking water bottle in the cage after he had some of the feed, seeing as he may never get another chance after today, after Naruto was feeling full it was time for there final examination as the breeder said with some excitement fully showing on her face, as she had a bit of drool dangling from her bottom lip just thinking of seeing Naruto's cock, \"Final Inspection and Examination Time, Isn't this exciting? Now let me see all of those tiny cocks, pussies and titties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the male tinies including Naruto stood up straight as they we already naked as the day they were born and faced the female breeder as she looked at the female tinies first and nodded saying,\"Good, looks like you females all have beautiful bodies, Now we need to check to see if the boys' \"little friends\" work well, now don't we?\" As she then started stripping herself of her top clothes and bra and showed her B cup sized breasts and smiled as she saw most of the male shrinkees including Naruto's penises at full attention and said in a proud voice, \"Sorry little girls, but it looks like I win, Naruto and all the men all seem to agree with me, even \"Fatso\" has got his up straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the female tinies didn't say anything in fear of making the breeder mad and just stayed silent and and after the breeder calmed herself down, she then began the actual examinations which were just like doctor check-ups as the breeder checked all of the tinies' pulse, heart-beats, breathing, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand when it was finally Naruto's turn for his examination the intercom went off and a female voice from the intercom said, \"Attention, you're attention please, will the breeder inside the tiny storage room please report to the manager's office and please bring Naruto Uzumaki with you please, and there will be another breeder to finish the shrinkee examinations for you, that is all.\" The announcement clicked off and went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeder and Naruto looked at each other and the female breeder said to the other tinies while Naruto walked into the palm of her hand, \"Now all of you, do what the next breeder says and look forward to your new lives out in the Konoha.\" and as she finished saying that, another female breeder came in to finish with the tinies' examinations as she then proceeded with Naruto in her hand to the manager's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Manager's Office ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the breeder and Naruto arrived at the manager's office they walked inside and the Manager thanked the breeder for coming but told her that she only wanted Naruto to come and told her to place Naruto on the table and the manager then dismisses the breeder and after the breeder closed the door, the manager rose from her chair and walked toward the window facing the direction of konoha and taking a deep breath and sighed and begins to speak to Naruto about her concerns while having her back facing him, \"Now Naruto, I know today is supposed to be a very special day for you, today is the day for you to finally leave the nest, and become a pet/sexual tiny for some lucky women in Konoha, but I just wanted to personally say that there is a third option you can take and I'm only giving you this opportunity.\" Naruto became very confused after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before Naruto knew it, the manager quickly turns around and snatches him up from the table and shoves him inside her pantyhose and when Naruto realized what happened he began to start squirming against her skin with his naked body as the manager attempts to leave from her office and going straight home, while fighting the growing urge to let out a sexual moan...</span></div></div>",

This story takes place in a alternate universe of either the Original Naruto series and or the Shippuden Series only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The shrunken people will be called either \"Tiny\" and/or \"Tinies\" by the \"normal\" populace, so they are not mistaken for humans in this story. Tinies are seen as either pests or pets, toys, even at times food, but overall slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. There was <u><b>NO</b></u> Kyuubi Attack when Naruto was born, but Minato and Kushina have already died after Naruto's birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. There was <u><b>NO</b></u> Uchiha Clan massacre, but there was also <u><b>NO</b></u> Uchiha coup d'etat either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Naruto is a male in this story, just wanted to make that clear. Also, his body is virtually indestructible, but he will still feel pain from his abusers and from whatever he goes through. Also, Naruto is also able to use chakra, but he can only use just enough for surface walking and/or water walking. No other tiny has any of these abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. If Naruto either escapes from the tiny breeding/training center or is sold to a tiny oppressor family, Then Naruto must be naked throughout the story, unless he escapes and runs into a tiny supporter then he can get clothes or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. If Naruto is shipped off to the pet store, he must be the most expensive and wanted male tiny there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. The members of the rookie eleven including the Sand Siblings and Sai in either the original Naruto series or Shippuden series will be either a year or two years older than Naruto (Sand siblings can be three years older than Naruto) and can act OOC. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Naruto can have sexual moments with women/girls regardless of them being either a tiny oppressor/supporter and their age must be at least around 10 years old or over. (Remember, Naruto is not counted as a human in this story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Naruto can interact with men/boys, but <u><b>NO</b></u> Yoai at all, only when they either try to kill him, Stomp on him, eat him, capture him or discipline him if he is owned by a shrinkee oppressor family, that's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Naruto can interact with animals and/or insects after he's either escaped the Tiny breeding/training facility or is owned by a family, but if Naruto is in a family that has a pet, then the interaction fully depends on how the animal(s) were raised to treat Tinies by their owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Please don't end the story line(s) too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. If Naruto is in a life threatening situation, please have at least ONE choice as his way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Please have good spelling and grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Please stick to the original plot of the story, no sudden changes in the story or it will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. Overall, please have lots of fun with adding in chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following is of the important characters and clans and how they see and treat Tinies in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki - The main character in the story, he is a pure born and breed Tiny, he dreams of living his life as a free Man or Tiny, to live his life on his own terms. He is very excelled in his profession of sexual practice from the time he was born and raised at the Tiny breeding/training facility, as he can make any woman/girl he has sex with cum in less than ten minutes despite the obvious size differences and keep on going for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Tiny Supporter List</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuzuka Clan - Sees the Tinies can serve the village to be potential spies and they are easily able to get into places \"Humans\" can't get into normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAburame Clan - Same views as the Inuzuka Clan and plans to make hives within their bodies and their future members for Tinies to live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyuga Clan Branch House - Feels great sympathy for the Tinies, as they were once humans and now they lost their rights to be seen and to be called humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata Hyuga - Despite being in the Hyuga Clan Main house, Hinata hates the way the main branch members treat their side-branch members and the way they also treat Tinies disgusts her and trains real hard to become the next clan head to not only permanently ban the use of the clan's \"Caged Bird Seal\" but also help the Tinies become human again, like her mother had wished for before her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi Clan - They believe that the Tinies are still humans and also deserve to have rights as well as any other human, and are working with fellow shrinkee supporters to find a possible cure to restore the Tinies back to human status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto Uchiha - Despite being in the Uchiha clan she feels that what the clan members as well as her husband Fugaku and her youngest son Sasuke have been doing to the Tinies is sick and wrong and she secretly helps stray Tinies when ever she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItachi Uchiha - While he may openly eat, stomp, crush and overall kill Tinies in front of a crowd or his clan. But once he is alone he will immediately vomit or carry the dead Tinies to a hidden garden at the compound and give them a proper burial while praying for their forgiveness and for their souls to rest in peace. When he can, Itachi also helps the Tinies by leaving them food and doll clothes and even makes clothing for the male Tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten - Comes from a family of Tiny supporters and has seen the things the Tinies go through first hand. (seen some genin to jonin openly use the Tinies as living targets and die violent deaths from weaponry to offensive jutsus.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Lee and Might Guy - Two open Tiny supporters with pride, they are jealous of the Tinies, since their difficult lifestyle would provide ample \"training\" opportunities. But also have seen how people sometimes treat them and finds those cruel acts to be \"un-youthful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNara Clan - They are smart enough to know the Tinies didn't ask or choose to be born smaller than an average human or to be treated like they are lesser beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamanaka Clan - With their mind transfer jutsu they would allow themselves to experience what the life of a Tiny is like and how they have to live, so oppression would be seen as unconscionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraya - One of Konoha's Sannin and keeper of the toad summoning contract, self proclaimed super pervert and the author of the Icha Icha series, he leads a massive spy network all around the elemental nations to keep an eye out for suspicious activity, he also travels the world in search of knowledge that would help his village and hopefully find a cure for the Tinies, He is also secretly envious of the Tinies for their size as he would have plenty of time to conduct his \"research\" for his latest book if he were their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade Senju - A descendant of the Senju clan and one of Konohagakure's Sannin, granddaughter of Hashirama Senju and grandniece of Tobirama Senju and summoner of the slugs, she is famed as the world's strongest kunoichi and it's greatest medical-nin. The repeated loss of her loved ones caused Tsunade to develop a crippling fear of blood and she would later abandon the life of a shinobi for many years. She is eventually persuaded to return to Konoha and take on the mantle of Fifth Hokage and even though she cannot undo the law that her predecessor Danzo Shimura has made, she will try everything in her power to find a cure for the Tinies and return them to human status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko Mitarashi - Enjoys scaring and/or teasing Tinies for a laugh, but she is VERY protective of them, between her being an outcast as a child due to her old affiliation with Orochimaru, and her contempt for her old teacher, she finds Orochimaru's being allowed to legally use Tinies for experimentation sickening. So against Tiny oppression, she regularly feeds any Tiny oppressor to her snake summons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai Yuhi - A female jonin and sensei for team 8 who normally doesn't mind Tinies, as long as they don't use their size for perverted acts, she usually uses genjutsu to make the oppressors think that THEY'VE become Tinies themselves, if she can get away with it without being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru - He was raised to have the Sarutobi Clan's views on Tinies, but he struggled with it at first until, he thought about if HE was a Tiny and if he'd enjoy being mistreated the way Tinies are just because they're smaller than an average human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Tiny Oppressor list</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUchiha Clan - Ever since the time of the first hokage and the strange shrinking fog came and began to shrink men, women and children at random, the Uchiha clan soon began to trap and collect Tinies as their personal slaves and/or property. They also believe that anyone who has been shrunken doesn't deserve to be considered a human and not even their own clan members are safe from their own abuse and it has been that way even after when Madara left the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkimichi Clan - Not really having anything against the Tinies, they just don't see a human being in their eyes, instead they see a new delicious bite sized snack and they even own restaurants around the leaf village that exclusively serve the villagers Tinies as a menu item, they even go so far to trap unfortunate Tinies to either slice up and cook them or serve the Tinies alive. Most Akimichi clan members love to eat Tinies alive and whole, so they also eat the spare Tinies to make room for more, sometimes violently chew them up or just swallow them alive to feel them desperately struggle inside their large stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyuga Clan Main House - Sees Tinies the same way as the Uchihas do, but as they treat the branch house members, they treat the Tinies far worse, as they openly place the caged bird seal on not only the branch members, but upon the Tinies as well. The Tinies feel more pain from the seal than the branch members do. The Hyuga clan elders have always approved of this for generations and they do not plan on ever stopping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji Hyuga - Despite being in the Hyuga branch family, Neji is a Tiny oppressor. As he thinks it was the Tinies' \"fate\" that they are what they are. (Remember Naruto is a Tiny in this story and is younger than Neji, so they never fight and thus Neji still blames Hinata for his father's death and hates her and because she openly supports the Tinies, he takes most of his frustrations out on them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruno Family - They may not be a ninja clan, but they do support the Tiny oppressors as they own many supply stores around the leaf village and always give the Tiny oppressors a 75% discount on their final purchases, but if they meet a Tiny supporter they raise the final prices to where the Tiny supporters can barely pay. (Sakura is an open Tiny Oppressor.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo, Civilian Council and Village Elders - After Hiruzen Sarutobi stepped down from being Hokage, the civilian council with full support from the village elders elected Danzo Shimura to be the forth hokage and thus began to make the leaf village into his image and also made the law that Tinies were no longer to be considered as humans and anyone who killed a Tiny without prejudice was forgiven and pardoned. But thanks to the efforts of Jiraya and Tsunade the remaining students of Hiruzen Sarutobi, they drove Danzo and his root anbu out of the village, but the damage he made has already been done even when Tsunade took over as hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba Inuzuka - Despite being in a Tiny supporting clan, Kiba never liked the idea of how creatures so small could ever be any possible use to the village and he has seen some of the clan members raise Tinies from the moment they are born, when he asked his mother Tsume Inuzuka why are they wasting their time and effort on non-humans whose value is lower than that of a simple doggy treat, he always hears his mother answer \"Because there could still be some traces of that shrinking fog in the air, that could shrink anyone of us at anytime and we need to be prepared to fully take care of our Tiny family members.\" However, Kiba being so stubborn to accept that, made it his personal mission in life to crush, swallow, stomp and kill as many Tinies as he could get away with and teach those \"fleas\" their proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUdon - A secret Tiny oppressor, he treats them well when others are watching, however when he alone with a Tiny, he enjoys torturing them in private. His preferred method of torturing Tinies, is drowning them in his snot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbiki - A sadistic jonin who works in Konoha's T&amp;I. He has a belief that pain is the most effective form of communication, and he is one of the worst Tiny-oppressors. He always tortures any and all Tinies he gets his hands on to death and then mounts the bodies on the walls of his home like an insect collection to be viewed publicity and is always looking for new tortures to try on Tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru - One of Konohagakure's Sannin, Summoner of the snakes and one of the greatest traitors to Konoha since Madara Uchiha, he loved the idea of Danzo's law fully pardons anyone who killed a Tiny as he was already using them as his experimental subjects, by injecting them with various different chemicals and diseases to possibly turn them into biological weapons. This went on until Sarutobi, Jiraya and Tsunade put a stop to his experiments and chased him out of the village, But he swore that one day he would return and shrink Konohagakure until it sat in the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarra - A shinobi of Sunagakure. He was made the jinchuriki of the One-Tailed Shukaku during his birth, causing the villagers and especially the Tinies of Suna to see him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew up hating the world and looking out only for himself, justifying his own existence by killing anyone, human and Tiny alike he comes across as proof of his existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Tiny Neutral list</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi Hatake - One of Konoha's best Ninja, Very lazy and tardy though. He doesn't really care one way or the other about Tinies, neither helping nor hindering the supporters or oppression of Tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoegi - Self proclaimed \"Sexiest Kunoichi of the Academy\", An avid Tiny collector. Her overall treatment of Tinies she collects depends on if she finds the Tiny in question is cute enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi Hyuga - The younger sister of Hinata, she sees Tinies as little more than toys, pets, or as living accessories for her to wear, yet keeps them alive as long as they behave themselves and don't try escaping from her once they're in her possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka - The daughter of Inochi Yamanaka and the Yamanaka clan heiress, she was raised to love all of nature by her parents, but one day during her childhood and during the reign of Danzo Shimura she saw something that shocked her, she was walking down the road with her mother and came upon a scene where a woman was standing in front of a tiny who seemed to be asking for money the woman viciously said no but the tiny kept asking her until she raised her sandal up and quickly stomped the tiny into a unrecognizable red smear on the ground. She then looked at Ino who was shivering behind her mother and said \"Listen girl, If you ever see a Tiny, don't be afraid to kill them, Danzo-Sama said it's OK to kill these parasites.\" Before the woman could say anymore, Ino's mother took her hand and quickly left with Ino, but Ino was already thinking about what the lady said and as the years went by she kept tormenting and/or injuring Tinies, but not killing them while her clan wasn't watching her. (Unless she goes into Naruto's mind then she can be a Tiny supporter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari - A kunoichi from Sunagakure's Kazekage clan, and the eldest of the Three Sand Siblings. She just never saw a point in either supporting or oppressing Tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKankuro - A shinobi of Sunagakure and one of the Three Sand Siblings. Sees Tinies as useful with helping him prep/repair his puppets, but useless in everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure I missed some other characters, but don't let that stop you. Please feel free to make the characters I missed anyway you want when it comes to either the treatment or mistreatment of Naruto and his fellow Tinies in the world.</td>",
