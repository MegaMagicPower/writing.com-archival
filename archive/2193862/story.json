Come on, you guys, move it!\" Malcolm urged excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're coming, we're coming!\" John grumbled back as the remaining four boys burst out of the tree line and into the clearing. Before them lay their destination: a vast, tranquil pond actually on the verge of being a lake, its mirror-like surface reflecting the cloudless blue sky above on the last day of summer vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it?\" Charlie questioned skeptically, the large redhead's arms crossed over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's right where Grandpa said it would be!\" Malcolm confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it grants wishes,\" John stated neutrally, his face showing neither belief nor doubt.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired boy nodded vigorously. \"Grandpa told me Grandma wouldn't even give him the time of day until he jumped into that pond and wished they'd live happily ever after together. They got married two months later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coincidence!\" Charlie scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not! Grandpa said when he settled her there was an old Indian legend that about how if you go into the big pond in the forest and wish for your heart's desire, you'll get it. That's why he did it. If it worked for him, it'll work for us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a shot,\" Ian contributed hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the very least, it'll cool us off after this hike,\" John pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we got to lose?\" Caleb asked, the undersized boy\u2019s muttered, plaintive question barely audible to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, whatever,\u201d Charlie grumbled, reaching down and pulling his shirt up over his head.  The others followed suit, stripping down to the bathing suits they\u2019d worn underneath their shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll except Caleb, who shifted nervously from one foot to another, still clad in his small white T-shirt, khaki shorts, and the locket with the picture of his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you remember to bring your swimsuit?\u201d Ian asked his best friend.  Of all of them, Caleb had the least money (although John was the one who complained about his own lack of pocket money the most).  He lived with his mother, who had never married and worked a minimum wage job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one,\u201d the dirty blond-haired lad admitted softly, self-consciously scuffing at the dirt with one worn sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ian hurriedly reassured him.  Because of his small size and poverty, Caleb got picked on fairly frequently at school.  Summer vacation was easily his happiest time, and this year\u2019s vacation was nearly over.  Ian did his best to defend his best friend from bullies.  He was quick and athletic, but short and sadly lacking in muscle, so there was a limit to how much could help, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not once he made his wish.  Then HE would be the biggest, strongest kid in school, and anyone who wanted to hassle Caleb would have to deal with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five boys lined up on the rocky, forested shore.  Glancing over the body of water, John realized what was so odd about it: it lacked any lily pads, pond scum or clouds of mosquitos hovering above it.  It was like plant and animal life avoided this pond.  Why? Did that mean the legend was true? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wasn\u2019t given any further time to ponder this, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, on the count of three!\u201d Malcolm intoned.  \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, all five boys leapt into the pond.  </span></div></div>",

They'd all been exploring for weeks as a group, to search for this magical pond, one that supposedly granted wishes. Even now, there was no doubt that in the swirling energies of the water just below them, the stories were all very, VERY true. So the five friends, Caleb, Ian, John, Malcolm, and Charlie, jumped in, and as they hit the water, each of them made a wish deep down in their heart of hearts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to be big and strong.\" wished Ian.<br>\r\n\"I wish to be rich and famous.\" wished John.<br>\r\n\"I wish to be smart and clever.\" wished Malcolm.<br>\r\n\"I wish to be popular and loved.\" wished Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb however, he wished for something very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish all the wishes other people made here could only ever benefit me, and only in the strongest possible way.\" wished Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the five friends began to open their eyes...Ian did not see big bulging muscles on his frame; John did not have millions of dollars to his name; Malcolm was not a genius scientist; Charlie wasn't any more popular than he had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they did see was Caleb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb wasn't the skinny preteen he was a few moments ago. Now he was at least 3 or 4 inches taller than any of them. It didn't stop there though, muscles...powerful, throbbing, writhing, rippling muscles covered Caleb's body. An arm was brought up, and it gave the other four of them feelings of power, authority, intimidation deep in their very souls, as if to see his arm was to be made subservient to it. His chest wasn't even muscular...as if one could call his pectoral muscles that anymore, a better word was probably 'armor', so invincible and indestructible did they look to the four other boys. His legs could not be spotted beneath the swirling and ebbing water, but there was no doubt he was just as huge down there as his upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the four saw a tremendous mansion, utterly stupendous in it's opulence only a mile from where they were, and they could see it, as the wooded area around the pond was now completely cleared, as part of the greater estate of the mansion. Said mansion overlooked the town where the five boys lived, but even that was changed drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery building was marked with a symbol involving a CC, which stood for 'Caleb Conglomerate', the name of the collected companies and businesses Caleb himself owned. The other four boys now lived in homes designed by Caleb, built by Caleb's construction crews. They wore clothes designed by Caleb's design company, produced in Caleb's factories, and so on. The town WAS Caleb's in all but name, really, let alone the billions and billions of dollars of assets and other wealth he possessed thanks to his super-genius brain, multiple doctorates and dozens of masters degrees, all at 12 years old still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here, Caleb...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Security!\" was the first word out of the new Uber-Boy's mouth. A powerful, rumbling boom that shook through the water and the other four in the pool. His voice sounded like it did before, that of a 12 year old boy. But there was...authority behind it, it was not simply the voice of a 12 year old, but a being of high nobility, a kind of modern royalty, like a 21st century prince, and he commanded respect and awe as such.<br>\r\n\"No!\" cut through the silence, \"I will not accept this!\" cried Ian. \"What did you do to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turned around in the water, to face the much weaker looking Ian, his deep, rich sky-blue eyes staring practically through to his soul. It stopped Ian's protests dead in their tracks. The point was then driven home by Caleb's hand rocketing outward and grabbing Ian by the throat, lifting him effortlessly out of the water, holding him in a death-grip. Tears began to stream down Ian's cheeks, as the look in Caleb's eyes showed such a disdain towards his friends that he knew deep down that Caleb could kill him right now, and not show the slightest, tiniest bit of remorse about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to tell you four this once, because we're friends. This is now my property. You four will be removed from the premises, and we will never see each other in person ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Friends'...the word was dripping, oozing with sarcasm. He called them his friends, but the disdain, the uncaring attitude, the look he gave the four of them, it was clear any possible HINT of friendship was now completely and totally snuffed out in Caleb's mind. They were less than ants to him anymore, as even ants could serve some purpose, and to Caleb, they weren't even that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was then dropped back into the water, and Caleb made his way towards the shore. As he got closer, his security arrived, and pointed their guns at the four friends. They surrounded the pond, allowing no means of escape whatsoever. A warning shot was fired near Malcolm. The guards were using live ammunition! They were actually shooting to kill! No...they WOULD kill, the four boys realized this, they would be shot dead if they didn't get out of the pond immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, as he got onto land, his feet stepped onto a literal red carpet, that his staff had rolled out for him, so that his feet were not sullied by being made to walk upon ground that was unworthy of him. Several servants bowed as he passed, each of them wearing a blindfold, so as to not gaze upon Caleb without his permission; for to see him in person was, to many, a reward in and of itself, and thusly, his own servants would only be occasionally granted permission to be able to gaze upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four however were all roughly hauled out of the water and carried by the security guards to the front gate of Caleb's vast, 1,000 acre estate, which overlooked their hometown. They were tossed outside, what things they had left behind were already being collected and burnt as common litter. The four got up, collected themselves and looked back at the massive, 25 foot tall gate, which looked less like an entrance, and more like a modernized medieval gatehouse, with multiple towers, cameras, and guards watching outside, with 20 foot walls stretching for miles in both directions across the entire perimeter of the estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Caleb had actually made his wish with the intent of sharing in all of this with his friends. He had guessed, correctly, that each one would wish for something different, and he figured that he would gain all their wishes together, then USE that to retroactively grant them their wishes later. He could've helped Ian grow muscle either through helping him exercise or using his mind or wealth to speed up the process; John's wish was easy, since money is no problem for him now; Malcolm's would have been a little harder to pull off, but something could have been figured out; lastly Charlie's wish was far more difficult to figure out, but again, Caleb didn't deny there must be some kind of solution for that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the old Caleb. The old version of himself would've cared about his friends. The person he was now, saw them as the immature, short-sighted, sad, childish nobodies they really were all along. None of them truly understood anything, what the world was like, or how they could make a change in it. Before, he had been Caleb Miller, now however, he was <u><b>CALEB MILLER</b></u>. What was the difference? Simple. Before nobody knew him. Now, everyone knew of him. Every person on Earth had bought at least one product or service he provided. Every government had massive business dealings with his companies. Every world leader would call HIM for the privilege of asking his advice on important matters. When he, Caleb Miller, spoke, the world listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving, Caleb got to his office and sat down in his chair, deciding...</span></div></div>",

Really his perfect eidetic memory he now possessed meant he knew everything right away without having to look, but he still wanted to look at it just because he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up his financial records he saw his own personal wealth and net value clocking in at 100 billion USD, with the total net worth of everything he owned, ran, or otherwise played a part in as part of his 'Caleb Conglomerate' umbrella breaking 1 trillion USD. The records were also being updated in real time, and Caleb could watch the number slowly ticking higher and higher as he looked through everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's collected businesses were the largest single employer on Earth, directly or indirectly employing 100 million people worldwide, including over 15 million jobs in the United States itself. Amongst his accomplishments was a movie he'd written, directed, produced, and starred in called \"Hercules Unchained\", which was the highest grossing film ever made, bringing in 2.5 billion dollars at the box office worldwide, and winning more awards than Caleb really bothered to keep track of, considering them little more than minor trifles by a bunch of ass-kissers in the movie industry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis largest accomplishment thus far, which was saying something considering he was Caleb Miller, was a drug guaranteed to cure cancer, any cancer, with a single dose, and without a single negative side effect. Once it was finished being fast-tracked through the FDA, cancer would not be the life-threatening, debt-creating monster that it had been for so many years, and instead it would be little more than a slight annoyance a quick doctor's visit couldn't fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue running through his assets, a special phone rang. Caleb rolled his eyes and gave a sigh of annoyance, before picking it up, \"Hello, Mr. President.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the other side spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know things in the Middle East are tense right now. But every country there already agreed to the treaty I proposed. Congress also agreed to accept the terms to after I spoke to them. You just need to follow the plan I gave you Mr. President, a plan I made at great personal expense to myself I might add, and expect reimbursement on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice spoke more, and Caleb held back another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I understand. I know you want to let me be the President instead, but the Constitution says you have to be at least 35 years old to have the position. Yes, I know Congress is trying to hurry through an amendment to let me run next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice continued to speak. This was so annoying, he had more important things to consider than being President.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. President, I get it, this is a lot to handle, really. But I wrote down what to do, just follow it, and everything will be fine. It might even be enough to get you that second term I know you were wanting, and if you do what I laid down, you can run on being the President that finally brought peace to that region at long last, I'm sure it'd be an easy victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my policy on that. I don't endorse any politicians. Anyways, I have other things I need to do today, goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he hung up on the President, and let out a slow breath, running his hand through his hair, smiling to himself as he watched the massive, 40+ inch upper arm he had flex up into it's full, head-crushingly huge size. Damn that felt good having all that muscle, it felt REAL good. Feeling up his flexed up bicep with his free hand, he enjoyed the power he could sense inside of his muscles, he knew he was powerful, truly powerful, beyond any other lesser human on Earth, breaker of so many weightlifting records, the only ones left were the ones he hadn't tried to go for yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stood up and stretched a bit, composing himself and leaving his office again. Dealing with that had annoyed him, and he needed to find some way to relax after that. He found that by...</span></div></div>",

He had but only one wish, \"More.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went in, he was a billionaire super-genius. When he came out, he was a trillionaire ultra-genius. When he went in, he had an equal voice on the world's stage as many powerful countries did. When he came out, there was not a question of a doubt who was truly in charge. When he spoke before, others listened. When he spoke now, others obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got back out of the pond, his feet caused quaking, the city shook under his step. The Earth was forced to move from his power, forced to accept him. His breath casually blew over trees. His bicep felt as if Superman could be effortlessly squeezed into nothing from the power he now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrillions sat in his name, and the general thought process was now that not only was Caleb's total domination of the Earth an eventuality, it was inevitable. Thus, people were signing over fortunes and businesses by the day to him to speed it up. The logo for his wholly-owned company now was a picture of a flexing arm with the Earth superimposed over the bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the whole city had been remade to make way for the palatial estate he had,. The wishing pond was even enclosed in a room only he could enter. But to say it was lavish was an understatement. Every inch of the building was a temple to Caleb's greatness, built to his precise specifications. The walls were covered in pictures detailing every moment of Caleb's life, like the tomb of an ancient Pharaoh. Unlike kings of old however, these tales were not exaggerations, nor falsehoods, but pure, unadulterated truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically all the world's treasures (including plenty he'd done himself or had commissioned) sat in room after room that only existed to display his overwhelming wealth. In what was his office now was more akin to a throne room, where others stood and awaited HIS word. There was no longer any semblance of 'equality' between himself and those who met with him. He did not schedule anything, he simply told people what, when, where, and how things would happen, and if they didn't, they would find themselves out on the street. There were no 'negotiations' anymore, Caleb's word was final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Caleb rested himself upon his throne, and looked out, deciding to...</span></div></div>",

But for Caleb, it was simply Tuesday. There was never any doubt that he would one day rule, and to think otherwise really would've been crazy. So when he made his declaration, the world spoke back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail Caleb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transition only took a few weeks, since much of the work had been done already with his global domination of every possible market in every country, so it was primarily the bread and circuses to show the world things were changing. A few countries held out, but not long, and were quickly and quietly overthrown by pro-Caleb groups who then promptly declared their place to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb took no title. He did not need one. Oh certainly he was given plenty of titles, like Emperor, High King, Padishah, Sultan, and more, but he only required his own name to show his authority. Anyone else in the world named Caleb was required to immediately change their name to something else and apologize to Caleb for their transgression, which of course, they all did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully Caleb did not really desire more power, it was more a side effect of the real reason he did it: He was tired of the inefficiency of the world. He despised it, people constantly making mistakes and being wasteful. With his rule, the world's resources would be put to their best possible use, and that included the people. Oh he certainly wasn't going to enslave the planet or leave everyone in poverty. But it was clear they needed HIS way of doing things, or else they were all just going to ruin the planet with their endless stupid ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were after all, cogs in the machine, but HE was the one actually turning the crank. The 'cogs' though they could move on their own, but were it not for his guidance, they'd just be spinning in place wasting time and energy, and thus with him, he would put them all to the best possible use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, for his next move, he...</span></div></div>",

He pulled up his phone and called his personal driver. Within seconds his driver appeared, driving an expensive 20XX Caleb Miller brand car. The car was a dark black, and the hood ornament was a mini figure of Caleb, flexing his mountainous biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the car, Caleb simply tells him to go to his most esteemed club, appropriately named Club Caleb, or just CC. They get there immediately, as Caleb's car has a lane dedicated to him and and him only. CC is a very modern looking club, adorned with some of the most contemporary designs. All along the walls were posters advertising his many ventures, like movies, clothing, even furniture. The entire place was sort of a second home to him as well, as it houses a private room for him upstairs, and a state of the art gym for him to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb only had to walk up to the bouncer and he was immediately let in. The club was strictly 21+, except for of course Caleb. As he entered the club he saw many familiar faces. Celebrities which had starred in his movie alongside him, photographers responsible for capturing his physicality, and the most beautiful supermodels that he had invited to come take pictures with and just hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Caleb!\" The models greeted him in a singsong way. He simply flexed a bicep at them to sedate them and kept walking. Right to the VIP section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a bit redundant to have a VIP section in one of the most prestigious clubs in the world, but to Caleb it made sense. The wait list to get into the VIP lounge was years long, and the cost to enter was a hefty sum of 1 million dollars. Caleb parted the curtains and entered the lounge. The walls were lined with mirrors, and murals of him posing in his Caleb Fashion line. Even a fountain of Caleb was right in the dead center of the room. The lunge was much less crowded than the general club, with only around 30 or so inside. These people were the best of the best, in Caleb eyes at least, which is all that mattered. The top designers, actors, and supermodels all gathered here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb prowls around, he decides to spend his time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clad in his new garb he strode into his personal gym.  It was relatively small, but spotlessly clean, and designed to challenge great Caleb's superhuman, mind-shattering might.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on the bench, the twelve year-old titan did a quick warm-up set of twenty presses with two tons on the Olympic bar.  Getting up, he adjusted the bar to four thousand five hundred pounds, and did another twenty presses.  Then five thousand pounds and finally up to three tons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally prudence would require a spotter to be in place to safeguard the one using the bench press, especially when such insanely massive amounts of weight were being lifted.  Given that no five people working together could begin to support even the minimally loaded bar, however, Caleb had previously spent ten minutes inventing a machine designed to stop the bar should the virtually impossible happen and it slip from his grasp.  Now the small, completed machine stood behind the bench, it's two protruding arms curving up under the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing at last with the bench-press, Caleb rose and moved on to the leg press, the pull-downs and the dumbbells.  As his work-out progressed he felt his annoyance wash away.  It was inherently satisfying and pleasurable to actually <i>use</i> his supreme physical strength, to gauge the growing, overwhelming raw power of his exquisitely sculpted, mammoth musculature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last he had finished, the stunningly gorgeous He-Boy juggernaut entered the room opposite the locker room, stripping off his clothing and stepping into his private hot tub.  With a sigh of pleasure Caleb submerged his fantastic frame beneath the warm, bubbling water.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After fifteen minutes the bronzed, perfect preteen mountain of muscle which had so enthralled millions of filmgoers last year emerged from the tub, took a monogrammed towel to dry himself, and went back to the locker room, where fresh clothes awaited him.  Redressed and revitalized, Caleb decided to . . .           </span></div></div>",

Turning back around, he leapt forward and did a cannonball into the center of the pond, making another wish upon impact.  The resultant waves engulfed the other four boys, sweeping them off their feet.  All soon surfaced again, choking and sputtering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do that for?!?!\" Charlie howled impulsively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only two strides Caleb came to stand towering over Charlie.  Looking down at the much smaller child with eyes which seemed to pierce to the very center of his soul, Caleb calmly replied, \"Because I wanted to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his newly deep, resonant voice there wasn't even a hint of apology or defensiveness, only the proud, self-confident assurance of an absolute monarch, one whose smallest wishes were his worshipful subjects life-or-death commands.  Unspoken, but crystal-clear was that the transformed Caleb considered his given reason more than sufficient justification for any conceivable action he might take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie shrank backward in fear, as much from Caleb's kingly alpha male aura as from the other boy's now-considerably greater stature and nigh-unimaginably superior physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing more distant, Ian found the courage to voice his distress.  \"What the heck happened?  How come I'm not big and muscular and you are?\" he questioned even as he vastly understating his best friend's size and chiseled bulk.  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Where's all my money?\" John demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't I any smarter?\" Malcolm bemoaned.  \"What went wrong?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing went wrong,\" Caleb reassured them in his vibrant, manly tones, his spoken words instantly causing them to feel better.  \"All the wishes were granted, and I wished for your wishes to benefit only me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant you could have heard a pin drop, as the other twelve year-olds processed exactly what they had been told.  Then the quiet was shattered by a shouted cacophony of protests and complaints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was Caleb's natural majestic dominance that he instantly silenced the four of them with a single glance, leaving them feelings like guppies sharing the pond with a Megalodon.  It wasn't just that the imposingly enlarged, colossally built Caleb could obviously effortlessly crush any of them between thumb and forefinger; it was the overwhelming<b> POWER</b> the veritable superboy radiated! The new Caleb could have <u>literally</u> held the four paralyzed by the irresistible force of his unconquerable will alone!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm everything each of you ever wanted to be, and so much more,\" Caleb told them.with quiet, matter of fact honesty.  \"Accept that and, like the rest of humanity, be content in my world-spanning shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words said great Caleb looked away from them, deliberately releasing the worthless children from his mesmerizing authority.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone could speak a word in response, but Malcolm found solace in action, closing his eyes to make a wish.  In doing so he missed seeing the shadow of a smile on Caleb's godlike visage.       </span></div></div>",

Listen, I'm sure you had some good reason you made to take our wishes, perhaps you wanted to have all our wishes combined in yourself, then you could help make ours come true later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb balled up a fist and reared his arm back, muscles surging to life as he readied himself to end the piece of trash that dared speak back to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then he stopped, and lowered his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan...he was right. That's exactly what he'd wanted to do, he WANTED to have all their wishes combined into him, then he would use the effects of his 'super-wish' to help them out instead. This...this wasn't who he was. He wasn't this kind of person. This was not his wish, nor how he wanted it to turn out. He never wanted to see humans as insects, or less than nothing, let alone his own friends. He was not that kind of monstrous person to behave in such a manner.

In the meantime, all he could do was wait, dream, or\u2026 Wish for strength, athletic skill and big muscles. Now, here he was, about to jump into this pond with his four other buddies, so what was he going to wish for? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan closed his eyes and quietly wished for amazing athletic skill in increasing measure, for ever-growing muscles on his frame, which would automatically lead to increasing physical strength. He wanted to be stronger. He wanted to feel stronger. He wanted to have big muscles. He wanted to feel his muscles as they grew, all the time. He could feel it. He could picture it. Yes, he could almost taste it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked down and leaped from the ledge into the blue water below, while holding on to those thoughts. It took just a few seconds for his body to plunge into the cold water. As he went down, he closed his eyes. It was cold. It was dark. It was quiet. He held his breath as his body went under. It was very, very quiet. He thought about it again. To be athletic. To be strong. To have big muscles. It would be so awesome. It would be very cool. It would make him so incredibly happy. He wanted to be the best. He wanted to be the fastest. He wanted to be the greatest. He wanted to be the strongest. It was such a simple wish, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir was running out. Ian opened his eyes and looked for the source of light. That\u2019s where the surface was. He swam up. He arrived. He opened his eyes and he took a deep breath. All the other guys were laughing and cheering. It didn\u2019t matter what they were saying. He knew what he had wished for. He had made his wish as he jumped into the pool and the thoughts of his wish were on his heart and on his mind as he went in the wishing pond. So, it should have worked, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan just splashed around and dove under a few times until he had enough. He swam to the shore and he got out. The breeze made him feel cold. He looked for a towel and dried off as quickly as possible. Later, he found himself hungry as a wolf. He was starving. He had two hamburgers from the grill and a big bottle of Coke. He got back in his tent and he was the first boy who crashed. However, he felt wonderful when he woke up the following morning, before everybody had to catch the bus ride home. He felt energized. He wondered about the wish. What would happen to him? He didn\u2019t think about it until much later that day, after he arrived home from the trip to the pond, when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He dashed for the kitchen and made four peanut butter sandwiches. He sat at the dining table and at them with two big glasses of milk before he took a long, hot shower; he changed into sweats and then he crashed on his bed. The poor kid slept all afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan woke up over four hours later, feeling refreshed and awake. He stumbled into the living room and turned on the TV while his mother was in the home office, working on her finances. When she came out, she found her son on the couch watching ESPN on TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sweetie! Want anything to eat? You slept for over four hours! You were very tired from that hike, huh?\u201d his mom, June, asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan let out a loud yawn, stretching his arms and legs. Luckily, he was wearing long sweatpants and a hoodie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling so tired and so hungry! That hiking trip just wore me out for some reason!\u201d Ian sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not used to being out in the sun that long, Ian. It\u2019s better you stay indoors for the rest of the day. You actually got a little bit of a tan out there!\u201d his mom smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tan? Really?\u201d Ian asked, as he looked at his hands and feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I see some redness in your face. Go ahead and take off your clothes so I can rub some lotion on you, sweetie!\u201d his mother suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, mom. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d The boy replied, as he ran back to his bedroom while his mother got some lotion out of the medicine cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan wandered into his small bedroom. His room was extremely neat and organized. The boy was an absolute neat freak, with all his colored shirts on the left side of his dresser and his white shirts on the right side. All his school textbooks were on the top shelf of his bookcase, in alphabetical order, while his reading books were on the shelf below. His shirts were hanging in the closet sorted by colored to sports teams and dress shirts. He always knew where everything was, and he loved having things in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed his gray sweatshirt first, neatly folding it on his bed. Then, he removed his gray sweatpants, hanging that in the closet. Finally, he put on his shorts, which were black, matching his black socks. Heaven forbid if his clothes and socks were not color-coordinated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking over to his dresser, he passed his long, full-body mirror. He glanced over and noticed his hair, his teeth, and his muscles. Wait. Hold up. His muscles!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan stopped and walked back and paused before the mirror. He noticed something that he had never seen before. Ian had always been skinny as a board. So, what were the lumps on his arms? Were those muscles? He had these small bulges between his shoulders and his elbows! Where did those come from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a fist with his right hand. He raised up his right arm. Holy smoke! The bulge on his arm just\u2026 grew! That\u2019s muscle, right? He did the same to his left arm. Same thing! He had to check and make sure he was becoming more muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan ran to the desk and he opened his laptop. He clicked his mouse on the web browser, which navigated to his favorite website, which was YouTube. He entered \u201cmuscles of the arm\u201d in the search box and watched part of the first video which popped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 those are the biceps, and these are triceps?\u201d Ian wondered, feeling the hard lumps on his arm. He began to ask himself where they came from, when he suddenly remembered the wish he had made earlier when he was about to jump into the pond during his hike with his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis couldn\u2019t be true, could it?\u201d Ian whispered to himself. \u201cDo muscles grow that fast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe vaguely remembered his wish. He had wished for strength, athleticism and bigger muscles in increasing measure. To become stronger, all the time. Every day! Was it really happening? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie? Are you still coming? I want to rub some lotion over your body, Ian!\u201d his mother shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m coming, mom!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan had completely forgotten about his mother. He turned around and ran towards the living room.

Your birthday is coming up and it looks like you\u2019re hitting a growth spurt!\u201d June smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 Do I look any bigger to you? Tell me, mom!\u201d he asked her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, of course, Ian! Your muscles are bigger everywhere! On your arms, your chest, your legs! You\u2019re a growing boy!\u201d she smiled, as she rubbed lotion on his legs. \u201cThat\u2019s also why you\u2019re eating and sleeping so much!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan yawned again, just as his stomach let out a loud rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness! Hungry again? Is all that food going straight to your muscles?\u201d his mom chuckled, while she rubbed lotion on his calves and glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, mom! Come on!\u201d Ian sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got some grilled chicken with broccoli in the oven, sweetie. I want you to have some vegetables along with some good chicken. It\u2019s a good source of protein, you know.\u201d She told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I need protein for?\u201d he wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need protein to grow your muscles, sweetie!\u201d June nodded, as she finished up rubbing lotion all over his back and shoulders. \u201cYou are becoming such a healthy, strong young guy! I love you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune kissed him on the cheek as she got up and walked over to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw! MOM!\u201d he protested, wiping his cheek with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome and sit down in the kitchen, sweetie. I\u2019ll get you a plate with some food!\u201d she smiled, as Ian sat down and ate. He prepared a glass of water and he had his dinner with his mother. Once he was done, he went back into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minutes on the computer, he started to doze off. He turned off the laptop and crawled in bed. He fell asleep and slept for the next twelve hours straight. It was Sunday morning, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he look like the following morning? How would Ian feel? How big would his muscles grow while the boy slept for 12 hours? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was already after 10 o\u2019clock in the morning when Ian heard his bedroom door open. A figure quietly walked in the room and bent down by his bedside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIan? Wake up, sweetie. It\u2019s after 10 already. You\u2019ve been asleep for over twelve hours!\u201d June said quietly as Ian rubbed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, wow\u2026 Twelve hours? Ohhhh\u2026\u201d Ian sighed as he let out a deep yawn. He opened his eyes and looked around the room. His mom had just walked out of the room. Ian felt refreshed and awake, but he also felt bigger and\u2026 heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, I must have gained weight or something. Why am I feeling so heavy?\u201d he mumbled to himself as he crawled out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stumbled into the bathroom, where he took care of business. Then, when he spotted the digital scale on the floor, he hopped on. He remembered that his weight had been holding at a steady 120 pounds for awhile already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped on the scale and gasped when he saw the reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hundred-and-forty-seven pounds? Say what?\u201d the boy gasped, realizing he had gained 27 pounds in 2 days. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped off the scale and waited for the device to reset. Then, he stepped on the thing a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c146.9 pounds? What the heck?\u201d he mumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the display for a few seconds before he stepped off and walked back to his room. When he passed the mirror, he stopped to check out his reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest seemed bigger now. He had some pecs sticking out. His stomach wasn\u2019t flat any longer. A nice washboard of abdominal muscles, in three rows and two columns, started to form over his stomach now, hard as a rock. He never had abs before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the--?\u201d he gasped as he ran his hand over his abs. \u201cI never had that before!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his fingers over his thick, round pectorals. His shoulders seemed significantly wider as they were sticking out from his chest. Plus, his arms seemed wider, with his enlarged biceps and triceps. He really started to look like an athlete, now! His forearms seemed to increase in width as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, as he examined his reflection in the mirror even further, he noticed how his quads had grown somewhat wider than they were before. Finally, his calves appeared to be bulging from the back of his legs. Sure, all that muscle must have contributed to his weight gain! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing just his shorts, Ian quietly sauntered into the living room, where his mother was sitting on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s my little man?\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou must be starving! Guess what I made to eat, big guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 what?\u201d he stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and walked up to him, kissing him on his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re growing so fast! We need to start talking about your birthday, sweetie! It\u2019s next week!\u201d June smiled as she walked into the kitchen and set a plate with pancakes on the kitchen table. \u201cI made you some pancakes! Your favorite!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026 Thanks, mom!\u201d he smiled, as he walked up to the dining table and sat down in his usual seat. She set a plate with two pancakes before him, along with a bottle of syrup. She also handed him some toast with peanut butter and jelly. Lastly, she poured him a glass of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan wolfed everything down and he could even go for more. He got a second plate with pancakes, before he was satisfied. He wiped his plate clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my little guy doing today?\u201d June asked him, as she was gathering the plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 I\u2019m going to the park. I can get some exercise there, until I get my gym membership on my birthday!\u201d he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll get you the membership at GymWorld for your birthday!\u201d she grinned. \u201cAt the rate you\u2019re growing, you\u2019ll be turning heads at school in no time!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the guys are getting gym memberships, mom.\u201d He just shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, come on, buddy. So, tell me. Who\u2019s the girl, huh?\u201d she cooed, as she sat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Who? What girl?\u201d he wondered. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lifting weights and putting on all that muscle! Come on! Do you have a girlfriend?\u201d June continued to interrogate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM! No! No! NOOO! I don\u2019t have a girlfriend! What are you talking about?\u201d he groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Well\u2026 You\u2019re not being bullied at school, are you? I don\u2019t want to get calls or emails from the Principal saying you\u2019re beating up other kids at school, Ian!\u201d June replied in a stern tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Oh, mom! Come on!\u201d he whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune leaned in quietly and whispered in his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2026 Do you have\u2026 a boyfriend?\u201d she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM! Stop! Stop it!\u201d he protested. \u201cJust STOP already! You\u2019re being nosey!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled before standing up and marching into his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. If you\u2019re going to the park, take your phone with you. Be back before noon so we can have lunch, okay?\u201d she shouted at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on his t-shirt, socks, clean shorts and tennis shoes before heading out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the park to meet up with Caleb and Malcolm\u2026 See ya later!\u201d he shouted, before running out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ian had just consumed a big meal. What effect with that have on his muscles while at the park? And, will his friends notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb and Malcolm were already hanging out at the park when Ian arrived. The boys were hanging out by the large playground, sitting on the swings and hanging from the monkey bars. Once they got bored, they took an old loaf or bread, which Malcolm\u2019s mother had given them, and they fed the ducks on the lake. They just sat near the shore, telling jokes and chatting. Finally, they got bored with that as well, and decided to wander over to the tennis courts, the basketball court and the soccer field, where all the action was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three boys playing basketball on the court. They were all older, and they appeared to be at least Middle School age. Ian guessed that they were around fourteen years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we play with you guys?\u201d Malcolm asked one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can play when we\u2019re done!\u201d the tallest boy sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys just sat down on the bench and looked on. About fifteen minutes went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! We\u2019ve been sitting here for over fifteen minutes. Can we play now?\u201d Malcolm asked a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall boy, named Adrian, dribbled the ball and walked up to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you know what? I\u2019ll arm-wrestle you guys for it. Winner gets to use the court!\u201d Adrian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you on! I\u2019ll take on all of you!\u201d Ian uttered loudly. \u201cIf I can beat you guys, then we get the court!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian, Chad and Ben just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear that? Okay, you\u2019re on!\u201d Adrian laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian squatted down by the steel bench, placing his elbow on the bench. Ian set his elbow on the bench as well, wrapping his fingers around Adrian\u2019s hand. Adrian counted to three out loud, and the match began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan started to push Adrian\u2019s arm down, slowly and gradually. The older boy\u2019s face turned red as he increased the pressure, but Ian just had too much muscle. Ian\u2019s arm bulged with a big, round rock-hard bicep that clearly showed who was in control of the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan pushed harder and harder, until Adrian\u2019s hand was almost horizontal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! I did it! I won! I WON! That was almost too easy!\u201d Ian cheered, letting go of the older boy\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was the strongest and the tallest of the three boys on the court and they all knew it. Adrian just bounced the basketball and let Ian catch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good game\u2026\u201d he mumbled, before he turned around and walked off, followed by his buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck? What did I just see? Ian beating a bigger kid in arm-wrestling?\u201d Caleb stated. \u201cWow!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan stood up and flexed. A big muscle rose up from his arm. Caleb walked over and placed his hand on the large ball of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna feel how strong you are\u2026 I wanna feel it to believe it\u2026\u201d he said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Put your elbow on the steel bench!\u201d Ian ordered as the two boys squatted down and locked hands together. Caleb counted to three and Ian started pushing. The match lasted exactly three seconds before Caleb\u2019s arm went straight down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, dude\u2026 Either I\u2019m getting stronger or you\u2019re getting weaker!\u201d Ian grinned. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m the strongest dude here! Time to play some basketball!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys dribbled the big, orange ball around and made shots on the old hoop. Of course, Ian was the one who made the most shots on the basket. Both Caleb and Malcolm realized that Ian was far more athletic than they were! But they were all great friends and Ian didn\u2019t use his strength or skill to scare, bully or intimidate his pals. Besides, Ian used the opportunity to invite the guys over to his place for his upcoming birthday\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When June asked Ian where he wanted to go for his birthday, it didn\u2019t take long at all for him to decide. He wanted to go to the beach with only his best pals from school, and nobody else. No family, no girls. If there was anything June had learned over the years about her son, is that he knew exactly what he wanted, and what he didn\u2019t want. And, if she went against his wishes, she would have to put up with a huge, long argument. So, she allowed Ian to text his buddies from school, and the gang rode to the beach in her SUV. She stopped off at the deli in the large grocery store to get the big, chocolate cake with some Subway sandwiches, since Ian just loved those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they arrived, the boys just ran for the water. Ian had invited the same group as always: Caleb, Malcolm, Charlie and John. June had asked Aunt Clara over as well, who had seen Ian grow up into the young man he became today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Clara said to June. \u201cYour boy isn\u2019t that shy, little boy anymore. He\u2019s turning into a little MAN!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it\u2026\u201d June sighed, as the two women laid back in their lounge chairs, looking out over the crashing waves, as the four boys constructed their large sandcastle before them. \u201cIan has outgrown three sets of shirts and two sets of jeans in the last four weeks! He sleeps whenever he\u2019s not in school and he eats like a horse! I swear, I don\u2019t know where the kid puts away all that food!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s grown all that muscle! My God! What\u2019s up with that?\u201d Clara asked her. \u201cSo, what are you getting him for his thirteenth birthday?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA year-long membership at GymWorld! He has been asking about that for the past six months! He\u2019s just dying to hit the gym!\u201d June sighed. \u201cAs if he isn\u2019t big enough already!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gym membership? For Ian? What are you doing, June? You\u2019re creating a monster! Look at him now! I\u2019ve never seen a thirteen-year-old like him who looks like a small version of Arnold!\u201d Clara remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted. I tried to talk him out of it, but\u2026\u201d June sighed, just as the boys came out of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm was the tallest, but Ian was clearly the one with the most muscle, by far. He looked like a young bodybuilder, even from a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, guys! Come over and let\u2019s have Ian blow out the candles on the cake!\u201d June shouted at the youngsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ran over to the large picnic table where June unveiled the large, round chocolate cake with \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY IAN\u201d written on it in white frosting on top, along with thirteen candles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group sand \u201cHappy Birthday Ian\u201d out loud before the birthday boy himself took a deep breath and blew out the candles in one mighty breath, knocking all the candles over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut the cake, big man!\u201d June grinned, giving Ian the knife with plates as he cut delicious slices of the dark brown cake for his pals. Everybody got a slice, and Ian gave himself the largest slice, of course. Right away, all the chocolate and the sugar went straight to the boy\u2019s muscles as he ate it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys, Charlie, found a long, thick rope laying in the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Let\u2019s do a tug-of-war!\u201d he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Us against the birthday boy!\u201d Malcolm cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan carefully walked up and grabbed one end of the thick rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! It\u2019s me against all of you!\u201d he grinned, flexing one of his arms. The muscle was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, Charlie, Malcolm and John lined up and they all grabbed a part of the rope, standing together on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small puddle of water in the sand, separating Ian from the other four boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first to fall into the water loses!\u201d Malcolm announced. \u201cOne\u2026 Two\u2026 Three!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grabbed hold of the rope with both hands, as tight as possible. He started pulling as he used his mighty legs to walk back at the same time. All four of the other boys were pulled closer to the water, groaning and gasping out loud. They tried to pull harder and harder, but Ian was the guy to beat with his big arms and his thick, powerful legs. It didn\u2019t last long for all four of the boys tumbled into the puddle of water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won! I did it! I\u2019m stronger than ALL FOUR of you! YEAH!\u201d Ian cheered out loud. \u201cBIGGEST!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome just looked at their pal in awe. Ian had become the strongman among them. He was their Hercules, their muscle man, their protector, their Arnold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him! Ohhh\u2026 What a show-off\u2026\u201d Clara sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet him be. It\u2019s his birthday!\u201d June slapped her on the arm. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what all thirteen-year-olds do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA thirteen-year-old with big muscles?\u201d Clara groaned. \u201cMore like a mini-Hulk!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune just stared at her. Then, she wondered. How big and how strong was Ian going to get?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
