The day was sunny and enjoyable, but occasionally, when Tommy went off to use the restroom, he heard the rest mumbling something. All he could distinguish was the word \"plan.\" After a long trek across the digital world, the sun got low in the sky, and the digidestined decided that it was about time to set up camp, eat dinner, then go to bed. They found a decent-sized grove with most of the trees around them harboring meat apples. \"Well, at least we have dinner taken care of,\" remarked the carefree Takuya, who began picking up handful after handful of the pale, raw apples, depositing them in a basket that Zoe had given him. \"Yeah, there are enough meat apples  here to last for weeks,\" said Koji, who was walking around, observing the dozens of trees filled with meat apples. \"I guess I'll get the fire started, then,\" was the reply from JP. \"Fine, I'll take care of the tent this time,\" said an annoyed Zoe. Either way, Tommy began helping Takuya, but things still felt strange for Tommy. Takuya was staring blankly at Tommy, and though Tommy was a bit confused, he remained oblivious, and continued to pick apples with vigor. \"I love meat apples!\" exclaimed an excited Tommy. The rest of the group tried to contain their excitement, as Tommy continued excitedly picking meat apples, saying \"I hope I get a smoked pork one! Those are my favorite!\" He was completely oblivious to the fact that the others were staring at him, having fantasies of seeing a bigger Tommy. Soon, Tommy cleared the tree, leaving a sizable pile of meat apples that completely covered the basket. \"I guess I got a little carried away.\" Tommy observed. \"That's alright\" assured an eager Takuya. \"We don't have to eat all of them now.\" That reassured Tommy, who eager waited for the fire to get started. Soon...</span></div></div>",

Tommy was already very excited, as meat apples were his weakness anyway. He excitedly took two more meat apples, and he impaled both on the skewer. The others were having difficulty containing their excitement. Either way, the five roasted their meat apples to perfection, talking about many different things. Finally, it was time to eat, and while the others ate normally, Tommy began ravenously devouring the first apple on his skewer, as if he hadn't eaten in days, and he finished two of the meat apples when the others finished theirs. The others were satisfied, and they all stared at Tommy while he tore into the third apple. Tommy remained completely oblivious, as he ate this next apple, which tasted like delicious bacon. He finished it less than a half of a minute, and asked, \"Can I have more, please?\" Takuya responded first, saying, \"Eat as much as you want. We have plenty to spare. Besides, you picked most of them!\" With that reassurance, any sense of guilt or hesitation quickly left Tommy, who put three more apples on a skewer. He was about to begin roasting again, when he asked if he could borrow someone else's skewer to cook more apples. Zoe responded this time, saying \"That's a great idea! Tommy, we can cook all of the apples so that we don't have to later.\" With that, the others put three apples on their skewers, and roasted more apples with Tommy. Once they were done, while Tommy ate more of the apples with gusto, they removed their cooked apples, then piled them on a flat rock that they cleaned in a nearby stream. \"Feel free to take some.\" Koji said, while the others loaded their skewers again. They couldn't help but stare as Tommy devoured his three, then absent-mindedly grabbed another apple. He ate so many that he left a small pile of cores next to him. Either way, he remained oblivious to everything, as he did not even notice his little belly become slightly less so, pushing on his shirt, then beginning to peek out from under it. Without realizing it, when the next batch of apples were done, Tommy had eaten 12 of the other apples, making his total 18 apples. At that point, he finally realized how full he was, and he belched loudly, with juices running down his chin. His little potbelly was so adorable to the others, and it had lifted his shirt over his bellybutton. He absentmindedly rubbed it, enjoying the taste of the meat apples. The others were ecstatic, and once they finish their next batch, they...</span></div></div>",

He dug in and loved to please his friends but knew he couldn\u2019t eat too much more. Packing his belly more and more to its fullest limits and he knew he wanted to make them happy by eating more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful Tommy, you don\u2019t want to overdo yourself.\u201d Koji said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked at Tommy and watched him eat his heart out. Takuya and Koji went to bed as Zoe stayed with Tommy. Tommy kept eating all he can until he felt like he was going to burst. Including the first 18 meat apples he had, Tommy now had eaten a total of 34 meat apples. His belly was the size of a basketball. Zoe felt his belly and was surprised at how much he had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel to be so big?\u201d Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt stings a little but it feels pretty good.\u201d Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe cooked up a few more meat apples for Tommy. She told him that if he eats them, she will do something special for him. She finished the meat apples and Tommy stuffed them into his ready to explode belly. Zoe almost lost it at the sight of him eating that much and not losing it himself. Zoe poked his belly and felt how taut it was. He told her not to push too hard or he will lose it. Zoe sighed and will hold up her end of the promise.</span></div></div>",

When I felt your belly, I realized that want to make you fatter whether you like it or not.\u201d Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn\u2019t know what to say but didn\u2019t need to. Zoe took him a little farther away from the camp to start. She made a ton of food for Tommy and made him eat it all. She made a ton of meat apples, some burgers and many other tasty things that she thought Tommy would like. He didn\u2019t like where this was going but went with it. When he couldn\u2019t eat anymore, the shy girl blushed at how big he has gotten and felt his belly. She then forced him to eat more by forcing the food down his throat. When she had forced him to eat the rest, she felt Tommy\u2019s large belly. Just like the night before, Zoe nearly lost it. Tommy wanted to get up and tell the others but the weight of his belly on his legs said otherwise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a satisfying meal, Tommy decided to nod off a little early, while the others talked around the fire, talking about their next move. \"He's almost asleep!\" an excited Takuya exclaimed, barely able to contain his excitement. \"He's gonna look so cute with extra weight on him!\" Zoe was going to scream, but she didn't, being careful not to wake Tommy up. JP added, \"Yeah, and we were lucky enough to stumble upon this grove filled with meat apples.\", and Koji pointed out, \"He even did most of the work harvesting!\" Either way, Zoe began cooking meat apples, JP went off with a bucket to find a water source, and Takuya went to check on Tommy, with Koji right at his side. \"He's asleep!\" Takuya whispered quietly to Koji. Soon, the two got in the tent and were getting to work. \"Good thing he trusts us!\" Koji said, as he took Tommy's digivice, which was sitting next to his daytime clothes. Meanwhile, Takuya quietly unzipped Tommy's sleeping bag, revealing the pajama-clad Tommy underneath, then he got out a rope. Luckily, Tommy was a heavy sleeper, so the two gingerly flipped Tommy on his side, then Takuya tied Tommy's arms behind his back, while Koji got a spot set up near the fire, setting up a pair of small boulders and a wide plank of wood. Takuya was able to pick up little Tommy by himself, then he laid Tommy down on the makeshift bed, which was surprisingly large. Koji lifted the board up, then Takuya positioned Tommy's arms below the plank, so he was laying on the plank with his hands tied under him. Finally, the two got out a pair of shackles that they managed to obtain at the last town. These secured Tommy's legs to the board. Then the two went to a stream that JP just found. They were glad to have messaging in their digivices. It made this so much easier. Soon, the three were taking buckets of water back to the campground, watering the nearby meat apple trees. They found out that the meat apple trees sucked up the water, and the meat apples grew slightly bigger and juicier. They repeated this process until the trees all had apples that were the size of large pumpkins. The extra water also made the pale apples grow a vibrant pinkish-red color, and the meat apples no longer had to be cooked. The apples were so large, that they were on the ground, barely attached to the sagging branches. At about this time, Zoe finished cooking the apples that Takuya and Tommy picked, heaping them in a larger basket that she brought. As if on cue, the sun began rising, and the four were ready to begin. Tommy woke up, and the four...</span></div></div>",
