Before the meeting can conclude, Mois, still a little girl, walks in carrying treats and drinks for her friends, although it doesn't seem like this is an easy feet given her size.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, Uncle. Being this small has made a bit hard to carry everything, but I got the chores done and...\" she stops talking from seeing their silent and stunned faces, except for Tamama who is just trying to hold back a laugh. Even Kururu, who would usually be the one laughing, is stunned in shock.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Mois-dono?\" Keroro asks. \"Are you alright? You look... little.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Mois smirks. \"I got shrunk down from Kururu's invention earlier for a prank. Don't mind me. Carry on.\" She clumsily hands over the soda and snack cakes to each of the frogs, even Tamama who is starting to find humor from her indifference to being mini-sized.<br>\r\n\"...okay. Anyway, clowns...,\" Keroro tries to resume. \"We scare off Natsumi and... are you sure you're okay, Mois-dono?\"<br>\r\n\"Mhm!\" Mois nods and takes a seat since she can't loom over them like usual. Keroro tries again to keep going, but the others are too distracted from watching Mois trying to act like everything is normal. Eventually, ... </span></div></div>",

Aki toddles over to Natsumi out of curiosity. \"Lie down, Aki-chan,\" Natsumi whispers softly in a motherly tone.<br>\r\n\"What? Wh-,\" Aki pauses in realization. \"Oh, no.\" Her face burns red from embarrassment at the sight of Natsumi taking out a package of old diapers for kids her size. \"B-but I'm your mother!\" Aki nervously picks on straws. \"I don't need my diapee changed!\" Natsumi just giggles at Aki's sudden behavior and vocabulary. She looks down at her diaper and sees that she had indeed wet herself in it without having ever noticed.<br>\r\n\"You're more like my baby sister right now,\" Natsumi playfully teases her. \"Now please, lie down on the floor.\" Aki, having no valid argument to use against the older girl, instinctively follows her daughter's instruction. Aki finds her even more surprised with Natsumi quickly switching her to a clean diaper, applying anti-rash powder in the process. She realizes she must have had practice from the previous victims of regression. Natsumi picks up Aki and hugs onto her immediately after taping the clean diaper onto her hips.<br>\r\n\"T-thank you,\" Aki stutters. Despite her embarassment, she is thankful that Natsumi is looking after her instead of being mean to her. As soon as she turned herself into a baby, it was natural that she would have to give up any control over her childrens' live while she's smaller and more dependent than them. Natsumi giggles in approval and...</span></div></div>",

Hearing the bed underneath her creak from pressure makes it quickly apparent that this is not solely of her imagination. She takes another look at herself, besides her clothes, finding that her figure had inflated in areas where her clothes had torn. A careful look around the room indicates that her room seems to have shrunk from her perspective. She gets off the bed to take a full look at herself.<br>\r\n\"Did I just grow bigger?\" She doesn't feel like she has become older like whenever Aki cannot accompany her and Fuyuki at the beach; rather, she seems to have actually gotten bigger overall. \"This is not right!
