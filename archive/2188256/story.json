You can only see the immense, blue and stinky sole over your head. This isn't a good  place to be. Carefully you began to walk away, always glancing at Undyne. Now you can see her long legs, at least for you, continue upwards until you reach the edge of the sofa. She is still watching TV, everything is going to be just fine; until you heard a sound: <i>Groowl</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze immediately, your stomach has betrayed you because you are so, too hungry. But you have to resist, you can't eat here, near to <b>her</b>... but for days you haven't put anything in your teeth.. You look up again, she is always there watching TV, she hasn't heard you yet and you shouldn't even take to much to eat... <br>\r\nYou feel your stomach grumble again ... no more wasting time. So you decide to bite the cereal remnant and fill your hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the mouth is closed, you can taste the horrendous taste of the food you have in your hands, it's something really disgusting, well it could not be anything different something that was on the ground and stomped by a sweaty foot of a monster. You want to spit it out, but you can't, you have to send it down. And after a couple of chews, you swallow the cereal of the taste of rotten sushi. You're struggling enough to continue, but the more you think, the more you waste time and therefore the more risk begin seen, so even if against your will, you close your eyes and take another bite, and then another and in a minute you finish eating. Your stomach thanks but your body doesn't. You only feel the dry tongue and the rancid taste left in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recover and once you open your eyes, you realize the surrounding environment, but notice something strange: there is silence. You turn around and you see the TV off, but before doing or even thinking about anything, the strong impact Undyne's foot against the floor makes you lose your balance. Lucky you weren't down there<br>\r\nShe's getting up, you can't stay there anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you stand up and start running, but you can't get very far because the second impact makes you fall to the ground again, your hearth is beating madly. You turn around and take a look. You see it in its entirety, you were now used to seeing it, but never so close and for so long. Her huge and bare feet were only the base, but they were enough to crush you without leaving any trace, his scaly and blue legs seemed to never end, but they were interrupted by her black shorts. Subsequently, the sleeveless shirt showed itself to make room for the head. You felt so helpless and hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to move her arms. What was she doing? She was doing stretching?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, the show continued, she gave out little sighs and made its only eye wander around: she looked at the shelves, the table and anything else had partial importance, but there was nothing. Then she looked at her feet and their pointy nails, letting out a small smirk. <i>\"It is useless to waste time in this way\"</i> Undyne thought to herself <i>\" Today the program is boring... I think it is convenient to start the exercises, at least we begin the day well\"</i>. Thought this, she takes the remote control, turn off the TV and place one foot on the ground first and then the other, to give herself a boost and get up completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done this, she raises her arms upwards and begins to arch her back to crack some bones. She releases a more resolute sigh by saying: \"Let's go!\" and quietly raise her foot and then let it fall back on the floor to go into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still shocked by the close encounter with Undyne, never would you have thought you were so close to her, but another and much more important issue was the following: Undyne's foot had risen and was coming towards you! With all your strength you try to back away as quickly as possible but with each successive instant, the immense bluish wall of flesh was getting closer and closer. <i>\"This is the end\"</i> you thought closing eyes and bracing for the impact. You hope that it will a swift death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was tremendous, you could feel the vibrations running through your body and the smell of fish filling your nostrils. But the curious thing was that it continued, which was difficult because you should be dead and not be able to fell anything. You open your eyes and you are welcomed by a blue scaly wall. You look up to see the rest of Undyne. It's unbelievable, you haven't been crushed but you were in the precise and small space between the big toe and the second finger of her foot! You stay still, either so as not to make the situation worse or because you can't, your body doesn't even dare to think about moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second the immense foot rises and Undyne continues his journey to her destination. You turn your head to watch her go away, regardless of what happened to you. But one thing was certain: you're alive ... stinking of fish, but you're still alive. The tremors become less and less strong until they are interrupted by the noise of closing a door. You, still in disbelief, stand up and observe the area, for as long as you live with Undyne, you've never been in the center of the living room, you preferred small holes in the wall and shady areas. You decide to take advantage of this moment of peace to hide. Undyne was quick enough to dress so to best avoid the experience before, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

It's definitely a lazier morning for her today.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a flash of movement appears in her view, her single eye darting downward in response. She might be sleepy this morning, but her senses are still sharply trained.<br>\r\nShe squints, startled by what she's seeing. Unless she's totally off, that's a little human scurrying across her floor. She spots a tiny hole in the wall that she hadn't noticed before, and is even more surprised. Of all the places, there's actually a human brave enough to try and make themselves at home in her house? She's actually sort of impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her foot with trained speed, Undyne blocks the tiny hole in the wall just before the tiny human down on the floor can reach hit, and laughs to herself as the speck-sized invader runs headlong into the side of her foot, bouncing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is hammering wildly in your chest. You messed up, and badly, too. A huge, blue, and mildly scaly foot is resting before you, totally blocking your only available escape route.

Just as you feared, Undyne is looking right at you, her single remaining eye fixed on your precise position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get back up and run, a massive hand is approaching, and two powerful fingers big enough to crush you instantly close around you. Your body is lifted right off the floor, a dizzying sensation setting in as Undyne picks you right up to examine her catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in front of her massive face. She's rather pretty, for a fish-like monster with no nose, and who's the size of the skyscrapers humans used to be able to build. Of course, you're still pretty sure she would be the type to eat any humans she came across, so her looks are a bit of a low priority right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" she says, almost casually. Your heart rate accelerates even more. \"Gotta say, I didn't really think I'd ever find a human in here.\"<br>\r\nYou sit there between her fingertips, too scared to move. Should you answer back?
