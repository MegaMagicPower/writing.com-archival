She tried remembering how she ended up like this, but it just made her head hurt worse, so she gave that up for now. Trying to reach up and hold her head to stop the pain and remove the blindfold, she found out that she couldn't move her arms, they were bound down. Testing her legs got the same result. From what she could tell, she was bound in soft chair of some sort, but with her limited mobility and lack of eye sight, she couldn't be sure. Using her other senses, she couldn't find anything familiar, not the sounds, smells, or anything. Just at the edge of her hearing, she thought she could hear someone breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is someone here? Where am I?\" She said, trying to not let the fear she was starting to feel creep into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response she got was the sound of footsteps coming closer. They stopped nearly on top of her. Suddenly, a hand roughly grabbed her body, starting with her toned stomach, then moving up to her pert breasts. She realized with a sickening feeling, that she was either almost completely or completely nude. She tried pulling back from the person, but couldn't get far. A barely audible growl seemed to come from whoever it was, before the footsteps moved a short ways around her.</span></div></div>",

She is barely able to register that it is a tube of some sort as is continues past her mouth and down her throat. It seems to be made in such a way that she can breath around it, but only somewhat.  Now, blind, bound, and with a tube fed into her body, she is getting quite scared. A few more footsteps can be heard after a slight pause, likely to check that the tube was inserted well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hum of a machine starting up can be heard, and the tube starts to vibrate. After a few moments of this, Krystal can suddenly feel the tube starting to pulse, like something was being pumped through it...straight into her! She struggled against her bonds, only succeeding in injuring her arms and legs. Biting down on the tube did little except made her headache worse, and the tube was inserted too far for her to try and spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whimper, she was forced to sit there, as this pump continued to push whatever it was into her. It didn't take long, but she could feel her small stomach filling up, and yet the pumping continued. On and on, the flow went, and she could feel her belly starting to stretch and grow. If this continued, she might just burst. Redoubling her efforts to try and escape did nothing to help, only making her her head pound worse, and adding to the growing pain of her stretched stomach.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach continued to stretch and bloat, seemingly far beyond what she should have been able to hold, but it was hard to be sure being bound and blinded as she was. She dreaded to think of it, but she thought she could even hear her skin and hide groaning, struggling to contain large load within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain within Krystal's stomach soon trumped the pounding in her head, even making her thoughts sluggish and unresponsive. A tear started to roll down her face, fearful that she was reaching her limits, and that this was how it was going to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought that was sure to burst, the machine clicked off with a sputter. The tube gave one final pulse, and her bloated stomach gave a final lurch. Krystal could have almost cried with joy, if it wasn't for her thoughts being so foggy from the pain, as well as knowing that it likely wasn't over.</span></div></div>",

Unable to think clearly, she was suddenly hit with a bout of pain as someone seemingly tenderly touched her swollen stomach. It didn't last long before she was pulled from the chair and forced along. It took her a moment to figure out, but someone had a hold of her arm and was guiding her along. The lances of pain from her bloated middle caused her to stumble sometimes, which only prompted the person to give a short growl and pull her along again, causing her stomach to flair up again, and so on. She was quickly able to figure out that she should try to keep up best that she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep track of the steps and the turns they take, Krystal was pulled to a stop, before some clicking can be heard. Her assumption that it was a lock being unbolted was proved when she heard the lock click louder as well as the creak of a door opening. She was then unceremoniously shoved through the door, but as it happened, the person was able to catch the blindfold and pull it off as she fell. She gasped loudly as she nearly fell on her stomach, and as such was too distracted to turn around and look until it was too late. The door was already pulled shut, and she could hear the clack as the lock sealed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to stand, she was forced to come face to face with her real problem: her over inflated stomach. It was a firm sphere, completely hard to the touch (though she didn't try touching it for too long, too much pain radiating out from the light pressure). She turned her gaze away with disgust and revulsion and stifled a sob, and took stock of where she seemed to be held for now. Her eyes were quickly drawn to the bed in the room, her body quickly becoming overcome with a deep sense of fatigue. Stumbling her way to the bed, she laid down as best she could, careful around her stomach. She gave up on the covers after the light touch of them caused yet another stab of pain to cause her to nearly become sick again. She soon passed into a fitful sleep, a tear rolling down her face, and her body already working on the \"meal\" that was forced into her.</span></div></div>",

She felt like she had been asleep for some time, though it was hard to tell with no windows or clocks around. She lay there, eyes screwed shut, dread seeping through her at what could happen next. Finally, with a groan she opened her eyes and took a look around. Plain cream walls surrounded her,  and it was even reasonably well decorated and furnished. She might have thought it was a hotel room of sorts, if it wasn't for the door's lock being on the outside, and lack of anything she could use to get a message out. There was a TV set on the wall, but she wasn't feeling up to watching TV considering her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought wormed it's way into her brain, she had some dream of someone coming into the room and watching her sleep. She couldn't get a good look at the person, but whoever it was seemed to consider her body, including her bloated belly. Another feeling of sickness washed over her as her thoughts landed on what had happened to her before she was brought to this room and slept. What if that dream hadn't been a dream though, what if that was someone who had bought her here for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle she could do about that right now though, so with a groan she tried sitting up. She found it was more difficult that she remembered. Sometime during the night, she seemed to have pulled the covers up. Her stomach didn't seem to be the rock hard sphere it was, but something still seemed off under the blankets. Getting a good grip, she threw the covers back. It took a few seconds for her brain to kick into gear as she looked at herself, then she proceeded to scream.</span></div></div>",

It looked like she had somehow gained around one hundred pounds of pure fat, every part bloated with a thick layer of blubber. Her stomach had lost the rock hard packed shape and turned into a large fleshy bag rising above her thickened body. The formerly decent sized breasts atop her chest had taken more than their share of her new weight and turned into soft orbs resting atop her gut. Moving her arms, she found that both had plumped up as well, matching her larger hips and thighs. Turning her head to get her gaze away from her swollen body, she was shocked to feel how her chin and face had expanded just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA solitary tear ran down her chubby cheek before she fought down her revulsion and fear. Opening her eyes again, they shined with a steely fire, as she knew that breaking down wouldn\u2019t help her get out of this situation. With a grunt, she forced herself up into a sitting position then stood up quickly\u2026before falling right back down onto the bed because of her new center of balance. Taking it a bit slower on the next try worked slightly better, but her wobbling wiggling body threatened to pull her to the ground with each movement. She gave a determined growl as she forced her fattened body around the room, trying to find any way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best hopes, the door proved quiet locked, and too sturdy to try and knock down. A second door opened into a lavious bathroom, complete with a huge whirlpool tub and shower combo. Krystal had to suppress a shudder at the thought of needing such a large tub herself. Finding no way to escape in the bathroom, the vixen forced her body back to the other room to continue searching. After checking every possible spot she could, she let herself fall heavily onto the bed. Even just sitting there caused her fattened body to shift and wobble slightly as she panted heavily from the limited movement she put herself though. She let out another growl, angered at how limited her ability to move was right then, let alone if whoever had trapped her did anything else to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden loud rumbling noise startled the fattened fox, and she had no idea where it was coming from at first. When the noise came again, even louder that time, she realized that her it was her stomach. Her gut expressed its displeasure a third time, giving her a hunger pang along with the grumble. The pain and noise continued to build \u2013 far faster than it should have been \u2013 wracking her body and making it feel like her stomach was gnawing on itself. Just as she thought she might pass out from the hunger, she was able to make out another noise between the roars of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Between the relentless grumbling and groaning of her stomach, Krystal was able to make out a small sound. Distracted as she was with her insistent hunger, she almost didn\u2019t notice the slot that opened at the base of the door. Through the formerly hidden hole, a tray of food was inserted, followed by a second and a third. The smells wafting off the platters only stirred her hunger even further; eggs and toast, pancakes and sausage, along french toast and bacon, all in amounts that would feed three or four people each, let alone all together. Before she even thought to react, the hatch shut with a barely audible click, looking like the door was made from one solid piece again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hunger, Krystal tried to hold out against the food offered to her, not wanting anything else to happen to her. Her will held out for only a few seconds, the aroma of the food causing her head to slowly twist around to look at the trays. No matter how hard she tried, she found that she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away. Her mouth watered and she licked her lips as she continued to stare at the food, her body betraying her as she started to unconsciously scoot down the bed closer to the food her attention was locked on. As her arm reached out to nearly touch one of the trays, she gave one last act of defiance, pulling her arm back. The last of her will fell as she then pounced at the food, giving into her unnatural hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost all conscious control of her body as she stuffed herself with all of the food given to her. Not even bothering with the silverware, the vixen shoveled handfuls of food into her maw, barely even chewing before swallowing to make room for the next. She finally came to while licking one of her hands to try and get the last remnants of food clinging to her fur there. With agonizingly slowness, she looked down at her body, finding that her softened stomach had again taken on its rock hard appearance, but even larger than before. Little gobs of grease and syrup as well as bits and pieces of the food clung to the fur of her breasts and around her mouth. Some small part of her mind was at least thankful for her hunger being sated\u2026for now, while the rest was disgusted at what she had done to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling, she tried and failed to stand up several times, her stuffed stomach weighing her down in addition to her fattened body. Finally succeeding, she braced herself on the end of the bed, her legs quivering from being unused to holding up her swollen body, causing the rest of her body to wobble from the motion. She accidentally brushed her fingers across her stomach, and expected another blast of pain like the last time, but was partially relieved that the pain was much less than before. It was still enough to cause her to hiss slightly as she inhaled sharply. Letting the minor agony pass, her thoughts slowly turned to her next actions, her mind slightly foggy from her recent gluttony.</span></div></div>",

This kind increases the speed of your digestion so you can eat more.\" Krystal takes the vial and gulps it down. Suddenly her belly starts gurgling loudly and felt like a dozen hands were rubbing it. Her belly starts shrinking and she feels the fullness disappearing as hunger replaces it. When the swelling disappears a thin layer of fat coats her belly. RUUUUUMMMMMBBBBBLLLLLE! \"Hurry Fox! Feed me before I starve!\" Krystal cries. 50 plates of food later Krystal belches loudly and massages a extremely swollen belly.

Several hand sized love handles have formed on the sides of her belly. Her hips have widened by 2 feet and her thighs have widened by a foot. Her boobs have swelled 2 and a half sizes and popped her bra open during the night. Her arms are coated in 10 inches of soft, warm, flab.

She finishes getting dressed and heads out to the ship. With Fox's help, she gets in and they take off to another buffet. She grabs 2 trays and piles them high with food. She heads back to the table and rubs her growling belly in anticipation. \"Hey Krystal. Why don't you take this hunger serum. It'll make you 10 times hungrier if you drink it.\" Krystal grabs the vial Fox is holding out to her and gulps it done. It takes effect immediately, her belly roaring and rumbling quite loudly in the resturant. She begins wolfing down food as fast as she can. Fox and a busboy gets her more food as quick as they can, but it was barely fast enough for the starving vixen. After a couple hundred trays of food Kystal lays back moaning in content as she rubs her swollen and bloated belly. The chair under Krystal groans ominously. \"Do you have anymore of the weight increasing potion Fox?\" Krystal asks as the chair groans again under her weight.  \"Yes, a whole crate full.\" He hands her one. She gulps it down, her stomach groaning as it adjusts for the liquid. They leave and go back home. She heads upstairs and takes a nap in a extremely tight nightie that shows a little of her overstuffed belly. She wakes up just before dinner her belly growling noisly. She gets up, finding it much harder to do so. She looks at herself in the mirror. Her belly grew another 3 feet outwards and 4 feet across. Her thighs and arms looking like small body pillows. Her face plumpened up and now have three thick chins hanging off with a fourth developing. Her ass looks like a large shelf sticking 2 feet out behind her. Her boobs swelled 6 whole sizes and rest on top of her mountainous belly. Krystal feels Fox wrap his arms around her large gut and snuggle aganist her back and ass. \"MMMMM! so big and soft!\" He whispers into her ear as he caresses her fat folds. \"How do I look honey?\" \"You look very beautiful and quite sexy.\" She giggles and shakes herself aganist him, her fat jiggling aganist him.. \"Am I perfect now Fox?\"</span></div></div>",

Becoming a member shortly after Fox's adventures on Sauria, Krystal had a skinny physique and weighed a respectable weight, but then Fox introduced her to some of the more delicious aspects of living with the team. The food was cheap due to the team's budget, but it sure was tasty! The rations, containing of mountains of chocolate in various forms, pizza, potato chips, all the stuff their parents told them was junk food when they were kids, was well in stock on the Great Fox. With a food budget of only 1000 credits, they had to make do with what they could, and they were well off with buying cheap, affordable junk food. And Krystal was loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a year later, the vixen had ballooned in size, now weighing 300lbs from days of snacking on junk food that Fox fed her. She had suspected that Fox was doing it purposefully for some reason because he would always weigh her at the end of the week, and this week when she came in at 300, Fox was strangely overjoyed. Now she found herself sitting on a table designed to support her weight, while Fox looked on. He had a strange look on his face and kept licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, would you mind telling me why I'm on this table?\" She asked the skinnier fox, who only chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked again, and after a few laughs, he finally told her why she was being displayed on this very sturdy table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eat me?\" She asked, both scared and confused.

I'm gonna need my special medicine for this!\" Fox said as he pulled out a small bottle from his pants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue vixen watched as Fox dropped a pill into the palm of his hand and swallowed it. \"This is a new drug Slippy and I have been working on. We call it \"Snake's Pleasure\". It allows my body to expand in anyway possible. I can stretch my jaws wide enough to swallow you, and my stomach can hold even a Landmaster. Of course, there's side-effects.

But here's the thing...it also releases a chemical that will allow me to regurgitate you....but in the process, it'll eat all of the weight you've put on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tried to spit at him, but Fox turned his head at the last moment. \"You have no idea how long I've been planning this, Krystal. Watching you with hungry eyes, just waiting for you to become the ideal weight for my eating. And once I'm done, I'll have the pleasure of fattening you up again to eat you all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gasped as Fox laughed heavily. \"Now how to eat you?\"</span></div></div>",

It just drifted into the system one day and stayed there, rotating but not orbiting. Scans suggested it was near identical to Corneria in terms of planetary habitability; breathable atmosphere, tolerable weather conditions, and even the right materials to develop a sustainable civilization. But with no transmissions from the strange planet or responses to Corneria's own, it was hard to say if intelligent life existed there. Stranger still, what the planet did transmit couldn't be picked up by radio scans, but by those select few blessed with telepathic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Which is why they've hired us to investigate instead of sending some of their own.\" Krystal stared at the planet from her view on the Great Fox's bridge. Despite maintaining a reasonable amount of distance, she could still pick up on the telepathic waves. Now if only she could discern their specifics...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the gist of it.\" Peppy, seated in the captain's chair, nodded at her. \"They're thinking that since you can pick up on 'em, you'll be able to sniff out...something or other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal frowned. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still think they're getting the wrong people for the job,\" Falco said, arms crossed, gazing off in some random direction. \"Just saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox shrugged. \"Well, General Pepper can probably count the number of psychics he knows on one finger. Just like the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" Falco sighed. \"But we're not exactly the go-to recon team, y'know? I mean, how do you expect four people to check out an entire planet all by themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just supposed to find the source of those waves,\" Peppy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they're coming from...I don't know, the center of the planet or something? And really, why can't they just use some kinda tele-whatever scanner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause there's no such thing,\" Slippy interjected. \"Most folks don't even know psychic powers exist, so there's no research about that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you do something about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've got my hands full enough as is! I wouldn't even know where to start anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fox and Peppy attempted interject only to be cut off by Krystal audibly clearing her throat. The men all clammed up and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm the only one who can carry out this mission,\" she said, \"I think it would be best if I go it alone for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked taken aback. \"Alone? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal nodded. \"I can't see much benefit in taking you all along with me. Maybe I'll need support if things get too dangerous, but we should at least confirm if there is a danger first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox didn't reply. He stared at the floor, face strained in worried thought. After a moment, he looked up and said, \"Alright, just be careful, Krystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRations and other necessities to last a week, check.

Maybe it wasn't a sentient being sending them out. But then what was it? And how was it doing it? These questions plagued her all the way down to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHills and grasslands covered the immediate vicinity. A mountain range dotted the horizon. Woodlands both to the east and west. No signs of civilization, developed or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely,\" Krystal whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut her eyes and focused. The waves permeated the entire surface, yet she still couldn't discern anything. Anything, that is, except for their potential source southeast of her location.

It might just be best to try to make a few scans\u2026 From orbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was stepping up to her Arwing however, she let out a surprised gasp as jets of what looked like the same black mist from before erupted from it in several areas. The dark, ominous smoke continue to pour out of Krystal\u2019s vehicle for a few moments before collecting into a small, swirling cloud of the vapor that circled over it. Then, just as the last of the substance had exited her craft, the collective cloud shot straight at her! The vixen was prepared however, especially after seeing the behavior of the much larger cloud earlier, and quickly rolled out of the way, the mist missing her by inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Krystal pulled herself out of the mud and, as soon as she was on her feet, drew her laser pistol to aim it at the menacing fog. As soon as she did though, she realized that it was not necessary as the small, dark mist was not headed towards her, but in the same direction its colossal companion had gone before, most likely to join with it again. The vixen shook her helmeted head and holstered her weapon, turning to inspect her Arwing once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starfighter looked fine at first, well, besides all of the grime and muck from the swamp of course. Upon closer inspection however, Krystal saw that the areas the mist had poured out of seemed to have been corroded slightly, and there was some sort of black goop dripping from the spots in small quantities, most likely a more condensed form of the mist. Whatever it was, it seemed like it could potentially be acidic, and had perhaps even damaged her ship\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about the state of her Arwing, Krystal opened up the cockpit and jumped inside, somewhat relieved when she was able to power it up without much difficulty, \u201cOkay baby, let\u2019s see if you can get me off this hellhole!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching a few keys, the vixen waited as her on-board computer ran a diagnostic of the Arwing\u2019s systems, hoping that it could still fly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This vessel has suffered severe internal stress! Immediate repair is recommended!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Krystal huffed and smacked a gloved palm against her helmet in frustration, \u201cThis is just fantastic! Ughh, Fox is just going to love that I got one of these things trashed\u2026 and not even in a fight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and climbed back out of the cockpit, landing in the mud with a loud splat before closing it again and kicking the muck off of her boots. She looked about the area, surveying her surroundings, before groaning, \u201cGreat\u2026 Well, I guess I better tell him now. If I can\u2019t get off this planet, he\u2019ll just need to take me with him\u2026 how embarrassing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tapped a button on her suit\u2019s collar to activate her communicator, but did not expect to hear the static that crackled through the speakers. Despite this, she began to speak, \u201cFox? Can you hear me? Fox, hello? There\u2019s some kind of interference! I think my ship\u2019s been wrecked, and I\u2019m stuck here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reply managed to come through, though unfortunately it was heavily distorted by the static, \u201cKry- I can harddd-zzzt!

Me and Katt are go-zzzztch-nd you and tr-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the static began to overtake the communications channels, and Krystal could no longer manage to contact either Fox or Katt, let alone reach the Great Fox in orbit. She frowned as she let her paw fall to her side and leaned up against the Arwing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic\u2026 Now I guess I\u2019m supposed to just wait around for rescue, like a freakin\u2019 damsel\u2026\u201d She groaned, turning around and facing the Arwing, \u201cI should probably get inside this thing and save the air in the suit for later\u2026\u201d She could very well need to use it later, especially if the atmospheric analysis comes up toxic\u2026 whenever it actually finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her mind was on analysis though, she figured that, since she had plenty of time and not much to do, she should probably get a sample of that weird mist crap. She pulled out a small kit from her belt and bent over to scrape some of the black goop leaking from her Arwing, carefully making sure that all of the potentially caustic slime made it into the sample container and not onto her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow disgusting\u2026\u201d She groaned as she put the sampling kit away, turning back towards the Arwing.<br>\r\nJust as she was about to hop in however, she heard a sound behind her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blue vixen turned around, her attention caught by the sound of something splashing about in the nearby mucky water. Her previous experiences with the strange creatures of this planet haven\u2019t been all that pleasant of course, so she reached for her blaster pistol as well, pulling it free of its holster as she slowly moved away from her disabled spacecraft to investigate the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at the edge of the water, but no matter where she looked, she couldn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary, or really anything distinguishable from the gloomy swampy environment she was stuck in. Just as Krystal was about to write it off as some kind of fish, she heard another splash, this one further away. She looked just in time to see the last of the water falling from the air and back into the mire, right next to another landmass on the other side of the swamp.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUggh, what am I doing..?\u201d She wondered out loud before stepping into the water and traveling across the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the water only went up to her ankles, but soon enough it was up to her thighs. Thankfully the suit kept her completely dry, but it still felt disgusting wading through the filthy, silt-filled water. Once she reached the other side of the marsh, she climbed ashore and brushed the goopy mud off her legs and looked around once more for the source of the noise, pistol still in hand. While she was looking however, she heard another splash and a new noise, what sounded like a loud, low, gravelly groan, coming from her left. She turned towards it just in time to see what looked like a massive brown barnacle-like creature closing its shell, the groaning ceasing just as it did, its movements creating ripples in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow odd\u2026\u201d She mused, examining the creature from a distance. She\u2019d seen many types of clams and mollusks in her travels. Most were small, though some, such as the ones on Sauria, could grow to be pretty big\u2026 Just not THIS big\u2026Maybe this swamp was connected to one of the planets oceans? Or it could be that these things simply were adapted for freshwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fascinating as it was though, she figured it would be best to just leave it alone now. Her curiosity was sated, but she didn\u2019t want to risk this thing trying to eat her\u2026 hell, it was almost large enough to by the looks of it! As she began to walk away from the creature though she heard another one of their odd groans, though this one was much louder and much closer, coming from one of the things in the water right in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Huh? How is that possible! I must have walked right past it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe debated trying to run past it before she heard even more groans, and as she looked over the marsh between her and her Arwing, she discovered that the trip back might be a lot more difficult. She must have woken them up with her first trip through the water, because now it was clear the place was absolutely full of the giant barnacles, all of them moving, groaning, and active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away from the edge of the swamp water slowly, Krystal weighed her options: She could either try to weave her way carefully around the barnacles and stay out of their reach\u2026 Or she\u2019d have to find another way around them; a long detour to avoid something that she wasn\u2019t even certain was dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides... who knows what else could be lurking deeper within the wilds..?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fox or Katt could show up at any minute to retrieve her, and if she went around the long way, she might miss them. She didn\u2019t want to make either of them wait for her while she bumbled around the wilds trying to find her way back to the landing site, all because she got a little curious: She\u2019d look like an idiot! Besides, there might be even worse things living further into the woods\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, looking out over the water and noticing almost a dozen of the strange, alien clam creatures, she let out a hesitant shiver. Sure, they could very well be harmless, but all the same they might not be\u2026 She\u2019d seen stranger things before. But she had made up her mind already, and if she just sat here doing nothing, she\u2019d just be wasting even more time! So, keeping her pistol out and at the ready, Krystal picked a part of the shore furthest away from any of the monstrous mollusks and waded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the barnacles would open their shells and make those disturbing groaning noises as she passed close to them, but besides sending chills up the vixen\u2019s spine, they did nothing to harm her. She figured she was either doing a good job keeping out of their range, or the things really were completely harmless, but as she looked ahead of her, she realized that she might find out which was the case soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was almost halfway through (And now waist-deep in) the water, she realized that she had run into a bit of a dead end. There was no longer any clear path through the alien barnacles now\u2026 in fact it seemed as though there were an even higher concentration of the creatures the closer she got to her Arwing. She did see an area ahead of her however that had less of them, but she would still need to pass dangerously close to at least one or two of them, and with the water so deep and thick with muck, it would be almost impossible to run by them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Krystal could tell, there were only two options\u2026 She could either move past the barnacles, hoping that either she was still swift enough to avoid them or that they wouldn\u2019t attack her\u2026 Or she could shoot the ones that lie directly in her path with her blaster pistol. It was a cruel option for creatures that might not even have defensive capabilities, but it just might save her life if they did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holstering her blaster pistol, Krystal steeled herself for what she needed to do next. She\u2019d need to wade through the murky water as fast as possible if she wanted to avoid the barnacle-like creatures lurking in it, and she\u2019d have to be ready. Taking a deep breath, Krystal clutched her paws into fists and leaped forward in a mad dash towards the shore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Or at least she tried to. Unfortunately for her, the suction from removing her boot from the mud coating the bottom of the marsh nearly caused her to trip. Thankfully she regained her balance, but now she had last all confidence in making it past the creatures before they could react. Maybe if she trudged slowly enough through the muck however, she might just be able to sneak by\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Krystal walked through the marsh, making sure that each step she took through the water was slower and more calculated as she drew closer and closer to the barnacles. Before long though, she found herself right in the middle of a group of three of the things, and even though it appeared as though she was all but invisible to them, she noticed that her hands were still shaking quite a bit. She stopped momentarily, closing her eyes for just a moment in an attempt to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for said nerves, they weren\u2019t helped at all when the vixen\u2019s ears picked up a the soft but sudden sound of rippling water, and she turned her head to see one of the barnacles to her right opening up its shell. Krystal gasped softly, worrying that even such a slight sound as that would aggravate it further. She stared at the creature as it opened up, revealing it\u2019s soft, fleshy interior as it did, the vixen taking note in her terror of the odd, dark green color its insides possessed. After a moment, though it seemed much longer to the frightened woman, the creature simply let out one of its low, guttural groans before it slowly closed shut once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal couldn\u2019t help but laugh, more in relief than actual humor, \u201cWow, what was I worried about? These stupid things really are harmless!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickered a bit more before continuing to walk forward, though as she was still looking at the barnacle to her right, she didn\u2019t even notice the one in front of her until her knee collided with it and she tripped down into the water. She let out a yelp as she fell down towards the large barnacle, and instinctively reached out to grab onto something to stop her fall. Unfortunately for her, that happened to be the creature itself, and even more unfortunately, it didn\u2019t seem to like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange, aquatic alien opened up its shell, spreading Krystals arms apart as she still clutched at it desperately. It then let out a noise, much like the groaning she was used to from them, but more shrill, almost sounding as though it were angry. The vixen would have gotten up, would have tried to get away from the thing, but she was far too petrified with fear to move even a single inch until it was too late. When the barnacle had finally opened fully, three thick, slimy tentacles shot into the air and lashed about, whipping and squirming blindly until they found their aggressor. Krystal screamed in absolute terror as the tentacles began to ensnare her, one wrapping about her left arm, another looping around her neck. The vixen gagged as this last one began to tighten and constrict her throat, reaching for it desperately to try to pull it off with her right hand before that too was restrained by the final tentacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered as she struggled against the creature\u2019s grip as its rope-like appendages began to slowly drag her closer into its shell. What was it doing? Was it going to eat her?! Her mind raced with horrible thoughts and she panicked, kicking as her upper torso was pulled inside the shell, too terrified to even realize that the slime on the tentacles was actually eating away at her suit like acid. Warning icons flashed on her visor\u2019s HUD indicating the breaches the monster was making in her suit, and she could feel the creature\u2019s slimy flesh against her bare neck and arms. Her mind was filled with revulsion as she let out a choked howl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and kicked more and more, even as the mollusk\u2019s shell closed around her, and the moisture of the creature\u2019s insides fogged up her helmet\u2019s visor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid, idiotic clam, let me go dammit!\u201d She screamed and shouted as she pulled against the tentacles keeping her trapped, but soon they stopped pulling her deeper into the shell, letting her rump and legs dangle in the air outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment all of the creature\u2019s movements stopped, and even though its tight grip on the vixen\u2019s throat still remained, she began to calm down a little. She tried to contemplate ideas now while she had the chance to think rationally, wondering if maybe she could slip her hands out of the tentacles wrapped around them, maybe even reach her pistol. She didn\u2019t have long to think however, as she saw movement from the creature once more, obscured by her clouded visor, and panic began to overwhelm her once more. She kicked and struggled again, not certain of what was going on until something thumped hard against the glass of her helmet, and she let out a frightened shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was rubbing against the glass of her visor now, smearing a slimy residue all across its surface. The flashing warning lights and messages on the visor\u2019s screen began to double before fizzling out as the visor itself began to melt away now, allowing the moist, warm, stinking air to flood into her helmet. Krystal gagged as she tried to hold her breath, still not knowing if the atmosphere was breathable, but the constricting tentacle around her neck made that incredibly difficult, forcing her to breath the air in through short breaths. As she finally saw the thing that had broken through her screen however, her mind was quickly brought to more urgent manners. It appeared to be another tentacle, though just a bit thicker than the others, and ever slimier. It reminded Krystal of the tongue of a snake, or maybe one of the Saurian species as it slowly wormed its way into her helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 What the <i>fuck</i> is THAT?\u201d She groaned, gulping in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The vixen winced as she tried to pull her head away from the thing, but before she could the tentacle moved suddenly, shooting straight into her mouth and pushing down her throat. She gurgled against it, almost choking as it forced itself past her gag reflex and even further downwards. She tried to bite down on the damn thing, but it was just too big to manage enough force to: She simply didn\u2019t have much room to bite with. She whined as the tentacle around her neck loosened a bit, and then the creature ceased all movement once more, the tentacle entering her body now firmly lodged inside and holding her still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Krystal was beginning to wonder just what the hell this thing was doing to her, she started to worry instead as the tentacle in her mouth started to squirm and her belly started to feel strangely heavy. Her eyes widened, her yelps muffled as she realized that her stomach was starting to swell against her suit. The barnacle was pumping her full of fluid! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted and struggled once more, but this time it seemed as though it was working as the tentacles around her arms and neck slowly began to loosen. Desperately, she thought of what she could do next: Either she could try to reach for her gun and shoot the damn thing, or she could keep struggling and hope that she could break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt her belly start to curve and become full, she knew her time was running out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly continued to grow with the stuff and started to round as she reached capacity. Her suit was getting tight around her middle and she wondered how much more she could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she thought she may burst from the pumping and her stomach ached from the pressure, the creature stopped pumping her, but still held her in its grip. Her bell was quite obviously distended to anyone that may look at her, and she looked like she had swallowed a football! Krystal held her gut trying to rub the pain away when suddenly the pumping started again. But this time while her middle still grew with the fluid, the pain started to fadeaway and the feeling of fullness also left her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horrer krystal realized the tentacle was now pumping her with something that was causing her capacity to grow as much as her gut was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much more is this thing gonna pump in me?!\u201d she worried as her stomach grew larger and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like hours the beast stopped pumping fluid into her and started to lower her to the submerged ground. After which both the tentacle holding her, and in her mouth and stomach removed and released her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tried to steady herself and regain her balance, both thrown off by the ordeal with the barnacle and her center of balance being thrown off by the weight of her unwanted liquid meal in her gut. She quickly backed away from the creature, and avoiding the others, not wanting to be pumped with anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waded away from the creatures she kept caressing her belly, feeling how overstuffed it was, yet suffering from no pain or discomfort. Her belly was now a little bigger then a basketball, but felt like an underinflated water balloon. Her skin felt stretchier, and she didn\u2019t feel full at all. In fact, she felt a little hungry. She worried a little about this as she was now pumped beyond her normal capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wadded back to her ship her belly swayed a little back and forth as she moved through the brackish waters of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d she wondered, \u201cWhat do I do about this stuff in me, and what effects should I expect from that strange creature? Why did it pump me full of this stuff and then let me go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it she had made her way back to the shore containing her ship and dry land. She made her way out of the muck, and tried to clean herself as best as possible. While doing so she failed to notice that her belly had softened somewhat and its mass had shifted a bit lower. As if her belly had gotten fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning the much off she started to feel a little hungrier. She looked down at her belly and thought,  \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be kidding. After all that and now I\u2019m hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening a panel she keyed in a short sequence of numbers and a larger compartment opened up. She removed both the emergency shelter and some of the E-Rations stored within and keyed the sequence to close the compartment. She carried the shelter a few yards from the ship and placed it on the driest part of ground she could find. Punching in a few commands on the shelter\u2019s keypad she stepped back as the shelter began its self-building process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shelter was finished erecting itself, Krystal stepped inside the first of four small rooms of the shelter with her food supplies from the ship. She placed the supplies on a small shelf near the inner door of the room and after checking the seals of both doors she removed what was left of her dissolved helmet and placed it on a storage hook. She them stepped in the small De-Tam shower and washed off any further contaminants still clinging from her suit. All the while steeling looks at the food and getting hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was as clean as she felt she could get she picked up the supplies and entered the second room of the shelter. In the second and largest of the four rooms was a small cooking area, a sitting area for two-three people with foldout table, and light in the center of the ceiling, a small window to the outside, and three doorways. One went back to the de-contamination airlock, a second to a small sleeping pod, and a third to a small bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal set down the supplies on a small shelf near the cooking stove and placed two E-Meals into the food reconstitute. The small stove was multi-purpose and could prepare E-Rations and another other foodstuffs procured while waiting for rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited she rubbed her belly in anticipation of the meals. Her belly had in this time gotten softer and more plush while she had been setting up camp. Something she still failed to notice due to her ever growing hunger. Soon the stove signaled it was finished and she removed the meals from the unit and sat down at the sitting area. She had to adjust the table from its normal position due to the new girth of her belly taking up more space than normal and proceeded to eat both meals ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes she was scrapping the bottom of the second container and wanting more. Krystal with some difficulty got up from the small eating area and disregarding the warnings on the rations stating now to consume more then two rations a day due to the super hi calorie content for survival reasons, Krystal placed ten more rations in the stove unit for reconstitution. Once the unit was done Krystal brought the meals back to the eating area and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe E-Rations were in fact designed to be quite large and high in calories for survival, and while small in the package to save space and pack more for long term durations in emergencies, once reconstituted were big enough for three meals a day. The instructions recommended on ration a day is not active, or two rations if under strenuous activity, but no more then two rations per day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal in her ravenous state brought on by the effects of the strange creatures liquid injection completely failed to remember her survival training and proceeded to tare through the ten additional meals. Also unknown to Krystal the fluid from the creature was intended to increase the stomach capacity of the individual and fatten up their belly area for as yet unknown reasons of the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Krystal ate and ate, her belly grew and grew from the bulk of 6-12 days worth of food and the calories contained in the rations. Twice she had to adjust the table\u2019s position due to her growing midsection. Once finished eating Krystal was finally satisfied and stifled a yawn. She was starting to get tired from carb overdose and the effects of the creatures fluid. She tried to get off the couch but had difficulty due to her increased girth. Finally after moving the table out of the way she was able to force herself to her feet. The meals and the creature had swollen her midsection to the size and weight of a medicine ball, albeit a squishy medicine ball. Luckily for her the suit she wore was designed to fit the wearer despite their size and shape. To a point. Unluckily for Krystal she was continuing to grow fatter as time, the goo and the rations continued to convert directly into belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tired and sluggish Krystal waddled her way to the sleeping-pod. She keyed the controls of the pod and the door slid back and allowed her access. Krystal folded down one of the two bunks and eased her way into a sitting position on the mattress. Her belly had swollen so large she had to open her legs to accommodate for the bulk of her gut. She idly patted and rubbed her stomach, her hands squishing into the new fat and the goo\u2019s effects allowing her belly to stretch to accommodate the massive quantity of food and goo in her gut. She felt her belly fold and squish under her paws, but was so tired she didn\u2019t fully register what the goo and her actions had done to her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepily she yawned, \u201cIll feel better in the morning after some rest.\u201d And with that Krystal laid down and soon was fast asleep. While she slept the goo continued to work converting her meal and itself into fat on her belly. Slowly her stomach grew larger and softer, bulging further forward and to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Krystal woke from her food and goo coma sluggishly and tried to sit up on the bed. She had difficulty sitting up due to some sort of resistance. Once she managed to sit on the bed she found the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to me last night?!\u201d Krystal almost yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down all she could see was her gut. She couldn\u2019t even see the floor past her belly. Her belly had continued to grow during the night and had gotten quite large from the goo and her gorging that night before. It was so large that it pushed her legs wide in order to sit up and sagged over the edge of the bed. With difficulty Krystal got to her feet and made her way to the shelters small bathroom. Once she was in the bathroom she surveyed herself in the rooms full-wall mirror. Her couldn\u2019t believe how big her belly had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was now three feet wide and three and a half feet deep. It was so wide that she couldn\u2019t see her hips in the mirror unless she turned sideways, and sagged down over her crotch. She tried poking it with her finger and felt no resistance what so ever, her hand disappearing past her wrist. Placing both hands to either side of her gut Krystal lifted her belly up and let it fall, it bounced several times before coming to a rest. Her breast rested on top of her massive stomach which pushed them slightly to either side. Krystal undid her flight suit and let it fall to the floor. Despite how soft her belly had become, there were no fat folds to speak of, just one massive ball of flab. Her belly button was larger and disappear into the depths of her gut. Not wanting to see anymore Krystal struggle back into her flight suit, glad for the suits ability to stretch around its wearer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once fully dressed again Krystal made her way back into the main room of the shelter confused and upset by her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d Krystal asked herself, sitting down on the couch. \u201cHow did this happen to me? I remember the encounter with those barnacles last night and then making my way back to camp. Then I\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off as the event\u2019s of the night played back across her memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID I really eat that much? How is that even possible?\u201d she asked herself as she ran her hands over her belly, her belly feeling like a beanbag chair full of soft gel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her gut rumbled, signaling that it was hungry for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Not again! I couldn\u2019t think of eating anymore! If this keeps up I won\u2019t fit in the shelter, let alone the ship.\u201d Krystal cried into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her stomach wouldn\u2019t quit, and she eventually found herself raiding the ship E-Rations again and bringing in even more supplies then the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was so hungry she set the stove unit to prepare 30 rations, and once the machine was done took them to the table to scarf them down. Like the night before she ate and ate like a machine having to move the table out to the side and resting her current ration box on her growing gut. As she ate her belly grew larger and larger to accommodate for the massive amount of food she was consuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consuming a month\u2019s worth of rations Krystal sat back in the couch and rubbed her massive belly. Although her belly was stuffed bigger than the night before, she didn\u2019t feel stuffed or at her stomachs limit. In fact, Krystal was hungrier than before, and her belly just continued to grow larger to fill with more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside herself with hunger, Krystal struggle to her feet and made even more hi carb E-Rations. This time she made 50 rations, each the equivalent to one day\u2019s intake of a normal person waiting for rescue. Krystal took the rations back to the eating area and stacked most of them on the table to the side then sat down and put the rest on her belly for easier eating. The more she consumed the more her belly grew to accommodate the food entering her stomach. Her belly grew bigger and wider with every mouthful swallowed into her insatiable gut. The fat also grew with the influx of food, the food converting to fat half as fast as she ate. Krystal knew she should stop, but the hunger wouldn\u2019t let her. Soon she had to sit on the floor as she grew too big for the couch, her belly growing bigger and wider across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Krystal finished her month and a half rations and as she scraped the bottom of the last container she felt finally felt satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Krystal panted, her belly resting heavily on her and the floor. \u201cIf this keeps up I won\u2019t be able to leave the shelter when Fox finds me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal looked at herself sitting on the floor with her back to the wall. Her belly was larger than anything she had ever seen. Yet despite her belly\u2019s new girth and roundness, the rest of her hadn\u2019t gotten any bigger. For some reason only her belly got fatter. Krystal carefully got to her feet, having to lean back due to her center of gravity being two feet forward of what it used to be. She cautiously made her way to the bathroom and its full room mirror. She had to squeeze through the doorway now that her belly was wide then the door frame, yet it was so squishy and stretchy that although more than a foot wider than the frame she had little difficulty getting in. Once in the room Krystal keyed the controls for the rooms biometric scanners to survey the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now 5ft wide and 5 1/2ft deep in the middle. The scanners showed that 3/4 of today\u2019s meals remained in her gut, and the rest had already converted into fat. The scanners also showed a strange gooie substance coating the inside of her stomach, and that her capacity for food had grown immensely. The coating of goo seemed to allow for her stomach to be much stretchier than normal and able to grow in size to accommodate larger feeding. Why this was so was still unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal ran her hands over her new gut, resting it on the small rooms sink for support. While feeling her new belly she felt something strange. Looking at the scanner readouts she saw what she feared. Her belly was getting larger, bulging further and further out. The goo was metabolizing the food at an alarming rate and her belly was fattening bigger and fatter as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stop! I don\u2019t want to be hungry again so soon! Or ever again!\u201d Krystal yelled at her gut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got stuck in the main entrance, which for some slight design flaw had been made smaller than the inside doorways, and forced her way out into the open. Once outside Krystal leaned against a tree to catch her breath. Moving this huge nuisance was\u2026well\u2026a nuisance. Then Krystal caught sight of her ship and its stored E-Rations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d she told herself, \u201cI can eat any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal struggle with her control and her belly. Eventually her gut won out and she waddled to the nearby ship and its food stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal broke out the ship food reconstitute and as many E-Rations as she could carry to the wing, than went back to the storage compartment for more. Each time she did she put them in the unit\u2019s reconstituter and got more emptying out the freshly made meals and putting in more ration packs. Krystal finally sat on a stump that fortuitously was close to the wing and starting eating as fast as she could to keep up with the unit output.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Krystal ate and ate her belly grow to accommodate the new food. Growing fatter, wider, bigger, and rounder. Her belly just kept bulging bigger and bigger as she ate more and more. Krystal kept eating, this time unable to satisfy her growing gut as it grew larger to hold all the food. She never could feel full and satisfied. While her belly grew larger the goo got back to work digesting as well as growing her stomachs capacity. Bigger and bigger she got., the bottom of her belly started to brush the ground as she sat on her stump eating the ration packs as fast as she could pull them out. every so often Krystal had to lean to her left to pull another create of E-Rations out of the ship and shove them into the reconstitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more Krystal ate, the more she consumed the bigger her belly became to hold it all, and the hungrier she got. She had set her suits bio scanner to continuously monitor her stats. Not that she was looking at them of course. As her belly continued to grow larger and fatter, the unit read her stats. She was packing on weight faster than any person should be able to. Fatter and fatter, bigger and bigger, larger and larger. Krystal just kept eating and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was now touching the ground and pushing her legs farther and farther apart. Her belly began to spread under the ships wing, allowing her to stay in one spot now and continue eating. Tears ran down her cheeks as she kept going, unable to stop herself now. More and more food went into her belly, the goo growing her belly larger and larger to hold it all. Rounder and rounder her belly got. Finally, Krystal started to feel like she might be betting full. Her belly started to slow in its growing, and start protesting, yet she still couldn\u2019t stop. Something drove her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t it stop!?\u201d Krystal sobbed between mouthfuls, her belly now larger than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was starting the last container her hunger started to leave her. Her belly was now at its limit finally. Halfway through the container Krystal could eat no more. She put the unfinished food on the ship wing and tried to sit back, but her belly was wedged under the wing. Krystal was finally full, she couldn\u2019t eat another bite. The goo that made her hunger for food had finally wore itself out. but the goo that converted her stomachs contence to fat was still there, coating her stomach and enhancing her metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Krystal sat there. Relieved that she no longer had to eat, the goo started converting everything she just ate into belly fat. Her belly continued to grow ever larger, softer, wider. Krystal finally looked at the biometer and read the results. She was happy that the goo had finally burned itself out, but was concerned about how much bigger she was going to get due to all the food still in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope they find me soon.\u201d Krystal thought to herself, \u201cI think I ate all the food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed she had, all three years worth of normal consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly gurgled as it grew larger. Krystal looked down at it for the first time since stopping. \u201cI better move to a better place, or a my not be able to get out from under the wing. Krystal struggled to get up and pull herself free of the wing. She finally pulled herself free and sat down with her back to the ships hull. Al the while her belly continued to grow ever larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal took stoke of herself. She looked at her wrist comp and read the biometer results. Her belly was now 10ft wide and still growing with soft yielding fat. Krystal rubbed what she could reach. Her belly was still incredibly soft, but she could now feel the stomach underneath was stuffed to capacity. A capacity she never would of thought she could attain, or wanted. Her belly just continued to grow fatter and fatter, still metabolizing at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal started to feel drowsy, unable to stay awake. Although she tried, Krystal finally fell asleep, unable to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke she was shocked by two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She was huge. Her belly was easily twice as large as before she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust past the little shore she could just see over her bloated gut the barnacles that had caused this to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fear she watched them as they splashed feebly in the shallows of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was immensely worried that they may pump her full of more goo, causing this all to happen again. She didn\u2019t know if she could live through another session of eating and growing. Besides, she had consumed everything her ship had in the way of food rations. Krystal blanched a bit at this, disgusted with how much she had already consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, unable to move her 20ft wide belly of fat, she heard something in the sky, and a static burst on the ships radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had found her! She only hoped they could get to her before the barnacles could ooze their way on land and pump her bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also hopped they brought a mega-lift with them!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Krystal turned her gaze skyward, hoping to catch a glimpse of Fox's Arwing as it would fly overhead.  She could hear the roar of an engine, and the <i>whoosh</i> of wings as they sliced through the air.  The radio continued to crackle, letting her know that help was on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs minutes passed, though, without sight of the Arwing, the vixen began to grow frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?  Fox, you know I'm here...\" the vixen snapped to herself.  She sighed.  \"I guess...  That it might be a bit hard to see.  The skies look a bit foggy, definitely...  And it <i>is</i> getting dark...\"  Patience returned to the bloated blue fox as she rationalized her savior's tardiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her eyes from the sky for a moment to steal a glance at the barnacles.  They were...  Keeping their distance, it seemed.  While they continued to splash about, they seemed perfectly content to stay in the swamp.  Did they know she was even there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the roar of the engine overhead intensified, the barnacles froze.  Their tentacles stopped in mid-air, and for a few moments, didn't so much as twitch.  After a few moments, they resumed animation, whipping about before shooting back into the body of the beasts.  Their shells clamped shut, and the barnacles began to descend into the murky water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they're scared...  Ha!\"  With her foes having fled from her sight, she relaxed.  Fox could take all of the time in the world, so long as the barnacles would stay away.  The air was just as stagnant as it had always been, but Krystal had gotten used to it.  It was obviously breathable, and as day gave way to night, it became pleasantly cool, lapping at her enormous fatty belly as the fox rubbed what little of it she could reach.  She was...  Content?  Well, as content as one could be while being stranded on an unknown planet and being swollen to over fifty times your size.  She was relatively comfortable, cool, and most importantly, <i>not hungry.</i>  At least, not for now.  She let her mind wander as she kept listening to the engines overhead and the crackling of her radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the static buzzed into a low hum.  The fox lazily turned her head toward her ship to hear better as a broken, garbled voice came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kr...\"  A single syllable, followed by a few more.  \"...  Ul.  Kr...  St...  Uh...  Co...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like her name, a bit.  But she didn't recognize the voice; it certainly didn't sound like any of her crew-mates.  She could chalk that up to a poor signal, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since she heard the engines in the sky, she entertained the notion that...  <i>It might <b>not</b> be Fox's Arwing that she'd been hearing all this time.</i>  Paranoia washed over her.  If it wasn't Fox...  <i>Who was it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gotta be Fox...  This planet...  There's nobody on this planet.  We never heard any signals from any other ships, here, and we would have when we scanned the planet before we entered the atmosphere!  There's nobody here...\" she said to herself.  She wasn't quite sure she believed herself, though.  The scanners said there wasn't any intelligent life, but...  They could be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...  The radio!  I wouldn't be hearing anyone on the radio unless they had my frequency!  And the only people who have my frequency are Fox and Katt!..  Yeah...\"  <i>But what if her frequency had been \"hacked?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed nervously as the sound of engines grew ever louder and the silhouette of a spacecraft appeared overhead.  It was vaguely triangular, like an Arwing, but she couldn't make out any of the finer features of the body, or even its color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped as the shape flew overhead, growing larger as it descended from the sky but still remaining obscured by the misty sky and absence of light.  She couldn't move in this state; she was trapped by her enormous belly, which pinned the rest of her body against her ship.  She couldn't flee, and she was sure that, even if she couldn't see the ship, it could definitely see her.  <i>How could it miss a 20-foot-wide blob next to a downed spacecraft?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a sitting duck, plain and simple.  She could only hope that the ship above belonged to Fox, because if it didn't, her goose was cooked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Krystal looked on as the black figure descended from the sky, coming into view.  She could make out some of its features, now, as it began to circle overhead.  It was flying pretty fast...  Faster than an Arwing would normally fly.  Not a good sign...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as it was going, she could only make out its coloring...  Black, yellow and red.  No blue or gray to be seen anywhere.  The blue vixen hoped she was going colorblind, because otherwise, this was <b>not</b> an Arwing.  As it began to slow, she could make out some of its parts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings were a good deal thicker than she'd remembered an Arwing's wings being, a bit longer, and curved upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prow of the ship's hull ended in some hooked ornamentation...  That's new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the ship lacked any sort of cannons, save for one mounted on the below the cockpit on the ship's underside, which almost looked like...  A harpoon gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbject horror overtook the fattened blue fox as it became clear that, without the shadow of a doubt, this was, positively, <b>not</b> an Arwing (nor would it be a ship belonging to a colonist), and pretty clear that that was <b>not</b> Fox, nor would it be any of the missing colonists she was sent to find.  And while she couldn't say for certain, the vixen was <i>pretty</i> sure that it wasn't friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menacing ship flew in lazy circles overhead for what felt like hours to Krystal.  Could it see her?  I mean, you'd think it would, but...  Maybe it couldn't, through all of the fog and darkness.  <i>But why would it keep circling if it didn't see her?  What was it doing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox held her breath, hoping that it'd leave soon, that it hadn't detected her.  She'd be as quiet as possible, and it wouldn't hear her...  She hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exact wrong moment, her stomach began to rumble.  <i>Loudly.</i>  The vixen froze in fear as her belly began to quake and jiggle, quickly expanding before her as it's rumble grew louder.  It surged across the ground in front of her, and with this last expansion, her suit finally gave, dramatically ripping open and spilling the now-unrestrained belly across the ground.  The ship stopped in midair...  And a searchlight shone down from the mounted gun, rolling along the ground.  Mercifully, her belly went quiet and still, but she was sure it was too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe it wasn't!  The searchlight was out, sure, but it hadn't caught her yet!  Maybe it'll get bored and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELCH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen blushed as her mouth flew open to release a plume of foul-smelling red gas.  She belched again, and more gas filled the air.  It seemed to just linger around her, almost clinging to her as she kept releasing bulk-quivering bursts of gas from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe searchlight darted from its position next to a tree straight over to her and the Arwing.  The vixen, like a deer in the proverbial headlights, could only stare into the light as it lingered on her, the entire gun-mount facing her.  At the back of her mind, aside from the fear, she felt great shame, imagining how ridiculous she looked, a gassy, half-naked blue blob of fat jiggling helplessly against her downed Arwing...  But, back to the fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"harpoon\" in the gun began to spin within its barrel as a small blinking light flashed next to it.  She watched in horror as the weapon continued to \"prepare\" itself, awash in horrible anticipation of its inevitable launch.  She didn't have long to wait, though, as before she could even think of reacting (which she obviously couldn't, anyway), the \"harpoon\" shot out of the barrel, rocketing towards her and piercing the middle of her gut.  She began to scream, but stopped when she realized that she had barely even felt the missile strike her flesh.  Did it have a numbing agent in it?  Or was her gut simply numb, itself?  She took the moment to examine what little of it she could as the ship flew away, presumably to find a suitable spot to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was built like a syringe, it seemed.  She could see a gauge on the missile, and a plunger on its tail, accompanied by a large flashing light.  Her belly tingled as the plunger depressed, and she was injected with whatever was inside of the canister.  Her entire belly was overcome by a burning sensation as it began to quiver violently...  And shrink.  She could feel the fat in her gut start to thicken, and she could feel much of it...  Migrating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the fat seemed to be distributing itself around her body.  Her belly shrank, but everything else grew.  Her breasts swelled with new flesh, surging forward to meet the receding horizon of her belly, which lost its spherical shape and became a more \"natural\" collection of folds and bulges crowned with a cavernous navel.  Her thighs thickened, pressing into each other and spreading her legs apart as the fought for space.  Her hips, not to be outdone, flared out from her sides, swelling into ever-fuller curves.  Her ass exploded outward, rolling across the ground beneath her, spreading to fill her body's new width.  Her calves and arms weren't spared, either, as they too ballooned, swallowing her paws in flab and leaving only dimples suggesting where they might be buried.  And to \"round\" this all out, numerous rolls of back-fat grew from behind her, giving her a cushion between her body and the hard, cold metal of the Arwing.  The transformation completed with her face, with a surprisingly-modest second chin forming beneath her first one, and some cherubic jowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could hardly believe what had just happened.  Only a couple of minutes ago, there was over 30 feet of belly-fat spread out in front of her...  Now, she was left with a \"modest\" 5 feet of belly, and 5 feet of back-fat, and 10 feet from side-to-side.  The burning sensation subsided, being replaced by the natural warmth of what must be over a ton and a half of blue vixen.  The fox panted as she was overwhelmed by the stifling heat.  Rivulets of sweat formed all over her body as the cool night air became inadequate in keeping her cool, sliding down her bloated form and getting caught in her folds.  She shuddered to think of how difficult it would be to keep herself clean and fresh, but that was the least of her worries right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was presumably the pilot of the attacking ship came into view out of the brush...  A ten-foot-tall, bipedal dragonoid creature, staring at her with malicious intent as he strolled toward his \"prey.\"  She could see that it was smiling; a wicked, toothy grin.  <i>Lots</i> of teeth.  <i>Sharp</i> teeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could only hope that it wasn't as carnivorous as it looked...</span></div></div>",

Krystal wakes up one morning, yawns, and gets out of bed. She walks over to her floor length mirror and looks herself over. Her formerly trim, yet curvy, figure was starting to fill out causing her nightie to grow snug. She sighs and rubs both hands over her plump hips, up her softening sides, and caresses her round middle. Krystal looks down at her breasts, which have grown even more noticeably then the rest of her body, a full three or four cups. She sighs again. \"I hope Fox hasn't noticed all the weight I've packed on recently.\" Her hands roam up to her breasts, tightly packed into the top of her nightie, and starts fondling them. She grins and gives a quiet moan of pleasure. \"At least he will like these being bigger.\" \"Actually, I like all of you being bigger.\" Comes Fox's voice from behind her, as he reaches around her softening belly. He starts rubbing her gut in unison with her fondling. Her belly starts jiggling slightly as she turns her head and nuzzles him on the cheek. \"Thanks Fox. You sure do know how to make a growing girl feel beautiful.\" Fox chuckles and kisses her on the lips. \"How about we make you larger?\" Krystal gasps. \"You want me larger Fox?\" \"Yes. You look good now, but you could look even better.\" She ponders for a few mintues. \"Ok Fox. Make me you big, flabby, love vixen!\" He smiles at her request. \"Ok my love.

An audible growl came from said stomach.  \"What do you think, my Reynard?\"  Krystal continued in a sultry tone, also moving her lover's hand up to her breast and making him squeeze it.<br>\r\nFox, after recovering from Krystal's teasing, managed to say: \"Um, Krystal, just eating would take forever to put on weight, why not-\"<br>\r\nKrystal couldn't help but giggle at Fox's almost child-like answer: \"Oh Foxxy, don't you think good things should be savored?\"  The she-fox took her man's other hand and cupped her right breast, letting own and sensual sigh. (Clearly, she enjoying this whole situation maybe a bit much)<br>\r\n\"Okay, when you put it that way...\" a more ravenous Fox uttered, spinning his voluptuous, sapphire vixen around and locked lips.<br>\r\nBoth vulpines were in total bliss, with Fox caressing Krystal's softened back and sides while having her enlarged bust pressing against his chest.  But just when Fox was getting comfortable, Krystal shoved him into the bed and took off, giggling like a little girl.  Fox quickly got up, but Krystal was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<i>It's a wonder she can still move so fast with all that added weight, especially in her boobs</i> \"Hey, I thought you were hungry!\" Fox called out.<br>\r\n\"Feeding myself is sooo boring!\" Krystal shouted back. \"Come find me and you can stuff me yourself!\"<br>\r\nJust the thought of Krystal's belly filled to bursting got Fox fired up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 or so minutes, Fox finally caught Krystal (she let him win).<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Unhand me, you ruffian!\" howled Krystal, hitting Fox with punches barely stronger than light taps.<br>\r\nImmediately catching on to Krystal's act: Fox, doing his best impression of a gangster, replied: \"Uh no, Honey, you gonna be comin' wit me.\"<br>\r\nFox proceeded to take a \"struggling\" Krystal to the kitchen and tied her up and gagged to a reclining chair.  (Fox had tied up his fair share of criminals in his bounty-hunting career, but he knew Krystal wasn't really going to try and escape, so he didn't tie her up so hard to hurt her)  \"Now you jus' sit tight.  I'm gonna fill that pudgy belly up so much, you'll look 7 months along.\" Fox sinisterly whispered into Krystal's ear.<br>\r\n\"MMph-m-mmmmphhhmm!\" she screamed, or at least tried to, before Fox blindfolded her.<br>\r\n\"Wait 'ere, I'll be back real soon.\" said Fox before going to get dressed then leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal sat as comfortably as she could while bound, gagged, blindfolded, and very hungry.<br>\r\n<i>When is Fox coming back, it feels like an eternity since I last heard him!</i><br>\r\nThe sound of a door opening and closing caught the vixen's attention, followed by footsteps getting closer to her until they stopped right beside her, and then the sound of fabric crumpling. <br>\r\n\"Hello, beautiful.  Did ya miss me?\" asked a familiar male voice with an obviously fake gangster accent.<br>\r\nKrystal was relieved that fox had returned, but acted like she was afraid; trying to scream and struggle free.  She then felt his hands grab the bottom of her nightie, pull it up, then tuck it under the fold of her breasts: leaving her round belly and barely visible panties exposed.  Fox's hand quickly found itself to Krystal's jelly belly, which responded with a loud rumble.<br>\r\n\"Well, well!  Sounds like dis beasty's HUNGRY!!\"  laughed <i>Gangsta</i> Fox.  \"I tink I got jus' the thing to take care o' that!\"<br>\r\nKrystal heard the sound of a large tray being placed on the table, then a cover being lifted from said tray.  A small collection of delicious smells soon entered Krystal's nose: first was the smell of some fried bread or dough slathered in butter and maple syrup, then a kind of fried meat.  These smells were cause Krystal to salivate heavily, but before she could take in any more, her blindfold was undone and she saw the source of the scrumptious aroma siting on the table.  Krystal's eyes went wide upon seeing enough to feed five people!</span></div></div>",

It was like eating a creamy, sugar-marinated, thick cloud: Scrumptious.<br>\r\n\"Ya like that, don't cha?\" Asked Fox as he readied the next bite, this time adding a juicy bacon strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes, the pancakes and bacon had lost almost half their mass into Krystal's slightly bulged belly.<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me, may I have a drink?\" Krystal asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course.  All ya had t' do was ask!  Just a sec.\"  Fox answered before adjusting the chair to lean back more.<br>\r\nThe new position definitely relieved the pressure Krystal was feeling.  Fox certainly knew how to keep his \"prisoners\" comfortable.<br>\r\nA thick straw coming from the mocha cup was presented to the parched vixen.  \"Here, drink up.\" Fox ordered.<br>\r\nKrystal complied: wrapping her lips around the straw, and began to suck.<br>\r\nThe brew was as divine as she'd hoped.  The sweat hot chocolate and the bitter coffee, while very different tastes, complemented each other wonderfully.  It may have also helped that Krystal tasted a generous amount of sugar and heavy cream in there as well.<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, the straw was pulled from Krystal's mouth.<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough f' now.\"  said Fox as he resumed feeding his growing vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 more minutes later: the pancakes, bacon, and mocha had completely disappeared into Krystal's rock-hard gut.<br>\r\nFox untied Krystal's hands from the chair arms.

Krystal enjoyed the relief Fox's caressing gave her.<br>\r\nAfter a short while, Krystal asked Fox to help her up.  It took a few minutes, but Fox managed to help Krystal up and to their bedroom.  As Krystal laid sprawled on the bed, she and Fox rubbed her belly to relieve some more of the pain.<br>\r\n\"Fox?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Krystal.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you get me a small ice cream, please?\"<br>\r\nFox's jaw nearly went slack.  \"Krystal, I just fed you more than 3 kilos of food!  How can you still be hungry?!\" Fox blurted out, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling a little better, I'll be careful.\" replied Krystal calmly before moving her hands to her bust. \"Besides: the more I eat, the bigger I get.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, hon.  But first\" said Fox as he leaned toward Krystal's face.  The two vulpines kissed for almost a full minute before Fox left to get Krystal's dessert.<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on!\" Krystal called out, to which Fox stopped upon entering the door frame.  \"What took you so long when I was tied-up?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... I went to get enough food supplies for a month: but considering how much you ate, I'd say it'll only last a week at best.\" replied Fox with a big grin.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...

She could have made a jump back to a more civilized region in order to restock, but her ship had gotten gotten some readings from this planet that warranted some investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, quite taken by the splendor of this world. She had set down at the edge of a wide plain, filled with some type of blue grass that came up to her waist. A distant mountain range seemed to made from some form of green stone, though it was hard to tell with how the suns were casting their light. Behind her, a dense forest stretched on, filled with tall trees all capped with blue canopies, thick with leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a slight feeling of surprise and maybe excitement from somewhere, but couldn't pin down the exact location. Looking around closer didn't reveal the source either. Reaching back into the ship, she grabbed a field pack, containing some basic gear she might need, including some of her last remaining rations. Hiking the pack onto her shoulders, she grabbed a small hand scanner, waved it around, and was able to locate a nearby source of water. Sealing the ship down, she shifted her jumpsuit around to avoid rubbing her fur the wrong way, and set off. While keeping an eye on the scanner to tell if she was going the right way, as well as keeping her other senses tuned to detect any possible threats, she moved into the forest.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't stop having the feeling she was being watched, but could see no sign of who or what it was, neither with her own senses or that of her hand scanner. Quickly moving  through the forest, she was able to find her way to the water, actually a wide fast flowing river. She was surprised by the condition of it, though considering what she saw of the world, she might not have been. Rather than the typical clear water she was used to, this river had a distinctly purple hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see signs of animal activity in the muddy river banks, as well as what seemed to be fruit bearing plants clustered around the water. So the water seemed to be fine for the things on the planet, but she had no idea if it would work for herself. Even repeated scans from her scanner found nothing wrong with the water, but also no explanation for the color. Looking around, she thought that maybe the water was just picking up something in the ground that was giving it that color, maybe it might be clear closer to the source. After watching the flow of the river, she could tell which way it was coming from, and set off in that direction. Unseen by her, some of the branches in a tree above her moved, as if something had jumped off to another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked along, waving the scanner around to get some more readings that she could, she pulled out one of her last water bottles. It was warm, but at least it was wet, and she knew what was in it, unlike that river water. As she put the bottle away,she didn't realize that she had walked straight into a large clearing. After the dappled blue light within the forest, coming right out into the sunlight blinded her momentarily blinded her. Blinking her eyes to clear the spots, as well as bringing her arm up to take some of the glare off, she looked around as best she could. Slowly features could start to be picked out, the clearing was almost entirely devoid of trees, just a few short ones here and there. There were also a number of stone pieces around, too well formed to be natural, but not all that well maintained, they were cracked and broken, dirty looking, laying in the grass of the clearing. The seemed to be arrayed around the remains of a path, now nearly overgrown with the native grass. Dominating the clearing was a large structure, seemingly made out of carved sections of the same white stone, but seemingly much better maintained, quite bright in the sunlight. The river also seemed to spill from within the wide doorway to the structure, no less purple than when she found it before. The path seemed to lead up along one side of the river, up into the yawning darkness within the building.</span></div></div>",

Unsurprisingly, it didn't, no small wonder since it couldn't even figure out what was up with the water. She quietly stepped up the remains of the path, using the stone pieces as cover. The darkness within hid the inside completely, right up to when she finally reached the massive stone that formed one side of the entryway. There she could finally make out a bit of the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river seemed to flow through a large stone trough, much narrower than what the river had cut out of the ground within the forest. Sunlight streamed through a large hole in the ceiling, illuminating a large platform in the middle of an empty chamber. Stepping inside, Krystal was caught by the drop in temperature, it seemed like it had dropped something like ten degrees from the temperate conditions outside. A quick check of the scanner confirmed that she was right. Thankful for her jumpsuit and fur, she continued moving in. The walls were covered in long chains of some alien script or pictograms, it was hard for her to tell, and something seemed to be giving a glow from a pedestal on the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer, Krystal could see that the platform was circular and flat, The same purple water she had been following seemed to flow from all points around the platform before flowing on out of the structure, A number of small stone bridges connected that central platform with the rest of the chamber's floor. She still couldn't tell what the object was in the center of the room, but she felt drawn towards it. Checking around again, she then proceeded across the nearest bridge to the center. Finally back within the light from above, she could see what the whole room seemed to be arrayed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop the pedestal was a statue maybe 2 feet tall. It seemed to be made of a clear crystal, but it radiated a light from within. As Krystal watched, the light seemed to twinkle and shift through various colors, it even gave off an aura of energy and warmth. Spinning in place, she looked around the room, thinking that the whole place seemed to be a temple devoted to this statue. Turning back to face it, Krystal moved a bit closer to get a better look. The statue seemed to be of a person, but like no person she had ever seen before. The decidedly female figure had four arms, and a vulpine like face. The oddest part was that figure was bloated out in all directions, swollen beyond compare. The stomach of the figure was a huge round orb stretching out from the body, and resting on the stone of it's pedestal. Huge breasts sat heavily upon the swollen stomach, and might have been spherical if not for setting atop that larger sphere. The arms were swathed in flesh, and looked like they wouldn't be able to move far. Broodmother sized hips and a tremendous butt likely served as a bit of a counterweight to the figure's bust and belly. Even the face was dripping with weight, but it had a maternal care and shape to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Krystal looked around again, but her eyes kept getting drawn back to the statue and it's light. At this range, she could almost swear that it was calling out to her, like a voice she could barely hear. Her fingers twitched, and she started to put her hand towards the statue, feeling a slight tingle reaching up her arm as she got closer and closer.</span></div></div>",

As she did so,her whole body surged with energy, every muscle in her body locked up. The light from the statue grew blindingly bright, washing everything away in it's brilliance. The tingle that she had felt before was now spread through her whole body, only much stronger. The warmth from the statue started to move up her arm, flowing through her body and washing the chill of the room away. The warmth continued to grow, till Krystal thought she might just burst into flame.The feeling seemed to be especially centered around her stomach, feeling like there was a fire burning away within, yet no pain came from the heat. As quickly as this had started, it ended, the room being cast into darkness, and she slumped over into unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then awake some time latter, foggy headed and sore. Her head throbbed, and her body ached. Slowly she was able to piece together some of her sensations. It hurt to try opening her eyes, so she didn't for now. She could feel the cold stone beneath her, so she was laying on her back...what had happened to her pack, she didn't remember taking it off. Unable to come up with an idea, she let it pass for now, too much thinking made her head hurt worse. She didn't actually feel cold though, if anything she felt like she was overly warm. Slowly she was able to make out a noise, soft whispers and a padding noise, almost like...bare feet stepping across the stone. Too many to be just one from the sound of things. Trying her eyes again, they responded a bit better. Everything was blurry, but she could start to make out some things. Like how the room was mostly cast in darkness, no sun in the sky, maybe a little dull moonlight coming through the hole instead. Had she really been out till nightfall? Blinking her eyes a couple times, she could make out figures walking around the platform in the room. Blinking her eyes several more times helped bring them into focus. Moving around near her were about 6 vulpine figures, all covered in short deep blue fur. Then she saw something else, all of them had four arms, much like that statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue! A piece clicked in her brain as some of her memories recovered, and she looked around, eventually finding it still atop the pedestal. The glow seemed dimmer, but still remained illuminating the curves carved into the crystal. Her headache seemed to be passing, but now she was left surrounded by at least 6 of these people, likely a native population to the world. Not a lot of options she had left. She found her pack to one side, with one of the natives going through it, not much she could do there. No way she could even try fighting her way out, not in her condition. Not coming up with anything else, she tried sitting up.</span></div></div>",

A great gnawing hunger seemed to open up within, causing her to flop back down with a growl as her stomach cramped. At the sound of her falling back, her growl, or maybe even the hungry roar issuing from her stomach, the native that was inspecting her pack turned around and stared at her. He gave a short bark in their language, and now all of the natives were be looking straight at her. Her whole body was left drained, yet still felt strangely warm, leaving her lying there for whatever they wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they wanted to do was form a loose circle with all 6 of them surrounding her, Then as one, they knelt down to one knee, and laid their torsos across their upright legs, seemingly bowing towards her. Being so much closer, and her hunger abating somewhat, she was able to get a closer look at them. All of them had the blue fur and four arms, as well as two tails she noted. She also noticed that all 6 of them were males, or at least they certainly looked it. The 6 were bare chested, and wore what looked like some type of hide pants. All of them carried at least one spear, a much more muscular one carried two larger spears, while the tallest one also had a longbow strung across his body. The one who was going through her pack leaned up, the leader she thought judging from the more complex and ornate piece on his spear, still on his knee and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke to her in his language, and though she couldn't understand it, it seemed to be maddeningly familiar. It seemed to be a question from his tone, but she couldn't be sure, and had no way to answer either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried the best she could though, \"I'm sorry, but I don't understand.\" Trying to put as even a tone to her voice so they might not think she was insulting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader seemed to ponder this, then gave what seemed like an order to the rest of them. There seemed to be some excitement to their words at that, talking back and forth, then two of them got up and walked away, towards the doorway. Two of the others, the one with the bow and another, came closer and leaned over her. They stopped just before touching her, and looked into her face. It almost seemed like they were asking if it was okay for them to help her up. Krystal nodded, hoping that it might mean about the same thing to them as she thought. It must have because they tenderly grabbed her arms and helped her stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing, she saw a movement of light that didn't seem to come from the environment. She also realized that was was naked except for her fur, no sign of her jumpsuit at all. Did something happen to it when she touched the statue, or did these people do something to it while she was out? She felt embarrassed to be before them naked like this, and did as best she could to cover up with her hands and tail. Another wave of hunger caused her to hold her stomach, such concerns forgotten, and as she did so she saw the light shift. After the wave subsided a bit, she held her hand out a bit and saw the light shifting around. Looking down over her breasts, she saw that some symbol was now across her stomach, emitting the same light that statue did. Another wave of hunger caused her to cramp up, the two nearest moving to catch her. This hunger pang seemed worse than the last ones.</span></div></div>",

She was able to bring her head up enough to look at her pack, still laying where the leader had left it. Stumbling straight at it, she went right for the rations still inside. Tearing the foil packaging with her teeth, she dove right into the pouches. The bland but nutritionally dense foodstuffs was quickly stuffed down her throat. Grabbing one of the water bottles, she flipped the top off and guzzled it, helping to move the dry food down into her stomach. Another two pouches were quickly torn open and emptied just as quickly, followed by another bottle of water. Partway through a fourth ration, she was finally able to gain control of herself again. Looking down at the shredded packaging surrounding her, as well as the partially eaten one in her hand, she realized that she had eaten enough food that should have lasted her at least a week, and yet it had only taken a few minutes, and she still felt hungry. All of that food had only taken the edge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she was being watched, she turned and saw the natives staring at her. It was hard to tell, but she thought they might actually look amazed at what she had done. The leader gave another small command with a hand motion, and the one with the bow stepped forwards. Krystal was feeling a little better, and was able to stand on her own, if a little shakily. Nodding, he instead picked up her pack and after looking at the detritus, picked it up and shoved it into her pack as well. She remained with the open pouch of food, and continued to nibble on it, seemingly helping her hunger just a bit. The leader and the one with two spears then started walking towards the doorway, with the bowman motioning for her to follow them. The last one brought up the rear, still looking around the room, and back at the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they passed over the bridge, Krystal saw her reflection in the water surrounding the platform. Moving closer, she was able to see the symbol across her stomach more clearly. The shimmering water and shifting colors of the symbol made it a bit harder to make out, but from what she could tell it was a circular symbol with two parallel lines cutting down across it, centered around her navel. A single shorter line connected the tops of the two vertical lines. Thinking it looked familiar, she looked up at the script on the walls, there it was, and again, and again, and so on. The symbol was repeated many times across the walls, and that was just in the small area she could see in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natives waited patiently for her till she was ready. Still unable to make heads or tails of anything, Krystal gave up on that, and take a few steps forwards. They figured that she was ready to move again, so they set off. Outside, the two that were sent ahead waited till all of them exited, then they quickly bolted off for the tree line. Once there, they took a huge jump, landing halfway up the trees, another and they vanished into the thick foliage of the canopy. The group around Krystal made for the same area, though much slower to allow her to keep up. Within the forest, it was nearly pitch black with little light coming through the canopy. The natives seemed to know exactly where to go, and Krystal had no other idea, so she followed right along.</span></div></div>",

She nibbled on the remains of the ration pack, but her gnawing hunger didn't allow her much choice but to eat it on top of the other 3 she had eaten. Her stomach still felt empty despite all of the food she had already eaten. A distant peal of thunder could be heard echoing through the forest, while a cool breezes weaved it's way through the trees. Krystal shivered a bit as the breeze ruffled her bare fur. Seeing this, the bowman following behind her said something to the leader, who looked back at her. Responding to the archer, he gave a hand signal to his fellows, and all of them set off a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully we're going somewhere a bit warmer, and somewhere with clothes for me.\" She thought to herself as she tried to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was inexperienced in this forest though, and her feet seemed to find every exposed tree root or slippery rock they could. The archer was always quick to catch her and help her stand so they could continue. The sound of the thunder continued to get closer, while the breeze grew in intensity. Before long, Krystal was able to hear rushing water, and the babble of voices. Up ahead, she could see hints of light through the thick tree trunks. A few moments later, the party passed into a clearing in the woods, just as some fat raindrops started to fall.</span></div></div>",

When they passed through the gate, Krystal could see that it was a large village, populated by the same people that had found her in the temple. There seemed to be quite a gathering of the blue four armed foxes as they walked down the main path. Krystal saw more of the males, most looking trim as the hunters or scouts that she had been traveling with. The females she saw were quite different; all of those she could see tended to be at least plump, while some were downright fat. More than a few of them tended to have much larger rounder stomachs their weight would suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps they're pregnant.\" Krystal wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also grew more self conscious, trying her best to cover up body up with her hands and tail. Though none of them seemed to have too much a problem with her bare fur covered body. The rain was starting to fall more heavily, so the people tended to congregate under shelter as they watched Krystal go by. She noticed that the village seemed to be laid out in a circle, most of the buildings surrounding a center section. The rushing water that she heard turned out to be a river, perhaps the same river that she had found and led to the temple, flowing into a pool in the middle of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the center was quite a sight: a much larger version of the statue that she had found in the temple, carved out of stone a bit more roughly, but the design was unmistakable. Lit by a ring of roughly hewn glowing crystals, seemingly much like what the small statue was made out of, the statue rose above the center pool with much the same dimensions as it's smaller version, just on a much larger scale. Seeing the statue like that, Krystal could only think of the words Earth Mother to describe it. As she looked a little closer, she saw the same symbol carved on the statue's massive belly as was on her stomach and around the temple. Perhaps the symbol was even on the small crystal statue, but it was hard to tell because of the smaller size and the glow from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four that helped her through the forest waited patiently for her. The one at the rear kept looking back and forth between the stone statue and Krystal, though she was too entranced to notice. When she had recovered, the leader said a few words to the others. They allow gave what seemed to be a salute or something, clasping their four hands in front of their chests and bowing  their heads slightly. Then they separated and went on their ways. Left with just the leader, Krystal looked up at him. He pointed ahead to a building nearest the statue, and started walking towards it. She dutiful followed behind, not having any other ideas, especially in the middle of such a number of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The leader pulled back the curtain covering the doorway, and motioned for Krystal to enter. She cautiously stepped inside, and he followed. The room looked like where a shaman might do their business, shelves with various powders and other small ingredients in bowls or jars, a stone copy of the same statue sitting in a place of honor in the center of the back of the room, the whole place softly lit with another of the roughly carved glowing crystal hanging in the middle as well as a few candles dotted around. The leader gave a soft call, and a feminine voice answered from a doorway in the back of the room. The curtain slid back and a fox woman stepped out, likely the answering voice's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look around but took a startled jump when her eyes fell on Krystal. Looking up at the male, the female fired off some fast words with a wide surprised look in her eyes. The male seemed to answer her, and continued at some length. The female sat down on a cushion on the rug in the center of the room, right in front of the altar, she motioned for Krystal to sit in front of her on a similar cushion, and she slowly did so, still completely lost on what they were saying, but had some feeling they were talking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it looked like she had some time, Krystal took a moment to more closely examine the woman. Like the others, she had the blue fur, four arms, and two tails. Like the females that Krystal had seen in the village, this one was definitely more round than the males she had seen in the village, but she was even more so than the other females. Her round stomach looked to be around eight to nine months along with at least 3 children, but was still covered in a soft layer of fat. Her breasts were somewhat spherical despite their obvious weight, and sat heavily atop her stomach, Her face was round, and had a maternal feel to it. Her neck sloped into her soft shoulders, which led into her arms. There was quite a layer of fat to her arms,  but there was muscle somewhat visible under the flab as well. The woman's butt was just as soft from what Krystal saw when she came in. Her hips were wide and well muscled even under the layer of fat covering them,  and her calves had slightly more easily seen muscles. Her long black hair was braided with various little charms hanging from the cordage. A number of amulets hung from bands around her neck, plunging into the shadow of her cleavage. Beaded cords wrapped around her neck and looped under her breasts, likely to connect to the neck piece in the back. A similar beaded belt started near the bottom curve of her stomach and likely continued underneath, with a leather section hanging loosely in the front, now behind her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to realize that Krystal was looking at her, so she turned her attention back to Krystal. Realizing that she had been caught staring, Krystal looked away quickly. Glancing back though, she realized the woman seemed to be observing her just the same, though her eyes were especially drawn to the glowing symbol on Krystal's stomach. The leader had finished his story it seemed, and the woman, a wise woman of this tribe (all for lack of better words on Krystal's part) considered this then said a few words to him. The male gave the same salute as the other males that helped Krystal, clasping his four hands in front of his chest and bowing his head. He held this pose for longer and backed out the door without looking up. As the curtain fell back into place, Krystal could see him looking at her before he was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the woman, Krystal didn't know what else to do except wait. The woman looked at her thoughtfully for a while before saying a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to understand, \"I'm sorry, but I don't understand you,\" trying to keep her voice level and slow to try and avoid any misinterpretation from the tone. The woman seemed to consider this, looking down at the marking on Krystal's stomach, then she seemed to have an idea.</span></div></div>",

Reaching down and pulling off one of her amulets, she offered it to Krystal. Krystal slowly reached out and took it before examining the necklace. It was a deep blue stone with the same symbol as the statues carved on it, hung on a leather cord with similar smaller blue stones arranged on the band. The woman went through the motions as if she was putting it on, making it obvious that she wanted Krystal to do so. She shrugged and turned it over before slipping it over her head. Looking down at the stone, Krystal thought she saw a shimmer within it, but she couldn\u2019t be sure because at that moment a bright flash and noise rattled her whole head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head felt foggy and slow like before, she was having this happen too often for her liking. Blinking her eyes several times, she found that she was still sitting on the floor across from the woman. The woman on the other hand was still sitting as if nothing had happened, and maybe whatever it was had just happened to Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice shocked Krystal, coming from the woman, but she could understand it,\u201d Can you understand me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could hear her speaking in their language, but she was able to understand it just as well as if she had always known it. Even more surprising was how she answered in their language, \u201cYes\u2026but how\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave a little laugh before answering, \u201cMy my, that worked even better than I thought. That amulet has been passed down for generations, it was said to bring understanding, and it certainly seemed to have worked for you. You may call me Shiara, and what may I call you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was still fuddled, but recovered enough to answer, \u201cKrystal, my name is Krystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Krystal, may I be the first the welcome you to our village, or at least the first one you can understand. It is very nice to meet you,\u201d Shiara said bowing her head respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was about what had happened to her, but was interrupted by a roar from her stomach; she had almost entirely forgotten about her hunger from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my apologies, I suspected this would happen. Will you please join me?\u201d Shiara said standing up, and help Krystal stand despite her own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin you?\u201d Krystal managed to say despite the protests of her stomach gnawing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, at the feast in your honor,\u201d Shiara responded, \u201cbut first, we better get you some clothes, you were awfully chilled after coming through the forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could only nod her head in agreement before following the woman through the curtain in the back of the room.</span></div></div>",

Up close the purple hue was even more vibrant and she saw how it even dyed the soaked soil above the waterline a similar shade. Her scanner could still find no cause for the color, but nor was there any odd smell to the water either, or at least far as she could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hairs on the back of her neck suddenly stood up and the feeling that someone was out there grew stronger, but she still couldn\u2019t tell where they were. The snap of a branch made the vixen whirl around, trying to find out where the noise was coming from. The swift motion dislodged a portion of the riverbank she was standing on causing her to lose her footing and fall into the river. Rising to the surface sputtering, she found that the churning current made getting back out difficult, as did the crumbly land bordering the river. Krystal finally managed to snag onto a protruding root and pull herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHack and coughing, she spit out some of the water, feeling more than a little angry that she hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to her surroundings and falling in. Her irritation was partially tempered by the fact that she had found out the water didn\u2019t taste odd either, but that was little consolation since she didn\u2019t want to be exposed to whatever was in it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of footsteps swishing through grass made Krystal look up\u2026right into the point of a spear pointed right at her. Slowly she raised her hands in what she hoped would mean to the person that she meant no harm and not insult them in some way. The figure holding the spear was covered from head to toe in a flowing hooded cloak that hid whatever body lay beneath, but Krystal could see metal and leather armor covering the arms poking out from under the cloak. More figures appeared from the shadows under the trees, all similarly attired and carrying spears. That was about all the vixen had time to see though as her vision suddenly started swimming and her head felt heavy. She flopped face down on the ground, and saw a pair of boots appear in her field of vision before she slipped into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits and pieces drifted through her mind: people standing over her talking in some unknown language, being carried beneath the lintel of what had to be the building she had seen the water pouring out of, an enormous statue towering over her along with voices chanting, before nothing again. When she finally came to, her throat was dry and her tongue felt like she had been licking sand for a while. Her eyes took a while to focus, but eventually she found herself in\u2026</span></div></div>",

She still felt worn out though so she started to drift off again feeling the roughness of a blanket laid across her. Eyes snapping open again, she looked down and saw the blanket as well as how her suit was missing underneath. A frantic search and she found it hanging near a small fire nearby. Despite her head starting to spin, the vixen made to slide out from under the blanket and grab her suit and the back sitting nearby. She froze when she heard a nearby quiet noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting beyond the fire at the mouth of the cave, Krystal could make out one of the cloaked figures that she had encountered. And that encounter was a while ago it seemed, judging from the near darkness outside, though the sheeting rain may have been helping with that. Seated on a small outcrop of stone facing away, Krystal couldn\u2019t see much of anything about the figure, though she thought that maybe she could see that the shoulders were hunched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, the vixen resumed slipping out from the makeshift bed she found herself lying in, but a wave of nausea was followed by an even stronger wave of vertigo. They hit hard enough that she tumbled sideways to the floor. She didn\u2019t know how long she lay there, drifting in the limbo between conscious and unconsciousness, but she thought she briefly heard a startled shout along with a of running feet coming closer.

Something bright passed over Krystal\u2019s face, dazzling her eyes and causing sharp stab of pain through her skull. The other muttered something but in a language that Krystal couldn\u2019t recognize. The brightness passed as fast as it had begun. Opening her eyes a crack, Krystal saw that the other had retreated a few steps. She was looking down at something in her hand and scratching her head as she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal couldn\u2019t help but let her eyes stray down the other\u2019s body. She was tall, very tall. The horns on her head were almost scraping the cave\u2019s roof above. Her cloak was open, exposing more of the metal and leather armor underneath. Her attire hid much of her underlying form. Enough was visible though that Krystal could tell that the tall cow standing over her was rather well built with plenty of curves. There was a supple grace to her movements as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt, Krystal realized that the cow was staring at her with those violet eyes. The waves of concern faded somewhat, though not all the way. The other said something, it might have been a question, but Krystal still couldn\u2019t understand it. Her own voice failed as a sudden coughing fit racked her body. Through tear filled eyes, the vixen saw the other lean down below the alcove. Then something pressed against Krystal\u2019s lips and a small trickle of water wet her tongue. As the coughing started to die away, she was able to open her mouth and let more of the water in. A dark haze started to settle over her mind again before a sudden wave of vertigo crashed over her. Before she slipped under, she was dimly aware that her stomach seemed to be rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFragments of sights, sounds, and other sensations intruded on the otherwise unbroken darkness. Krystal remembered more armored figures crowded around her, conversing in their unknown tongue. Then came a time where she was lying down on a stretcher or something, a pair of the figures carrying her between them. She managed to make out the edge of a glowing gate or something. She also remembered low hanging storm clouds as well as a clear star filled sky, though those two events seemed to be far closer together to her mind than they should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke again, this time in a furnished room rather than in the jungle or a cave or whatever. Looking around, she found that she was in a bedroom, that was much was obvious. Soft cream colored walls with plenty of intriguing art surrounded her. The fourth wall seemed to be a floor to ceiling and wall to wall window though. That was a best guess from what little light shown through the curtains that covered it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt better rested than she had in a long time. Her head wasn\u2019t spinning any longer and her mouth didn\u2019t taste like the bottom of a trash can. Stretching her arms out, she ran her hands through light and airy sheets that all but flowed like water through her grasp. She frowned and furrowed her brow as she saw something that didn\u2019t make sense. The way the sheets were falling around her body didn\u2019t look right. It looked like she was wearing a padded suit or something. Throwing the sheet back, Krystal stared in shock at what she found.</span></div></div>",

As she tried to avoid aggravating her head, she thought back to what had happened to her. She found that she couldn\u2019t remember much of what had happened to her, only bits and pieces. She remembered exploring a distant region of space away from the <i>Great Fox</i> and everyone else beyond the region they had previously explored. She also remembered coming across an inhabited star system with several worlds home to people. She thought she could remember walking around one of the cities for a while, learning what she could, and then someone\u2026grabbed her\u2026maybe, her memories started to get really hazy around that point though. Eventually her headache eased up enough that she tried sitting up again, and was somewhat successful. She was in a lavish bedroom, lying under the covers of a large and luxurious bed. She also realized that under the covers, she was completely naked, and there was no sign of her body suit as far as she could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then threw the covers back and then froze when she saw her body; it took several seconds for her to realize what she was looking at, and then it clicked: rather than her slender and trim frame that she was expecting, she was instead looking at a somewhat pudgy body, a thin but notable layer of fat added around her. Her stomach was bigger that it likely should have been and it felt a bit firmer than she was expecting too. As the shock started to wear off, the vixen pinched herself, as if to dispel the possibility of all of this being a dream, but no such luck. Gritting her teeth, Krystal got off of the bed, thinking that she could deal with her body later, after she figured out where she was. Walking around felt different due to a slight shift in her center of gravity and the feeling of extra softness wrapped around her body. Trying the doors proved fruitless, one was completely locked, and too sturdy to try breaking down. She tried anyways, and only ended up with a sore shoulder as a reward. The other led into an opulent and well furnished bathroom, which she didn\u2019t feel like making use of, needless to say. The windows were similarly unyielding, but at least they granted her a view of a city in the distance, butting up against a lake or sea beyond, but she couldn\u2019t tell if it was the same city she had been in before. The windows also showed that she was in a building \u2013 second floor, maybe, judging from the angle \u2013 on a grassy hill, with small copses of unfamiliar trees dotted around. Reaching out with her mind didn\u2019t bring any new information either; something was obscuring or deadening her telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the door unlock, Krystal spun around, hoping to maybe get some answers and maybe a way out of here. She couldn\u2019t see much anything beyond the door, but she could somewhat make out a person standing there, looking at her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good, you are awake,\u201d said whoever was standing there, before stepping into the room, letting Krystal see who it was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She swept into the room like she owned it, and as Krystal thought about it, that could very well be true. Tall and leggy, she also possessed a voluptuous figure that stirred a little envy in the vixen. She shook her head to try and clear it; now wasn\u2019t the time for her to be distracted, but she couldn\u2019t help herself staring though. Luminous white fur splotched with black wrapped around the cow\u2019s body, a body that was a much exaggerated hourglass shape: huge round breasts that defied gravity, wide shapely hips, and a little plush belly that added to her sexual stance rather than detracting. A pair of horns and somewhat long ears peeked out of the thick black waves of hair that cascaded down to her well-rounded rump, along with a white forelock that strayed in front of those limpid deep ocean blue eyes. A midnight blue dress fell from her shoulders across her body, the deep cut front exposing much of her meaty orbs, while a slit up the side let one of her shapely legs peek through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, nice to know that I can still inspire speechlessness,\u201d the woman said in a sultry purr of a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal again shook her head, doing her best to clear away the cobwebs within. She also remembered \u2013 much to her embarrassment \u2013 that she was still completely naked. She did her best to cover up with her arms and hands, and this actually seemed to amuse the bovine before the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh darling, there\u2019s no point in you being so modest, I\u2019ve already seen you naked before, and there will be plenty of that later as well,\u201d the other woman said with mirth in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what did you mean by that? And how did I get here? What am I doing here?\u201d Krystal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ask too many questions, but I suppose I can answer them. First, I had you brought here, you had to be knocked out first though, you looked like you might have been able to handle yourself then,\u201d a smile crossed the woman\u2019s face, a smile that sent a chill down Krystal\u2019s spine. \u201cAs for your other two questions, that should be obvious, you are mine now to do as I wish. How do you not know about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026not from this system, know about what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that should have been obvious, your style of dress, your mannerisms. Ah well, on our worlds, the upper class can take anyone they want from the lower classes and do whatever they want, as I have done to you; since you aren\u2019t part of the nobility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean slavery?\u201d Krystal growled, venom seeping into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to send you to toil in the fields, if that\u2019s what you mean. I just wanted a pretty little thing about the house; maybe have some fun with you. I had to make some changes to you first though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanges?\u201d Krystal echoed, before realizing, \u201cYou mean my weight, what have you done to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave you a special little cocktail, enhancing your weight, yes, but the pregnancy as well,\u201d the bovine said as she sashayed up to Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPregnancy!? I\u2019m pregnant!?\u201d she said, her hands flying to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dawning dread, she realized that explained why her belly felt a bit odd for just being a bit fatter: it wasn\u2019t just fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, darling, I just adore the sight of a woman ripe with unborn life,\u201d the other woman said as she circled around the vixen, \u201cand with ample padding as well,\u201d she added quietly as she suddenly grabbed Krystal\u2019s rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal jumped away, baring her teeth, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, and let me go,\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the other woman flashed that chilling smile again, \u201cOoh, spirited, aren\u2019t you? That will pass in time, but it will be fun for now. As for your requests, I apologize, but I won\u2019t be able to agree with either one. As I have said before, you are mine, that collar around your lovely neck is certain proof of that,\u201d pointing one of her slender fingers straight at Krystal, the well manicured nail glistened with blood red polish, the same red as the lipstick on those sensuous lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal\u2019s hands flew to her neck, her fingers clasping around unyielding metal; she hadn\u2019t even felt it around her throat. Pulling at it provided no help, and her claws didn\u2019t have any effect either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat collar means that no one in this system will dare harm you for fear of my wrath, but it also means that you aren\u2019t escaping me,\u201d she said it so calmly, emphasizing how serious she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal\u2019s hands fell to her sides again, despair settling in her heart. Then she clenched her teeth, she wasn\u2019t going to give in that easily, no matter how she might show on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering her voice and bowing her head, acting more subservient, Krystal then asked, \u201cMay I know your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you may. My name is Lyra Silverton, but you may call me Mistress,\u201d the bovine purred out, giving a haughty grin as she did so.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOf course,\u201d Krystal said, and then forced herself to say, \u201cMistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only widened the haughty smile on Lyra\u2019s face, before she said, \u201cCome along, darling, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re getting hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal started to say no, but almost as if on cue, her stomach let out an angry rumble. This caused the vixen to instead nod her head and follow the bovine out of the room. As they walked along, Krystal tried to keep her attention on her surroundings to learn what she could and see if anything could be useful in an escape attempt, but instead her eyes kept getting drawn back to the rolling rump of Lyra in front of her. The bovine even seemed to be aware of this, judging from the sly grin she gave when looking back over her shoulder and the way that she added a little extra swagger to her walk, just to add some bounce to her butt. Eventually they came to a small but opulent dining room with the table already laden with numerous edibles, with more being delivered by service droids. Despite attempts at controlling herself, Krystal felt her mouth start to water as the smells hit her nose, followed by her stomach growing even louder and longer than before. Hearing Lyra go \u201cAh-ah-ah\u201d brought Krystal up short, and made her realize that she had been marching towards the food without any conscious thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra then walked up around the vixen, one finger tracing across the slight plush layer, while saying, \u201cPatience, my pet, you can eat your fill and then some, but only when I say so. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal found herself nodding despite her brain\u2019s objections; the hunger was getting to be too much. Grabbing her arm rather roughly, Lyra led Krystal to a pair of seats at one end of the table; taking the more throne like of the two, while pushing the vixen into the other one. Every second stretched out into an agonizing eternity for Krystal, her hunger constantly gnawing away on her insides and making it feel like she was digesting herself, and yet Lyra was still content to take it slow and easy, dishing up a plate for herself and giving occasional sly grins to \u201cher pet\u201d. Some small portion of her mind figured that chemical cocktail had to have something to do with this insane hunger, but it barely registered to the rest of Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just when the vixen was sure she was going to pass out from starvation, Lyra sat back and simply said, \u201cNow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Krystal lost all conscious control of her body, and she threw herself at the food, shoveling anything in reach into her slavering maw. She didn\u2019t care that she was already coating her fur in a layer of grease, gravy, and other bits and globs of food; the only thing that mattered was getting food into her mouth. The vixen was so lost in the food frenzy that she almost missed the fact that Lyra let loose with a peal of laughter as she watched the vixen tear into the food with such reckless abandon. Lyra was careful to keep her plate well clear of the spectacle happening atop the table though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, a portion of Krystal\u2019s mind realized just how much she was eating, but it couldn\u2019t stop what was happening. Her gut continued to swell further and further as more and more food was shoved in, far beyond anything that should have been possible. Some of the service drones moved plates and platters closer to Krystal, but more than a few went spinning away as she tore at the food before they had even placed them down, often hitting or even damaging the drones in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a thunderous belch, Krystal found herself beached in the middle of the table, chomping down on several pieces of bacon while at the same time licking the combined gobs of goo that formed on her other hand. She groaned loudly as the realization of what had just happened hit her, as well as the feelings that her overstuffed stomach was relying to her mind. The bovine gave another loud laugh and even clapped her hands several times, very much enjoying what she had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, that went better than it ever has before. It was more than a little messy, but still quite enjoyable. I can tell we are going to have much fun together, you and I,\u201d she said, standing up and poking and prodding Krystal\u2019s swollen gut, causing several more belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could just barely make out Lyra\u2019s face, and the wide grin that split it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next thing Krystal knew, she was warm and very wet. Cracking her eyes open, she was greeted by a steam filled bathroom, and found that she was half-sitting half-floating in a huge bathtub sunk into the floor. She was still dealing with her extremely bloated stomach, and her fur was still caked and stained with the remains of her gluttony, gluttony that had been somehow forced on her by that cow along with everything else done to her. The vixen\u2019s head flopped back as she ground her teeth together and screwed her eyes shut, but suddenly jumped as she felt a wet cloth rubbing across her body. Opening her eyes open again, she that it was as she expecting: Lyra was in the bath with her and was currently washing away the crusty and gooey patches across her \u201cpet\u2019s\u201d fur. Krystal tried to suppress the grimace that threatened to come over her face upon seeing that, and was more than a little shocked at how easy that proved to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to compliment you, darling, as I said before, I\u2019ve never seen it work quite as well as it did for you,\u201d the bovine said, flashing that smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tried to resist taking that as a compliment, but found herself smiling at the praise despite herself. She also found that her eyes kept dropping down to stare at the twin orbs of Lyra\u2019s breasts, bobbing around partway out of the surface of the steaming water. Lyra gave a little tinkling laugh as she saw that, all the while continuing to clean Krystal\u2019s fur. After considering that she had little choice in the matter, the vixen relaxed just a fraction and let Lyra carry on with the cleaning, as well as moving when requested so that she was soon free of the remains of the feast. After that, Krystal was only half surprised when Lyra \u201casked\u201d her to return the favor. She grudgingly complied but was again shocked as she found herself starting to enjoy running the wet and soapy cloth across Lyra\u2019s body, paying particular attention to those luscious orbs with touch in addition to her wandering eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of them cleaned up again, they remained in the bath, relaxing in the heated water. Krystal was actually starting to nod off until she jumped again as she suddenly felt Lyra tenderly rubbing the vixen\u2019s belly. Again, it wasn\u2019t something she wanted to happen, but still found that it was pleasant once she gave in a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal\u2019s ears perked up as she heard Lyra mutter, \u201cI wonder if you\u2019ll be as effective with our children as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Krystal had to ask, \u201c\u2018Our children?\u2019 What do you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly that, my darling: our children. The serum impregnated you with some of my DNA, slightly altered though, so that you are pregnant with our offspring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Lyra tenderly caressed Krystal\u2019s stomach, unaware that the vixen was experiencing quite a lump of icy dread in the pit of her stomach\u2026along with everything else packed in there. Not only was she being used as a plaything by this woman, she was actually impregnated with her children, and who knows what else was going to be happening to her. Krystal was stirred out of her despair by Lyra rising out of the water, revealing her squeaky clean and glistening body, drawing her eyes around the curves yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along, dear, we\u2019ve spent enough time here so far, and it\u2019s getting about time for lunch after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gulped loudly, even after that breakfast; she was going to have to eat lunch too!? However, despite what her mind was saying, her body felt differently, her stomach rumbling slightly in hunger around the mass of partially digested food already packed within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and do try to be a bit neater this time, or we\u2019ll have to get you cleaned up all over again,\u201d flashing that chilling smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal followed along as quickly as she could, most because of not wishing to provoke Lyra, but a small portion was eager to eat again as well. Soon enough the two of them were dried off, and Lyra slipped into a different dress before she lead her \u201cpet\u201d vixen back to the dining room and another huge meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Days passed and though Krystal attempted to look for some means of escape, something always seemed to come up. Something like how Lyra kept Krystal as stuffed \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than that first meal. Something else was how the vixen awoke the second day with her stomach swollen even larger than even multiple fetuses could reasonably be the cause of. Krystal had some idea what it was, and Lyra confirmed it: the pregnancy had advanced quite a bit. She also deigned to reveal that was part of how it worked; the pregnancy would progress rapidly, usually taking only around a week to end up with the equivalent of a full term pregnancy. When Krystal then asked if Lyra would impregnate her again after the birth, Lyra laughed again before saying that the pregnancy was permanent, Krystal would never give birth. Krystal thought she should have been shocked to learn of that, but it just became one more thing her \u201cmistress\u201d had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the knowledge of that little revelation still kicking around in her mind, Krystal turned most of her attention to the more pressing concern of her ever present hunger and the weight that came from dealing with that hunger. Fat continued to pack on her body, burying her former slender body under layers of blubber. That night Lyra decided to give a further \u201creward\u201d to her vixen, so while Krystal lay there, barely able to breathe due to that day\u2019s meals, the bovine put her tongue to work under the curve of Krystal\u2019s belly. She tried to resist, but soon she was gasping and moaning as she was brought to new heights of pleasure. Climax followed climax till Krystal was numb from head to toe, and Lyra slithered up looking pleased with herself and still licking her mouth clean of the glistening mess she had made. The vixen thought for sure that she would have to do something in return, but the bovine laid that concern to rest saying that Krystal was already providing recompense. Krystal drifted off to sleep still thinking that Lyra might \u201cask\u201d her to do something in return though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third morning, Krystal awoke to her womb swollen even larger, as well as the addition of her breasts swelling beyond what her increasing weight would be responsible. Some exploration of the sensitive orbs revealed that she was now lactating, most of it storing up to add a fluid bulk to her breasts, so much so that any movement caused them to almost audibly slosh around. Lyra seemed especially pleased with that development, often adding roughly squeezing Krystal\u2019s breasts whenever she could. The bovine even occasionally licked and nibbled on the turgid teats now possessed by Krystal, and always with that coy smile on her face. Lyra also fed the vixen even more, so much that come the night Krystal swore she could hear her skin creaking and groaning because of the strain of containing everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, on the fourth day since she was taken, Krystal awoke to her body even more swollen with fat and life. She was somewhat shocked at how big she was getting and how fast it was happening. Each time she woke up, for a few moments everything felt like it was a bad dream or even a nightmare, she would be back on the Great Fox with Fox. Then she would look down and see the changes that had been wrought on her body, and she would realize that everything really had happened. Today she awoke to find out that she had nearly doubled her weight within the past three days, and she now seemed to be well along with twins, though some part of her mind tapped her on the mental shoulder and reminded her that she was likely far from done. She moaned a bit \u2013 mostly from annoyance and anger, but surprising herself with some arousal \u2013 as she heaved her bulk up and out of bed, something that had gotten a lot more challenging over the past few days. She made a quick stop in the bathroom, making sure to avoid even glancing at the mirror or scale, before heading out to make another attempt at exploring the mansion, somewhat grateful that she wasn\u2019t locked in a single room or anything. Before she had gotten too far though, she heard a gentle swishing sound just before an increasingly familiar pair of hands sneaked around clasping her belly and bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth and stifling a hiss, Krystal felt the little tickle on the back of her neck as Lyra whispered, \u201cMy, my, you are coming along very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face her, Krystal found Lyra dressed up even more than usual in a shimmering top and matching flowing skirt, as well as rings on several fingers and a number of necklaces sparkling teasingly in the canyon of her cleavage. Krystal briefly wondered what the occasion was, before remembering something that Lyra had mentioned the night before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Someone was arriving at the mansion, someone rather important, but more than that, Lyra was being deviously quiet. Without another word, Lyra took a hold of Krystal\u2019s hand and led the vixen through the halls. It didn\u2019t take long for Krystal to figure out that she was being taken back to the dining room, undoubtedly for another self-inflicted stuffing session. Entering the room, she found the table loaded down with even more food than usual. Yet again, despite a portion of her brain screaming at her to get out of there, Krystal found herself licking her lips in anticipation while her stomach roared with hunger. Without being told though, the vixen held back, following Lyra dutifully to the seats at the head of the table. Soon enough, the bovine had her plate ready and nodded for Krystal to begin, and so she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she still stuffed herself with gluttonous abandon, Krystal had gained a tiny portion of control that she hadn\u2019t had on that first night. She remained in her seat now, while still shoveling food into her mouth as fast as she could. More food was moved closer as she continued, allowing a never ending procession of food piling down her throat and into her well stretched stomach. As quickly as she had begun, she found herself licking the last gobs of thick gravy from the platter in her hands. Leaning back heavily, she chewed on a thick rasher of bacon, drumming fingers on her taut yet plush belly. She half expected it, but still jumped \u2013 causing the chair to creak from the impact \u2013 when Lyra snuggled up against her, running one hand across Krystal\u2019s stomach, while the other reached up to squeeze one of the heavy breasts, causing a little milk to leak out, cooing lovingly the whole time. With a regretful look on her face, Lyra pulled away before grabbing several napkins and tenderly cleaning Krystal up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that finished, Lyra then said, \u201cMuch cleaner this time, but that\u2019s enough of that for now, my pet. Come along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Krystal felt more like she needed to go to sleep now, she instead followed Lyra back to the vixen\u2019s room. The bovine quickly made her way to a closet that she hadn\u2019t paid much attention to. \u201cMistress\u201d stood there, shuffling through racks of clothing, muttering to herself for a bit. For what Krystal could see, much of the clothing in there was lacy, semi-transparent if not completely sheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, this would be perfect,\u201d Lyra said, pulling out a hanger with a rather small amount of material hanging from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lyra held it up in front of Krystal, the vixen realized that there was even less material than she thought, and what little there was wouldn\u2019t hide anything of her swollen body. Lyra seemed rather pleased with this as she removed the skimpy outfit from the hanger and proceeded to slowly slip around behind Krystal. After being told to hold her arms up, Lyra slipped the top down over her head, the silky material barely cupping her weighty breasts while the loose sleeves flowed down her chunky arms. Next came the bottom and that proved quite a challenge, as Krystal tried to balance her weight on one foot even though she wasn\u2019t even really used to her weight on both feet yet. After a number of tries, Lyra managed to get the little silky thong on Krystal\u2019s legs, but took some time to tug the tight fitting material up over her wobbly hips and thighs. With that finished, Lyra lingered on Krystal\u2019s rump for a bit longer, kneading and squeezing the fatty flesh for a few moments before slowly and teasingly working up along Krystal\u2019s frame. Looping her arms around Krystal, Lyra then directed their gaze to a full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tried to turn away, but found that Lyra was quite a bit stronger than she had expected, actually holding her in place and making her look at the reflection, making sure that she saw exactly what was happening to her. So held, Krystal was forced to look at how her body had changed in such a short time, her slender and athletic body now hidden beneath a thick layer of fat and a bundle of unborn children. As she thought, the top did nothing to hide her breasts with the transparent material, and didn\u2019t cover her belly at all, leaving the furred expanse completely exposed. The bottom on the other hand was completely hidden below her stomach in the front, and \u2013 though she couldn\u2019t see it \u2013 it felt like it was well and truly hidden in the deep crevice of her butt. She also realized how quickly she had gotten used to being naked in front of Lyra, as well as how pleasant it felt to have those big cow breasts squishing into her back. Pulling away, Lyra told Krystal to follow, and so she did, following that relatively small rump to the entry hall where she received a bit of a surprise: several other women standing in a line, facing the door. All of them were in various stages of what Krystal would have once considered fat, but none were near her current size, and they were all obviously pregnant too, as well as wearing similarly revealing outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lyra walked past them, as one they said, \u201cGood morning, mistress,\u201d while bowing as much as they could at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra swept past them, only barely acknowledging them, and led Krystal to the front of the group. As she looked, the vixen noted that all of the other women looked at her with expressions of obvious envy, something that she shouldn\u2019t have enjoyed, but found that she did. Lyra placed Krystal right in the middle of the room, and tutted slightly before fluffing Krystal\u2019s hair around her face and smoothing the tiny bits of clothing around her body, making Krystal feel a bit like a trophy being displayed and triggering jealous whispers from the others. Before Krystal could ask what was happening and who these other women were, Lyra shushed her with a pair of fingers pressed to her lips and took position just in front of Krystal. Almost as if on cue, a knock rang out from the door, loud and clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra spoke just as loudly and clearly, \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin doors swung open, admitting the person that Lyra had been expecting, along with enough light that the person was momentarily silhouetted in the doorway.</span></div></div>",

Clothed in her typical tight spacesuit, cleavage showing, her blue eyes surveyed the land around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal the fox had left her faithful team star fox a few days back to answer a matter of great importance. When asked to elucidate by her comrades, she had steadfastly refused answering their questions for the core matter that she had no clue as to what was of such great importance. All Krystal knew was that she had a sudden impulse to proceed to a designated coordinate on her home planet. Being a pyschic, she was no stranger to the concept of telepathy, so she assumed that the incorporeal energy of her home needed for her to accomplish something. This assumption was given further credit in her mind by the fact that this impulse not only contained numeric data (the latitude and longitude) but also made her strangely resilient to the idea of any of her teammate's following and made her temporarily stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet looking around at the island whose only remarkable feature was that of the many trees bearing a strange fruit she had never seen before, Krystal felt a little frustrated. And returning her gaze to her broken Arwing, she felt the frustration double. Just as she was landing, the computers in the craft had cut out, and she had to make a crash landing on the beach. Luckily, Krystal was only fifty meters above ground when it shutdowned, so the damage to the external frame was negligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no generator for an EMP field\" she thought. \"But the Arwing won't startup, and my communicator won't work- what else could it be?.

Whether it be games, vehicles, locations, or characters, I knew I had to learn a few things before I do this rewrite, since my idea is very complex. I mainly read most of what I now know from the Star Fox wiki,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://starfox.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">http://starfox.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a><br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat said, I want to make sure you know where my story takes place in the grand scheme of things, as this affects the story. From what I read about Krystal, Fox, and the other members of the Star Fox cast, there are a lot of different incidents and things that tie into Krystal and Fox's relationship. However, for me, it all boils down to a game called Star Fox Command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this game, depending on which path you take in-game, when you beat the game, there will be a different ending. These endings are very diverse. In one instance, Fox leaves the Star Fox team to be with Krystal and live the quiet life, at which point he has a son named Marcus. In another, Krystal leaves the team and joins Star Wolf, Star Fox's rival. There's even an ending where Krystal becomes a bounty hunter named Kursed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong these endings, I found one I would like to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this ending, Fox convinces Krystal to stay with the Star Fox team with some help from Slippy and Falco. I thought this would be a good place to start, so I decided to use this ending. Of course, this story takes place after said ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some things to remember about this game and its endings. In Star Fox Command, Peppy Hare actually takes General Pepper's place as General of the Cornerian Army. Obviously, this means he is no longer a part of the Star Fox Team. Therefore, he doesn't play as big of a part in my story as he did in Star Fox Command. He'll probably appear only once or twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother important thing to remember is that, in this ending, the Star Fox team gets a new member! Aside from Fox promising Krystal that they'll be together forever, Slippy Toad gets married to Amanda, a pink frog who joins the Star Fox team to be closer to Slippy. For full details, please read the wiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, do you want to start this story from my chosen ending, or start it from a different point in the Star Fox timeline?</span></div></div>",

What had been a respectable, albeit a bit large, D cup, was now a voluminous GG cup bordered on a H that threatened the material that was struggling to contain those masssive spheres.

Glancing for a split second at her magnificent cleavage and the blue mounds that obscured her view of her feet, Krystal could not help but wonder how long her suit would hold- and why she felt a little proud of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- I have to get back on task!\" Krystal snapped out of her fantasy, \"Its the heat is all- I'm just a little distracted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a laborious sigh at her predicament, though not stopping her exploration of the island for even a split second. Even if it was a bother, Krystal needed to determine the exact reason she was on this island, why her breasts grew so suddenly, and the nature of the odd, if not very pleasant , nature of the dream she had. The specifics had been lost upon her resurfacing into her conscious state of mind, but she knew, if she could admit to herself, that it had to do something with breast growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. She had reached the other end of the island after only 10 brief minutes of walking, and she encountered no dense foliage. Her tail drooped as she rubbed her right blue ear in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the same blasted trees\" She quipped to herself. \"With the same delicious fruit\" a small voice in her piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She had no energy to swat away such a rogue thought. She leaned against one of the trees next to the beaches of the other side.The pressure was beginning to take its toll on her lungs, and she knew she was going to collapse if it kept up. Panting, she looked up and saw the blueish pink fruit above the tree she was using for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could these fruit really have caused....my....breasts.....t...o...\" she sputtered, her eyes glazing over as her hand extended to the hanging fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Groggily, she lifted her snout from what appeared to be a very comfortable pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratch that. Two Pillows\" she murmered to herself when she opened her eyelids by a bit. They were very peculiar in shape, both being spherical in shape and furred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're beanbag chairs\" she pondered lethargically. Then again, she didn't remember anyone on the great fox owning such impractically large round accessories- these seemed a little bit too big to be that either<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they are, they sure are warm, soft...and nice to tou...\" Krystal froze. Her eyelids popped open a  her jaw simultaneously went slack.<br>\r\nGazing downward, she soon discovered what exactly those pillows were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts. \"My breasts\" she murmered to herself not quite believing what she seeing. After moments of a stunned silence, Krystal decided to see if she this was all a warped dream and if she was still in her quarters on the great fox. And there was only one way to see if her tits were real, or her tits were fake. Following through, her elongated paws spasmed slightly in hesitation before diving in to the inviting flesh. Her response was immediate, Krystal cocked her head back, and let out a pleasured moan releasing her firm grip on her left boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definetly real\" she stated after she managed to control herself. But how could they be? she found herself asking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one of my boobs must weigh at least 80 pounds!\" It was ridiculous the situation she found herself in, it was even more ridiculous that it was through her ,by the eating of the strange fruit, that this situation even existed.

No walls were present, and the floor was nothing but a bland greyness that didn't extend very far.

It was a double of her, but at the same time they barely looked alike. The other Krystal was far more extravagant. Her first and easily most defining feature was a pair of breasts comparable to queen size beds; they lay atop a large table, which Krystal assumed was to help the doppelganger support those massive beasts. Moving to see from a different angle revealed a muffin top stomach that sagged a bit, leading to a luxurious-looking lap. With thighs like tree trunks and butt cheeks the size of exercise balls, the golden throne with velvety red cushions that the other Krystal was sitting on seemed a bit pointless. In fact, her entire body looked soft to the touch, with a slight amount of fat layered over everything.

It was most likely true that her urges were only going to get worse. Still, listening to this... over-sized caricature of her and giving in to them wasn't a particularly good idea either. There were still plenty of questions that she wasn't answering, too. She did say they would discuss that later, though, so maybe...</span></div></div>",

When it became obvious that no progress was going to be made, the regular Krystal let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you're not going to explain any of this to me,\" she started, \"can you at least tell me why you won't answer any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The far heftier one of the two scratched her right cheek. \"Honestly? I just don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Regular Krystal slightly turned her head to the side and raised an eyebrow. \"You mean you don't know why you can't explain, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I mean I don't know what the meaning behind all this is. I'm almost as much in the dark as you are. You see, I began developing at the same time you--well, <i>we</i>, really--first got the psychic impulse that brought you here. The only reason I even appear like this is because of those fruits you ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hold on.\" Regular Krystal held up a hand. \"Those fruits not only make my breasts grow, but you as well? Or rather, what you represent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Obviously,\" her double replied. \"And before you ask, yes, eating more of them will help me--er, <i>us</i>--understand what's going on here. That's what I think should happen, at any rate. I wish I could explain more, but I'm too underdeveloped as I am now.\" She gazed down at her body. \"Figuratively speaking, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was no point in trying to force out any more information, Krystal realized. She obviously wasn't lying to herself, or else she would have picked up on it right away. Resisting this new part of herself wasn't going to do her any good either. Even if she could stave it off long enough for her to find a way off the island, the urges would most likely stay with her and grow stronger, eventually compelling her to return to the island and pick it clean of its fruit. And why bother trying to work against them when she could work with them? It would make focusing much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nodding to herself, Krystal gazed into her double's turquoise blue eyes-- into her own eyes. \"Alright,\" she said, \"I'll give you some active control, but just enough to keep this 'new self' of mine from running me ragged. I certainly wouldn't want to pick the island clean and turn myself into a pair of monster breasts with a woman attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her double-- her other self smiled. \"Of course.\" Her smile shifted into a smirk. \"Just don't be afraid to eat another fruit or two. Our bosom could be so much more lovely than it is already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll consider it,\" she answered hurriedly. \"Now how does this work? Do we touch foreheads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bigger Krystal chuckled. \"No, consent was all I needed. Now we just need to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smaller Krystal was about to voice her confusion, but no sooner had her other self spoken those words when her vision suddenly went completely black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a groan, Krystal forced her eyes open. She used her hand to prop herself up, and immediately felt the weight of her breasts. The vixen eased her way into a proper standing position and stared down at her cleavage. A smile crossed her face as she took in the sensation of feeling completely refreshed. Even with the added weight of her enlarged boobs, she felt as though she could run a lap or two around the island. Then again, her suit was still tightly constraining her figure. She fiddled with the zipper, but it still refused to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could make them grow bigger,\" Krystal mused. \"It just might force the zipper to move.\" It was an interesting idea, one the blue vixen found tickling her fancy. She'd have to be careful not to eat too many fruits of course, but then again she was feeling rather hungry at the moment and the fruits were the only food around. She hummed in thought. \"How carefully do I want to approach this?\"</span></div></div>",

Krystal figured that she was frustrated that her ship had run out of fuel. Krystal politely said hello to Samus who had quickly turned around, Paralyzer drawn and pointed in her direction.

To examine them, test their properties and bring samples back to Corneria. At first this was but another odd-job Fox took up, but perhaps there could be more to this trip after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moon had a warm climate, and feaured nothing but jungles, beaches, and it's own ocean water. Krystal and fox had both dressed accordingly to accomodate the their hot day there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had some sturdy boots, green shorts, a thin white shirt with a vest ontop, filled with lots of pockets and a red scarf around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal also wore some boots, then some roomy grey shorts, and a basic yellow bra.

He then looked more closely at the flora and fauna surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a number of colorful fruit from where he stood;<br>\r\n On one tree he saw what looked like clusters of bananas, but in a bright red color.<br>\r\n And then on a tall and bushy blue-ish bush, hanged small groups of green berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked over to Krystal; \"So, the deal is that you'll eat these for me.\" He reinformed her; \"Okay?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two choices were both alluring, as their colors and shapes were vibrant and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The choice was up to Fox, and he ultimately decided on examining...?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvestigate the red fruits (butt expansion)<br>\r\nInvestigate the green berries (they both get horny)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first the fruit tasted like any normal fruit back in Corneria, but it had a sort of sweet aftertaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmh~ This is really good, Fox!\" Krystal told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they pick a pair each and eat them. Fox shares Krystal's sentiment, though he admits he doesn't like fruit that's too sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as the pair sat there feasting on the fruit, Krystal suddenly felt a bit strange in her stomach, followed by an audible rumble from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did you hear something just now?\" Fox asked the blue fox sitting next to him.<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" Krystal murmored; \"I don't know what is in these wierd bananas, Fox. But now my tummy feels all wierd.\"<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't feel anything though.\" Fox responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Krystal started moaning quietly under her breath, trying not to make Fox hear it, as she felt the fruits properties take effect on her.<br>\r\nThe shorts she was wearing were tightening around her ass! She couldn't mistake the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh err Fox... I never did ask you, but do these shorts make my butt look big to you?\" Krystal asked with a hint of confusion in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was now promted to lean in to look at her butt, but was then unable to form an answer. What he saw made his jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Krystals butt was actually growing in size.<br>\r\nFox stared in shock, and Krystal now felt her shorts straining on her beyond a shadow of a doubt. Both her ass cheeks were swelling because of the fruit, and her hips widened.<br>\r\nTo Krystal, having her ass inflate felt unlike anything she had ever felt before. The place that was now growing felt warm, and the growth came in subtle spurts, rippling from her within her body as it swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystals moaning got louder now, as she felt the shorts' strain against her ass coming to a climax, unable to contain her for any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sat there with his mouth open, not knowing what to say, hypnotized by the \"swell\" display from Krystals booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystals ass had now more doubled in size outward, and her humble shorts could not bend to accomodate any longer, as the fabric audibly creaked from the tearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*RIIIIIIIP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large opening appeared on the pants' back-side, Krystal's ass skin now revealed to the world, as well as her pink panties buried somewhere deep in those blue chasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmidetly, Krystal felt her ass cheeks both jiggle around individually from their ordeal. This only furthering her pleasure and resulting in more intense moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww~ That felt amaaazing~! She explaimed bewteen her heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if on command from her shorts being ripped, her ass growth now slowed and stopped completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox wiped his drooling mouth without breaking eye-contact on Krystal's newly improved assets. <br>\r\nHe then trusted his insticts and commented; \"Krystal! How did you do that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was now calming down, and tried to let what just happened sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know fox... I think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut herself off, as she telepathically read fox's thouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, Fox...

She enjoyed her boosted confidence, feeling increasingly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gave herself a self-congratulatory slap, and felt her ass freely wobble in the air, truly unrestricted without stopping for the first time, as the jiggling seemed to last seconds longer than it ever had before whe was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal both marveled a bit over each others naked bodies. Krystals very big butt really made a difference now that it was properly visible. Her hips had grown wider, and her thighs also looked a bit meatier too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both smilied and nodded at eachother, then slowly dipping their feet in the pond.<br>\r\nIt's wasn't too cold, while still being a refreshing change of pace from the hot temperate enviroment they were traversing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked into the translucent water, slowly lowering themselves into it, finding that they reached its stony cliff-like bottom with just their legs, meaning its the right size to comfortably sit down on this shallow part while that their heads above trhe surface.<br>\r\nKrystal thought this felt suspiciously close to sitting in a jacuzzi back in Corneria, though she reasoned that ponds in those shapes probably form naturally as well by chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Krystal.\" Fox said tilting his head to look Krystal in the eyes; \"Do you think this glow from the water might be magical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had some limited experience in magic, but she couldn't rule out the possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, actually. Maybe.\" She said with a scrunched eyebrow; \"It feels a bit different than any water I'm used too.\" She paused; \"Then again, what good is magic if you cant notice a difference? If it was magic, it'd effect us in some way I'd wager.\" She reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded, satisfied with her answer. In the same motion he rested his head back against the ground behind him and closed his eyes.<br>\r\nSpeaking with his eyes closed he said; \"Well, either way... I could get used to this.\" Letting out a relaxed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal laughed; \"Ha ha, well no kidding, Fox.\" As she then also closed her eyes and relaxed in the ponds glowing waters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Hours pass ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting quietly in the water, Krystal feels her head is a bit fuzzy.

For how long did we both sit here, and also... Are my shoulders kinda warm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of her thought, she thought she definitively remembered sitting closer to the water's surface when she first sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned quitely to herself, taking care to not wake up fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then as she was about to pick herself up and get out of the waters...<br>\r\nThats when she noticed...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happend while they slept?</b></span></div></div>",

And this tingling feeling her her realixe they were even bigger than she had first imagined just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt happy, so she in for a prolonged hug with her new body pillows. They were warm, they were cozy. They were hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to mind, and Krystal had her next idea.<br>\r\nReaching her arms forward she wanted to touch her nipples again.<br>\r\nThough her breasts had now grown from her regular size to at least 4 times the size, she could reach and touch her nipples with a sense confidence in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt familiar, she had felt around her areola many times after all. But it was familiar in another way to her, almost as if she'd been used to this chest size for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was thrilled to have them. Immidietly treasuring her breasts, loving them now more than ever thanks to their size, firmness and softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal wanted to get out of the water, but she couldn't. She found that she had to reached her hands further down to push herself up, feeling easier, as if she was sitting higher up than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot air of the jungle hit her wet fur as her torso hovered above the ponds water. She stood up, looking to step out of the glowing pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she was in the middle of lifting her legs to step out, she stopped herself.<br>\r\nControlling her legs felt different. Something had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips were now wider, her ass had swelled too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was amazed. She had herself maneuver out of the water, now with considerable thighs supporting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal now stood on the ground away from the water, looking over her transformed body.<br>\r\nHer butt was again, even larger. Definitively larger.<br>\r\nHer boobs had also now grown! Though, she was still more bottomheavy overall.<br>\r\nAfterall, her butt had grown first, Krystal reasoned, so her boobs couldn't have caught up to it in size while in the water.<br>\r\nEither way, the curvy woman's very considerable breasts were not nearly as large compared to her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Krystal now had some options on what do next: What...?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After having marveled at her own nude body, Krystal looked over at how cute Fox looked, resting peacefully in the pool of water. So she decided that she could wait to show the waters surprise growth on her, after he'd woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotivated to experience more of this planets flora and fauna. (Though admiteddly, she hadn't seen many animals on this moon yet.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal walked of, keeping in mind to not wander to far away from camp, seeing as she had to get back to Fox if she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking was now very different to her, it felt improved and more pleasurable, as the feeling of her skin pressed againt itself, her ass mounds slipping side to side as her hips swayed. Krystal meanwhile feeling her unrestricted chest bounce with and endless jiggle, filling her her with a sexy confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not having walked to far, Krystal now noticed a dark blue and purple-ish color ahead of her. She walked up, then squatted down. While crouched, she raised up the branches that were in the way of whatever it is she saw down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bush with a type of berry she hadn't \"examined\" on this planet yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the bush, which had what looked like purple blueberries hanging off from it, only they were all the size of apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be safe to eat...\" Krystal reasoned; \"I'll only eat one, to start with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for one of the large purple berries, and in her hand it easily loosened from it's branches. A typical tell of a ripened berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up again, and inspected it for a second, before biting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts inside was very soft and juicy, almost fluffy. Again lifting up the berry, she now saw that the its inside was a dark purple, almost black. Yet still, this berry's flesh featured a very sweet taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there for a minute, eating the entire thing. It seemed this berry didn't have a solid core, big seeds or anything. Very snackable, Krystal thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Perhaps just, one more?\" She thought to herself, as she again squatted down and reached for another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quick to take multiple bites, as she chewed and swallowed. It really was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter now having downed two purple berries, she felt satiated, and not in the mood for any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal thought about the berries, and how they didn't seem to have affected her body atleast, as she thought that she should head back and make Fox get samples from this bush also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to where Fox was, Krystal felt a strange warmth in her throat, which then faded, only for her stomach to feel wierd, and her head to feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal grabbed at her stomach in reaction to it; \"On no, am I getting a fever or something?\" She wondered to herself worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing to worry about, as the pain in her stomach went away as quickly as it had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal let out a sigh of relief, putting her hands away from her stomach. However, she felt that her fingers were now a bit wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, whats this now?\" She asked with a puzzled look on her face.<br>\r\nCarefully having her fingers run up her body's wet trail, going away from her stomach up her breasts, sliding her fingers across her wet underboob, and then feeling it. Her situation dawning on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... Can't be, can it?\" Krystal thought; \"Are my breasts lactatating milk??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if on command there was a subtle swelling swnsation slowly emitting from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal knew this was different from how her breasts had previously inflated in size, as she felt liquid now rising up within her mammaries, already sloshing around inside, causing her tits to grow in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her new milky mammaries with her hands, holding them from underneath. The support her hands offered was nice.<br>\r\nShe also felt how every small surge of growth rippled throughout both her tits, their surface jiggling like a heartbeat with every purt. The milk inside was increasing, and the weight was adding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal lifted up one of each boob alternatively with her hands, ammassing how big they currently were.<br>\r\nAt the same time, doing this made her milk slosh around inside, as her boobs were still growing, quickly feeling very full and milky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...~\" Krystal mumbled to herself, smacking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure Krystal got from this was unreal, and any negative notion of this pleasure vanished from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after what felt like a short time span to Krystal, her breasts got one last big surge of growth outward, nearly causing Krystal to fall off balance. Before regaining her balance again, re-adjusting and letting it sink in just how heavy her own milk was inside her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal curiously, and carefully let her wet hands travel up across her breasts; around and then back down.<br>\r\nShe lifted them both up, and let them fall down, bouncing as they did. An audible sloshing sound emitting from inside them.<br>\r\nThe milk. She was absolutely full, even though some milk was already shyly dripping down her underboob, it seemingly made no difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jungle felt more quiet than usual now.<br>\r\nKrystal took a moment to appriciate the silence and her new bigger boobs.<br>\r\nShe smiled deviously, getting the idea to test herself on new potential sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits had now gotten quite massive, by Krystals own standards. Though larger breast sizes was nothing this smart, young, adaptable space canine couldn't manage, she reasoned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to test if you could make herself lactate, she reached her hand out out to her right boob, carefully <br>\r\n making her fingers ready, before pinching her nipple on it's tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breast had been urging for release, and a stream of white goodness erupted out, flying far out into the air from that one small pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaauuuuuughhh...~!\" Krystal yelled out in a surge of pleasure, quickly falling to her knees from the sensation, letting her arms fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she needed milking, but that it was impossible for her to do it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing she could do. One person here she could turn to for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>~ Back at Fox's camp ~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox awoke from his slumber in the small pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw that Krystal had apparently already woken up and went off somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox slowly picked himself out of the water, drying himself off, and then got dressed in his usual clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal didn't put her clothes back on when she left?\" He thought to simself, before realising; \"Oh yeah, I forgot she grew a little bigger earlier today. Can't be easy getting back into those clothes, if any clothes at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down, tending to his equipmemt; \"It'd probably be smart to call on Krystal to see if she's nearby. I'm starting to get worried she might've gone somewhere hazardous on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox got prepared to shout out Krystal's name, but before he could do so, he saw what looked like Krystal arriving at their small camp, only looking significantly more voluptous than when he'd last seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too distracted looking at her sway her swollen assets back and forth to say anything. Still, he saw the naked body of vixen he loved approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefire he could fully process this all through his mind, she now stood in front of him, now leaning over him.<br>\r\nHe saw that it clearly was Krystal, but with an amazingly massive hourglass figure, large hips, thighs, an asstounding ass and a massive pair of apparently milk-dripping tits to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment od d\u00e9ja v\u00f9, Fox felt like he should say something, but he couldn't find any words for it.<br>\r\nPerhaps... He had actually drowned or something, and this was what women were like in his version of heaven? He wondered, still unable to form any sort of greeting for Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was urging to speak with her soon-to be savior about her heavy tits- thinking about the pain in her nips, and how they begged for release -she conjured up a sexy, pleading voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, staring into his eyes;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MILK...

Him, like the quick fox he was, placed his lips down, enveloping on of her lactating nipples, before sucking and drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suction force Fox' mouth created gave Krystal a sensation completely new to her, as her eyes rolling back, while a steady stream of milk had opened, and was being suckled out of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal moaned, urging Fox not to stop between her heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox then held both his hands on Krystals' tit, and gently squeezed down into its firm, tear-shaped form, helping empty Krystal of her milk, feeling her liquids float around inside.<br>\r\nIt seemed that there had been more milk produced than what she held capacity for inside, causing a painful pressure on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, the milky preassure could be lowered. Krystal, currently overwhelmed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox meanwhile kept at it from where he sat. Caressing the huge, beautiful white and blue breast he was holding.<br>\r\nYet, while Krystal was meaning to ask Fox about it... He knew to switch to her other breast and drink from that one instead. His hands remaining, still squeezing Krystals previous tit in a massage motion, maintaining a milk flow out and onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulnerable Krystal again felt herself shaking, as the her other breast was now being freshly milked by her lover.<br>\r\nThis time, her pleasure seemed even greater than when he started on the other, as if her other had filled up even more than it's neighbor next door, now finally having its preassure easened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OoooOOOOOooohhh~\" She pleaded; \"Please Fox, keep going harder! I'm still... So... Full...!\" She forced out in a quieted and tender voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried her best to glance past her massive bust, and look at the face of the one helping her:<br>\r\n And she saw Fox, sucking away, eyes closed, completely set on helping this maiden in self-induced peril.<br>\r\nThis scene here eyes witnessed all looking so cute to Krystal, as she couldn't help but to smile. \"Perhaps, this is this the happiness a mother feels...?\" She imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox then thought of something to help milk Krystal.<br>\r\nThis move of his catching the pondering Krystal off-guard, as she nearly lost her balance.<br>\r\nShe clearly felt Fox putting his tongue in as he was drinking, increasing the milk flow, while still drinking all that Krystal had to give without stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox then again switched to drink from her free breast, and again milked the one now hanging free with his hands, squeezing the nipples tip, massaging her soft mounds, helping relieve Krystal's heavy burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was skillfully emptying her out, having gently sunk his teeth in, and now swirwling around his tongue, having it dig into her.<br>\r\nThe sensation of Fox slow-moving tongue doing circles deeper and deeper into her boobs now had Krystal's moaning hit the high notes. This symphonic voice encouraging Fox to go slightly more rough with her. Krystal's moans went ecstatic. Her panting and heavy breathing intensifying. She was practically drooling, as her tounge hanged out from her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox really enjoyed his part in helping his love, his mind completely focused on taking in just how sweet and creamy Krystal's nourishing milk was.<br>\r\n\"Could the taste of Krystal's milk always have ben like this, or was this something amplified by the fruits here?\" Fox thoughts flying around inside his mind.<br>\r\nHe would gladly take any chance to drink from her boobs again in the future, now that he'd tasted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other milk Fox had releived Krystal off now formed a shallow puddle underneath where his curvy woman stood. Some of it slowly running down into the magic water not far from Fox' make-shift campsite.<br>\r\nThe water was now glowing more than before, as the milk from Krystal was being mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to now be over for the both of them.<br>\r\nFox let go of her, having felt the stream of milk drying up inside her, an audible smack sounding as the vaccum his lips created lifted.<br>\r\nHe knew he did well. His beloved Krystal's boobs no longer burdened to the brim with milk.<br>\r\n <i>For now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt refreshed, her tits now emptied. The refreshing mood was mutual. Her thirsty Fox now a lot warmer and a lot happier with a belly full of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal praised Fox for valiant and exemplary effort.<br>\r\nThis act, further reminding Krystal of why she loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was now finally free to complement Krystal on her taste, in addition to her body's makeover. Also pointing out to Krystal that her boobs seemed to have slightly gone down in size from when she came to him. Krystal hadn't realized this herself, but she figured it made sense that they would be slightly bigger when she was full of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Fox... Thanks~ \u2661\" She said to him while blushing.<br>\r\nKrystal then instictively read Fox' other thoughts, then following with; \"Oh, you think so too, huh? Well... Who's to say if this won't happen again soon, my darling Fox.\" She taunted him in a sincere voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox knew she liked to tease him with her psycic abilities, yet couldn't be upset by this. He really wasn't brave enough to admit enjoying being breastfed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed it off, reminicing back on what just transpired.<br>\r\nIt was a strange situation, they reasoned. Yet concluded; it was undeniably a romantic moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they both do now...?</span></div></div>",

She worried that she'd get sweaty wearing this, but the materials ventilation proved her wrong, as it kept her cooled underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked at Krystal in the suit she had worn during those missions that long time ago.<br>\r\nKrystal felt the thought making itself heard in Fox mind, as old wounds from the Apparoid invasion opened in his memories in reaction to seeing her in that outfit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal noticed the subtle greif on his face, consoling him that it was alright.<br>\r\nShe read within him that he tried seperating the association between the events and the clothing Krystal had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal walked up to the somber-looking Fox, placing her hand across his cheek; \"Oh Fox... Let the past stay in the past. Remember that it's most important to focus on what's right in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox felt better about it now, knowing there was wisdom in Krystals words.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But speaking of what's right in front of you...\" Krystal changed gears, taking some steps back and turned around to get Fox a view of what she was packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was rasied up by the form-fitting suit, her ass cheeks forming perfect purple orbs majestically hovering outwards, with a deep valley of tight carbon wrapped around her butt cheeks making both their individual forms fully displayed, as her long light blue tail swaying above the both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slim waist curving downward to her wide hips was a sight to behold, as Fox ogled at her voluptuousness.<br>\r\nKrystal tilted her head behind her, seeing Fox enjoy her show. So she placed hand on her waist, slowly running it outward along her side, being as sexy as she could (which was easy for her), then inward again, caressing across her tight suits vast ass mass, going down into the chasm where the cheeks pressed against themselves.<br>\r\nKrystal made an exaggerated moaning sound, as she then raised both her hands above her head, Fox now seeing how her torso extened went outward in the front, carrying the two other orbs on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal turned around, staring Fox down as she turned.<br>\r\nShe now looked down at the way her suit covered her up. This was way to modest for what Krystal was going for, so she grabbed a zipped in front, and extened the v-neck view of her white cleavage mounds. This small opening motion causing them both to bob up and down, not stopping at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal knew this \"show\" of her was great, as his hard, focused stares caused Fox to have a nosebleed, which seemingly didn't bother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal hypnotized him further with her boobs, pressing them together, leaning forward to let them hang and sway.<br>\r\nShe switched poses again; placing her hands on her neck, swinging her boobs back and forth, going down on all fours, giving Fox an enchanting view of both her tits and ass.<br>\r\nShe picked herself up, grabbing the collar of her suit, pulling it up and down rapidly, as her hooters followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal paused to look at Fox again, noticing a thin stream of blood under his still nose.<br>\r\nShe shot him a wink, seeing that this was heaven for him, and she thought this was fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeexed her boobs together, then with her hands underneath them, then squeezing them with ther elbows while winking at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt a strong desire emminating from his mind.<br>\r\nShe knew just what she wanted. so she calmed her bust down with her hands, holding her boobs as she waled up to Fox; \"Just ask, Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was obvious to him; \"Can I...

Desiring to relive the pleasures that came along with ass growth. Eating another banana was now so close. Would it feel even better the next time around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal reached up, and picked one of from it's cluster of more bananas.<br>\r\nShe figured that first, she'd see where just one banana would take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeled it, bit in, and then ate the whole thing. Now she just had to wait.<br>\r\nShe lobbed the peel into the forest, waiting for the fruit to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what would happened now, and after an insufferable wait, it came back exactly like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire, massive ass felt warm from within, as it's sexy expansion ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt her backside swelling up. At this size, one banana didn't make much visible change... But Krystal could <i>feel</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swelling was slow, but steady. The difference for Krystal this time was the amazing suit she was wearing, which was sticking tightly to her the entire time, no signs of tearing or ripping, as it simple grew larger to house her slowly swelling thighs and all of her ass' flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expansion stopped. Krystal was feeling sexy. She stretched her harms back to grab it, and she massaged it as it wobbled around like her own not-so-little plaything. Krystal knew she wanted <i>more</i> to love and play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second time, she reached out and pulled down more bananas for her. It was the rest of the cluster she'd just plucked away from; six bananas remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating them was no problem for Krystal, and the moment of anticipation followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the effect of another six bananas went straight to her rear.<br>\r\nIt was warm, it was swelling, and Krystal was loving those pleasurable feelings that resulted as it all went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer size was immaculate, yet, she steadily grew bigger, bigger and bigger.<br>\r\nThere was alot to fill out in her no-limit, ever-stretching suit, since scientifically; going twice as large takes 8 times the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sudden or explosive growth, Krystal knowing her preferences well.<br>\r\nShe knew she now loved to expand herself, while appreciating every square inch if her curvyness as it happened, instead of waking up larger or something.<br>\r\nAlthough... Waking up with a very large surprise was also very nice. Gradual growth was prefered for her though, from her experiences so far at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the bananas had given her all they had to give.<br>\r\nShe squeezed her hands in to estimate their amplitude, as she had no clear view of her cheeks.<br>\r\nThough, she reasoned she could probably sit down on the ground and easily stand back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was amused by the mental image of herself carrying a portable couch wherever she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, for now she was filled up enough with red Musaceae.<br>\r\nSo, Krystal continued out to the beach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw her and fox' arwings they'd landed there earlier this day.<br>\r\nThen the thought dawned on her:<br>\r\n Her more curvy self wouldn't exactly fit in her cockpit again, if they were to leave anytime soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became a bit envious of Fox, not having any size-related difficulties to worry about.<br>\r\nWell, <i>yet</i> anyways.<br>\r\nPerhaps he'd manage to turn himself into a woman on this moon?<br>\r\nKrystal knew he'd always look after her. Maybe he'll even have a tool for this situation, configuring her arwing's cockpit to house more voluptuous women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now followed the length of the beach. Walking for a bit, her exploration led her to notice tall palm trees and large towering bushes not far from those sandy shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Krystal do now that she's here...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now two open coconut halves lay there ready to be drunk from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal picked one of the halves up and drank from it; \"Ah, thats refreshing~\" Krystal thought, it's creamy contents streaming down her throat.<br>\r\nThere wasn't alot of what Krustal could only describe as 'elixir' in that first coconut half, so Krystal went and drank what was in the coconuts other half.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's better~\" Krystal celebrated, her parched throat now refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was off.<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right here with this scene.<br>\r\nKrystal was worried, but right then and there there was a jolt of pain, and she cropped her empty coconut half from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a weird stretchy feeling in Krystal's crotch.<br>\r\nThen, she felt a metamorphosis erecting outward, and her clothing around with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt that a long shaft had erected out from her crotch.<br>\r\nHer view of down there was obviously obstructed, so she carefully placed her hands against it, noticing it was sensitive to the touch.<br>\r\nShe gently gripped this shaft of hers. Holding onto it reminded her of Fox, with its girth, and above average length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on her that she just sprouted a very penis-like appendage, though notably, she failed to feel any balls having grown out along with the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tightened her grip on it. I grew more erect, twitching and throbbing under the suit, and Krystal lost her grip.<br>\r\nThis feeling was so foreign to her; \"Is this what its like for Fox when I...\" Krystal paused her thought, then squeezed down it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~ OOHH~ Oomphh--\" Krystal bit her lip, as to not let any further moaning out.<br>\r\nShe was now first-hand finding out the many ways a dick could be handled. Valuable experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all felt kinda nice and all, very much a learning experience in a way, but Krystal wanted to get rid of it.<br>\r\nShe reasoned that in order for it to do so, she had to make it do it's \"thing,\" like on with Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... Krystal went at it, placing her right hand around it, then moving it up and down around the suit and the penis underneath.<br>\r\nWith some resilience, she increased the speed of her masturbation and neared ejaculation.<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she reached orgasm, as was familiar to her, but it was different. For sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stream of cum was flowing up through her shaft, and grey globs of goo sprayed out through the fibers of her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis orgasm was intense for Krystal, as she replayed the sensation of ejaculating for the first time in her head.<br>\r\nShe was still horny for more. And feeling that the thing between her legs was still rocking a rock hard boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i don't have testicles, so this cum wouln't be fertilized in any way.\" Krystal gave her analysis on this elixir's properties; \"I may not fully understand this, but there are many more charges left in this thing before it can retract and disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>And to make this happen, Krystal did what?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake it go away!

Yet at the same time, she didn't want to waste this moment while the possibility of an increased effect from the black coconut's elixir was so close within her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she hurried to a palm tree growing the black coconuts, knocked 4 more down, carried them back and opened them.<br>\r\nShe hastily drank all the juices from the shells, while being careful not to spill any of it.<br>\r\nBefore she could finish drinking the fourth nut, the effects were already taking hold in her downstairs regions, as the dick started to pulsate, its girth and length growing slightly in rhythm with the pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal felt an unrelenting horniness as the erection stretched it's way from an \"above average\" size to an absolute log under her stretching suit, her mind was being forced to only focus on the impossibly rigid and rock hard meat scepter towering ever upwards.<br>\r\nEntranced, she continued gulping down the juices from the coconut knowing that every dropped had an effect.<br>\r\nAnd she wanted more.<br>\r\nMore.<br>\r\nMore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh~ Continue growing bigger!\" She chanted in her mind, as she emptied the last shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to keep her eyes open, feeling light headed, but Krystal marveled at the sight before her.<br>\r\nShe had a hyper-sized cleavage in her sights at all times, but on the horizon where the end of her outfit opened up, she saw a purple suit-colored penis head pulsating upwards, erecting itself upward, lifting her chest up, wanting to go sky high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal now saw the dick she'd grown for the first time. Admittedly not in it's full glory, but what little she saw of her log of a cock caused her to feel proud and happy.<br>\r\nStaring at the pulsating cock's tip, she saw that it was already dripping with pre-cum, sizzling out through the suits fibers, the grey slime running down all sides.<br>\r\nKrystal wanted it, she could never resist cum in all its forms, and so she felt compelled to open the zipper of her suit, allowing the cock to stand straight up, and letting face reach the tip. She wanted a lick. Her instincts told her to lick up all she could reach off from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the zipper down, opening the suit, and immediately the cock flew into her cleavage, knocking pre-cum on her face as it landed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, it rested there, its shaft hiding away in between her sweaty, warm, cozy cleavage, with the tip right beneath her face. Ideal conditions for a loaded penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal did as she had wanted for a while now, and started licking the slimy pre-cum of the tip.<br>\r\nThe ever-stretching suit transferred the sensation of her tongue with no loss of feeling, as her tongue against the penis sent a jolt of pleasure throughout her entire body, almost knocking her off balance in sudden and overwhelming pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCum streamed out, in anticipation of the full orgasm, and Krystal went at it again, licking and sucking it up as it ran from the top.<br>\r\nShe pushed her tits together to further force more of the cum to flow out from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt great, then better and even better, as she kept stimulating the penis tip while rubbing the shaft with her boob flesh.<br>\r\nKrystal lifted her lips from the cock, leaning her head back as she increased the speed that she rubbed her tits together, making the jiggle and wobble against it, then pressing them together more and more, while moving them both up and down individually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong ejaculation followed, it felt greater than her first, from when she had a \"normal sized\" penis. A fountain of cum pumped up, and the entire dick throbbed as it pumped large loads of cum for seconds on end, leaving her suit, her face and the ground beneath her icky and goopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an enjoyment in a slutty kind of sense, Krystal admitted to herself, but being drenched from a cum fountain only had her ready for more. And so was her cock, still eager with lots more to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal used her tongue, swirling it around the uthera, pushing her soft flest against the slimy, sweaty shaft, now with semen lubricating her cleavage furthermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, another orgasm! Fountaining over her and all around, her cock pumped out load after load of cum.<br>\r\nKrystal tilted her head back as it happened, closing her eyes and opening her mouth, swallowing what landed in her mouth, time and time again.<br>\r\nIt turned out to be quite the meal, appetizing her for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely drenched, still her cock was fully erect, and Krystal worked her magic on it. All while making note on how the parts of the penis head reacted to stimulation, occasionally running her hands down to the base of the shaft, massaging it up and down, before using that hand for paizuri again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the cock unleashed its load, the splooge flying high in the air. Krystal closed her eyes and let the spunk land in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious.\" Krystal thought; \"Oh, if only Fox' balls had this much cum, <i>all</i> the time~\" She fantazised that all this was Fox' love juice, and the thought turned her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal went at it, and she came many times out there by the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a further 3 loads, Krystal passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before long, she came to. And she woke up her ass resting on the ground beneath, as this \"laying down\" of hers more resembled a nap on a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal placed her her still slimy hand against her forehead; \"That last one must've knocked me out...\" She said quitely; \"Ooh, my head. I feel alot of blood rushing up to my brain again and--\" She cut herself of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to check on this situation; \"I guess its\u2026 Gone\u2026?\" Still sitting down on her ass, she investigated the area below with her hands. Only finding the parts she was used to before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that's finally over with!\" Krystal said with a sigh of relief; \"Although, I must admit\u2026 I can't remember any downsides to that little adventure I just had.\" She finished off; \"I sure hope that 'futanari penis' didn't leave any lasting marks on my body though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged; \"Eh, I suppose I'll find out soon enough~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and now she could no longer ignore the face that she was covered in spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This suit of mine got a bit 'dirty'.\" Krystal thought; \"Luckily I have an ocean right in front of me. I'll have the waves wash it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps\u2026\" Krystal played devil's advocate with herself; \"I'm I really that bothered by this look? I could always try doing something else <i>first...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now had a dirty suit - wash it off in the ocean<br>\r\nTry eating someyging else first (readers choi<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes going dark, staring off into the distance in sheer terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got ahold of himself, walking out of the water to get a better look.<br>\r\nThe distressed genderbent Fox examined herself. This was very different to what she was used to.<br>\r\nOn her thin, but still quite muscular frame, the two womanly features had had considerable growth, rocking a serious hourglass body, Fox now having a massive set of boobs and an ass to match thanks to the devious waters he'd rested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was shocked, but intrigued to know more about what this situation entailed.<br>\r\nLuckily, there was another girl she knew she could ask for guidance in this troubling time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was actually a bit envious of her partner. She had been away from their camp for longer than she'd realised.<br>\r\nYet, Fox had gotten boobs that big in only an hour... <br>\r\nWhatever that water was doing, it was definitively more potent now, and she was admittedly jealous of Fox having grown faster than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she read Fox' mind, and he was very distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fox...\" Krystal consoled her new lady friend; \"I have an idea that will cheer you up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How did Krystal solve Fox' conundrum\u2026?</b></span></div></div>",

At first he was a bit afraid, but then felt proud of his tool being this large.<br>\r\nFox continued staring as he asked; \"Err, Krystal\u2026 Is this my...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal answered him; \"Yes Fox. That is indeed your juicy, meaty cock~~\" She said as she smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal grabbed the back of Fox head, crouching herself down and giving him a long passionate kiss.<br>\r\nAs they were making out, Fox felt his cock forcing out a gentle stream of pre-cum from his horniness alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox roared in delight; \"Oh Krystal, I want you so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exactly what Krystal wanted to hear; \"Oh yes, my beloved Fox!! Come up here and take me~!\" She moaned seductively, walking back and gesturing with her hand for Fox to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal made took a few steps away fromt he pool, and watched as Fox stood up and exited the pool, still fullt naked, but now with his glorious impossibly huge hyper-penis exposed for her to see in it's entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was awestruck, feeling herself getting heart eyes looking at his erection erect up against his toned torso and wide shoulders, it's top trickling with cum already.<br>\r\nShe felt herself fall to her knees, as she reached her hands up to stroke at it, liking it as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox was moaning already. This was way more intense than anything he'd experienced before, looking down at his mistress licking and stroking his dick.<br>\r\nShe looked so irresistibly cute as she did, he thought; \"Oooh, k-keep\u2026 going...\" He murmured, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had no plans on stopping. She was eager to try out her techniques.<br>\r\nShe knew how to better handle one now, she had tested her tricks on a cock first hand after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked her hands up and down, her hands now slimy with his pre-cum.<br>\r\nKrystal pressed her tongue to his shaft, and made her way up. She slowly raised her body up, in order to reach the top.<br>\r\nShe continued her tongue stroke up to the top, and pressed her tongue down in the urethral orifice atop his penis, and she pressed her bust up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all to much, and there was an audible gurgling sound emitting from Fox testicles, rumbling as his sack stretched and swelled, preparing to pump out a stream of cum from his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal wasn't phased by this happening, as she licked him, using her hands and tits to make him squeeze out as much as possible.<br>\r\nShe knew he was about to cum, and she placed as much of her mouth over Fox' penis as she could, sucking on it, while pressing both her gigantic tits up against his massive log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she heard Fox' balls rumble, and prepared to swallow up his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stream up white goo fountained from his cock, and Krystal took it all.<br>\r\nShe sucked on his cock, swallowing more and more, as he continued to spray out more and more cum seemingly without end.<br>\r\nShe couldn't keep up, and Krystal was forced back as Fox kept cumming without remorse.<br>\r\nShe flew back and landed on her ass, as she saw the fountain shooting load after load high into the sky, before landing on her face and tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cumming stopped, and Krystal surveyed the penis of her beloved.<br>\r\nIt was still rock hard, clearly able to go for many more rounds before Fox would tire out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they changed positions, as Krystal rolled over to her side, resting on her bosom with her ass raised in the air, as Fox moved in to start hot dogging between her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grabbed the cheeks together, slapping them and thrusting his still slimy, rock-hard dick back and forth on Krystals humongous ass, her tail resting to the side as Fox went on with his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then felt Fox slap her ass harder around his penis, increasing the speed of his thrust as he yelled out with pleasure.<br>\r\n\"CUMMING!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal couldn't see behind her, but she did see that in front of her, Fox was shooting his loads far into the woods in front of them, again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fox, watch out where you shoot with that blaster of yours~\" Krystal said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox let out a small chuckle, lovingly slapping Krystal's ass, seeing the ripple last for along time before stopping.<br>\r\nKrystal was happy Fox had fun with his new, 'improved' tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal.\" Fox told her; \"There's only one way I wanna finish this. Can you guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic vixen just nodded her head, knowing exactly what Fox thought of as she stood up and let Fox grab her arms.<br>\r\nHe lifted her up, and Krystal used her legs to guide his penis toward her crotch. It's top now rubbing against her.<br>\r\nIt was so hard it almost couldn't throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal, are you okay with me going <i>all the way</i>?\" Fox asked before he could penetrate her.<br>\r\n\"It's okay Fox, I can take it. I know I can take it.\" She whispered into his ear; \"Now, give me it all~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunk of a man then started as instructed, gently pushing his dick further and further up her vajay-jay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal let out a tiny yelp, but then reassured Fox that it was okay. Her insides stretching around his dick's girth in a way she'd never experienced before.<br>\r\nShe felt him deep inside, and she placed her own hands on her stomach, feeling his dick go further into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox' dick managed to go further and further in, in way that shouldn't have been possibly. But by some magic, Krystal's body managed to have it all fit.<br>\r\nHe had completely filled her, her stomach bending tightly around his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last time, Fox asked his girl again if she felt alright. \"Oh, but this is amazing, Fox!\" Krystal said on the verge of tears; \"Now fuck me! I want you to thrust into me without remorse!\" She excitedly instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox complied, as he banged the love of his life like he had done many times before, only this time, them both with mutually grown proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went faster and faster, hid dick going back and forth inside her, until Fox again started cumming, filling Krystal's inside to their limits, and his fluids sprayed, soaking the ground beneath them when no room was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting go of Krystal and pulling out, a now very exhausted Fox McCloud fell down to the ground, having had the most intense orgasm of his life. (So far.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal looked at the knocked out Fox on the ground, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw Fox drift of to sleep, and his erection subsided, shrinking to a flaccid state as the blood recirculated to other parts of his body.<br>\r\nKrystal surveyed his now massive dong, now having gone back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that Fox would have had to scan in new clothes to fit his hanging equipment, a clear shapely bulge protruding from his tight pants.<br>\r\nKrystal was amused by this visual she imagined before her, finding it incredibly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>As Fox slowly started waking up again, what did the pair of lovers then do...?</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A glass (but probably wasn't) panel was acting as the roof of the place.

Moving as quickly as her gigantic proportions would allow, she yanked cherry after cherry off the bushes and devoured them. The taste and juiciness were lost in her frenzy. A long, loud moan escaped her muzzle as the growth began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>More!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't long before the leaves' durability were put to the test. They fought valiantly against the onslaught of furry tit- and ass-flesh, but said furry flesh fought back twice as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>More!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The threading strained hard, desperately trying to hold the leaves together, which cried out with a rubbery squeak. Krystal's manic grin somehow widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>MORE!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With one final surge, both T and A alike broke through the makeshift clothes and sent the overstretched leaves scattering about. Krystal fell to her knees, shuddering at how her titanic ass engulfed the lower half of her legs. She shuddered again when her breasts made contact with the tiled floor. Resting against them, she whined in reaction to their sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was safe to say she was more tit than fox at this point. Each individual breast could serve as a beanbag. Had Krystal been standing up, they would have blocked everything below the collarbone from view, save for her feet. A grown man's fist could fit inside each nipple. Her ass was very much the same way, though it didn't as much of her body from view as her bust. It jiggled thanks to her tail, which was sandwiched between both cheeks. It flicked back and forth like mad, as though trying to fight its way out, but the struggle was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Krystal felt her breathing and heart rate settle down. Despite the sheer immensity of her hourglass figure, she managed to stand up. Rather than ponder how four giant orbs of furred flesh could be nearly weightless, she looked around the garden. The cherry bushes were now barren thanks to her, but there were plenty of other fruits for her to try out. Her gaze fell on the cylindrical ones by the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Resettae... Sounds like \"reset\". Does that mean eating one will shrink me back down to normal? I don't want that!</i> She turned her attention to the other doorway. <i>What's in there, I wonder. A mirror, perhaps? Or maybe some research notes on these fruits. Or both. I'd definitely appreciate both.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As her eyes drifted back to the various fruits, she couldn't help but lick her lips. So many more choices, and there was no doubt they'd all grow her in delightful ways.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Krystal shook her head. Bigger is always better, but bigger also makes it harder to fit through doorways. She certainly didn't mind the idea of picking the entire garden clean and becoming the most voluptuous woman in the Lylat System--and all of existence--but she still wanted to explore a bit more. Banishing all thoughts of flooding the planet with her assets, she set her sights on the doorway and headed straight for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully, it didn't have any knobs or handles, so Krystal used her rack to open the way. The contact sent a shiver up her spine. As she brushed off the pleasure, she found herself in a mostly barren room. A table with nothing but a single notebook on top stood in the center, with the hugest bed she'd ever seen off to the right wall. That was when Krystal realized just how large the room was. It was almost as big as the garden!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Maybe to accommodate women like me...? Well, that should be obvious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking left, she found the entire wall was a giant mirror. It was surprisingly clean, as though it had never been touched by a single speck of dirt. Odd. Still, it gave her a perfect view of her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't shock her. She didn't gasp. Aside from a smile, she didn't react at all. It was already obvious she was gargantuan beyond belief, so why make a scene? A hand came up to stroke her bosom. Even the lightest touch of her fingers made her tingle. She tried to lift them up from underneath, but her arms got lost beneath it all, just like most of her body. If her body stayed this way, her torso may very well be never seen again. And her ass, which dragged along the ground and came up to just below her shoulder blades, demanded just as much attention. Krystal chuckled under her breath; the rest of her otherwise normal body looked so out of place! It was like she was being squished by her four furry funbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Too bad none of those fruits can fix that,</i> she mused. <i>Oh well, I'll just have to get used to it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stifling a sudden yawn, Krystal shifted her focus over to the notebook. It was obvious her breasts would obstruct her, so she approached the table by the side. She moved like she'd always been so big. Notebook in hand, she lay down on her cushy ass and inspected the cover. It was blank, so she opened to the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not sure what to make of this place. All these depictions of unnaturally large women, and these weird fruits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I think I'll be safe here. I got water, and the garden's got food covered for me. It's odd, though. I waited all day and I'm still the only one here. Did something happen to the owner? Maybe it's abandoned.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Krystal, yawning again, skimmed through the next couple paragraphs. It was all aimless speculating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Anyway, since I won't be getting off this planet anytime soon, I don't really have anywhere else to go. Good thing I have all my provisions with me. And there's a bed here! Really big, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, here's to day 1, I guess.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next page showed another entry. From a glance, this one seemed a bit more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Day 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the best of me. I have my rations, but I couldn't keep myself from trying one of the pineapples. Next thing I know, I look like I'm 9 months pregnant! But my belly was so soft! How does that work?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Krystal yawned yet again and giggled. \"Maybe I should try one of those next. Might be fun to have a nice, big belly to go with my breasts and bum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I suppose I don't need to point out how shocked I was. I was scared to touch it, like it would pop or something. But here's where it gets really weird. It felt...nice. Really nice. Once I started touching it, I couldn't keep my hands off. I was rubbing it, squeezing it, shaking it... The darn thing was just so soft and fun to play with. I don't think I stopped until I had another 3 pineapples. Or was it 4? I don't remember. All I do remember was ending up with the hugest belly I've ever seen! Seriously, it touched the ground and everything! And it was so round! I thought I was obsessed with it before, but</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the entry quickly devolved into a scribbled mess that barely resembled actual words. Well, aside from one small sentence at the bottom of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I WANT MORE</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal, grinning, yawned once more. Why was she so tired all of a sudden? \"I guess it's nap time,\" she mumbled as she rocked herself off her ass. Then she walked over to the giant bed. She got on, breasts first, and rested against her massive bosom. It was so soft and warm that she dozed off right away.</span></div></div>",

Right.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Krystal slowly opened her eyes and yawned. Then, she took notice of a giant pair of furred orbs covering her legs. Her ass, of course. How she managed to get off the bed and on her feet, she had no idea. She was too groggy to care. After rubbing her eyes focusing her sight, she noticed she was looking at the mirror wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She blinked.

She's not even sure whether or not the choice she made was what she really wanted. There's no way she could show her face in front of fox and the others now. As she leaned back in her chair, she glanced around at the endless space to discover a blue planet. \"That place sure looks beautiful\", she whispered. Then it struck her, looking at her supply of food and water she realized that there wasn't an adequate amount even for another meal. \"Okay then! Let me scan the planet to find a suitable landing site\" she said as the computers began to compile landing zones. It came down to two places. One was near a beach while the other was surrounded by forest. \"Seems that either landing spot contain some sort of food supply.

The transition from space to the planet ran quite smoothly. The ship gently flew from the stars to the ground of a decently sized island. As the Arwing touched down upon the sand of the beach, Krystal quickly popped open the cockpit door and hopped graciously onto the sand. She started to stretch since it has been quite awhile since her departure from the last stop she made. She then began to survey the area around her. The beach was quite flat and the sand led right to the forest in a slightly sloping angle. The trees were nothing like she has seen before. They were ragged as palm leaves yet thick like a pine. The sky was a greenish color thus the ocean around the island were green as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her thirst caught her attention and then she began her mission of finding food and water. Her thirst outweighed her hunger greatly so she began to search for a river that would lead into the ocean. She walked for hours until she found a mouth of a river. Krystal ran to bank of the river and began to hastily slurp up the water. Her eyes widened in shock as she spat out the vileness that deceived her. The water still seemed to be salty and she found out the hard way due to her recklessness. The salt from the water only increased her thirst as she panted in fatigue. \"Darn it...I...-huff-...just have to...go up a little farther...to...-huff-....get some fresh water...\" she said as she breathed heavily. And so she kept walking while stopping every five yards to test the water, this time only taking sips. However, the water began to actually taste a bit sweeter every stop she made. She gulped down a handful of water and smiled. \"I should've brought my canteen in order to fill it with this stuff\" Krystal smirked as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked up, she saw something that caught her eye...</span></div></div>",

The stone blocks it was made of, presumably once intended to shine with a golden brilliance, were showing many years' worth of decay. Any luster they might have once had faded away to a muddy yellow with plenty of missing bits and pieces. Moss and vines had grown all over, and most of the structure itself was slightly obscured by a small group of trees. A rather typical-looking temple structure, save for the river Krystal was following. Between two of the trees and off to the side of the main entrance, an opening was letting the water flow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blue vixen scratched her chin. \"So I'm on a planet I know nothing about, drinking from a river that goes from salty to sweet as I go further up, and it seems to come from this deserted temple.\" She put her hands on her hips. \"Must be one of <i>those</i> places, then. Still, I'd have to be the most unadventurous lady in the galaxy to not look inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nodding to herself, Krystal began to walk over to the temple. She only hoped that whatever crazy thing was probably going to happen to her wouldn't be too terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Again, the blue vixen could help but say, \"Huh.\" It turned out there wasn't all that much to see in terms of architecture. The main entrance only led to a circular platform with nothing more than a podium of sorts. What really stuck out was the water surrounding the platform. More specifically, the fact that the water really did seem to come from the temple itself. Fountains perched on the walls poured steady streams down to the ground below, which then flowed out the side opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It actually does come from here? How strange.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thirst was no longer an issue for Krystal at that point, so she made her way over to the podium. Engraved on its surface was a paragraph in a language she had never seen before. Strangely enough, she felt a strange sense of familiarity with the writing, as though she did actually know the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How in blazes can I recognize this when I've never even seen this language before in my life? My home planet never had any scripts like this. It's far too curvy for that to be the case!\" Krystal rubbed her temples. When staring at the writing for an extended period resulted in nothing, she let her eyes wander to the wall fountains. \"If that water gets sweeter when it's closer to the source...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She crouched down at the edge of the platform and, taking a quick breath to steel herself for whatever weirdness would inevitably ensue, brought her open mouth down to the water. Her taste buds were immediately assaulted by a sweetness like no other. It was like honey, only twice as strong and twice as addicting. The vixen drank away as though she hadn't had a drop in days. Only the need for air could stop her binge, and even then only a few seconds at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After coming up to breathe the fourth time, Krystal finally herself away. She wiped the liquid dripping from her muzzle and adjusted herself to sit down on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that was certainly something. I never knew water could be so addictive.\" The vixen patted her belly. It had become just the tiniest bit distended, and the contents sloshed around noisily. \"There's definitely something special about it. The taste? Or maybe that's just a part of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Krystal started rubbing her stomach, a calm fog fell over her mind. She sighed. Nothing sounded better than just sitting there all day and... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>And what?</i> Krystal frowned. <i>Do nothing? Why would I want to just sit here and do nothing? I've got liquids covered, certainly, but there's still the matter of food! And what of the purpose of this temple? Just who or what is it built for?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She got to her feet and was caught off-guard by a weight she did not remember having. A few seconds of stumbling back and forth passed before Krystal was able to get any solid footing. That was when she realized just where the alien weight came from. She looked down and was greeted by a pair of breasts a touch bigger than she imagined. The change was barely noticeable from a cursory glance, but closer inspection revealed furred tit flesh that was straining against her suit a little more than usual. She could still see her feet, at least, as well as the modest bump that her stomach had become. Bringing her hands to her rear revealed that it too had gone up in size. The change there was more readily apparent, as it was softer to the touch than she remembered and had more to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A heavy sigh left the vixen's lips. \"At least now I know what makes this temple so special.\" Another sigh, and Krystal moved toward the podium, surprisingly having little difficulty adjusting to her new proportions.</span></div></div>",

And we even have similar names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a minute, Krystal was silent once more. Then, she began to giggle. The giggles soon became snickers, the snickers gave way to chuckles not long after that, and it just kept escalating until she was outright cackling like a maniac. Only the need to stop and breathe was enough to get the vixen to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Krystal wiped the tears from her eyes. \"Oh, I did not expect this, not at all! What do I even consider this? A cosmic contrivance?\" She shook her head. \"Well, no matter. This is the reality, absurd as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Placing her hands on her hips, Krystal turned back to the water. It was obvious that she couldn't just ignore the pleas of this dead race, whoever they were. Then again, the message they left behind was annoyingly vague, as dying requests often were. It asked her to save them without explaining <i>how</i> she could save them. What powers would she have as this life-giving goddess? How would they work? And most importantly, just how extreme would her changes be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I'd obviously round out more,</i> she mused, <i>but what else would happen? Would my personality change as well? That could be the case, if those impulses from before mean anything.</i> The vixen sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do I even want to go down this path...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several minutes passed as Krystal paced around the platform, scratching her chin in thought. Finally, a decision was made.</span></div></div>",

The looked at each other, almost communicated before nodding and darting at Krystal's body. Each one took their own hole of mouth, cunt, and ass. All 3 penetrated deeply, but easily due to their slick skin. Krystal's eyes rolled far into her skull, the sudden pain, but mostly pleasure, of the tentacles ruthlessly fucking her holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one in her mouth began to release a sweet, but slightly tart, fluid into her throat. It seemed to relax her muscles similar to a drug. It poured and poured and poured until her body felt numb, making her stomach swell a bit. The anal tentacle began to do the same thing as it's oral partner, but with less fluid leaking into her. The vaginal tentacle pounded in and out of her wet cunt, ongoing for almost 30 minutes before releasing it's potent seed into her womb. Immediately Krystal came again and again as the torrent of seed seemed to go on forever. Her stomach h visibly swelled outwards, reaching farther and rounder than her previous egg-filled belly. It had easily doubled in the amount of eggs she contained in her body. The drug like liqued subbdued the pain it would have normally caused, however Krystal was now a drooling mess of herself. She simply twitched while hanging onto the blue tentacles as the pumped in and out of her mouth and ass. Each hole oozed and spilled excess fluid as her continued to come.

Who ever heard of a vulpine actually falling in love with a dragoness, let alone one huge her size? \"Fox...I-\" The blue dragon's words were quickly interrupted as her snout was quickly embraced by fox. While it must've been quite a challenge for him to accomplish, Fox tried his best to give his lover the best hug he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal...\" Fox began. \"I don't care if you're a fox or a dragon. I want to be by your side no matter what.\" he states before gazing up at her large green eyes. \"Besides, how can I just let go of someone I cherish so deeply?\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's eyes beamed up by the comment as her eyes quickly began to water. Trying to hold her composure, she takes a few blinks before mustering a warm, grateful smile to her vulpine companion. \"Thank you Fox.\" She says in a sincere yet soft tone. After a few more seconds of embracing, Fox soon takes a step back to get a better vantage point of his loves new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how is it being a dragon?\" he asks with a cocked head. \"Well...it's certainly different.\" Krystal admits wholeheartedly while glimpsing down at her scaly body. \"Instead of fur, I'm covered in scales. Plus this size is something I'll definitely have to get used to.\" she adds as her spiky tail end gently sways about behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, This certainly is a different way of seeing you.\" Fox admits before clearing his throat. \"Errrm, a good way that is.\" he throws in. Krystal simply lets out a small chortle as she raises her neck up to a more comfortable position. \"It's okay fox.\" She assures him before fully standing up to her new ginormous size. \"Well...seeing as how I'm a dragon now, how about we give my new for a test run?\" Krystal asks in an almost calm yet playful way. \"A...test run?\" Fox asks, confused by her suggestion. \"Well...what do you have in mind?\" he asks, promptly causing Krystals smile to grow in size.</span></div></div>",

The blue vixen was on her way to see Slippy at the Star Fox underground base, where the crew puts the Great Fox in for repairs or storage during inaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the day, while Krystal was doing her daily stretching and flexibility exercises, she received a call from Slippy at her home.  A 3D hologram with Slippy greeted her, the following conversation took place:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Heey Krystal!  How's it going? \"  the amphibian excitedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm doing fine, Slippy, thank you.  I see you're at HQ.  What's on your mind? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I have something important I want you to try - a new, improved bodysuit! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Improved?  How?\" the curious vixen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The new material its made out of is more resistant to firepower - about 30% better performance against weaponry of all types.  Not only that, but it should be more flexible than ever before!  I know how you don't like to wear clunky armor. Buuut there's a hitch - I can't make the suit without you.  I have a machine that will form a mold with the new substance around your body.  So ... think you can come over? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hmm, I suppose I can come over.  I'm not doing anything important.  Okay, sure!  I'll be leaving now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Cool, okay then.  Later Krystal. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had arrived at the base, took an elevator down deep into the earth, and met with Slippy.  They walked and entered the room where the machine was set up. There was a horizontal bed - it was a human sized, thick cushion made out of something reminiscent of latex.  Two long, tapering tubes were above the machine and on opposite sides, ready to apply the substance.  A floating sphere was also present, used to scan the subjects body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Umm, Krystal, I didn't want to tell you earlier, but for the suit to be skin tight, you're going to have to remove your clothes...\" Slippy said while scratching the back of his head, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What?  Well, since I came all this way, I might as well.\" Krystal responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Okay, I won't look, I promise. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Why not?  Are you saying I'm ugly? \" the sly fox sharply responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" N-no!  It's not that! I ju--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal, with a chuckle and a pat to Slippy \" It's okay Slippy!  Don't worry about it.  ... You can look if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy blue vixen casually removed her clothes and shoes.  Breathing in the cool air and feeling the cold metallic floor on her footpaws gave her a slight shiver.  With a swaying tail, she walked up to the machine and lied atop of the latex glove, in the supine position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tapping of keys and blips and bleeps, Slippy at the machine's console began the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay just stay still.  This will only take about 30 seconds.\" the toad instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide, emerald green laser scanned Krystal's entire body.  From the neck down, the table began to expand and merge around her body, encasing Krystal tightly, making the fox a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Krystal, I'm going to inject the substance now.  Be prepared - it's slimy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two metallic arms descended and poked into the sides of her haunches, thrusting the transparent blue goo into the latex prison.  The goo was lukewarm and viscous, she could feel the slime penetrating her fur, an awkward pleasurable feeling came as it went over her ass, tits and pussy.  Suddenly, a flat, piercing tone filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!  Get me outta here, Slippy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!  It won't shut off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instruments injecting the slime had malfunctioned - an electric current was now flowing through the goo.  Krystal became paralyzed, unable to speak.  She felt a pins-and-needles sensation throughout her body and felt as if the slime was going through her very being.  The instruments continued to fill the mold with more and more goop, expanding the encasement far beyond its original proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uhhhgh...\" Krystal moaned out, she couldn't sense any fur on her body now, nothing but slime.  Slippy entered all the top priority commands to shut down the machine, but all failed.  8 seconds had passed, Slippy had enough nonsense and ran out of the room to the nearby power switch to shut down the entire section where the machine was located.  When he returned, Krystal's neck and face was in the process of turning into slime.  The transformation was already nearly complete, Krystal finding the process stimulating, feeling like nothing she ever felt before.  She oozed out of the mold by simply squirming her body through the space her neck occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splatter and plop onto the floor, a new Krystal was born.  Krystal's gelatinous body glistened under the soft white light, her body was still cerulean colored like her fur, the translucent figure converting the light into blue.  All the slime given by the machine had made her grow to 8 ft.  Her body still retained her previous proportions, but she found that she could willfully expand or compress her body or body parts by a moderate amount.  \"Mmmm\" Krystal moaned as she groped and examined her body.  It seems that no matter where she touched herself, she would receive the same pleasing, erotic feeling.  Her nature was already made amorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Krystal!  What's happened to you?  Are you okay?\"  Slippy quickly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" *Exhale*  Slippy, I've never felt better.  Tell me, do you have any more of this stuff? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded by the response, Slippy answered \" No ... it's not artificial.  I found it on Sauria, in Krazoa Palace. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, the slime vixen walked out of the room - Slippy couldn't help but gawk at Krystal's jiggling ass and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to now?</span></div></div>",

It would be 3 days before she arrived at Sauria.  It was strange that she didn't feel the need to sleep (at least not yet), and it was definitely a plus not needing to go the bathroom anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt an impulse, a desire to stimulate herself, taking the 3 days to learn the intricacies of her new body.  She would play with her breasts, massaging them and intentionally make them bigger by shifting some of her mass towards the squishy balloons.  She practiced extending and transforming her hands and arms into different shapes - tentacles, bulbous shapes, and others were made.  The same that could be done to her arms she could also do to her legs.  One neat trick she did is build a large ball of slime the size of a basketball and ate it.  She found out that she could expand her mouth and throat and eat it whole, akin to a snake.  With practice, she would probably be able to use her whole body as way to envelop and absorb objects, or food, and maybe even shapeshift into different morphologies, but that would have to come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she arrived at the wild planet, landing at Cape Claw (the beach area).  Pleasant memories rushed in as she took in the wild beauty of the planet.  Two large SharpClaw noticed the vehicle land, and decided to investigate.  In whispered tones, the pair talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  Look at that female.  She's gorgeous!.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she's all gooey?  I don't know, it seems to make her more sexy to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Ohh man, it must feel great to be handled by all that slippery, slimy goo.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm getting excited, let's go greet her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two anxious dinosaurs meet with Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there lady, umm, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"The name's Krystal.  Perhaps you've heard of me?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!  General Scales said he had a run-in with you.  He also talked of your beauty ... I can see why.\"<br>\r\n\"Scales complemented me, huh?  Interesting... so what do you two boys want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 lizardmen were heavily salivating over the female; they licked their lips, their tails dreamily swishing from side to side.  With a giggle, Krystal came closer and remarked \"Heh, I think I know what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to a nearby tree and got on all fours, presenting her ass to the pair, waving her tail in a welcoming manner, the bright sun illuminating her body in an irresistible way.  Immediately, one of them skipped towards Krystal's rump, with penis fully erect.  \"You're so hot!\" he exclaims - he took a moment to grope her slick rear,  rubbing himself against her smooth texture before driving his dino cock deep into the blue fox's pussy.  The other came around to present Krystal with his dick as well.  \"Damn, you have such juicy breasts...\"  The male began to massage and rub Krystal's breasts and nipples - the jelly melons healthily bounced with a nice firmness..  He then positioned himself so that Krystal can blow him - her mouth opened, a gooey entrance welcoming the SharpClaw's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph ... mmm\". The fox reacted.  The male at the back was furiously thrusting, enjoying watching his member push through the slime vixen's translucent rear, her entire mass reverberating from the penetrations; the lewd, slapping sounds of their bodies filled the air. At the front, the other male was moaning in delight and stroking Krystal's ears as the slick feeling of her tongue and mouth was bobbing and sliding against his sensitive dino meat.  With eyes half-closed and a waving tail, Krystal was thoroughly enjoying the sex she was giving and receiving with her new body - her entire being was electrified with feelings of sexual pleasure, satisfying her cravings she had while being cooped up in the ship.  Soon, the male in the front began to pump his hips and gave Krystal a face fuck, while the one in the back hunched over Krystal's back to reach and grasp her tits as he pounded away at her juicy, slick pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 8 minutes of pounding slime, the climax was creeping up on both males, their actions becoming more brutal over time. Moans and gasps were increasingly getting louder and more frequent \"Mmm -haa!\"  With a visible shaking in the loins and thighs, the dinosaur men had reached their limit!  Both of them shot their seed into Krystal, watching in curiosity and delight as they saw the stream of white simply float inside the jellied vixen.  For Krystal, it was a strange phenomenon because she was able to feel the invading semen in her body, and even taste it!  Her body lightly jiggled in response and in just a matter of seconds, the semen dissipated into the blue goo, seemingly absorbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SharpClaw men collapsed to the sandy floor, pleased as punch from the treat they just had.  Krystal, too, was content from the sex, though she could have easily taken some more.  With a kiss on the lips and a poke of her tongue, she thanked the scaly men for the fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, boys~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

After such a long night's rest, the blue vixen was beginning to think her mind was playing tricks on her. \"What is this?\" she says in a soft voice as she finally manages to open her eyes. At first she could've sworn the area she set camp on looked different, a lot smaller to be precise. As she slowly begins to rise upwards from her lying position, an odd object from above soon impacts her head. \"Ouch.\" She groans before quickly raising her hand to caress her crown. \"what was that?\" she mutters as she opens one of her cringing eyes to gaze upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blue vixen manages to stare upwards, she finally manages to catch sight of the culprit. To her surprise though, it was the least thing she'd expect. \"W-Wha?\" she mutters as both of her orbs grew in utter confusion. Mere feet above her head was what appeared to be a long thick tree branch, though not just any. Before Krystal set up camp deep in the forests of Fortuna, she made sure to detail the main stand outs of her surroundings. That way, in the case of getting lost, she could easily track her way back towards the teams meeting area. One main thing that stood out the most was a huge, oddly shaped branch attached to one of the old trees. The only problem with this was that the branch was dozens of yards above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what on Dinosaur planet?\" Krystal stammers as she quickly backs away from the wooden protrusion. Upon scooting back, the sounds of clanks and rummaging catch her pointed ears as she stares down besides her right foot. Messily adorned on the ground were a plethora of camping items, ranging from a canteen to even a disassembled tent, the same items that Krystal brought for the trip. \"H-How?\" Krystal stammers in a shaky, confused voice as she lowers her head to stare down at her now tiny equipment. Unsure if this was still some odd dream or mind trick, she slowly lifts up her canteen, which barely manages to fit in the grip of her thumb and index finger. As the metallic feeling of the canteen meets with her finger tips, she gasps before dropping the container and backing up against a tree's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real...\" Krystal stammers as her breathing begins to speed up from shock over her current state. \"This isn't real...\" she repeats while shaking her head, trying her hardest to dissuade the reality before her. \"This is-\" A sudden gasp escapes Krystal as her tail suddenly wags against one of the tree's, causing a flurry of avian's to ascend skywards. \"This is....real...\" She mutters in a nervous and uncertain tone, seeing how her fears we're indeed real. With a small whimper, Krystal huddles her knees close to her chest, unsure just how to deal with her sudden growth. \"I need to do something.\" she mutters staring down at her camping ground with unease while slowly rocking back and forth.</span></div></div>",

A big one!\" The person walked away laughing evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Krystal remembered what happen she needs to get help and find a way to get back to normal sized.

Krystal chooses the beach because you rather not go to a city and have thousands of people freaking out. The beach usually consists of 10-20 animals the whole day so it's less likely to get you in more trouble. As Krystal walks towards the beach she begins to rethink being big isn't a bad thing. She could get used to shorter distances, having the ability to see farther, and massive strength. Right now Krystal doesn't care if she has to squash 2-3 trees with every step. After some walking, Krystal begins to run and at her size she reaches 30 mph in 5 seconds. Not wearing all those clothes makes her run faster and lighter making jumps easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far no one notices or hears the giant naked blue vixen running or jumping to the beach (Not even the armies or cities). At the beach we see an adult Red Fox behind the trees, behind the beach. He's a little shy but also embarrassed of his life. \"Trevor\" the Red Fox as spent his entire life at this beach without a family.  People make fun of the way he smells, being small, and his passions. All he wants is to have friends how can understand him and maybe even one that's really different but share similarities. That would all change when he starts to hear mini earthquakes and trees collapsing. Trevor thinks it's a problem so he yells, \"Danger! Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone else says, \"Is that Trevor? Ignore him, he's crazy.\" Everyone laughs at him and Trevor feels embarrassed again but his embarrassed face is interrupted by a giant blue foot nearly crushing him. He looks up and is disgusted, looking at Krystal's crotch. Everyone turns around and stares in awe. Now everyone has a disgusted face and quivers very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal doesn't say anything but a lifeguard yells, \"EVERYBODY RUN!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!\" Everyone screams and runs left and right often crashing into each other. Holding babies and carrying what they can hold in their arms. After 2 minutes of screaming and panicking the beach was quite and deserted. Krystal watched it all and didn't say a word or move her body. She was about ready to cry and feel miserable when</span></div></div>",

Trevor actually spends most of his life naked because in his teens his last pair of clothes ripped off after not fitting him anymore. He often gets new clothes by people leaving the beach, forgetting their clothes. Sometimes the beach is a nude beach but not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laughing so hard and loudly Krystal wipes the tears and looks down.at her leg. \"Is there an ant on my leg?\" Krystal asks and looks down burying her face into her thick fur.

You faint instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 minutes later after Krystal poking and shaking Trevor he wakes up looking directly at Krystal.

All that Trevor sees is Krystal's pussy and anus and stares at Krystal thinking she's sexy and irresistible naked. Once Krystal gets settle she's on her belly with her elbows on the hot, tan sand and her hands on her chin. Her legs are bent and her feet are on her butt and her tail is pointing straight up.

After accidentally scaring all those animals and started to cry I worried you needed to have some company so I got naked just for you. Do you like it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi Trevor, I'm Krystal from the Lylat System. I was on vacation when last night someone zapped me with a ray and made me grow the next morning. This morning I ended up naked and after a while I was enjoying it. You can't be naked in the Lylat System, even in the showers and I have to say, not only do I like dicks, butts, anuses, and other private parts. I like people who get out of their zones and done special things for me. Anyway I realized I could use some help or spend my vacation using my gigantic body so I ran towards the beach and that's why we are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a story. I spend most of my life naked and I don't have a family. No one has told me, maybe it was an accident or something else. I grew out of my clothes in my teens and today before you came I was wearing adult pants that were left behind and that was it. People make fun of me and I don't why. Give me a break, I'd started out rough and it's been like this my whole life. Can you understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do understand and they are bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for making my day great, By the way can you show me the path you took to get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure.<br>\r\n(Back regular writing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal stood up and picked Trevor up with her hand. \"Your hand is so big you could carry a house easily.\" Trevor said amazingly as he kept on going higher and higher. Trevor wanted to be on Krystal's head to see the view and this time the fur would tickle his cock. \"This is a once in a lifetime view,\" Trevor called to Krystal, \"No place or landmark is this high and look at the grass, no wait that trees.\" As Trevor continued to be amazed looking at the view he saw all the trees that fell down and demolished. \"Did you step there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Krystal replied to Trevor, \"I didn't want to cause all that destruction to those tree but how else was I going to get here.\" Now Krystal turned around and pointed at the lumps in the sand on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew how big this beach was but you take up half of it and at your size that's impressive.\" Trevor told Krystal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I know this beach.\" Krystal remembered and said, \"I've never been here but this is the largest beach around in this world and holds several celebrations year-round. Anyway let's get down and either continue our conversation or do what ever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're letting me choose.\" Trevor said in a surprise, \"I've never been chosen to do something.

Besides it's not like anyone will show up. This could be our beach until someone forces us to leave or until we die.\" As the two naked animals go back to laying on the beach Krystal wants to lie on her back and Trevor is confused where to sleep. He wants to sleep near or on Krystal but goes back and forth. \"Having a problem Trevor?\" Krystal wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just don't know where to sleep.\" Trevor explained, \"In cartoons and on the Internet you would sleep on the giant or giantess. Their skin or fur would be the warmest blanket around so I'm trying to decided. You know what, you should choose since you let me. Just a way to give you the turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Krystal said and for the third time she picks up Trevor onto her house-sized hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor wanted to say something personal, \"Um Krystal I was thinking. I know you must have relationships with other animals but until it must happen I want to stay with you. I have always loved you and you were very nice to let see your body and really high views.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smile in surprise and love replying immediately, \"So sweet, you're nice to and I will stay with you.

But it was Krystal, and Fox knew that she would never do anything to harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Krystal... You look even more beautiful than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal simply giggled and placed Fox down on the ground below her. She then laid down on her stomach and crossed her arms under her chin.

Seeing this, Krystal couldn't resist teasing him a bit more. She reached out and grabbed her soaking teammate, and began rubbing him against her breast fur to dry him off. She then placed him back out in front of her again, and began rolling over in laughter at the sight of how messed up she had made Fox's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Krystal!

The blue catsuit was next showing off her sexy body and all the blue and white, never-seen fur,. Her bra came next and she firmly ripped it off like she hated it. Her boobs were white and like gelatin, shaking around. She also removed any bracelets, necklaces, and other accessories off her body. Where did she threw all her clothes and accessories, over trees and caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally all she had to do was remove her pants and panties. She decided to waste time on purpose and take these clothes off as slow as a snail. She unzipped her pants and push them down. Her visible panties  were showing along with a lot of white fur. Right now Krystal felt like someone at a beach, acting sexy, wearing only panties. Finally after all that slow work she had to remove her pants. She looked around and as far away to make sure no one could see her do the most embarrassing part in undressing and going nude. She slid of her blue panties and used her foot to kick them hundred's of feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of undressing there lies Krystal totally nude and 198 feet high. She did grew just a little bit so she was aware of that. For the first time outside she felt her pussy, boobs, and butt and made herself comfortable being naked. \"Okay Fox I'm done. Come see the naked me,\" Krystal told Fox, so he came out from under the tent, looked directly up, and saw Krystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pussy caught his sight and his had an instant erection. There was some pussy juice and a some urine inside her pussy as well. The size was the about the size of the flying ships. Fox ran around Krystal and saw her big, white, blue, bubble but. It was probably twice the size of the ships they fly around in space.

Sarah took the hint and grabbed Krystal's soft, fat, blue hips and squeezed. Krystal moaned as she grabbed Sarah's squishy, bouncy breasts. They both kissed as they fondled each other in the hot tub. Sarah flicked a switch that not only dimmed the lights, but filled the hot tub with lubricants. Both hippo's skin became even smoother as the oils lubed them up. Krystal slowly moved her thick hands down Sarah's back until she reached the two smooth, jiggly, and quivering balloons of flesh that was her ass. Sarah moaned and shook as she felt her butt cheeks pulled apart and smacked together. Her entire body jiggled and quivered in pleasure.<br>\r\n     Krystal, meanwhile, had been enjoying the feeling of her baskatball sized boobs being squeezed, squished, pulled, and pinched by Sarah. She stopped for a second, quivered, and got out of the hot tub.<br>\r\n      \"What are you doing?\" asked Sarah. \"I was just getting warmed up,\" she said, sexily rubbiing her breasts. Krystal grabbed her breasts and lifted them up, pretending to struggle, and said \"Ugh, it's so hard to lift up these heavy milk juggs. Sarah, be a dear and help me carry them.\" Krystal winked at Sarah and let her massive breasts fall, slapping against her oily skin and making her jiggle.<br>\r\n       Sarah stood up, showing off her own massive girth by pretending to have trouble balancing from having too much \"upper curve.\" She strode over to Krystal and rubbed her breasts, making both their nipples harden with pleasure. They both ttried to lift Krystal's boobs, pretending to struggle just for the pleasure. Sarah then \"accidentely\" pushed Krystal's breasts too hard, making Krystal topple over, her body jiggling when it hit the ground. <br>\r\n       They both made out for the next few minutes, and said in unison, \"I want to spend my whole life with you\"</span></div></div>",

The locals had a name for it, Ymir, the frost giant. A planet so cold that it perpetually remained below Celsius all year round. It was one of the furthermost planet from the sun in the Lylat System, thought to be an inhabitable snowy wasteland with no life that dared to set foot on it. That is, until the Great Fox received an S.O.S transmission from the planet just two days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife had apparently stubbornly clung to the frozen crust of Ymir, a far-reaching section of the Cornerian Underground Spec-Ops division had set up a base of operations on the planet supposedly for the sole reason that no enemies would bother searching the planet for a hidden base. They were proven wrong, the details were vague in the message but they were under attack by some unknown force and their base was completely overrun. Being in an outpost so far from Corneria, they had no way of contacting anyone. The Great Fox only just received the transmission out of pure luck after returning from a successful mission in Sector Z and being in the area while heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where Krystal's new assignment came in, for she was the one that sensed the distress signal in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal!\" Cried a high pitched voice, interrupting the vixen's thoughts. \"Krrrrrystal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"What is it Slippy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toad mechanic gently tugged Krystal's right sleeve in the manner a child would when consulting its mother. \"Falco stole my gyro-driver and he won't give it back. He doesn't listen to me, can you tell him to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slippy, I am not your mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Krystal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Stop acting like a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal grasped her forehead from the sudden migraine Slippy was giving. Her new assignment was to be the one who scouted the planet for any signs of the hidden base. Because of the thick icestorms on the surface, traditional radio transmissions and planet scanning were not options. The team would be relying on her telepathy to locate the base. Though there was a danger of getting in the storm, that wasn't what was worrying Krystal though. Despite be covered in fur like most foxes, she absolutely hated the cold. A journey to Ymir was the last thing she wanted to do, even Fox had pushed the others into dropping the mission until the scanning equipment would work. But they all eventually agreed, there wasn't time to spare. She would be leaving for Ymir by Arwing in a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Slippy, you know I'm going planetside soon. I can't waste time here playing mom with the rest of you. As much as I don't want to go to Ymir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked in Slippy's head. \"Oh yeah! I finished adding that special addition to your Arwing, it's all set for launch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe special addition to her Arwing was a full ship super heater that would generate enough heat to keep her fighter warm the entire mission. It would make her job that much more easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, thank you.\" She turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going!?\" He ran to catch up to her but the blast door closed right in his face. \"Darn...I'm sure there's something I forgot to tell her about heaters...Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, Krystal was clear for take off and sped out of the hanger straight for Ymir's atmosphere. As she cleared the thick gray hail clouds, the windows of the Arwing all started to freeze up. The thermometer read -70 Celsius outside, enough for anyone to freeze to death instantly if they weren't prepared. Krystal sighed contently in the cockpit of her Arwing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like summer inside, a drastic contrast between the freezing outside. Hail battered the hull of the Arwing, but Krystal wasn't even shivering. The heat blew in at full blast as Krystal tried to concentrate \"hearing\" for another signal from the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Arwing finally reached the surface of the planet after about a minute of nosediving through the storm clouds. The ground was covered with snow, as would be expected. Not a single patch of brown or black tainted the pearly white pillow of snow. If it weren't for the computer navigating the terrain, Krystal probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the sky and the ground. At least it was a little warmer on the surface, only -40 Celsius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her Arwing gracefully tumbled to and from the great mountains that littered the surface of the planet, Krystal picked up something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...Help..........Many...Them....</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrowed her brow, trying to pinpoint the direction of the beacon. The voice came in a little stronger this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">....Turn.....Back...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she almost had the direction it was coming in, a blaring warning flashed up on her Arwing's computer screen. \"<span class=\"clred\">WARNING: FUEL LEVELS LOW</span>\" The dial of the fuel was nearing empty when a computer voice filled the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Warning. Fuel dangerously low. Emergency landing equipment engaged.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a full heartbeat for Krystal to understand what was going on. \"Slippy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe added heaters had to get their energy from somewhere, and the only suitable source would have to be the fuel for the main engine. Combined with that and the extra energy required to fly through the storm, the Arwing couldn't maintain flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal closed her eyes as her ship tumbled nose first into a pile of snow. Her body jolted as the ship came to a sudden stop. Snow was all around the windows of the cockpit as the temperature in the ship steadily dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill him...\" Muttered Krystal as she kicked open the window and dug her way through the snow. Her Arwing was encased in a good five feet of the stuff, when she finally clawed her way to the surface. It was a dreaded sight that greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had landed in a giant plain of snow. There was nothing for miles on all sides of her. The razor winds of the storm caused her to wrap her arms around herself in a feeble attempt to warm herself. This was bad. Nothing could be seen anywhere except...</span></div></div>",

But what was heartening about the sight was a small black cave-like opening not too far up the base with a path leading to it. It was the only thing that promised shelter from this terrible snow storm. Krystal shivered as her fur was getting powdered by the blinding ice and hail, she didn't have many options at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as quickly as she could, she gathered up all the intact supplies on the crashed Arwing. There wasn't a lot she brought with her, an emergency blanket, some flares, her staff, and a few small food rations. Even with this equipment Krystal probably wouldn't be able to last that long on this planet and unless she got to shelter soon, she would not be able to survive even a night. Her only hope was to make for the cave and hope Fox and the others came down to rescue her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping herself with the blanket like a cloak, she trudged her way through the icy plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like hours had passed as she walked through snow that went up to her waist. She couldn't even feel her feet at this point, even with the insulated boots and a layer of fur. She could almost feel herself passing in and out of consciousness as the mountain slowly got closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, she found herself face to face with the mouth of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of heat swept over Krystal's shivering form, it was almost as it the cave itself was breathing. \"H-Hello!?\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer, just the howl of the wind blowing through the cracks in the opening of the ceiling. But Krystal still couldn't shake the eerie feeling that she wasn't alone in the cave. But her body wouldn't give her time to be afraid, her legs finally buckled under the strain of holding herself up. She needed to get a fire going, and fast. Unfortunately, the only thing flammable she had on her that was expendable was her backpack. Pouring all of it's contents on the floor of the cave, she set the sack in the middle of a small dip. She then took one of the flares and sparked her makeshift kindling to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire made the cave almost come alive. It lit up the dark corners of the caverns as well as warming up the frozen vixen. Little did she know, however, the bright flames also alerted what was also in the cave with her....</span></div></div>",

Even though her arms were practically in the fire at this point, she couldn't feel any heat. In fact, she couldn't feel anything. Every part of her body was numb, she was sure she was getting frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing Slippy yet another time, she wrapped herself in the snow covered blanket she had managed to grab and desperately tried to warm herself with her own body heat. She felt like the last bit of a candle about to go out with a small gust of the wind. This wasn't a normal chill, this stabbed her to the bone. Outside the cave, razor sharp winds cut the air making Krystal shiver at the thought of facing them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had it been since the crash? How long had it been since she had started the fire? Her ship crashing seemed to happen days ago, but no it had to have only happened just a few hours ago didn't it? Surely Fox and the others would notice something was wrong by now. Surely they'd come looking for her, before she...Before she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shuddered at the frightful thought that entered her head, being stuck in a cave as a frozen solid corpse for all eternity. She wasn't going to die here, she couldn't die here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespairing, she looked up at the roof of the cave and shouted telepathically hoping to reach someone, or something. \"<b>Is anyone out there!?!?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that responded was the silent howl of the cave, like the wind in the dead of winter. Krystal grabbed her knees, about ready to give up hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hear you, young one.</i>\" A deep voice tickled her mind and rattled the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal spun around facing the darkness of the cave. Her eyes met a pair of two great yellow orbs floating in the blackness surrounding her. In any normal situation, she might have reached for her staff to defend herself, but right now she was too weak to fend off whatever foul creature this was. Her only hope was to reason with this monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If you continue to stay out unprotected such as that, you will certainly die.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal huffed angrily. \"Is that what you're waiting for? For me to freeze to death before you move in for the kill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your kind come into these frozen wastes so ill prepared, it would be just to let you suffer your own fate for intruding on our refuge.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you aren't going to help me, then leave me be please. Once my friends find me, you'll regret coming near me.\" That was a bluff, but it was all she could muster at this point. Whatever this was, it seemed reasonable. Perhaps reasonable enough to leave her in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The storm outside disrupts all forms of communication that your technology permits. And your mind powers, though impressive for one such as you, are too meager. They will only reach those with the ears to hear it in a short range.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal quickly decided if she was going to have any hope of getting out of here, she'd need to keep this thing talking as much as possible. \"One such as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice hesitated as the orbs of light blinked and shifted around slightly. \"<i>I must admit, you are unlike the others of your kind. None I have met possess the mind powers. Perhaps you are different.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...They came. Driving us from our homes and dens. Forcing us, our young, into the cold during the last great storm. Many died. We learned to distrust your kind. We learned to hate them.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the reason we lost communication with our base then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs shifted again. \"<i>No.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still hate us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hate was not something we Icewalkers were born with. Our home was without conflict before your kind came. So we came to hate them. To curse them. But never strike against them. Only bid our time. Yet, you are different.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs then approached her, closer and closer. Until at last Krystal saw that they were not orbs of light, but two large eyes attached to a humongous white bear. The bear's head was almost half the size of Krystal herself, and it's blank fur was covered with odd markings. Intimidating was the very least Krystal could say about this monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You are the first of your kind to speak to one of mine.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're a bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A bear? I do not know this word. I am Urso of the Icewalkers. Speak, what is your name.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Krystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What a beautiful name. It reminds me of the many shards of ice that decorate the roof of my home.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this cave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What remains of it. This used to be a sprawling hall full of life and my kin. Now, it is all but abandoned save for the ghosts and the ancients. We are the only ones who remain among the living here.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all becoming very fascinating, but a sudden gust of cold wind blew out what remained of Krystal's fire. The cave was flooded with darkness as she suddenly realized she could no longer feel most of her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>As I told you, if you continue to stay out unprotected you will die.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" she begged the bear. \"I have no quarrel with your kind. I'm not even from this planet! I just need to find someway to stay alive. Please, anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs of yellow light that was Urso's eyes shifted around again. The bear seemed to be debating with itself, growling in the darkness of the cave. Until at last Urso came to some sort of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I shall show you how to survive, but if you choose to use our ways is up to you.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

She felt a nudge at her stomach and was slowly lifted off the ground on onto the great bear's back. He was carrying her away from her old campfire and deeper into the cave. It was so dark that she could not see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come then. I shall take you into my refuge.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it warmer there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nowhere is warm on this world, Krystal. I'm surprised those who sent you would not know the dangers of our land. Even your kin have only survived on this world by hiding in metal machines and rarely venturing outside.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal could only imagine the hardships the Special Operations forces had to endure to live on such a desolate place. Still, this tale spun by Urso about how they drove out his kind from their homes just didn't sit well on her tongue. All members of the Cornerian Forces were bound by duty to never endanger or disturb the sanctity of a planet's inhabitants, the Special Operations were no exception to this rule. But there was no way she could accurately explain such a duty to Urso, she sensed that he was the sort of creature who would not understand such things. His mind seemed too wrapped up in how his people had been wronged and less involved in reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll just have to prove to him overtime that we're trustworthy.\" Krystal thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso continued to bring her deeper and deeper into his home. Krystal could tell that she was descending underground by the feel in the air. It wasn't getting warmer exactly, but it seemed more stuffy and less fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bear came to a stop and gently lowered Krystal down onto a hard surface. Through her limited eyesight in the darkness, she was able to tell that it was some sort of stab or bed made of ice. Krystal quietly crumpled up into a ball with her blanket, she no longer could feel temperatures including cold. She was beginning to sweat profusely, though the very marrow in her bones ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso disappeared into the shadows once again. It was some time before his great yellow eyes reappeared. Something sharp was place next to Krystal's shivering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You must eat this herb if you wish to survive.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso grunted once again, this time it seemed impatient almost. \"<i>If you truly have no choice, it will not matter what it does. Make your decision.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said there was no choice in the matter. Reaching a shaking hand out for the plant, she grabbed it and tossed it into her mouth wincing as she chewed. Whatever it was, it was extremely bitter and cold, like a sharp blast of the winter winds. Once it was at the bottom of her stomach, however, a new sensation was filling her. Like warm butterflies were passing over her in a wave, heating up every cranny of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she smiled contently and closed her eyes to drift off into a well earned sleep, Urso grunted approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I shall warn you now, little one. When you awaken, you will be in an unfamiliar but safe environment.

The second thing that came to mind was that she could actually free her arms and legs now. Whatever that bear had given her to eat really worked well, she felt like she could run a marathon now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA presence on the other end of the cave made Krystal turn her head, and a great big familiar shape came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Excellent, you are awake.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks to you. Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The deepest known crevice of our world, beyond the detection of any of your kin's feeble devices.

Well, it's certainly fitting, I'll give you that. Of course, I don't understand what you meant by don't panic-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal went to sit up in her bed, but was met by some unusual resistance pulling her stomach down. This great weight sent her falling face first into the pile of straw, slightly confused. As she sat up again, her confusion quickly turned into pure terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wh-What is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is what I meant by don't panic, little one.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Krystal's eyes, she could hardly have been called little anymore. Her once perfect figure honed by years of martial arts practicing and constant training had been completely ruined. Her stomach had extended a good foot away from her body as her breasts, which were certainly bigger than before, were resting comfortably on top of it. Every part of her seemed fatter to her, even her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me!?\" Krystal demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I saved your life.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saved my life!?\" This could only be considering saving her life if she had been starving in a desert for forty days. Krystal felt disgusting and huge like a hippopotamus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The herb you ate was no ordinary herb. It is specially prepared medicine that we use to bolster our young's body heat and mass. We consider it our most sacred plant, I did not choose to give it to a stranger such as yourself lightly.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was sure she had offended Urso now, but was still freaking out over her bodily change. \"Couldn't you have just brought me here!? I mean this place seems much warmer than it was in the cave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It only seems that way because of the herb I gave you. With the storm blowing outside on the surface, it's most likely even colder than it was the day I rescued you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso had kindly left Krystal's belongings in a neat heap on the side of her straw mattress. After digging around her remaining supplies, she found her portable thermometer and promptly shrieked at the number it displayed. \"There's no way! It's -50 Celsius in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Typical arctic storm temperatures in our home. I repeat, had I not given you that herb you'd be a frozen corpse right now.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal frowned and gazed glumly at her gigantic stomach bulging out beneath her Arwing uniform. This was going to take at least three months of dieting and constant exercising to burn off. \"I...I understand. Thank you, and I'm sorry Urso. I just...This wasn't what I expected when you said you'd save me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I suppose a greater warning would have been more appropriate on my part, so I apologize too. There was really no other way and no time to waste. If I hadn't given you the herb and treated you here, you would have been gone for certain. It already took two days for you to awaken.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days,\" Krystal thought to herself. \"Fox and the guys probably think I'm in trouble, or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal rose to her feet with some difficultly, considering her new girth, and hobbled over to her equipment to begin packing things up. She'd have to at least find a way to contact her friends and let them know she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What are you doing?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Packing my things and finding my communicator. I need to get to the surface and tell my friends I'm alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're going to stay right where you are.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't anything sinister in the bear's tone of voice, only a commanding presence. Nevertheless, Krystal prepared her staff in case she had to fight her way out. With this extra weight, it would be difficult but she'd have to manage somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmly but firmly warned the bear. \"I'm not staying here, Urso. I need to speak to my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If you go up to the surface now, you will die. I did not save your life just so you could throw it away again. Do you know what's going on above us now?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her staff. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The entire earth is being covered by layer upon layer of snow and ice. The great storm is upon us, the terrible phenomena that happens only every few years. Even the mightiest of our kind who have attempted to face the storm on the surface have perished from the bitter cold and blinding winds. It is a frozen apocalypse in the world above.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you expect me to sit here and wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It will take five days at least for the worst of the storm to pass-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five days!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>-I suspect during that time your friends will be able to look for you anyway. Even with their machines and metal monsters, your kin were unable to venture out into the great storm. They too bunkered into their homes as we must do for a time until it is safe again to walk the surface.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then when the storm ends, will you let me return to the surface?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso shifted around uncomfortably again. \"<i>Yes. But I have a request to make.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal sighed, but nodded. \"I suppose I do owe you for saving my life. What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You are the first of your kind to be taken into our Lair. This is because you are the first of your kin to use mind words to speak with us, you're the first one to communicate with us. We desire our homes that your kin stole from us. When the storm settles and it is safe to venture the wasteland, I wish to take you to your brother's metal home and reason with them. If you do this for us, I will consider our debt paid in full.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed slightly. \"That works out just fine for me. I was planning on visiting them anyway, and you can show me the way even. There's just one problem though, how am I supposed to get there without my Arwing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I said I would teach you the ways of the Icewalkers, and I plan to. For the next five days, you will learn to become an Icewalker.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a figurative statement, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, you must physically become an Icewalker if you plan on surviving the trip to your kin's home.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute, Krystal didn't quite believe what this bear was asking her to do. She had never heard of anyone ever literally transforming into a bear, but then again she had never heard of a herb that could protect the eater from cold and fatten them up in such a short time. Part of her was screaming at her to not do it, but her more reasonable made a convincing argument. Without Urso, she would have been dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it permanent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is simply...\"</span></div></div>",

This lair holds the last bastion of our holy tree, and it is through the herbs created from its roots that our people have been able to survive on this barren world for as long as we have.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal patted her protruding stomach. \"Yes, I can imagine it's qualities have helped your kind live through the harsh winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Legends say that our people were once like yours, small and unsuited for the winters of the planet. It was through the Ymirwood that our people were saved. Some say it was the planet itself that reached out and spared us.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal nodded along, but in the back of her mind she had her doubts. She had heard of a species adapt to a planet before over the course of a period of time, but there had never been a case of a planet adapting for the species itself. She didn't wish to betray Urso's trust in her, however, she much desired to examine the qualities of this herb he had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>In any case, come. We have little time if you wish to be prepared for the journey to the defiler's- your kin's- hole.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal nodded and resumed gathering up her things to follow Urso, she was regretting burning her backpack now especially with the extra weight she had been putting one. She followed Urso out of the cave with all her belongings on top of her stomach, waddling to catch up to his great strides as best as she could. He led her down a long rock hallway filled with unusual cave paintings of bears, men, and all manners of horrible looking snow creatures. Krystal didn't bother to take a look at them in case she became too distracted and dropped one of her items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Urso came to a stop at the end of the hall, Krystal only then dared to glance up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Behold. These are the halls of the Icewalker.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHall was an inappropriate word at least from Krystal's perspective.  The cave had opened up into a full blown chamber, fully lit with fires along the walls. The alcove they were now in was at least one hundred feet tall with an almost menacing statue of a bear in the chamber center stretching up the entire length with bubbling waters down below them. Along the walls were multiple holes, which Krystal assumed leaded into more hallways like the one they had just been in. Most noticeably was the amount of white furred bears lurking everywhere in the chamber. At a glance, there had to be at least a thousand of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world did you manage to build all of this?\" Krystal finally found her voice after a moment of speechlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The truth is, we didn't. This, along with the Ymirwood were all found here ages ago. We believe this place is as old as the planet itself.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the cavern itself is, but that statue is definitely hand made.\" Krystal thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso grunted uncomfortably. \"<i>Regardless. We must venture down into the lowest chamber, where the elders and the Ymirwood await to meet you. Once they have heard your plea, they will allow you to begin your training as an Icewalker.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they haven't already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso did not answer, and instead continued towards a ramp in the cave wall. Krystal clumsily followed with her items in hand nearly tripping over her own two feet. It was much more difficult to walk like this than she expected. Along the way down into the pools of steam, Krystal sensed that she was being watched. She looked around the walls of the chamber to see that every single pair of yellow eyes were on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're staring at me.\" she whispered to Urso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Indeed, so they are.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bears treated her with...</span></div></div>",

The doorway opened up into what Krystal assumed was an assembly. There was a stage in the back raised above small stone benches all facing it. On the stage sat three of the oldest looking bears Krystal had ever seen, with the most ancient looking one sitting in the middle with beads tied into its fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The Exiled approaches,</i>\" echoed a new hoarser voice in Krystal's mind. \"<i>And he comes bearing one of the Defilers. Hardly a welcoming sight for your first visit to the Lair in years.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Indeed, it has been some time most honored elders.</i>\" Urso's familiar voice filled her head now. \"<i>The past is past, I come now with tidings of a hopeful future. This young may yet restore our rightful glory and bring justice.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That abomination!?</i>\" Rumbled an even deeper voice which Krystal suspected was coming from the fat bear to the right. \"<i>That filth would see us driven out of our homes before helping us! Toss it out into the storm!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I have already begun to evoke the Right of the Icewalker.</i>\" replied Urso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall suddenly filled with angry roars and growls. Krystal had not been paying attention behind her, but several dozen bears had entered the assembly as well. All of them had the same angry glare on their faces. All of them were looking directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Enough,</i>\" called out the center voice. \"<i>The penalty for such an act is-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Exile, something that you had already placed on me, brother. That still didn't stop me from returning home, did it? You let me walk right in. If you still hold any hope towards me, then listen. All of you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall grew uncomfortably quiet as Urso stepped forward and onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I have a solution, one that will work this time. I know the hatred of the Defilers still burns in your very souls, but this one is different. She can help us, she will help us. She has already agreed to undergo the Right.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And what trust can we place in this Defiler? How can we be so certain that she speaks the truth? What if this is another trick?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If she betrays us, I will place the Ritual of Yorn on myself.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was Urso had said, it caused even more commotion than revealing that he had given Krystal the herb already. This didn't seem like angry growls though, more concerned or awed. Krystal wasn't quite sure how, but she was able to sense their tones and feelings through their roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If you remain so confident, the Elders will grant you their blessing, though strained as it may be. You are granted access to Ymirwood, dismissed.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the elder bears rose and stepped out of the assembly, as did most of the audience. Urso and Krystal continued to remain behind. She was desperately trying to keep up with what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say you were exiled,\" she said to Urso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You never asked.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it this Ritual of Yorn thing is bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrso paused, trying to find the right words. \"<i>Exile is merely exile. One can still return to the sloth if one proves himself, we are so few that this is permitted. The Ritual is...More final. It is abandoning all worldly possessions and venturing into the frozen wastes alone. It is a death sentence, a long cold death sentence.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal suddenly felt cold, remembering wandering around the snow covered plains like it was a dream. How close had she come to death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Do you understand, Krystal? I put my life on the line because you must succeed, because we must succeed. Once you go forward with me, you may not turn back.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The actual process is quite simple, little one.</i>\" said a shriveled looking old bear that sounded like a female to Krystal, though she couldn't be any judge. \"<i>Lay down please on the slab and we can begin.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal obeyed, laying flat on her back with her massive stomach in the air. She wasn't sure, but it felt as if she had gotten heavier since this morning. The budge that was her belly seemed so huge to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're coming along quite nicely,</i>\" continued the old bear. \"<i>Have you had your root today?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, what are you waiting for? Remember, you must never go a day without the herb else you could end up ruining the whole process.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crone bear set down a plate of blue roots at Krystal's side, she grab one and silently chewed on it. \"This all seems far-fetched, what exactly are these herbs doing to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Stimulating your body and growing it. You have a lot of catching up to do if you want to make the trip to the Defiler's Grounds. And Urso entrusted you to me, so I'm going to make sure you're ready. Now swallow that root!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal obeyed and gagged on the taste of the bitter herb. \"What must I do to be prepared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>First step...</i>?</span></div></div>",

There was also a growing warmth spreading from her belly to other parts of her body, just like before though this was more pronounced. Despite a massive weight dragging her down, Krystal was able to stand on her two feet with little difficultly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel hot,\" she said to the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Indeed, the growth should begin over the course of the day. You'll be even bigger then.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big will I get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>As large as any other of our kind.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gulped. She tried to imagine herself as big as Urso and her mind simply couldn't process it. All the bears here were at least ten feet in height, even the older bear in front of her was sitting at around nine feet. Getting fatter was one thing, it would be another entirely to grow into a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This way.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old bear motioned her to follow into a rather loud part of the caverns. When Krystal arrived she saw that it opened up into another large chamber with dozens of little growls inside. Krystal nervously stepped towards the ledge and saw an amazing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby bears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Those are our cubs, yes.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber before her was like a playroom for at least fifty different tiny bears, at least tiny in comparison to the adults. Each cub was nearly five feet tall, nearing the height of Krystal herself. They were all tackling each other and now that they were closer, Krystal could hear their childish laughter in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, go on</i>,\" the old bear nudged Krystal in the back, closer to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait,\" Krystal scrambled to keep her balance on the ice. \"What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, Krystal slipped on the edge and slid down the ledge like a slide straight for the cubs. \"<i>Walk like a Icewalker. Wrestle with them and learn to use our great strength.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging her fluffy tail on the ground, Krystal skidded to a halt in front of a rather bulky cub with a strange black moon marking at its forehead. It turned to greet her were with wide green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi!</i>\" shouted a kid-female voice. \"<i>Who are you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the adult bears, the children seemed to show no hostility to Krystal whatsoever. There was a wide-eyed curiosity as Krystal sat up to brush her butt off, causing the cub to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said Krystal. \"My name is Krystal and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why are you angry?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're standing up like that, are you angry?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Krystal whispered to herself. \"Bears only stand on their hide legs when they're angry. Walk like a bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal carefully leaned over and got down on all fours, which instantly caused the cub to return to her and smell her. She tensed up, hoping not to scare her new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hehe, you smell like fruit,</i>\" said the moon-cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Krystal, struggling to keep her head raised at the cub and she repeated. \"My name is Krystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm Tunglio!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're quite fortunate, outsider,</i>\" said the old bear crone's voice as she approached from the side. \"<i>Tunglio is actually the daughter of one of our elders. Treat her with respect.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal nodded as Tunglio got closer to her. \"<i>Is Krystal here to play?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She is here to learn how to be one of us. She has begun the Rite of the Icewalker and needs to study our ways, starting with learning how to physically behave like one of us.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cool!</i>\" Tunglio got even closer to Krystal's face. \"<i>You'll be like a big sister! Does that you'll wrestle with us?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" The thought of Krystal taking on this bear, even if Tunglio was still a child, would be a daunting task without her staff, which she left back in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only made matters worse when the old bear said. \"<i>Absolutely. The first step in her transformation is testing her strength.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Tunglio immediately jumped at Krystal, trying to pin her to the ground. Krystal reacted as quickly as she could, but was ultimately defeated by the cub's great weight. Laughing, Tunglio got off Krystal as the fox girl sat up, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to beat her when she's twice as heavy as me?\" Krystal asked the crone bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old bear gave a a huff. \"<i>You must defeat Tunglio by the end of the day or we will not proceed. Fight or give up. Walk like a Icewalker.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal grunted and got back to all fours again. This would be easier if she was used to walking around like this, instead her back was already killing her from bending over and holding up the great weight on her belly. The other cubs were gathering around her now, looking at the strange overweight fox before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are you going to surrender?</i>\" asked the old bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gritted her teeth. She had a mission here other than survival. She couldn't back down now, even if the task seemed impossible. Urso was putting his life on the line in order for Krystal to make peace with his people and the Special Operation forces, and she owned him for her survival. Even if it meant becoming a bear, even if only temporary, she wouldn't back out of a life debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good</i>,\" the old bear sounded pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day Krystal...</span></div></div>",

A few hours of eating and growth later, Krystal now looks like she's at least twice as big as before. Fox lovingly kisses his wife as he happily massages her huge belly. \"How do you feel my dear?\" \"Mmmm. Great. I am stuffed with life!\" She'll say as she rubs the sides of her belly as it'll squirm with greater strength.\"Wow.\" Fox will say with great love. \"Krystal will settle back and smile. \"Would you like to go see the pregnancy doctor to see how many we have?\" Krystal will think for a moment.</span></div></div>",
