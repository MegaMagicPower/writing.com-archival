Velma quickly learned there was no turning back if she wanted to come out the other side of this with everything as it was once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts made her flop to her knees as they grew,' Fred smiling wickedly as she struggled to stand. The carpet's fibers caressed her nipples as her chest reached bean bag size, something she wasn't used to for reasons made clear before the curse took effect. Her squirms and groans only excited Fred more, who took a seat in front of her to enjoy the show just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, they are huge!\" stammered Velma, her breasts becoming fleshy anchors that kept her pinned to the carpet. \"You can stop them, can't you?! I find them a bit hard to work with and a tad painful. Mostly heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" said Fred as he stroked his chin. \"They can't be entirely pleasant to endure. At the very least we can make the experience better. You get horny as you feel your breasts rubbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly did the trick: Velma felt her brow sweat as her struggles to overcome her obstacle actually excite her. She gnashed her teeth as she pressed against her chest, the carpet's rubbing making her feel all the more aroused. Her labored breathing didn't help her keep a stable stance, her legs feeling limper and limper as she struggled all the more. She looked up at Frank, who was clearly enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff-huff. I guess this is an improvement,\" she said, laying on her breasts with a sigh. \"But not in the direction I intended! What are you going to do next? I can't even stand up at this rate! They'd have to push me up to - oh god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your breasts will grow big enough to push you to a standing position. Bigger than the rest of you are,\" said Frank, with another wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was quick. Velma's breasts grew out of control, pushing her up back up to a standing position as she felt every rubbing against the carpet turning her own harder. She blushed intently as she gasped and groaned, trying hard not to touch herself as she gradually stood up thank to the growth. She felt increasingly intense pleasure from the growth, almost humping herself in the process. Such sensitivity, she thought, taking deep breaths as she tried to avoid getting excited enough to encourage herself personally. Her hands were millimeters away from going where she never expected . . . </span></div></div>",

So I'm going to give you a break, if you'll at least <i>talk</i> to me. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma nodded briskly, stopping suddenly when the motion caused her hypersensitive, room-filling breasts to quiver and shake against the floor, the sensation nearly overwhelming what restraint she had left. \"P-Please! Help me! I'll do anything, just make it stop!\" Caught between humiliation and arousal, Velma actually began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred got to his feet, and placed one hand on her shoulder, \"Your breasts are normal, in size and sensitivity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes flowed rapidly through Velma, the relief caused her to fall to her knees right there on the carpet. She hugged herself, crossing her arms over her now bare breasts, exposed by the complete destruction of her dress and brassiere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred left Velma on the floor to recover, and stepped into his bedroom, returning with a large work shirt. He draped it around her shoulders to help cover the damage her changes had caused. \"Here,\" he took her arm, \"have a seat on the couch, and I'll get you a drink.\" While Velma composed herself a bit, pulling the shirt about her bare shoulders, he grabbed a pair of cold sodas out of the refrigerator, and offered her one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped it open, and took a good sip, slowly starting to feel a little better. \"Thank you, Fred. I owe you one. I'm sorry if I've been...mean...before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred sat across from her, drinking from his own can, and replied, \"It's alright, but we need to have a serious talk about more than just us. Do you realize how valuable, and dangerous, your condition is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma shook her head, \"No, it's all happened so fast, I haven't even given it much thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Fred continued, \"look at it this way. Anybody who <b>knows</b> about your condition can basically push you around, any way they want. That's not good, at all. Hopefully, that's just you and me right now. So, at the very least, you're going to have to trust me when I say I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanching, Velma realized just how SOL she was, \"Oh God, anyone around me who says something accidental, could affect me! And if they find out they have control, they could...\" she couldn't finish the thought, but Fred nodded solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. But, there is an up-side.\" Fred stood, and made a theatrical gesture, \"You have the strength of an Olympic weightlifter, and the body you always dreamed about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma shivered as the change rolled through her. She grew, just a inch or two, while her body grew the curves she'd always felt jealous over other women having. What was left of her dress creaked a bit as her butt filled it out more than before, but with the top gone, nothing else fell apart. Peeking down the front of her borrowed shirt, she saw that \"the girls\" had grown up too, but only to a more moderate and manageable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it,\" Fred continued, \"You could be a model, or a super-hero, or who knows what else. Think of what you could experience. Did you ever want to be an animal when you were young? You could totally do that! Frankly, I envy you a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma, who had been test-lifting the couch with deceptive ease, put it slowly back on the floor. She turned to Fred, and said, thoughtfully, \"Yes, I can see the advantages. I can also see how it could really work to the advantage of a randy boyfriend, being able to fulfill any wild fantasy he might have.\" She approached Fred, and placed her hand on his cheek. \"The question is, can I trust you that far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred stammered a bit, placing his hand over hers, \"Umm, I don't want to go too far too fast, but yes, I would be honored to be your boyfriend, it's what I always wanted. I'm...sorry I let my hormones get in the way of my brain earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma smiled a little at that, \"Well, I suppose I'm partly to blame for that, I wasn't very nice either.\" She thought for a moment, and then said, \"I owe you, and I think I also need you. It's going to take two of us to deal with this problem. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about you, <i>that way</i> yet, but...I'm willing to take a chance. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred took her hand in his, and kissed her fingers, \"Deal. Let's take this one step at a time.\" Smiling, he continued, \"Hi, my name is Fred. I live two doors down, and I would like to take you to dinner, if you're not busy tonight?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dinner plans seemed pretty straight-forward and simple, if the dishes left in the sink where any indication. A little pasta, a little buttery bread, and a couple of meatballs to accent it all filled them up to other satisfaction. What remained uneaten was sitting in a fridge in proper containers as the dirty dishes laid to rest in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock read 7:37 PM. As it switched to 7:38, Fred sat on the couch in his living room, one leg resting on the other and sipping a red wine carefully poured into a wine glass. The bottle of wine itself rested on a table in front of the couch, with the cork precariously left off it, ominously tempting fate to tip it over and ruin a couple of DVDs left out in the open. In front of him, Velma, in a furiously concentrated fashion, scribbled notes onto a whiteboard, the marker fumes making her sneeze gently periodically. She scratched her nose, giving her a brief pause in her writing regiment, which convinced her to turn towards her new partner in revelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whiteboard laid out what they noticed so far about Velma's condition. It was a flow chart with little care given to proper flow, but it still managed to give crucial information. Expansion became topic #1, with arrows to various body parts (some of which were written with a question mark and others with an exclamation mark - for example, 'breast!' or 'feet?'). The exclamation points corresponded to Velma's current state: her breasts grew to twice the size of her head, her legs made her a good six feet even, and her tongue felt some added girth, if not enough to crowd her mouth terribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the expansion set (forgiving the loose use of 'beneath') were other ideas that crossed their minds. Immobility, obeying commands (which included an added note of BE CARFUL - the E was left off in haste), strength, new skills. The 'new skills' section only included one example, which was a drawing of a painting - meta reference to that she could draw now. Beside the board was a quick painting of an Italian landscape, which added all sorts of questions about her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that question was answered when they included a note on increased function, including speed and jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma gave Fred a proud thumb's up as she stood beside her board of accomplishments and suggestions, smiling beamingly. Fred stood and applauded, the two giving a hearty laugh at their new sense of comradeship and adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like made a couple of discoveries,\" said Velma as she tapped the board. \"Some of them are, heh, more obvious than others, but I feel we can make some good headway if we experiment properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiment makes it sound like you're a guinea pig,\" said Fred as he leaned into read the board carefully. \"I think we can use the term 'explore' to give it a more positive spin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Lewis and/or Clark,\" said Velma, chuckling as she scribbled 'exploration' upon the white board. \"That doesn't exactly help us figure out where to start. We picked out a couple of obvious ones already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stepped back as best they can to give the board a proper look. With that, Fred gave a proud smile as he stroked his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can always try . . .\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Velma was your average twenty eight year old woman. Her shoulder length brown hair framing her brown eyes and thin lips. Modestly framed with slight curves her small b-cup breasts gave her a more feminine shape than her tomboy look she seemed stuck with. It was a typical day for her. Her routine walk through a park to exercise and relax after a stressful day as a secretary. Today was a particularly bad day for her. She had made a simple mistake and her boss reprimanded her harshly. A week with no pay off. Her mood kept her wrapped in her own thoughts. <br>\r\n As Velma walked she kept her gaze down. Bumping into another woman they both stumbled but Velma lost her balance and fell back. Looking up angrily she saw the other woman compose herself as she regained her balance. Her black knee high boots and black skirt under a loose black blouse that had the largest DD's Velma had ever seen. The womans curves the essence of sexy. Her dark makeup and long dark hair that she brushed from her face made her look like an adorable goth.  <br>\r\n \u201cOh. Excuse me miss.\u201d The woman said offering her hand to help Velma up. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n The polite calm of the other woman set something off in Velma. Her days frustration boiled up and she snapped back slapping the offered hand away.  Velma stood and pointed an accusing finger at the woman yelling at her.<br>\r\n \u201cYou dumb . . . bitch! You could have hurt me. Watch where you thrust those stupid big boobs!\u201d, Velma's voice oozed jealousy and hurt full intent.<br>\r\n The woman crossed her arms, obviously uncomfortable of being a target.  Her smile and friendly disposition started slipping away as she stood there taking the insults Velma kept shouting at her. Her eyes growing annoyed then angry. <br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry miss. I didn\u2019t intend to knock you over. No harm done so let\u2019s please just drop it and go our own ways.\u201d, her voice calm but firm. Turning to go around Velma she started to walk away.<br>\r\n Velma stood, fists on her hips as she watched the woman dismiss her so easily. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away you dumb bitch! You stupid goth! You owe me an apology!\u201d Reaching out Velma grasped her arm and jerked her around to face her again. The womans eyes glared at her. They almost looked like they were glowing purple with electricity. Velma caught her breath mid insult and released the woman's arm. <br>\r\n The womans voice, like a loud speaker booking around Velma spoke. \u201cI have apologized already miss. However you seem a little rude! Perhaps a lesson should be made. You insult my looks, though I don\u2019t have much choice how my body looks.\u201d She cupped her breasts. \u201cYou on the other hand shall never have a choice now. I curse you!\u201d Her hands releasing her own breasts and one hand slaps Velma in the forehead. A jolt of energy flows through her body and she finds herself unable to move. Her whimpering drowned out as the other hand of the woman raises and seems to shower her with purple lightning that crackled and popped.<br>\r\n \u201cYou shall from this point on be cursed to change. Change in ANY way anyone commands you to change!\u201d, the woman spoke, venom dripping from every word as she pushes Velma back down to the ground. A smile appeared back on her face as she finished. Small crackles of lightning still popping from her fingers making Velma jerk and shudder.  \u201cAnd if anyone asks about your changes or appearance you will be forced to tell them about your curse. I hope you have some understanding friends.\u201d<br>\r\n The woman stood tall and offered her hand once more to help Velma up with a warm smile. \u201cNow. . . As I was saying. I\u2019m sorry I bumped into you. Allow me to help you up.\u201d<br>\r\n Velma looked up in shock hardly believing what just happened. Shaking her head she pushed the hand away and angrily said, \u201cLeave me alone you stupid big titted goth bitch! You knocked me down and I must have bumped my head! Curses don\u2019t exist! You are just some stupid nerd!\u201d Standing on her own she turned to hurl another insult at the girl and froze. The glow in the women's eyes returned and the smile left her face. The hand that was held out now in a fist. \u201cOH?! You have FF tits miss. Have fun carrying those around!\u201d The woman spoke calmly then grinned and turned to walk away.<br>\r\n Velma stood. She was surprised to see the woman turn and walk away. She was about to start hurling a few parting insults as she herself turned to walk away angrily brushing off her summer dress when she felt a tingle on her chest. Her hands reaching up and scratching her bra through her dress top. It seemed to be growing tighter. The tingling continued as she continued to walk, her steps slowing as she felt her bra tighten and looked down seeing her breasts swollen a little. Turning she looked back but the woman had disappeared. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d  Each breath she took started to turn to panic as she felt her breasts swell larger, the tingling continuing and the dress top stretching tightly across her chest. <br>\r\n \u201cNo! This can\u2019t be real! I must have a concussion or something!\u201d Velma's voice squeaked as she felt her breasts with her hands and could see the growth continuing. Her bra digging in as it was fast becoming comically too small. The dress, skin tight now giving creaking sounds as the seams started to give way. With a soft pop her bra snapped free between the two cups and her tits flooded the top of the dress. The strained fabric ripping at the sides as they bounced. Velma looked around and ducked into some bushes to hide as the tingling stopped. Her dress top torn on the sides showing an impressive amount of side boob. <br>\r\n \u201cH-how the. . . .?\u201d Velma stammered as she pulled her bra free and tried to cover her breasts with her hands on either side. \u201cI . . . I have to get home and figure this out!\u201d <br>\r\n Velma peeked out from the bush and looked around. The coast seemed clear. She lived only a block away so it wouldn\u2019t be hard to run and be home in a few minutes. She darted from the cover and headed home. Her steps clumsy as they were being thrown off balance by her now large FF breasts. Each stumbling step forcing her to hold her breasts with her arms. A few people watched as she ran past. relieved that no one was bold enough to ask her what was going on she made it to her apartment steps. Breathing heavy as she climbed the stairs to the second floor she reached for her door as a neighbor stepped out of his. He glanced at her saying hello then did a double take. His eyes wide and staring at Velma. <br>\r\n \u201cVelma? What the heck? What happened to you?\u201d, he said stunned as she fumbled with keys trying to get inside.<br>\r\nVelma stopped cold. Her hands stopped trying to get her keys in the keyhole and she turned to face her neighbor. \u201cFred, I have been cursed. I have to change in anyway anyone commands! . . . \u201c, she paused as the curse made her tell him then free of the forced response she turned back blushing red and continued to fumble with her keys. <br>\r\n Fred laughed and said, \u201cCome on. You can\u2019t say something like that and expect me to believe that. You are wearing a set of fake breasts aren't you?\u201d He walked over and poked a side boob that was exposed making her jump. His eyes grew bigger as he felt the very real skin, warm and soft. \u201cShit! Those are real!\u201d<br>\r\n Velma covered herself and turned to him glaring. \u201cNone of your damned business! J-just leave me alone. . . please. . . \u201c <br>\r\n \u201cFollow me.\u201d, Fred said with a smile and turned back to his place. Velma followed slowly trying to resist but unable to stop herself from following him into his apartment. Fred closed the door behind him and looked her over. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be rude. I can help you. . . probably.\u201d He ran a finger over his chin and said,\u201dYour breasts are your normal size.\u201d<br>\r\n Velma, her arms across her chest, felt the tingle return and felt her breasts slowly growing smaller. The gaps at the dress top side closing a little as the fabric became looser. Fred's eyes watched the change, mouth open and amazed. \u201cWow! It is true!\u201d He looked up at Velma's face and grinned. \u201cI know you have been cold with me every time I am nice to you. Perhaps you will be nicer to me now. . . \u201c <br>\r\n Velma kept her arms over her chest and nodded. \u201cTh-thank you Fred. . . I\u2019m sorry . . . I\u2019ve just had a long day. . . I\u2019ll leave you alone. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Turning she took a step towards the door but froze as he spoke. <br>\r\n \u201cYour breasts are the size of beanbag chairs.\u201d Fred said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n \u201cWhat! You bastard!\u201d Velma turned and started to raise her hand to slap him when the tingling took her again and she felt her breasts growing again. Her attention distracted from him as she watched her breasts growing bigger and bigger. Taking a couple steps towards the door Fred said,\u201dYou can not leave without my permission.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cPlease! D-don\u2019t do this! Stop it! They are growing too big!\u201d Her arms now cradling her breasts as the dress top is torn more. The pale skin bulging out from the sides then flowing freely into the air as the cloth shreds free. Her new mass shaking and jiggling into her arms heavy and round. The weight soon pulling her to her knees. Leaning over her breasts panting as she panicked she could feel the carpet touch her nipples. Looking up at Fred she saw his joy at the change. The breasts still swelling larger under her till the held her up and she was forced to be on her knees bent over.</td>",
