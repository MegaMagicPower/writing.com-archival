The Doctor's wondrous time/space ship was thrumming with energy as the Doctor's companion flicked through some controls on the console panels. She was looking through TARDIS database files, having recently discovered that they weren't the first person the Doctor had invited to travel with him. Resentment had burned throughout her at the very idea of not being as special as the Doctor had made her believe that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why she was looking through files of everyone who ever had (or ever would) travel with the Doctor. As far as she was concerned, she was<i>the</i> companion, and she wasn't going to settle for second, or third, or fourth, or even twentieth place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving travelled with the Doctor long enough to pick up a little bit of knowledge, she set the controls for her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship wheezed, and the time rotor repeatedly rose and fell as the TARDIS was in-flight, she eagerly awaited, bouncing with anticipation for what she planned to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the noise came to a stop, signalling that they had materialised at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced towards the doors, ready to meet her fellow companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the companion?</span></div></div>",

But her necklace was more than just a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS key around her neck allowed Martha Jones to blend in, unnoticed. Covering her in a perception filter, it should prove very useful for what Martha had in store for a certain blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing dark blue jeans, an unzipped red leather jacket and her jet black hair flowing down her shoulders, Martha looked around until she found who she was looking for. Rose Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after the Master had been killed. The Doctor had allowed Martha one trip in the TARDIS as requested, fully trusting her. But if he had known what she was going to do, he never would have granted her request. Her year exploring the Earth in defiance of the Master had given Martha a lot of time to reflect. During her travels with the Doctor, his constant mention of his previous companion, Rose Tyler, had bothered Martha to no end. She was just as good; why could he not stop talking about Rose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealously had festered in Martha like a poison, until all she knew was that she had to get some measure of revenge. That's why she was currently on the hunt for Rose Tyler, in a time before she became trapped in a parallel world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done her research, Martha knew that Rose would be all alone in her flat, without her mother, Mickey, the Doctor to spoil her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha knocked on Rose's flat door. The blonde woman answered, but found herself disorientated as she tried to see who it was. This was the effect of the perception filter. Martha took this opportunity to slip past, shutting and locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Rose asked timidly, clearly unsure of what was going on. And that's when Martha took her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha rushed forward, pulling Rose down until her face slotted against her cleavage. She pushed Rose into the wall, smothering her against her tits. The blonde struggled, rubbing her face from side-to-side. But with her attention forced away from whoever was squashing her, she couldn't do much to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMFFFMMPPPP,\" Rose muffled into Martha's bosom. A vengeful smile across her face, Martha carefully squatted down, ensuring that Rose slid down with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha grinned down at the gasping and bewildered Rose Tyler. This had been her plan all along. With the perception filter, Rose would be constantly forced to look away from her attacker, and therefore be powerless to stop her. This way Martha could avoid being overpowered, considering she wasn't the biggest or most powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin across her face, Martha pushed Rose to lie down on the floor before taking a seat on her face, the fabric of the jeans covering the blonde's features. Unable to properly look at whoever was now using her face as a butt cushion, Rose was none the wiser as to what was going on, assuming that an alien looking for the Doctor was using some type of freaky technology to punish her into revealing his location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose mumbled a protest into Martha's plump butt. The protest turned into a scream as Martha shifted her legs until they were resting across Rose's body, meaning that her ass was sat fullweight on the face of Rose Tyler. Now Martha could enjoy punishing the woman who had captured the Doctor's attention even after she was gone, knowing that nothing was going to stop her from carrying out her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Martha do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy exited the TARDIS doors to a nicely decorated flat. As she took in her surroundings, she noticed that the woman she'd come here to meet did not seem to be around anywhere, and she couldn't hear any movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall Scotswoman had come here with a purpose. Earlier that day, she'd come across a note, signed by her future self. At first Amy had taken it as a joke. She might have only been travelling with the Doctor for a few weeks now, but she still wasn't quite as open-minded as she would likely become over time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as she had read the letter, she accepted that it was indeed her handwriting. Her future self had not given much of her future away, only vaguely suggesting that one day the Doctor would need cheering up, and one woman would be there to do that for him. Her name was Clara, and Amy's older self instructed her to go seek Clara out at her flat and thank her for being there for the Doctor. The older Amy made it clear that she was no longer in a position to do it herself, which was why she had turned to her younger self for the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had been relaxing in her living room, laid on her couch, when suddenly she watched the TARDIS materialise in her living room. This was far from the first time this had happened. She was used to her grey-haired Doctor turning up unannounced in her home at any time. The round-faced woman grinned widely enough for her dimples to become very pronounced as she sat up. However as the TARDIS doors opened, they didn't reveal the Doctor stepping out, but a tall ginger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hello?\" Clara asked. Bizarrely, the mysterious woman didn't take any notice of her. In fact, she didn't react at all. She just continued to look around the living space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy huffed. There was no sign of Clara anywhere in her flat. 'She must be out,' Amy thought. All the while, Clara was actually asking her who she was and what she doing there from her seated position on the sofa. Yet Amy didn't acknowledge her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Clara, the TARDIS' perception filter had malfunctioned when the Doctor had dropped her off the previous night. An invisible field, the perception filter prevented anyone from noticing the TARDIS' presence, behaving as thought the object was not there. The Doctor usually kept the field down to a minimum, allowing everyone to notice it, but not feel compelled to investigate it further. However, the full strength of the perception field had latched onto Clara, covering her with an invisible bubble that would prevent anyone else from seeing or hearing her. Usually the field merely altered one's perception. But turned up to full strength and latched onto a human? Clara was effectively invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to sit and wait for Clara to show up, Amy turned and walked in the direction of the sofa, heading straight for Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed in relief as she saw the stranger approach her. Finally she was going to give her some answers. \"What-what are you doing?\" Clara asked as she saw the long-legged ginger stop just in front of her, and turn around so her tight ass was right in front of Clara's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed again as she began to lower herself to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's eyes widened before grunting as the woman plopped her heavy body down onto her lap, their height disparity becoming crushingly clear. 'Dear god, how much does this woman weigh?' Clara thought before she pushed against the strange woman's back in a fruitless effort to force herself off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy flinched as she thought she felt something push into her back, feeling almost like hands. It did feel like she had sat down on a pair of legs. But there was no one else there. She turned around just to check, confirming that she was indeed alone. She decided to lean back a bit to get comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara groaned again in pain as the red-haired woman lifted her butt up an inch before scooting back and plopping it back down. Her groans were muffled as the woman began to lean backwards, forcing her back into Clara's face, pinning her head into the back of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt a ticking sensation against her back, but thought nothing of it. It was probably just an itch. Little did she know, that she was now sitting on the very woman she was waiting for, and had trapped her head between her back and the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara Oswald excitedly bounded out of the TARDIS doors. Today was the day she was going to meet Amy Pond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the TARDIS had shown her profiles of the Doctor's past companions, Clara was entranced by the photograph of Amy Pond. Remarking that the woman was \"made of legs\", Clara was instantly attracted to the tall ginger, privately thinking that she'd love to have those long legs wrapped around her head. That was why Clara had set out on a mission to meet the Doctor's former companion, and make her fantasies come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in a year that she knew Amy and Rory would still be living in the present day in the house the Doctor had given them, Clara crossed the street and knocked on the blue door. Although she knew Amy was happily married to Rory, she figured that she could come to some sort of arrangement. After all, she was the Impossible Girl. No situation was impossible for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open to reveal the sexy redhead she'd expected. \"Hello, can I help you?\" Amy asked politely. Never had a Scottish accent sounded so sexy to Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter woman was lost in her own dirty thoughts for a second before snapping back to reality. \"Oh! Yes. Sorry.\" Clara blurted out in a scramble to save face. \"I'm Clara. Clara Oswald. I travel with the Doctor, and I know you did too. I was wondering if I could come in for a chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" a warm smile crossed Amy's face. The Doctor would always be one of her fondest people in the world, and she'd love the chance to chat to someone who really understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women chatted away for a good while, swapping stories of TARDIS adventures and shenanigans. Eventually Clara grew bold enough to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy I must say, you are even more beautiful in person than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scottish woman blushed, taken completely off-guard. \"Thanks. You're quite the looker yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara grinned back. She knew how attractive she was, but that didn't take away from the effect of Amy telling her so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, there was another reason I came here. You. I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy exclaimed in shock at the gall of the woman. \"Clara I'm flattered, but I'm happily married and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. And I'm not asking to come in the way of you and Rory. But meeting you, seeing just how curvy you are up close, I want to feel them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's ears reddened. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, you must know how sexy you are. Your ample bosom, those long legs that stretch for miles, that nice plump arse. I can't help but think how great they'd feel against my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, what are you asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, please smother me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for you to go,\" Amy began to stand, and that's when Clara reached across and pulled Amy back down. A grin spread wide across Clara as Amy's round rear fell and collided with her face. Amy looked down, her mouth wide open in shock at the foreign sensation of sitting on another woman's face. Amy knew she should get up and kick this mad woman out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't. She found that she was genuinely enjoying the feeling of having Clara's round face underneath her butt, especially as the petite woman moaned into her curvy rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you win,\" Amy voiced aloud. A cheeky grin crossed Clara's face beneath her, as she wrapped her arms around Amy's thighs. Feeling aroused, Amy began to grind her ass around on Clara, who let out some muffled squeals of delight in response. Maybe this wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the two do next? </span></div></div>",

If Clara motorboated Martha? Then this is the story for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how poorly Doctor Who companions tend to react to the information that they're not the first to travel with the Doctor, maybe they might be jealous enough to go find them and teach them a lesson? Or maybe they might be jealous enough of their bodies to want to find them and beg them to smother them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe they might land on them without realising that they're there? Or maybe a perception filter might come in use to cause some purposefully planned or unaware smother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No toilet stuff/scat/peeing. Farts are acceptable.<br>\r\n2) F/F or F/M only.<br>\r\n3) Please use adequate standards of grammar/punctuation. Please don't let this discourage you; just try your best! I don't mind fixing chapters myself if this is too much of a problem.<br>\r\n4) Please make sure to write a decent chunk rather than just a few sentences. Aim for at least 1,000 characters.<br>\r\n5) I'll allow growing/shrinking, but the characters can only grow/shrink by a couple of feet at the most.<br>\r\n6) Not a hard rule on feet stuff, but I'd prefer to keep it to a minimum.<br>\r\n7) Please try not to make it too violent. I've rated this 18+ to be on the safe side, but I'd rather people try to keep it more closer to 13+.<br>\r\n8) No death.<br>\r\n9) No going back in time for interaction with them as a child. All interaction must be from the time the character became a companion. I shouldn't have to state this, but just in case.</td>",
