People are calling it Juvenile or just J. It temporarily returns the user's mind to a more youthful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts most popular use is recreation. Some want to experience being a teenager again when just being near someone of the opposite sex was exciting and taking risks was normal. Others return to childhood where everything is new and there's no responsibility. A much smaller group even regress their minds to when they were toddlers or even infants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing number of people have also discovered its use for study. A youthful mind absorbs information much better than a fully matured one. Unfortunately self-discipline also decreases with age. To deal with this, some people ask a friend to act as their 'parent' and keep them focused on study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the illegality of the drug there is little quality control and it is hard to know exactly what dosage you are getting. Some people have found themselves regressed to infancy when they were aiming for teenage. More concerning, there are rumors of people suffering permanent side-effects. Some have returned from a trip to infancy still incontinent. Others have not returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first \"character selection\" choice this story should be written in the style of a \"choose your own adventure\" type book. That means keep the point of view 2nd person (The main character of the story is referred to as \"You\" - the reader) and limit options to choices that character can make, not events outside his/her control. Eg \"How much J will you take? 1) 1 pill 2) 2 pills\" is good but \"How far do the pills regress you? 1) Childhood 2) Infancy.\" is not.   </td>",
