            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\"></div>There is a place between the realms of Heaven and Hell, where spirits with unfinished business roam freely.  Some call it either Purgatory or the Netherworld, but what's known to the souls there is actually called the \"Neitherworld.\"  Why?  We'll explain this a little later.  Our story begins on a central part of the Neitherworld, in a city of dark and twisted buildings.  Although the sun was rising, on this eerie landscape, it was still rather gloomy looking.  As we draw deeper into the city, we see that its inhabitants are not only ghosts and ghouls, but there were also monsters of all shapes and all sizes.   One for example is a burned out smoker sitting on a bus stop bench, next to an overweight spook with a chicken bone stuck in his throat.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\"Want a cigarette?,\" the smoker offered a spare from his box.  \"Oh, no thank you,\" replied the fat one in a rather choky voice. \"Trying to cut down myself,\" the smoker continued with his 'duty'.<br>\r\nPassing the two, were a group of bicyclists, each have a missing limb or, car or truck tire marks, and anything else that could symbolize their accidents.   Then goes a bus load of more ghosts, monsters and a skeleton driver.  And a taxi cab driven by ghoul with a burned up face.  Over the rooftops, came a flock of skeletal birds that fly past an eerie Roadhouse at the other side of the city.  With A big sign that says \u201cBJ\u2019S ROADHOUSE.\u201d On the roof, crawled a two ft. spider in tap-shoes on 6 of its back legs. It uses two of its front ones as hands and washes the \u201cB\u201d with a cloth as it hums in a sweet, feminine voice.  <br>\r\nIt was unaware that some other frightening creature was sneaking up on this innocent looking insect.   As the spider scrubs the \u201cJ\u201d, the figure stepped a little closer and closer until the spider turned to look.  It was a large frightening monstrous face with sharp green teeth, crazy blond hair, and snakes popping out all over him!  The spider screamed from fright, causing her to slip off the edge of the roof, with a string of web trailing as she lands on a skeleton out for a jog!  Her landing caused the skeleton to literally fall into pieces! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\"Oh,\" complained the skeleton in a French accent, \"why does this always happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>Suddenly, a cackling sound caught the attention of the two.  On the roof top, they saw that the laughing comes from that terrifying thing that scared the spider.  It then changes to a phantom figure wearing a pinstriped suit, a mulberry colored shirt with a black wrinkled tie.  Skin that\u2019s ghostly white, moss growing around his face and his hands, with red pointed finger nails,  dark purple eye shadow, with a pair of creepy yellow eyes, a green striped tongue, and a pair of dirty black boots.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\"Oh boy,\" laughed the ghoul, \"You guys are really a couple of \u201cspooksters\u201d, aren\u2019t ya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was you, Beetlejuice,\" the spider said sarcastically in a New York accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui,\" agreed the skeleton, \"And that was not funny at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeetlejuice, the prankish ghost, floated down towards the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw come on, Jacque,\" he said to the skeleton.  \"You know I was just goofing\u2019.  Where\u2019s your sense of humor?  After all,\"  He then used magic to make an American flag appear behind him, waving on a golden pole.  \"We as dedicated ghosts, ghouls and goblins, have the right to haunt and scare the living daylights out of everybody,\" He said in a patriotic tone while placing his hand over his heart.   <br>\r\nThe spider literally helped put the Jacque, the skeleton, back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So why not just haunt the living?,\" the spider asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui, agreed Jacque, \"can you not just get someone to summon your way into the living world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it\u2019s just as fun as tormenting you guys as it is with mortals now-a-days,\" scoffed the ghoul.  Beetlejuice laughed so melancholy, but<br>\r\nJacque and the spider both groan at this.  Beetlejuice then stopped, as he turned to see what\u2019s going on across the street.  He saw a house across the street that looks like the skull of a giant steer.  But next to it, there is a creature that looks half bull and half dog sleeping in a doghouse labeled \u201cPoopsie\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of fun\u2026\" He said an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeetlejuice disappeared in a flash, and then reappeared in front of the creature.  No doubt that he had a dastardly plan for this dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Poopsie,\" he tapped on the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog woke up, from that, shaking its head.  After taking one good look at him, the dog got so mad and starts barking at him!  Seems that the two have met before.  Beetlejuice then turned around and gave the mutt a great big fart which clouded the whole yard. Jacque and Ginger turned their heads away, holding their noses, in order to save themselves from the smell.  When the smoke cleared, the \u201cbulldog\u201d just sits there, frozen, with a face of shock, as a result to the gas.  The ghost flicked his finger, which tips the dog over.  Beetlejuice disappeared as some huge, angry monster in a cowboy hat comes stomping out the front door and onto the porch with his spurs on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN TARHOOTIES?!\"  growled the monster in a Western accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he made the mistake of sniffing the scent, which also made him passes out with the same expression, causing the ground the shake a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeetlejuice reappeared at Jacque and the spider's spot, laughing once again at his own joke.  <br>\r\n\"Sometimes I kill myself.  What am I talking about?  I\u2019m already dead!\"  He laughed even louder after that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jacque and the spider just walked into the Roadhouse, scoffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ginger,\"  Jacque said to the spider.  \"Yeah,\" agreed Ginger, \"Why did we ever move in with this joker?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\"></div>Suddenly, the prankish ghoul was caught in a gust of wind and covered in what looks like an orb of fog.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!  What the--,\" exclaimed Beetlejuice at this.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In an instance he had vanished from sight!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a second, Beetlejuice had found himself transported into what looks like a waiting room with even more ghouls and ghosts sitting around couches and chairs, minding their own business.  One was a diver with a shark on his foot; another one  a woman sawed in half, literally sitting beside herself; another a skydiver with broken tree branches sticking out of him; another a jungle explorer with his head shrunken and an African headhunter, sitting next to him.  Beetlejuice ignores them, but furiously turns to the receptionist, who was a pretty woman, wearing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Argentina\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beauty ribbon, doing her daily job which was using her typewriter.  He pounded on her window, which grabbed her attention.  She immediately opened it up and spoke. <br>\r\n\"Yes?  Can I help you?\"<br>\r\nThe male ghost took a deep breath (Well if he still had any) and just as you thought he would yell at her, he actually said... <br>\r\n\"Hey babes, how\u00e2\u0080\u0099re you doing?,\" in a very smooth-talking voice.<br>\r\nThe receptionist, was completely annoyed by this.  Who wouldn't?<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much just why I was dragged all the way over here?\"<br>\r\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait if you want your appointment for Juno.\"<br>\r\nBeetlejuice paused with what sounded like a car screeching its tires and crashing.  Sure, it sounded cartoony, but that's how <br>\r\n\"JUNO?!!!!\" He yelled, for he knew that name very well.  But sometimes, he wished he didn't.  <br>\r\n\"Aw come on,\" The Ghost complained, \"I got better things to do than just sit around here, wait for my number to be called and get an appointment for that old bag!\" <br>\r\nIn an instance, Beetlejuice had found the bright side, in his way.  <br>\r\n\"But I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so bad, once I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got you, toots.\"<br>\r\nThe receptionist pressed his face away from herself as an obvious sign of rejection.  Then slammed  the window completely on that perverted ghoul!  Beetlejuice, however, took his number, then turned to see there was room to sit in between the woman in half.  He smirked at the sight of this, and then floated in to take his seat.  The perverted ghoul started caressing her legs while she wasn't looking.  Beetlejuice grabbed her skirt, to see what was underneath, but the lady turned to look and whacked him on his shoulder with her book.  <br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Beetlejuice shouted in pain.<br>\r\nHe immediately got up and walked to the other chair, where the explorer and the head hunter were.  <br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see you sitting there,\" he obviously lied.<br>\r\nHe then took his seat in between the two men.  <br>\r\n\"Women,\" he said to the explorer.  \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what her problem is.  Normally chicks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\"<br>\r\nThe Explorer turned his head on Beetlejuice, ignoring him.  Beetlejuice took one good look at his number, which read 9,998,383,750,000.  He looked at the number display which changed from 2 to 3.  Poor impatient Beetlejuice sighed at this in frustration, until he saw the headhunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ticket that had a # 4 on it.  The prankish ghoul smirked at this, then leaned is arm on the hunter.  <br>\r\n\"Pardon me,did you do that?\" he pointed at the explorer's head. <br>\r\nThat had also gotten the shrunken-head victim's attention.<br>\r\n\"Very nice work let me ask you something. How did you get them down so small?\"<br>\r\nThe sneaky ghoul turned to look.<br>\r\n\"Hey, there goes Elvis!  Yo, King!\"<br>\r\nOf course, there was no Elvis Presley there, but the hunter turned to look at where Beetlejuice was pointing at, while the tricky ghoul swiped tickets with the distracted one.<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m next,\" he chuckled, with no shame.<br>\r\nFrom that moment, the headhunter looked at his ticket, and realized that he had been tricked.<br>\r\n\"Good thing too,\" Beetlejuice continued.  \"I got an appointment for Juno in about an hour and a half.  Yeah something about my being careless with pranks and all, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the headhunter sprinkled Beetlejuice with some weird form of glittery dust.  All of a sudden, the ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head began to shrink!<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, what are you doing?,\" his voiced started to sound high-pitched.  \"Hey, stop that!  Hey, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re messing up my hair!  Hey come on!  Whoa!  Stop it! WHOA!!!!!!\"<br>\r\nBut then, he had a second thought.<br>\r\n\"Hey, this might be a good look for me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\"></div>As time went on, Beetlejuice decided to keep his head at a normal size.  Of course, he hadn't left the room, so he stayed there for days, weeks, months, and possibly years.  This bored him so much, that he fell asleep on the couch he was sitting on.  Then a fly came buzzing in, and even in his sleep, the ghost caught it with his tongue like how a lizard or frog does it.  This right, this ghoul really has a taste for bugs.  Could be where he got the name \"Beetle.\" <br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"></div>\"NUMBER 9,998,383,750,000!\" shouted the voice of a much older woman.<br>\r\nBeetlejuice sprung himself awake from the sound of it!  In fact, it made him jump so high, he squished his head flat on the ceiling!  He then landed on his bottom and inflated his face back to it's original state by puffing on his thumb. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>The next minuet, the ghoul saw that the first receptionist had been replaced with another, who was a hideous blue octopus-like creature with big pink glasses, and red hair wrapped around in a beehive.<br>\r\nHe look both ways and said,<br>\r\n\"Hey, where\u2019d the pretty one go?\"<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha,\" she sarcastically replied, \"Very funny.\"<br>\r\nJust then, the door to the offices opened all by itself, revealing what looked like a man who had been run over, with a huge tire mark over his chest.  He was run over so hard, he was looking pretty flat.  What kept him up, was a long line of string hanging him up by his elbows like a clothes line. <br>\r\n\"Beetlejuice,\" he called out, \"party of one.  Take your hand book and--\"<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me to Juno,\" the impatient ghoul so rudely interrupted.  \"I know, I know.  Can we just move this along already, so I could pull more pranks later on?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, The road kill man didn't know Beetlejuice well enough, so he continued, \"come on.\"<br>\r\nHe leads the prankish ghoul out through the door and into a corridor of even more office workers, typing, passing out files, and escorting their own clients to other offices.  Some of the type writers were skeletons, while the others were suicidal souls who were gliding on nooses, passing out files.<br>\r\n\"How do I look?,\" asked the road kill man. <br>\r\n\"Oh fine, said the bored and sarcastic Beetlejuice, \"you\u2019re looking just fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I\u2019ve been feeling a little flat!\"<br>\r\nNot even at that joke made Beetlejuice laugh.  In fact, the only one who was laughing was the Road kill man himself.  The \"flat-out\" ghost slid right through a crack in the wall, while Beetlejuice floated up the stairs into Juno\u2019s office, passing through the door using his ghostly powers.  <br>\r\nThe office, was a dark room with green lights shining around the desk.  And behind the desk was an old woman with her throat slit and smokes bittering out of that cut as she puffed on a cigarette.  <br>\r\n\"Beetlejuice,how many times have I told you to knock before entering?\" she complained by this.<br>\r\nThe cranky ghost groaned as he floated back through the door, then he knocked on the it.<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" she said.<br>\r\nBeetlejuice opens the door and walks all the way in to take his seat.  <br>\r\n\"Okay, Juno,\" he said to her, \"what\u2019s the scoop?\"<br>\r\nShe gave him a quick summary about his actions in the world of the living. <br>\r\n\"I\u2019ve received word that you\u2019ve tricked the Maitlands into saying your name three times, and tormented them with your stupid bag of tricks.\"<br>\r\n\"So?\" that didn't bother him, so he waited for Juno to make a point.<br>\r\n\"So, you\u2019ve caused so much mayhem, that you nearly sent them flying off the Winter River Bridge with that silly disguise of yours.\"<br>\r\nBeetlejuice remembered it all too well.  The Maitlands were a living married couple who were driving in a yellow Volkswagen beetle, along the Winter River Road, in Connecticut.  <br>\r\n\"Jane says we should sell the house to some other family,\" said Mrs. Maitland.  <br>\r\nThe Jane she was talking about was a sweet, kind hearted friend of the couple who requested that the house was just too big for the two of them.<br>\r\n\"Barbara,\" Mr. Maitland replied, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of Jane\u2019s business.\"<br>\r\nJust then something had caught his attention.<br>\r\n\"Hey, look out for that dog!\"<br>\r\nHe was right, for as they were getting close to the entrance of a crimson red covered bridge, there was a little Scottish terrier, crossing their path! As the wife turns the car directly away from the creature, the car smashed a hole through the wall of the bridge, making them stuck in between the edge and the river.  Little did they know, that the dog was laughing at this scene, then it turned out to be Beetlejuice in disguise the whole time!<br>\r\nBack at the office, Beetlejuice chuckled at it and said,<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, those were the good times.\"  <br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t you see the point?!\" exclaimed Juno.  \"You could have sent them falling off the edge, and drowned them in the river!  You could have ghosts of them!\"<br>\r\n\"But I didn\u2019t,\" he smirked.  \"Look at the bright side, Junie, at least you don\u2019t have to make clients out of those two deadbeats.  If only they didn\u2019t find that page in my spell book to send me back.\"<br>\r\nThat was the only thing that bugged the insensitive prankster.  For the only way he could be summoned, is by calling his name three times.  The same could be said for sending him back to the Neitherworld.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to get sent to Sandworm Land for that?\"<br>\r\nThat was the punishment for ghouls who couldn't behave in the Neitherworld.  That was what frightened Beetlejuice the most!<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" he reacted.  \"Sandworms.  You know I hate \u2018em.\"<br>\r\n\"Then, next time, think before you pull another one of your stupid pranks,\" she warned.<br>\r\n\"You can count on me, Juno, he replied with a positive attitude.  \"I\u2019ll be extra careful on my old haunting routine.  I won\u2019t Juice any living people to death for as long I live.  Which is kind of late for that, you know.  After all, I\u2019m the Ghost with The Most; the Number One Name in Laughter from the Hereafter, the world\u2019s funniest\u2014\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.  I get the point,\" Juno interrupted, annoyed by this.  \"Just get the heck out of here, and try to behave yourself!\"<br>\r\n\"Ha!  You got it, Junie,\" He winked.<br>\r\nBeetlejuice disappeared from the office, leaving Juno alone to talk to herself for a minuet.  <br>\r\n\"How did I ever get to be this wacko\u2019s caseworker?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a pleasant enough day in Peaceful Pines, and the Deetzes were celebrating the ever sunny weather with an outing on the front lawn. Mother and father were cheery, but not young Lydia. She sat in the shade of a tree far from the grounds, hidden beneath its mangled branches and imposing shadow. She couldn't stand the light for very long, so she took respite under her own \"spooky tree\" whenever she could. She could wait there for hours, and her parents wouldn't even notice she'd left. Figures. Her parents never really seemed to pay her any attention, especially when moving to a town like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only things she'd managed to get for herself were a little darkroom in the basement and the tree she sat under. The darkroom came about because her parents didn't know what else to do with it, and so let her have it to fuel her little hobby. That was about the only thing they knew about their daughter, her love of photography. No one else really took the time to listen to her. She'd been at Miss Shannon's school long enough to know those girls wanted nothing to do with her as well. If only there was someone she could talk to, someone who'd appreciate her love of things a little more\u2026 macabre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia took a few photos of the dead patch of earth in front of her. She smiled as a little worm eased its way through the ground. She'd always been interested in these sorts of things, the things most people avoid. It started with a love of monster movies and Halloween, but grew and grew over the years. She took a particular interest in the idea of ghosts, invisible people hanging around still. She felt a kindred spirit to them. As she photographed the dirt, a strange crackling disturbed the spot and out popped a tiny beetle. Lydia laid her hand out and let it crawl into her palm. With her other hand, she quickly tried to snap a picture, but the beetle disappeared as soon as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have flown away,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she'd never seen a beetle like that just slip away, they were slow crawlers. Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her parents were going inside. Lydia took her cue to sneak by them back into her room. That was one other upside to being ignored, she could come and go as she pleased. And her room was decorated just for her! She could truly lavish in her love of the creepy here. Spiderweb curtains, crimson red sheets, and delightfully dark wallpaper, all that she'd chosen herself. If her mother ever came in it would spell trouble, but luckily she had this place all to her lonesome. Though the dead quiet got to her from time to time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia plopped onto her bed. If only there were somewhere else she could go. Even the walls of her room were looking a little too cheery. There had to be a place where others like her could go, somewhere she could be herself and not hide away like this. Somewhere neither here nor there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkittering woke Lydia from her brief nap. She jumped up and caught a glimpse of a little bug flitting about her wall. It scratched at the corner of her wallpaper, peeling it away to reveal a hole in the wall. Lydia leaped to her feet and tried to catch it, but it flew right overhead! She swiped and and swung, but it was no use! It flew right in front of her face this time, before disappearing completely! Lydia stood agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was very, very wrong.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sudden burst of cold wind blew through the hole in the wall the bug revealed. Lydia shuddered and reached for her red blanket, draping it over her shoulders like a poncho. Now a bit warmer, she tried to peek at the hole. It seemed far too deep for something so small. And where could that wind be coming from? The closer Lydia got to the hole, the larger it seemed. No, wait, it was actually growing! The hole in the wall grew and grew until it wasn't a hole at all, more of a door, really. Lydia searched for a handle in the dark, but to no avail. She then knocked on the door once, twice, three times. To her surprise, it sprung open, with a stone spiral staircase leading down a seemingly endless tower. Lydia took one step down, then another, and another, and soon enough she'd slipped outside her room into somewhere completely strange and new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea there was a room like this in the house,\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each new step, what little light was left in her room faded away. She looked over her shoulder but once, then turned her back on it for good. Lydia smiled to herself as she descended the final steps of the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the foot of the stairs she found a little table with a hefty book. She brushed the aging dust off the cover. Unfortunately, it looked as if the book was in Latin, or some other dead language. These were the times where Lydia wished she'd paid a little more attention in school. Despite its size, Lydia found she could pick it up rather easily, and slipped it into the folds of her blanket. Maybe she couldn't read it right now, but if given a little more time, perhaps she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another door across the hall, beyond which a strange orange glow peeked. Lydia shuffled to the door, eager to explore more of this strange new world. She reached up for the doorknob, turned and pushed---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find herself back in her room! She swiveled around, expecting to find the stone tower, but instead looked out on the familiar hallway. She couldn't believe it! Had it all been a dream, sleepwalking or something like that? But when she found the book she'd tucked away in her blanket, she knew something far more interesting was afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lyd-iaaaa dear! It's time for your dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be Mom calling for her. She must have been gone for a while if it was already dinner time. Lydia quickly hid the volume in a long forgotten shelf and hurried on down. She didn't want them to come up and find her (or the book).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia sat down for an uneventful dinner, where her oblivious parents asked her about nothing and spoke only of their days. She took solace in this boredom, as it kept them from being suspicious of her whereabouts for the past few hours. She cleared her plate and slipped away without much fuss, and hurried back to her room. When she came back, the strange door was long gone, as she'd somewhat expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, she fell into her bed with a troubled mind. She really wanted to take another look at that book, but until she could understand what it said, she'd be pretty out of luck. Maybe she could take another look at it, though? She had rushed through the pages, come to think of it. A little more time couldn't hurt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all Latin, it seemed to be written in a hodgepodge of languages, one of which happened to be very old English. Though the letters looped and crossed everywhere, Lydia could just barely make out a word or two here and there. She read aloud to herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I know I should be weary\u2026 Still I venture someplace scary\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain a cold wind howled and shook the walls. Lydia gripped her blanket tighter, struggling to read on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"G-ghostly h-haunting I t-t-turn loo-oose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia fought off shivering long enough to finish that line, but beyond that a giant inkblot scrawled out the rest. Poor Lydia curled up into a ball on her bed, cold from head to toe now. She piteously struggled to read what was left behind the inkblot, but not even a fragment of a word could be made out. She tried flipping to a few other pages, but it was all the same. Words here and there were completely blotted out, as if on purpose. Though they looked like random blotches, they were clearly hiding something that someone didn't want read, or said, or even thought about. Lydia wondered what would need to be covered up like that. Maybe this was some sort of spell book, and she'd accidentally stumbled upon a curse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the normally unaffected Lydia was a little scared at the thought of that. What exactly had she read, after all? The last thing she'd said, something about ghostly haunting\u2026 Could she have called out something supernatural?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia quickly flipped through more of the book, desperate to find an answer. But the more she searched, the less legible the text became. Suddenly, the pages started flipping of their own accord, and Lydia leaped back in awe. The book floated just above her bed, its words shuffling around to form giant jumbles of text. When Lydia got the book pinned down, the words rearranged into little pictograms, which Lydia struggled to identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne definitely looked like a insect, but the other one was\u2026 a milk carton? She didn't really understand it. What was the book trying to tell her? Lydia wondered if reading aloud again would help, so she tried to sound out the words: \"Bug, Bee, Bee-tle?\" The book responded with a vigorous thrashing! \"Beetle. Beetle what? What about the beetle?\" The word beetle fragmented off an arrow, pointing at the carton. \"Carton? Milk? Drink? Bottle?\" The book was losing strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know what it is! It's very hard to tell with all these letters mixed together\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk carton fractured into its individual letters then, rearranging to form \"STARTS WITH\" and a gigantic letter \"J\". Then, sure enough, it reformed into the milk carton, then an orange. The orange stayed in the center of the carton, and it suddenly clicked with Lydia. \"Orange juice. Juice!\" The book practically applauded her. \"Okay then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do beetles and juice have to do with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book showed the bug again, then the carton, flickering between the two. Lydia tried again, \"Beetle. Juice. Beetle- juice? Beet--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Lydia could repeat the words again, her father peeked in. The book shut in her hands as he turned on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumpkin, is everything okay? You've been in your room all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Dad, I'm fine. Just doing some reading\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my little girl. Good night. Don't stay up too late now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Dad. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and don't forget to shut that window. You'll catch cold in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heh heh. I hadn't noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia sheepishly got up to shut the window, only to find it already closed. Just as she'd expected. Once her father shut the door, she looked to the book on her bed. It was also shut up tight. Seems she wouldn't get any further with it tonight. Lydia tucked it safely underneath her bed, then laid down wondering what she'd gotten herself into.</span></div></div>",
