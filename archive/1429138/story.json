I finished watching my show and reached over to grab the remote but it wasn't there. I looked over, and it was ten feet away, across a strange ground. I stood up, and looked around... everything was... giant! I looked over as I heard a door opening, and saw my sisters cat Danny. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n I tried to hide, but there was nowhere to do so. Danny ran over, and leaped up onto the couch knocking me down. I started crawling away when I heard a familiar voice. \"What do you have there Danny?\" I looked up as I felt myself being lifted into the air to my sisters face. A grin broke her curiosity, and I almost turned to tears.</span></div></div>",

I didn't want to think of what was going to happen to me knowing my sister. The cat's paw landed on my leg, and I let out a loud squeal as it nearly tore my leg off. I tried to close my eyes as this horrid event happened but I couldn't. This game went on forever, and it seemed like Amanda was lowering me closer and closer. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n I soon was no longer able to cry as I was reduced to a wimper. My sister didn't seem to be pleased. She lowered me down into the cat's maw. I could only watch as the cat's mouth slowly closed around me. I let out a scream and felt myself being lifted away from the cat. My shoe fell off, and the cat swallowed it. I only knew that was to be my fate. <br>\r\n      <br>\r\nThe cat then jumped into the air after me, and Amanda barely got me out of range. I nearly bawled at this event as she kept lifting and lowering me at the cat. She started dangling from side to side, and the cat jumped again. This event was gretting harder and harder to bear.</span></div></div>",

A shrillish scream left my throat, and I could barely speak... or scream anymore. My sister laughed as her hand jerked quickly making short bursts up and down causing my sweater to choke me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought this would last forever, when the cat's image grew swiftly. The cat's teeth impaled my side, right around my stomach, and a shock of pain jolted through me as the cat landed. \"Danny!\" The cat made it's way into my sisters room, and climbed under her bed. It was dark, I couldn't move, but there was a feint meowing noise. Kittens. I felt myself being lowered, and finally dropped, I could feel multiple sharp objects digging into my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little kittens continued to eat him, and ripped him to pieces. Much of him was found by his sister, who at first disgusted could only smile as she watched the kittens, eat their meal.</span></div></div>",

She stopped dangling me, and slowly pulled me up to eye level as I caught my breath. I looked directly into her giant, menacing eye, and curled up into a ball. I was terrified, and didn't know what she would do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun,\" she cried as she started off. I stayed in  the ball as best as I could, so I couldn't see where I was going. Before too long, she stopped, and dropped me. I landed on something hard. Soon I felt a warm sensation across my body that soon went away. Slowly I left my ball, and I looked around trying to find my sister, but she wasn't in the room. I took a moment to try and rationalize what had happened, but It didn't help. How could you rationalize this? It made no sense! It had to be a dream, yes that's it a horrible dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlooking around I soon noticed that I was walking, my leg had healed. I ran around trying to raise my courage for anything my sister could have planned for me. I took a seat on a giant log sized pencil, and I looked at the large objects around me. One thing that drew my attention was a large pencil holder. I thought maybe I could hide from my sister in there. If I could get her to think I was missing it might give me the chance to run away.</span></div></div>",

I finally came to the decision I'd have to use the log sized pencil. I ran over, and tried to pick it up, but It was far too heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dragged the pencil over to the cup, and tried to figure out how to get it up there. I ran to the sharp, pointed end and started to lift. I could get the pencil a foot or so (actually a couple centimeters) off the ground, but It was a lot of weight. I set it back down to prepare myself for the next lift. I grabbed the pencil, and managed to lift it above my head. I continued to push until I had it set against the cup. I caught my breath, and began climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got halfway up when I heard my sister talking on the phone outside the door. I started climbing faster, but my body motions started shifting the pencil. I made it to the top as the pencil fell, and I caught the cup with my hand. I threw my leg over, and fell in. I heard the door open, and I tried to quiet my breathing even though she probably couldn't hear it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up, and saw Amanda's face looking around. My plan worked, she thought I'd escaped. I waited as I could hear her rummaging through her room. I heard the door shut, and I decided to come up for a look. I climbed the pencils, and pens to the top, and she was still in the room. She must have thought if she made it sound like she left, I would come out. She was right...</span></div></div>",

I cowered underneath the pencils, when the entire cup began shaking. I soon was falling, and one of the pencils broke my ankle. I grabbed my ankle, and looked up at Amanda, and she was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to apologize, but she just shouted, \"Stop it, I don't want to hear an excuse!\" She slammed her hands on the desk, and just screamed. The shock sent knocked me on my butt, and the scream deafened me. I didn't know what to do, what was going on this was a nightmare. She raised her hands, and I cuddled in a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*slam* Her hands struck the desk, and the shock wave made me roll. She grabbed my shirt and lifted me into the air, and held me to her face. I uncovered my eyes, and looked at her menacing gaze. She had angry eyes, but her lip was oddly quivering. normally you wouldn't notice it, but being this small it really stuck out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was falling, and when I struck the table my breath was cut short. Amanda picked me up again while I was at a loss. I was just about to catch my breath, when she dropped me again. I couldn't breath I felt like I was gonna die. I looked up at her, her fist raised in the air, and closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda crushed her big brother underneath her hand, and but a single tear dropped from her eye. She left the room, and got a napkin to clean up the mess. After a while the tear had dried up, and she smiled. Laughing almost she called her friend with an incredible story to tell.</span></div></div>",

Once I heard the door slam I climbed up again. No sign of Amanda. I climbed out of the cup, and looked for a way down. I found a spool, but there was no way the spool would stay up here while I climbed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then got an idea, I'd use pencils to hold the spool, and then climb down. I aligned the pencils on the base of the spool, and unwrapped a thread long enough to get to the floor. I hoped three pencils was enough to hold my weight, and I started to climb. To climb down I just slid small amounts at a time, making sure not to fall to fast, or burn my hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was climbing down, I'd feel small jerks of falling. With one fourth my climb left I looked up. The pencils were giving way! I slid faster now, when suddenly I was free falling. I hit the ground, and looked up. The pencils were coming straight at me! I curled into the fetal position, and hoped for the best. The ground rumbled around me, and finally it calmed down. I got up, and looked around at the mess of string, and pencils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started venturing across the room, when I noticed she'd thrown a lot of things on the floor looking for me. She even threw her underwear down. I walked underneath one of her bras when it fell on top of me. At first my heart started racing, but I soon remembered that bra's were made of light weight material. I crawled under one edge, which made me remember something. Amanda was complaining about a mouse hole she found in her room.</span></div></div>",

I ran back to the pencil that almost fell on top of me, and started dragging it back to the folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached the binder, and wedged the pencil under the binder. It wasn't easy, but I got it pretty far under the folder. I ran over to the giant mounds of clothes, and began digging out socks. I grabbed about ten, and dragged them all over to the binder. Lastly I needed to find something hard. After searching through the room all I could find was a Barbie doll, at least twice my height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her arm and dragged her over to the pencil, and wedged her under the pencil. I then began layering the socks onto the end of the pencil. After about eight socks I'd created a big enough hole for me to climb under the binder, and into the mouse hole.

I ran, bolted away, but the mouse was way too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse made a roaring screech behind me which deafened me. It knocked me down, and grabbed me with it's teeth. It's two front teeth dug into my stomach and I screamed. The mouse ran off, and with every bobbing movement a shock of pain shot through my body. The mouse finally stopped, when it dropped me onto a large pile of sticks. I began to feel dizzy, and my body turned numb. Just then I felt a pain jolt through my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse devoured him piece by piece, until nothing remained.

I waited for her to look away, before I darted behind the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Amanda, and it seems she didn't see me.

She didn't. I reached the end of the couch, and looked around. Above me on the arm of the couch my mom's purse. I knew if I could reach it mom would find me, and I would be safe.

I sat on the glasses case after closing it, and waited for Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed a while Amanda came in through her door. \"I see your awake, good, now it's time for fun. If you want to eat this morning you'll have to complete your first task of the day.\" She sat her feet on the table, and placed a vile of nail polish next to me. I only knew this would take forever, but if I didn't complete the task I'd starve. I grabbed the brush, and pulled it out of the vile. \"Oh,\" Amanda added, \"If you get any of it on my toes, you don't get to eat, and still have to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful, I started to polish her toes. I made it about two toes in, before I had to re polish the brush. I pulled it out, and it dripped on me. My face covered, I propped up the brush so that I could wipe my face, while Amanda giggled at me. I grabbed the brush and continued this chore. As I neared the end of the first foot, I noticed she had very soft skin. I managed to use her toes as a chair, while I worked on another toe. This helped me avoid leaning over helping my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I got to the end of her second foot. She wiggled her toes while I took care of the brush which again dripped on me like ten times. She took her feet down, and looked at me laughing. Her echoing voice hurt my ears. I looked at her, and she handed me a cotton ball of nail polish remover. I pulled off a small hand ball, and started cleaning myself off. I couldn't get it all though, so Amanda wiped the rest. The fumes put me into a high, and I fell down several times. Just then Amanda placed food next to me, and left the room.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and said, \"Sorry, but I'm just too hungry to go to sleep.\" She held me above her face. I looked down at her gaping mouth, and reminded myself this was just a dream. She lowered my foot into her mouth, and she bit down... hard. I screamed in terror as she slowly chewed my foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'm used to taking small bites, you know that.\" She brought me above her again, and blood from my leg was splashing her face, and she just giggled. She lowered my leg back in up to the knee, and she bit it off. Another scream left my throat. I tried to kick free, but this became harder with one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be a dream, it just has to be.\" I cried Amanda just giggled, and caught my other foot in her mouth. She tore it off, and I couldn't even make a sound. She giggled, and said, \"Don't worry brother, this nightmare'll be over soon.\" She again lowered my leg in till the knee, and bit. I was crying, but everything began to get hazy. Soon I couldn't feel anything. pressure fell upon my waist, and soon I couldn't see, and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..............<br>\r\nAmanda continued to slowly pick at her brothers body until she finally chewed up his head and swallowed. \"ahh, that was delicious.\" She layed back down, and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Amanda cracked another smile, as her cat poked at me with it's paw. She started giggling as the cat knocked me down. She finally grew bored with the cat's muse, and picked me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel myself being raised into the air, as she made me eye level with her. She seemed amazed as she examined me from head to toe. I also took the moment to examine myself. I was still wearing my clothes, thank god, and I could tell my strength was but a fraction of what it used to be as I struggled to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda giggled as I struggled, and not only was it annoying, but quite deafening too. I looked up at my sister, and was amazed at how large she appeared. \"Oh my god!\" Amanda giggled again as my voice sounded so squeaky. I tried to pull my arms out to cover my ears but I couldn't. I looked back at my sister, and even though I'd been shrunken for a good amount of time now, I couldn't help but now realize just how frightening it really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked like she was thinking, and if I'd learned anything, that was bad. She lowered me, and slid me into the pocket of her skin tight pocket. I tried to move, but I was at a loss for breath, as I was crushed in her pocket with every move she made. She finally stopped for a moment, and I caught my breath. I looked up, and saw Amanda was talking to mom. I tried to scream, but Amanda leaned, crushing me in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took off again, and I was back to gasping for air. She finally pulled me out of her pocket, and dropped me on a hard surface. I caught my breath, and looked around. I was standing on her desk. I noticed she was gone, so I took the chance to look around. I couldn't believe how big the room was. It looked like a 20 foot drop to the floor. I sat on a pencil which was like a log to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda finally came back in, and she was holding...</span></div></div>",

Already tired, I ducked as the fork was coming right at me. The deafening sound of my sister's laughter came out, and I fell down.

I surfaced and realized the game had begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her spoon she grabbed a large portion of cereal from next to me.

I tried to swim away but she scooped us both up at the same time. I ran to the end of the spoon, and leaped off as she placed the spoon in her mouth, and chewed up the last of the coco puffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd landed on the table, and took a moment to catch my breath. Amanda must have thought she'd won, so I ran to my mothers plate. She was eating pancakes. I jumped up and down, when mom poured syrup onto the pancakes. A fork came down in front of me, and cut off a small piece of pancake from right in front of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to crawl away but the syrup was too thick. the fork came down next too me and tore off another huge chunk of pancake. I surface the syrup, and I heard my sister giggle. I looked over at her, and saw her looking right at me. \"What is it honey,\" mother asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing,\" she replied. I tried to run for it, but the fork was too fast. She cut off another large chunk of pancake.. with me on it. I tried to move, but the syrup was a trap. I watched as I was drawn closer to my mothers lips. I tried to scream, but syrup rolled over my head. Mom placed me in her mouth, and everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol chewed the small piece of pancake, and crushed her 'little' son in her mouth. \"I think there was a bug on that piece.\" Mother looked at her pancakes for another bug, but found none, and all the while Amanda giggled as she took care of her bowl.</span></div></div>",

The edge of the bowl came to her lips, and she started drinking it. I swam as hard as I could, but she'd drained my strength from pushing me around with the spoon. Her parted lips were a death sentence for all that entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swam and swam with all my might, but at this new size it didn't matter what I did. I slowly moved towards her lips, and all at once the last of the milk pulled me into her mouth.

Suddenly the roof pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made a quick survey, at least half the sandwich was gone. Amanda giggled, and place the top slice back on.

Then I was awaken by a loud zipping noise. \"Here he is.\" Amanda said, as a giant hand came at me. My entire body was being squeezed, and lifted high into the air. I looked around, to see I was outside surrounded by all of Amanda's friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, he so cute,\" they all chimed. I didn't know if I should be disgusted or complimented... Disgusted of course. Before too long I was being passed between all of the girls. Their giant hands kept cupping and squeezing me as I was being jerked one way to another. Finally a voice came, \"Hey, hey, not too much now, we don't want to scare him.Finally I was in one of the girls hands,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be hungry, here you go little fellah,\" I looked up to see Jen's face, and her other hand feeding me some lettuce. I reluctantly bit from it, and took the small piece of lettuce from her. I felt like a pet hamster as I fed off this leaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a hamster,\" said one of the girls. That thought made me chuckle inside I couldn't believe she said what I was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's eating it isn't he.\" said Jen. I finished the leaf, and again I was handed off, but this time to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who gets him?\" I looked at her in shock, how could she just hand me off like that, besides I'm sure Mom will wonder where I've gone after a day or too. I hope. The girls all wanted me of course, for what ever twisted Idea they had going. Finally Amanda put an end to their loud chirping as to who should get me, and pulled some grass leaves to play straws.</span></div></div>",

Once were in her room I found even a pencil to be the size of a log, and then my sister made me sleep in a hamster cage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tell you it was the strangest dream, and I know it will all be over when I wake... up......<br>\r\nI awoke in a moving environment. I opened my eyes, but everything was dark. I must be in the car cause there was a large bump out of nowhere. As I landed, I realized I was underneath some cloth like material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to climb my way out, but we hit another bump. I was soon buried even deeper in the clothy material. I tried to climb out, but my leg was wrapped with something, so I just waited where I was. As I waited I tried to figure out where I was. I felt around, but all I could feel were different clothy materials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything came too a halt, and then to a start again. \"You have fun sweety,\" came a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will mom,\" replied my sister. I finally figured it out. I was in my sister's backpack, and I was wrapped somewhere in her clothes. I listened to figure out where she was going, listening for any familiar voice.</span></div></div>",

Just last week she was over, and I walked through the room, she was watching me the whole way through. I felt my surroundings again, when I realized I was tangled in with a bra! Worrying what Amanda would think I began untangling the cord from my leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got half way through the tangle I heard a loud and quick, loud, zipping noise. A giant hand reached in and raised me to my sisters face, the bra dangling from my leg. She gasped, then looked at me with a pout when Carly blurted out, \"Wait, can you make him smaller, like half his current size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but why?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Carly jested. Amanda looked at me, and I cried no, but she obviously didn't care. I fell, and Amanda caught me in the bra's left cup. I tried to get up, but Amanda's shaky hands made it hard to stay balanced. I looked over to Carly, and she was taking off her bra. Now I'd realized what was happening, and tried to talk Amanda out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could start, Amanda handed me over to Carly, and she raised me towards her left breast. She had C cup breasts, which were almost disproportionate to her miniscule body. The Bra cup pressed firm against her breast, almost crushing me. It was hard to breath but I managed. After a moment I heard them speaking, \"Wanna go jump on the trampoline,\" I heard Carly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sounded pouty, \"I don't know, I thought we could work on our dance routine.\"</span></div></div>",

I caught my breath, but I knew it wouldn't last long, as music started up. \"I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world,\" I hate that song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy neusea came back before she even started bobbing again. As the dance carried on my head was spinning from the low amount of oxygen I was able to recieve, the constant bobbing, and the extremely loud music pounding on my eardrums. It was soon that I finally puked all over. Now I had to deal with the all that, and puke covering most of my body, and rubbing up against this giant mound of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long I started moving away from the puke. I'd realized that her breast was getting sweaty, and it was lubricating my decent. Now instead of bobbing around, I was bouncing around at the bottom of her bra cup. Bouncing and flopping, I ended up hanging on to her bra for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a few quick movements, and I was falling. I'd caught onto her belt, but hip movements kept me from holding on for long. Still falling, I grabbed her pocket, and was on a quick journey to the floor. Once there I was stunned, but I managed to pick myself up. I looked up at the two giant titans, and found that I was right in the middle of their duet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging left and right I could barely keep up. A large white clothe landed straight in front of me sending me flying. I landed a few feet away, and realized that the music had stopped. I watched one of the pairs of gigantic feet leave.</span></div></div>",

I realized that now, they may not even recognize me thinking that I was dead, so I decided it best to run for my life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carly, what song should we practice next?\" Amanda had called to Carly, who hm'd before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm gonna go clean him up before we dance though, make sure he doesn't stain.\" Her response turned cold in my heart, but I just kept running. I looked back for but a second as I saw the titaness towering towards me. I kept my pace, but was growing tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping away as best I could I was running for cover underneath a potted plant. I could hear the thunderous thumping of her foot as she was walking. The sound became louder and louder. Eventually I began slowing down. A great shadow appeared around me, and I tripped, hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carly crushed John, she slowly grinded him into the ground as she turned to enter the next room. Continuing on her way she got to a sink, and wiped the puke off of her bra. Standing there for a moment she turned around, and leaned against the counter saying, \"Too bad he got crushed, I wanted to keep him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

For some reason despite the fact I was being crushed by an enormous girls left breast I was able to wonder how girls of this age were as perverted as they were. The bouncing would change from better to worse, until eventually they took a moment to rest. Taking the moment to catch my breath I listened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still wanna jump?\" asked Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" Replied Carly. Preparing for the worse I got a good breath in while I could. The bouncing started up again, but I was starting to shift position. Almost falling I tried to secure a position in the bra, but her breast was breaking my grip. Carly giggled, and then I was out of her bra, holding on to the edge. I held on as hard as I could, but at my new size, the amount of force being applied, I was unable to hold. Falling I tried to avoid any limbs striking me. I hit the ground, and bounced up, making me throw up. I hit the ground again, and again, till I lost conciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\nAs the girls bounced around they giggled at the little boy bouncing with them. The boy gave of feint noises but they were laughing too hard to hear. Finally one of the girls tried to land next to him, but her soft foot came down directly on the little boy. They took a moment to get a hose, and clean off the trampoline, then continued to play.</span></div></div>",

Remembering that they were having a conversation, I listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go get some Polly Pocket toys were saying.\" Amanda said. They were off. Most of what they were talking about was just boring girl talk, but I did take a moment to try and figure out what was wrapped around me. I felt around, and felt the materials, and realized it was her bra. I realized that if she caught me like this I'd be so screwed. I started crawling my way out, but I couldn't get it off of me. Working my way out, I finally managed to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I got free, when everything around me started to fall. With an abrupt halt, I fell into the mess, and was tangled up again.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a story about a boy named John who is shrunken by his sister who is a premature witch. Quickly discovered by her, he finds himself being tossed around on an adventure being traded between his sister and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story was meant to be used to help satisfy many fetish needs. Not everyone agrees with my style of writing so I say if you don't like it, you don't have to read it, and I don't need to hear about how you hate the story, unless you actually have some constructive critisism for me. For those who are interested in giving me advice, or believe that I can improve a chapter, and how, feel free to contact me at Sashima8@yahoo.com. You can also talk to me personally by the Aim name Sashimo7. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story contains many fetishes, most revolving around shrunken men. These fetishes include feet, mini-giantess, breast smothering, vore, unbirth, crush, and if you find another one that you know about and wish to tell me I'll be happy to add it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are only interested in one or just a couple of these fetishes, you can visit the story outline, and I'll be identifying the endings by the fetish they represent. I hope that while navigating this story you don't feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo I'll be introducing the characters of my story. If you are paying attention though, you may find that I havn't actually included chapters with all of the presented characters yet. I merely put them on here so you have something to look forward too. I apologize if this angers anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn: The main character of the story. One day sitting on the couch watching tv, he is shrunk by his sister. As time goes by he is traded between his sister and her friends, trapped to their wills doing whatever they want him to. His only hope is to return to his original size before it's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda: The main secondary character of the story, her opinion of John is changed by his actions. From murderous to loving, she can face many mood swings. She in turn is the fate decider of our main character no matter how childish she acts, and how little she truly understands about what she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: John's Mother, unaware of his current state, she provides many opurtunities for john to be killed, or maimed in ways she'd never imagined. Disappearing from main story line for a while, she makes an eventual return accepting the fact her son no longer lives...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny: A minor character in the story, she is always providing a threat to John. There's not much to be said about this cat yet, except that she's always hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly: Carly has a huge crush on John, but she is mature for her age. Whenever around her, she tries to turn John on with her underdeveloped attempt at sexual intamacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley: Ashley has always hated John. whenever around her it's only one peril after another as he tries to escape her vicious cluches to the safety(?) of Amanda's hands. Ashley comes up with fun and exciting ways for our character to be tested in his survival skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen: Always insecure, she has been given John to carry for a while, but depending on John's reaction to this event, she can either learn to love, or despise his very existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: Always the strange on of the group, Amy has been friends with Amanda for some time. Whenever she gets the chance to hold John, it's just another limit test of his strength, and intellect. Placing John in potentially life threatening situations she makes for an interesting character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea: Andrea has been on vacation for sometime, but upon her return she is introduced to our one and only main character John. As it turns out, Andrea is an adventurer, and collecter of various animals, and John has just been put on the top of the list. In her quest to tame John, she grows emotions to which may force him into a new life, or even end it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally: Andrea's pet dog, she plays a more dramatic role in our main characters journey. Giving him rides around the house, she allows John to hide from his giant captor. Only one problem occurs... Won't she come if she's called?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTricia: Amanda's teacher who has always taken a liking to her students, al little too much of a liking. Having discovered John in Amanda's confiscated purse, she takes him home to make him her personal toy. John soon gets trapped in her house on a rampaging path to sexual destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice: A true to life scientist, Alice discovers Amanda and her friends playing with John. She immediately begins taking notes on his actions, stalking him wherever he goes. Finally able to capture him, she puts him in a controlled environment where she will finish studying his behavior before she is finally done with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy: A shoe store clerk, she finds John trapped in a shoebox that was left out. Keeping him inside she takes him to the back room where she decides to keep him for her own pleasures. Once she gets home, she keeps the shoebox as an easy way to transport, and keep him sealed. Her common way of interacting with him is not always with her face or hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: Her true purpose in the story is to satisfy those who have a desire to see some giantess, and sm action. She enjoys using him to probe, and explore everypart of her body, inside and out. While John only has one goal... Survive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: During John's great escape he is captured by this busty bug collector. She takes him back and places him in a terrarrium where she can document his various activities, and actions as he tries to stay alive. However, John has other plans than to end up pinned to a board in her basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you enjoy my story, I have spent much time writing it, and plan to eventually reach the ending of this hopefully gigantic story. </td>",
