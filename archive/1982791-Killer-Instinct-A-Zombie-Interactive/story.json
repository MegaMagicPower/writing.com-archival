            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary stayed up late last night, celebrating the new franchise with his Uncle Joe. He didn't have anything to drink (because he's responsible), so no nasty hangovers to deal with. Anyhow, Gary was oh-so-rudely awakened by his neighbor's car alarm going off. He glanced over at his alarm clock to see that it was five-thirty-three. <br>\r\n\"Great, I got four hours of sleep...\", Gary stated groggily.<br>\r\nHe shuffled over to the bathroom and took his morning pee, very satisfyingly, I might add. (what, I'm just the narrator, don't judge...) He looked at the mirror while he washed his hands and saw a very stupefied man looking back at him. The car alarm outside continued to blare unrelentingly.<br>\r\nGary walked down the hall to the kitchen of his double-wide trailer. He flicked on the coffee pot and started to brew his life blood. He turned around to face the front window only to see someone wandering around in his cousin Jill's garden. Jill stumbled out of her bedroom looking just as annoyed and dazed as he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary pointed with his chin toward the man stepping all over her tomato patch.<br>\r\n\"What!\", Jill exclaimed<br>\r\n\"The man looks drunken, I'd leave him be. Tomatoes can grow back, but at our age, teeth cannot.\", said Gary calmly<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", Jill agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee pot started to bubble just as she closed her mouth. The both stumbled toward the cupboard where the mugs are kept, eager to get their caffeine fix. The alarm outside ceased as soon as Jill finished pouring her coffee.<br>\r\n\"Cool, we can enjoy our coffee in peace.\", said Jill<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of sipping and sighing Jill broke the silence with, \" Did my dad keep you up long?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, only until one-o'-clock.\", Gary replied<br>\r\n\"Dang, he mustn't have been very coordinated once you brought him home.\", Jill cracked<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, we're Irish are we not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed and made jokes until they both sipped down two mugs. Gary and Jill had been close friends since seventh grade, when Jill lost her mother. <br>\r\n\"You don't have to work today, do you?\", asked Jill<br>\r\n\"No, everyone gets a week off while your father sets up the new franchise\"<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how that drunk is doing.\", stated Jill<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll go check on him.\", said Gary as he made his way to the glass pane facing the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked toward the tomatoes he saw that the man was no longer in the garden, but was even closer to the house.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, the guy got closer!\", exclaimed Gary<br>\r\nWhen Gary shouted to Jill, the drunken man looked strait at Gary, seeming to be alerted by the raise in voice. Gary looked closer at the man, using the slowly rising sun to make something out... blood on his face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, that guy has blood on his face, what the heck is up with him?\", Jill asked worriedly<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I think we should let that guy be, maybe call the cops or something.\", Gary replied calmly<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\", Jill exclaimed as the walked toward her smart phone on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the phone and dialed \"0\" for operator, the dial tone rang out just before that robotic woman said, \" I'm sorry, lines are full right now, try hanging up and calling back at a later time\"<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Apparently lines are full, that doesn't happen in New Hampshire...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, especially not for the emergency line...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard a banging on the window and turned to see the drunk man smacking on the glass with his arm. They both stepped back in shock. <br>\r\n\"Get behind me, Jill!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't have to tell me twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary slowly walked backwards to his room, where he keeps his handgun, Jill mimicked his pace and did the same. When they both were through the doorway to his room Gary slammed the door shut. He walked to the nightstand next to his bed and took out the 9 mm pistol that was stored there. Gary slid the clip in and pulled back the slide.<br>\r\n\"Stay here, I'll make him get away from our house.\", Gary said as he picked up the wrench from his tool belt on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary walked out of his bedroom to see that the drunk had slammed on the window enough for it to have spider-cracked, a couple more hits and that window would be in pieces.<br>\r\n\"Back away from the window!\", Gary commanded<br>\r\nThe drunk continued to slam on the glass.<br>\r\n\"Back away from the window or I will be forced to shoot you!\"<br>\r\nThe final fist hitting the window caused it to shatter and fall to the ground, setting off the house alarm. This caused Gary to jolt and pull the trigger, it hit the drink in the chest, sending it backwards. <br>\r\n\"Oh, crap!\", Gary shouted, realizing that he had just shot a man<br>\r\nThe man seemed to be barely jaded by this shard of metal piercing into his cardiovascular-control-center.<br>\r\n\"What the?\"<br>\r\nThe drunk proceeded to lift himself into the window and head towards Gary. Gary pulled the trigger, this time aiming higher, sending a bullet into the drunk's head. The former drunk's body fell to the dining floor, causing a blood puddle to form on the beige carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill ran out of the bedroom to see what had happened. Gary stood there, in shock of just taking someone's life.<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that!\", cried Jill<br>\r\n\"I warned him...\", Gary replied in a sort of trance state<br>\r\n\"Oh, God... what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I dunno... call the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited a minute only to hear the robotic voice telling you there is no help coming.<br>\r\n\"Dang it!\", Gary shouted<br>\r\n\"Seriously... what do we do?\", Jill asked, almost in tears</span></div></div>",

'Joe would know what to do,' Gary thought, 'and besides, Jill and I need to know what's going on.'<br>\r\n \"C'mon, let's go to Joe's,\" Gary signals Jill. They exit the home not bothering to do anything about the body, or even locking the house. They proceed to walk to the driveway. \"I can't see a thing,\" complains Jill. \"Wait a sec...\" Gary left off. He looked into the darkness...their car is gone. \"Somebody took the car,\" Gary angrily states. \"What the...hell?\" Jill says in disbelief as a car, with it's passenger door open with all indoor lights on revealing a gruesome mess in the cabin, rolls down the street in front of the house. It stops as it slams into a lamp post. The headlights reach out into the darkness in front of the couple. \"Oh my god,\" says Gary.<br>\r\n A human form sits in the light over a body of a man. It is disturbed by the light and turns around. Jill gasps as she comprehends that this..person is eating parts of the body. She notices that the creature's body is decomposing. The creature snarls at the two as it stands, with it's innards pouring out of the gaping hole in it's stomach. Gary raises the firearm and fires one shot into the temple of the creature's head. Wit great accuracy too, as his Army training has taught him well. \"Just like the movies,\" breathes Gary. \"W-w-hat?\" stammers Jill in shock. \"Remember Dawn of the Dead, Jill?\" questions Gary. \"Are you implying that that thing is a zombie?\" retorts Jill shakily. \"Well, it's falling apart and was eating someone.\" bluntly states Gary. Jill stares at Gary with wide eyes. \"Listen , i'm scared like hell too, but we need to stay calm and get to Joe's before more show up. I know he seems like sane man, but he's one of those doomsday nuts who prepare for something like this. He'll help. Now let's go before any more things show up,\" Gary spoke. \"S-s-s-aid that t-t-oo soon,\" stumbles Jill as multiple \"zombies\" surround them. \"Run,\" says Gary.</span></div></div>",

A fresh hire to Channel 8 News, it was her first story. Eastbrook Cemetery had been hit last night. Over a dozen headstones were tipped over, broken in half, bits of concrete scattered over the well manicured lawn. Worse though, were the bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were missing. A dozen in all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's longcoat flapped against her legs as she stood, waiting for the camera crew to start filming. In her mind played the predetermined talking points she was supposed to say once the cameras were rolling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Local Cemetery vandalized...<br>\r\n...thousands of dollars in damage to grave markers...<br>\r\n...disturbing individuals removed bodies from their graves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last one stuck with Leah, and she didn't believe it. For even now, as she stood looking down at one such grave, she couldn't help but notice how the hole was conical, how there was no way an outside force could have exhumed a dozen bodies in a single night. The muddied footsteps that led AWAY from the grave, but none leading up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leah, you ready?\" It was Matt, her camera guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said distractredly. She brushed down her jacket, adjusted her ear piece and held the microphone close to her mouth. When Matt gave the signal, she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late last night, a local cemetery proved the site of a malicious vandalization. Headstones, flower vases, pictures and mementos, smashed and scattered. But such random destruction pales in comparison to what local authorities have recently divulged. At least twelve bodies have been removed from their graves by the would-be vandals. So far, Authorities are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah stopped mid sentence when she saw Matt's horrified expression on his face. His mouth hung open in disbelief, eyes unblinking. With one trembling hand, he pointed behind her. Leah, gulping, slowly turned and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
