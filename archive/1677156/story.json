You been hearing on the news for a few days about grisly murders of someone eating or biting another human being, but you didn't give it much thought cause there's a lot of wackos out there. You just thought it was just one of them kind of people. While you were lost in thought you see another person stumbling along the dimly lit streets and see he's not normal for his clothes are tattered and torn and there's a gash that barley bleeding when it should be gushing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You see him start running into the alley and you follow him. You see a homeless person drinking a bottle of whiskey and all of the sudden the guy you were following started sprinting towards him and the homeless person notices and tries to outrun but only ends in vain as the guy jumped on top of him and started eating the person alive. The homeless person was stronger than you thought and threw the guy off but suddenly started having a seizure and died right there. You ran afraid the guy would chase and you kick a can while running and he starts chasing you. He jumps on you and woke up in a sweat and realized you were being haunted of the scene you saw a month before the infection. You look out your window in the safe house and see it's daylight when the less zombies are about and saw some of the other survivors some planning on moving to another town while others started rebuilding the barrier and had to choose between two things.</span></div></div>",

Your phone lights up with a notification. Last house of the night. Maybe these folks won't be too drunk or stoned to open up and give you a few bucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last house of the night is a normal-looking suburban place with two floors. All the lights on the inside look off which is never a good sign. You sigh and walk up to the porch with their order: three cheese pizzas and a meat lover's special with a side of garlic bread. Annoyed, you knock on the door. No response. So you knock again and again, pissed off that you missed on a tip. As you get ready to leave and decide to take the food with you, you hear a growling from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You pause at the porch. They don't want to open up and now they're making sounds at you? \"Hey! Open up this door...\" Another growl is heard through the door.

You shivered at the thought, the damn news would air anything these days just to bring in ratings. You turn the next corner and switch on the radio, flipping through the channels of static until you come to a station playing \"Whiskey Hangover\" by Godsmack. There was minimal static on this one so you decided to leave it on. \"Maybe they'll play some newer songs soon.\" You say to yourself as you look out the side window. On the other side of the street is a group of people standing over a collapsed teenager with blood on her face. \"Oh Jesus...\" You say as you stop at the corner and turn off the truck. You check your watch, your supposed to be at work in another hour. \"Phew, I still have plenty of time, good thing I got up early this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your raincoat and step out into the downpour, careful to avoid stepping in the growing puddles of water as you make your way over to the crowd. \"Did anyone call an ambulance?\" You stutter as you stop next to a fat man with an umbrella. \"No good.\" A woman said as she checked the girls pulse. \"She's dead.\" No sooner had the words left her lips then the girl sat up straight, her eyes lifeless and unmoving. \"My god! Its a miracle!\" The woman shouted as the crowd began to cheer. \"She's alive!\" Their celebration was cut short, however, when the girl bit into the woman's arm with a furious growl. \"Eeeeekkkk! Get her off me!\" The woman screamed as the group of people began to back away. \"Shit!\" You yell as you stumble out into the street. The woman begins sobbing softly as the skin is slowly peeled from her arm by the monster. \"H-help me...\" She choked out as blood covered her dress.

Your hand soon touches something metallic and you pull it out. In your hands is the shiny silver revolver you thought you'd never have to use. You get out, slam the door back, and run back over to the scene of the attack. The woman has passed out from blood loss at this point and the teenage girl is now chewing the meat off her arm. You close your eyes and point the gun, your hands shaking as try to pull the trigger. \"I don't think I can do this...\" You think silently to yourself, but fate had other plans in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun went off before you could even comprehend what was happening. A red dot appeared on the girls chest that quickly began growing into a large red spot on her sweater. She released the woman and got up with a savage growl. You start to feel really scared now and fire off another shot. This one hit her in the neck, severing a huge blood vessel and causing ever more blood to run down her pale and lifeless body. \"How can you still be standing?!\" You shout as you fire a third shot at her head. The bullet pierced her left eye and lodged itself into her brain. She let out a groan and fell into the cold street unmoving, she was dead. \"Oh... my god...\" You gasped as you lowered the gun to your side. Was it over? You turned to walk back to your truck when another growl shatters the silence. The woman had gotten up, shredded arm and all, and was advancing on you with frightening speed. What now?</span></div></div>",

Lets have a fun day today.\" You cheerfully chant and walk off the elevator and walked about making funny faces at the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like any other day, reading stories, playing games and making the kids happy. As the day drew later and a few of the kids have left but still many that would of been gone still remained, you seemed bothered by something. A fellow worker said on his break he saw on the tv in the break room that there was a report of riots in the streets. \"Don't worry children your parents will be along for you.\" You called out to break the awkward feeling that was starting to grow from the children. It was now eight pm and a hand full of kids where still there at the most three hours past the normal pick up time.

The familiar chime came before the doors slowly opened, but only to unveil a scene that made everyone's stomachs drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the small compartment of the elevator, the walls where covered in blood. And in the middle of it all was a woman kneeling over a man that two of the kids recognized. It was their mother and father, and the father's body started to twitch as the kids called out to them. The mother looked over at the care taker with empty eyes and her mouth dripping with blood from her husband's shoulder where she was biting him. \"Shit, Run.\" He yelled and in a flash the lady leaped at him and tackled him to the ground as you picked up the little girl by me and ran for the emergency exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back as you was running you saw her eating my coworker and friend. The two kids where running to their mother only to have the father get up and grab one of them. The other care taker tried to help but quickly all of them fell to what ever it was that caused the parents to become this way. \"Cover your eyes and don't watch.\" you told the girl as you carried her through the door and started down the stairs that lead to the parking lot. you had parked right in the spot next to the door and today you was grateful for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to them pounding on the door above as we made it to the bottom and out into your car, you realized that they are not able to open doors so they try and smash their way into things. \"Hold on.\" you told the girl after putting both our seat belts on. you started driving with only one place in mind, that be your house which was across the street from a mall that was recently closed down for construction. Stores still had merchandise inside and you where helping a friend that owned a store inside move his stuff so had a key to get in. you lived alone so it would be safe.</span></div></div>",

Instinctively you cover the girls eyes but you wish someone was there to cover yours. The man had milky-white eyes that were blank and expressionless. His nose and jaw where bent to the left. His bottom jaw was dangling from bone but he still managed to hold a bloody peace of flesh in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only see his face from the window. You took the girls hand and lead her further down the hall. Suddenly you stopped dead in your tracks. A scream echoed through the hall. A woman's voice. She sounded like she was around fifteen or sixteen. So much pain was put in this scream. You took the girl by the back of her shirt and ducked behind a decorative potted plant. You heard something fall over and the breaking of glass. The girl next to you made a series of weird noises. She made a gulping noise and blinked rapidly. You put your hand over her mouth as you heard foot steps coming closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK. A gunshot echoed. You kept you and the girl hidden under the pot. A deep rumble filled the hall. What cruel laughter. \"Come on out.\" his voice boomed \"Don't keep me waiting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and see him. His dark hair covered one eye and a bandana covered his mouth and nose. He was wearing a gray hoody and saggy jeans. An M-16 rifle was in his hands and a knife was on his belt. \"Why don't you come with me and meet my friends?\"     </span></div></div>",

I took one of her tiny hands in mine. Her hand was already stained in tears. We stood, slowly and he walked over to us. <br>\r\n        \"Good,\" he said, \"I didn't have to shoot you.\" You gulped and thought about the scream of a girl you heard earlier. It was this guy. He killed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The man walked behind us and I could feel the warm metal of his gun on my back. He told us to move and hesitantly I pulled the girl along with me. On the way he talked to us. It was weird but it seemed like this felt natural to him. He told us about how him and his buddies where going to turn this mall into a place to live. They already had a prison and a place to live. They lived inside of a book store and when they were hungry, would make food from places in the food court. He had four friends with him and three prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Walking along the hall we ran into a dead girl, She was 16 with blonde hair with a bullet wound straight through her left eye. Flies where already buzzing on her empty socket. The man never even looked at her. Further along we came to a closed gate of a salon and spa. <br>\r\n        \"All right, this is where the girl goes.\" He said lifting the gate. There where three sad figures slumped against a tanning bed. The man grabbed her hair and threw her inside. She fell to the ground and cried. Then you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Turning to the man you punched him square in the face and struggled for his gun. He gained the upper hand and knocked you back with his gun. He turned the gun and aimed it at you, <br>\r\n        \"Sorry, man.\" He said. As soon as you where about to be shot a black hulking figure came from the spa and tackled the man to the ground. His gun flew and landed far away from him.<br>\r\n        \"She was my friend,\" The figure whispered as it's hands wrapped around the man's neck. \"And you shot her,\" The figure's harsh raspy voice said as he chocked the life out of the man. Standing the Figure spoke again...    </span></div></div>",

Jackson looked like he wanted to protest but she pointed again, and he gave in, looking very bored. <br>\r\nTo avoid attracting the dead, she called up quietly for Amelia. \"Mom!\" <br>\r\nNo response. She called again, slightly louder. \"Mom!\"<br>\r\nFinally, she heard footsteps on the stairs, but if was only Andy. \"Andy,\" Renee said, eyes still on Jackson. \"Go wake up Mom, we have an intruder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, her family had established that Jackson was not a threat. He had no weapons, food, or much of anything, save the lockpick and clothes on his back. However, with Amelia being the kind mother<br>\r\nto all, she invited him to stay with the three of them. <br>\r\nAndy clearly disapproved of this and protested, \"No way! Mom, have you SEEN the Walking Dead?\" The two looked to her, and once again, it was her choice. This scavenger, while he was rather handsome, clearly wanted to stay, but should he? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was walking my kid sister home from her softball game.  Izzy's team, the Cower Bold Eagles, had lost.  Again.  She was mumbling about bad teamwork and poor stamina.  I rolled my eyes.  She was so into her softball games and basketball games and volley ball games.  But she could do more than I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm NOT  a sports person.  But I do do something most people think I'm crazy for.  Free-style fighting.  My dad doesn't have enough money to get me into any real classes for Karate and what not, so one day my best friend, Jamie, and I just started fooling around with a broken pipe at the side of an old abandoned building.  Soon we got stronger, more agile, and before we knew it, we were spilling the beans to all of our friends and family and classmates.  Then one day a bunch of kids all younger, the same age, and older than us came up to where we were \"training\" and said that they wanted in the fun as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway.  Back to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting dark beyond reasoning-no, I mean really.  Even in the night, NYC doesn't get that dark.  It's because of all of the street lights and apartment lights and all.  Not many of the street lamps were on.  And, to be perfectly honest, I got kind of nervous.  I mean, it's NEW YORK, for the love of God.  You hear about people being murdered and raped and mugged all the time here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not only that, but recently there have been strange killings going on the sides of the Big Apple.  More unnatural than usual.  Like people getting scalped and stuff like that.  One morning while I was eating a bowl of Jack's, there was a purple-and-green elderly man that was found in a dumpster-PURPLE AND GREEN! How often do you hear about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Izzy wasn't afraid, or even if she was, she wasn't showing it.  \"Hey, can we go to Lower's?  I want to say hi to Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. Chris was Izzy's illegal boyfriend.  She wasn't supposed to be dating anyone, according to law set by our father.  She always met the punk at different, shady places.  And the reason why she wanted to go to Lower's was because she knew that was the local Goth hang out.  \"No,\" I said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!  WHY?!\"  she screamed, and I was pretty much positive that the whold west side of NYC could have heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"  I hissed.  \"Reason number one:  I have studying to do tomorrow for that major social studies test that determins my fate.  Reason number two:  It's late and Dad would kill me if he knew that I took you to some shady place like Lower's.  And Reason number. . . ,\"  I stopped, knowing that I shouldn't go on anymore, less my little sister and I have a full on war.  She was already fuming behind me, giving me a look that could kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" she beckoned in a voice that I knew was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed.  \"And reason number three:  Chris is NOT good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy was quiet for a moment, but then she spoke, her temper rising.  \"What do you mean, 'he's not good for me'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, Chris is a boy who has 'trouble' written all over his face.  He's shady, has robbed a good number of banks according to you, has mugged one more person than necessary, and besides that, you're starting to act like a little brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, first of all, I am NOT a little BRAT!  Second, Chris is sweet and talented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes.  \"Yeah.  Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!  Look, you don't know him like I do, alright?!  And since you DON'T know him like I do, I suggest that you just SHUT UP!\"  she screamed at me, slamming her Eagle cap down to the cement.  I watched, horrified, as she ran off into the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was exasperated.  it was a shame that Izzy wasn't as smart as I.  Our little apartment was to the east, and Lower's was to the west.  Or course she would be going there.  So I took off running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really have that much of a fair advantage.  I was sixteen, had longer legs, and I was pretty much trained to run like hell any time I needed to-Jamie and I had taken our training pretty seriouly a couple of times.  Izzy was only a softball/basketball/volley ball player.  And even though they all required fast running, she was never the FASTEST.  So I knew I could catch her.  And I was soon gaining on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seen her long blonde hair fall into sink with the rest of her body as she rounded the corner.  Suddenly she ran into a tall, big man.  My feet stopped running almost immediately, and I was only a few meters away.  Izzy was flat on her ass, wiping dust from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she got up.  \"I-I'm sorry, sir,\" she mumbled shamelessly.  \"I didn't mean to.  Can I help you with anything?\"  I smiled in spite of myself.  Despite her ornery to me and my friends, she was nice to complete strangers.  Oh well.  At least she knew her manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, however, the man she had run into did not.  He just stood there.  He was in the shadows, so I could only see his silhoutte.  The man was big, muscular.  The kind of guy that could crush an alligator's mouth in one fell swing.  I gulped.  There were a lot of villians in the Big Apple.  Could that man be one of them?   I pondered that.  Everything in me screamed to turn, run, run as fast as I could and get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't do that.  I was a big sister of Izzy, and it was my responsibility to take care of her, no matter how much I thought that she had bad taste in men.  \"Izzy,\" I said, cautionly.  \"We need to go now.  Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, and we both ran.  As fast as we could.  But suddenly I felt a hard knock to the back of my neck, and Izzy and I were both on the ground.  I looked over.  The man had missed his target on me, but had succeede in knocking my little sister out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage boiled inside of my belly.  No one touched my family.  NO ONE.  Not sense Mom died.  I did a flip and landed back on my feet, protective of Izzy on the ground.  I crouched, ready to fight if need be. But then I gasped, and everything I had ever been tought or had tought myself let my memory bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was a greenish-gray color, with his skin peeling off in certain places.  His torso was red with faded blood, and his pants were scratched from stumbling.  He had yellow eyes, and looking into them, I could tell that he had no emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only gap.  Was this a. . . a. . . zombie. . . ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head in frustration.  \"No, no, there's no such thing as zombies!  Idiot!  Get a hold of yourself!\"  I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I run without Izzy, stay and help, or run with her?\"  I asked myself.  I looked down at Izzy's unconcious body.  Could I really leave her a lone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. . . .  I could never leave her a lone.  Or can I?\"</span></div></div>",

Your face turned bright red and you accidently tightened your grip on your sister's hand which made her turn her head to look. \"Sis isn't that the thing you have.\" She openly stated as she pulled her hand from yours and started to walk towards the window. \"Yeah you have this one, I saw you with it the other night.\" She continued making you lower your head and look away as you felt your face get so red you thought you was going to die. \"You thought I was asleep but I saw you using it on yourself, you looked like you was really liking it.\" Her cheeks where starting to turn red them self as she thought about when she saw you and she felt her body starting to feel warm as you felt like you was on fire with embarrassment and arrousment knowing she saw you. \"Please teach me how to use these.\" She openly stated making you drop to your knees as you took deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sis, that is a grown up thing, you don't want that.\" You coughed as you was trying to control your self under this situation. \"You want to go to the arcade right?\" You asked trying to change the topic before feeling her grabbing your hand and you turn to see her blushing at you as you was blushimg back. \"What wrong?\" Yo asked trying not to know as she reached in your gown's pocket and took your father's master key chain off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I want you to show me, seeing these here and remembering how you was using it is making me warm inside and more so down here.

The two of you had gotten everything you needed and had set it all up. There was a fridge for drinks and another one for food. There was also freezers and tvs. Games and chairs along with tents and beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally everything was fine and your sister walked over to you and smiled as she blushed and pointed towards the sex shop showing that she had not forgotten.

I rarely see you this focused on things outside of games.\" You sighed and started to head into the store with her and she was looking at everything while you was browsing and looking at the toys trying to see what you would start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you took a few corded eggs and a double end dido.  Taking a deep breath you removed your pants and your sister was watching with fixes eyes as her face was getting redder. She watched you pull open the waist band of your underwear and slide te first egg in and rest it on the out side of your crotch before closing your underwear and turning the control on. You whimpered at the vibrations and you sister watch you go deep red and moan to the feeling. You get up and walk over closer to her and sit in front of her before pulling her skirt up and her underwear open to do the same to her.

Her body shivering as you held her and kissed her. After  bit of the two of you rubbing your crotches against each other you pushed the second egg inside you making you moan out in pleasure.

You might hurt yourself if you expand it to far to fast.\" You told her for you remember that is in the instructions of the inflatable dildo you bought last month, but been to afraid to use yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She pouted before gasping a moan as she climaxed and panted.  She was reaching down to turn the eggs off but felt you pump more air in her by accident for you took it away from her after she pulled it fully back. You pumped it by mistake for you heard her moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" You said as she just looked with her flustered cheeks and smiled as she took the pump back and slowly got up before running off into the arcade. You shook your head and looked around at all the secular toys that she sneaked off and gathered while you was asleep still. You just shook your head for she pulled out many different random toys. You went about picking up a pair of underwear that had a vibrating but plug as well as an inflatable dildo in the front.you slowly took your underwear off and slipped that one on. Gasping and moaning as the toys entered you. You turn them on to their lowest settings and went about whimpering as you was making cereal for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Wiping the tears from your eyes you stands up and when your sister opens her mouth to speak you silence her with a finger to your lips. Slowly the two of you creep deeper into the mall, a handful of lights on for security reasons provide just enough light for you to see where your going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk past the banner and balloons and stages in the middle of construction for the mall grand opening you start to hear voices in the distants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on&lt; what are those things?\" one voice said and was answered by another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know and I don't want to know, now stop talking and help me move this shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your sister reach the stairs near one of the other entrances and you motion your sister to stay low as you peek around the stairs and see two men moving furniture from one of the store in front of one of the door that is missing the glad from it, near the broken window you see a pool of blood and outside of it lays a body of one of the crazy people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why are we hiding?\" your sister asks suddenly and in the stillness of the empty mall her voice echos slightly and you clamp your hand over your sisters mouth shushing her, but its to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou hear the sound of a heavy object drop on the floor. \"who's there? SHOW YOUR SELF!\" one of the men barks in your direction. you look for a way to hide or run but here isn't any that the men wont see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard you step out from behind the stairs with holding your sisters hand and you are staring down the barrel of a gun one of the men has aimed at you. \"Luke its just a couple of girls, put the gun away man.\" The other man says lowering his baseball bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck I will, how do we know they aren't like the rest of the bastards outside huh?\" The one called Luke replies the his eyes and gun never wavering from where they are pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow again and in a shaking voice you say. \"W-we aren't like those crazy people outside.....we're hiding from them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun remains aimed on you as you can see Luke is thinking about what you just said and after ten agonizing seconds that feel like an eternity he lowers the gun. \"then get your fucking asses over here and help us move this shit to block the door.\" he said putting the gun in a thigh holster.</span></div></div>",

I was walking, hands in pockets, to the theater for rehearsal when I saw it. I had made it to the corner of 5th and Broadway and had stopped dead in my tracks at the sight of it. It's skin was dusky. It was bleeding from horrible looking wounds and its eyes were sunken, bottomless pits. There was some skin peeling from the side of it's head. It looked like a walking corpse. As a horrible putrid stench wafted over me, I decided what this creature was...a zombie.  <br>\r\n      The zombie turned it's nose up into the air and gave three audible sniffs. Then it turned it's head toward a man that was leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette. The man glanced over from his perch on the wall and finally noticed the bloody, shambling, being walking toward him. He startled at the sight of it; eyes going as wide as saucers. True fear written across his face. He stood straight up, threw his cigarette to the ground, and took a step away from the wall. He looked like he was going to try to run. But before he could take another step, the zombie lunged for the man.   </span></div></div>",
