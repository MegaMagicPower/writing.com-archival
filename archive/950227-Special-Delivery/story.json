            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan Smith was a brilliant and highly respected research scientist who had been employed with EDL Labs for the past fifteen years. His work on several cholesterol drugs had been pioneering but his true passion always focused on a secret side project he had been nearly obsessed with for the past five years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd six months ago, he had achieved a nearly impossible breakthrough. Although generally accepted throughout academia as an impossibility, Bryan had developed a shrinking formula, and of course, an antidote. After an extremely light regiment of testing with lab animals, Bryan made the hasty decision to try the formula on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past three months, Bryan had shrunk and returned to normal size four times. Each experiment had been meticulously planned and thought out. Each time, Bryan shrunk himself to where he was only about one forth of an inch high. The intense rush was a high like he thought he could never experience. During one of the tests in his office at home, Bryan remained at the insignificant size of a quarter inch for nearly three hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was overwhelmed and fascinated as he explored the gargantuan objects throughout the vast, enormous room. He stared in complete awe at a simple pen that was lying on the floor. It seemed as large as a Boeing 747.  His desk seemed to extend up endlessly.  Even at a sprint, he could only cover small distances.  He figured it would take him a half day\u2019s hike to travel the office wall to wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could only imagine what it might be like to encounter a real person at such a minuscule size. A normal size person would appear colossal to him.  The thought of such an encounter began to consume Bryan\u2019s every waking hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was once again sitting at the kitchen table daydreaming about the next experiment with his shrinking formula, when the phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle B\u2026what\u2019s up?\u201d Bryan\u2019s nephew Zack was calling from California. \u201cJust checking up on you to make sure you havn\u2019t bored yourself to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet Zack,\u201d Bryan said with a chuckle. His job and life were normally very boring, but Zack had no idea of his uncle\u2019s recent discovery. \u201cHow\u2019s school going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better Uncle B.\u201d, Zack replied. \u201cThe weathers great, and there is so much to do. You gotta come out here and I\u2019ll show ya how to surf\u2026And, by the way, I love the Acura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan smiled. Since Zack\u2019s dad left when he was very young, Bryan had been like a father figure to his sister\u2019s son. Bryan was paying for his nephew\u2019s college, and had bought him an electric  blue Acura RSX for his high school graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I could Zack,\u201d Bryan responded with some disappointment. \u201cBut you know I can\u2019t get off work. I\u2019m glad you like the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never take vacations,\u201d Zack argued. \u201cWhat the hell are they going to do at EDL\u2026fire ya? You made that dum fuck company. Just take off this weekend and fly out here. I want you to meet my roommate anyway. He\u2019s one crazy dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack, you know I can\u2019t,\u201d Bryan tried to reason with his rambunctious nephew when suddenly a crazy idea filled his head. \u201cBut here is what I\u2019m going to do. I am going to send you something very special in the mail. Expect it in a couple days. Okay Zack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, unless you\u2019re in it, don\u2019t bother Uncle B.,\u201d Zack responded with sarcastic disappointment. Zack had always wished his uncle would spend a little more time with him instead of working all the time. But instead, his uncle just bought him anything he wanted. \u201cThere are some things more important than that fuckin job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Zack,\u201d Bryan tried to console his moody nephew. \u201cJust calm down. I think you will really like this. Be on the lookout. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever Uncle B.,\u201d Zack replied with the typically defiant tone of a teenager. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see ya at Christmas. Take care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s head spun with a fury of ideas and possibilities. Could he possibly do it? Was he daring enough? All rational had been replaced by sheer adrenalin. Yes! Yes! He would do it. He would shrink himself to the ridiculously small size of a quarter inch and mail himself to his nephew Zack in sunny California. He rushed to his office to get a yellow note pad. He would plan it all out perfectly to the smallest detail. If he did it just right, what could possibly go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knock on the door returned Bryan to a mild sense of reality, if only momentarily. Bryan went to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mr. Smith\u2026ya got any jobs for me?\u201d Tommy asked enthusiastically. \u201cI need to earn some cash for a rad new skateboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, the yard really doesn\u2019t need m\u2026.,\u201d Bryan began just as an incredible idea entered his head. No outline. No meticulous planning. Bryan was now going to wing it. \u201cAs a matter of fact Tommy, I have an extremely important job for you, and its going to pay really well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Tommy blurted out, unable to contain his enthusiasm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am going out of town tonight but I need a very important package mailed tomorrow,\u201d Bryan began unable to believe he was just making this up as he went along. \u201cShow up here at three o\u2019clock tomorrow and let yourself in. There will be a key under the mat. I\u2019ll leave the package on the kitchen table along with a hundred dollar bill. Take the package to the post office and mail it. And you can keep whatever\u2019s left over out of the hundred. Think you can handle that Tommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes sir!\u201d Tommy spoke hardly able to contain his excitement. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mr. Smith. You can count on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and make sure it goes overnight mail,\u201d Bryan added as Tommy began to walk away. Tommy shook his head okay still with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got some packing to do,\u201d Bryan thought to himself. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going on a vacation.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Bryan quickly calculated that at his reduced height of about a quarter inch, the box would appear huge to him, about 500 square feet and a height of 72 feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shiver shot down his spine as he realized how really minuscule and helpless he would be at such a tiny size.  But there was no turning back now for the brilliant research scientist.  He was determined to carry this plan out to the very end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan took a key and opened a small metal box.  With a pair of tweezers, he carefully lifted out some very tiny clothes\u2014several shirts, pairs of pants, underwear, and last, a tiny vial of antidote.  Bryan had first discovered how to shrink inanimate objects, which came in handy during his shrinking experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, if anything goes wrong, I\u2019ll just take the antidote formula and quickly return to normal size,\u201d Bryan reassured himself confidently.  \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan began to pack his small transport box.  He loaded it up with his extra tiny clothes, some bread crumbs for food, and a soft handkerchief to cushion his journey.  He set his initial wardrobe for the trip and the vial of antidote on the kitchen table. Bryan would shrink himself on the kitchen table, get dressed in his tiny clothes, and enter his box with the vial of antidote in hand.  Then it would all be up to Tommy and the post office to do the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan carefully sealed the box with tape and made a small incision at the bottom of the box just big enough for him to squeeze through after he shrank.  He then punctured several tiny air holes at different points around the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan set the small box on the table, it began to dawn on him just how small he would be during all of this.  He wondered if he should call his nephew and fill him in on the complete details of the plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two of his friends were sprawled on a sofa watching a game on a small TV set placed on a rickety wooden stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey greeted him enthusiastically, until Zack gestured wildly to show them he was trying to listen to a call on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack ducked into the bathroom, which was cluttered with socks and underwear, still on the floor where he had dropped them prior to showering. He did laundry about once a week, when his supply of fresh clothes began to deplete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke into his phone again. \"So, what's in this package?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan considered telling him the truth, but even as the words almost left his mouth, he changed his mind. \"I don't want to spoil the surprise,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Christmas is over, and it's not my birthday,\" Zack said. \"You do so much for me, you don't really need to send me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may get a kick out of this,\" Bryan said in a dreamy, hopeful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, for lack of a better place to sit, put the lid down and used the toilet for a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When does it arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am having it sent Overnight Express,\" Bryan answered. \"You should see me...uh, you should get it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait,\" Zack said as he stared down at the dingy bathroom tiles. Suddenly, to his disgust, he saw a cockroach crawl from beneath his discarded boxer-briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly moved his right leg and lifted his sneaker over the unsuspecting bug. He brought it down over the roach, which met its demise with a satisfying crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hear you,\" his uncle replied on the other end of the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing,\" Zack said. \"Just had to take care of a little problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look for that package,\" Bryan said. \"And please, be very careful with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Zack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't emphasize enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Zack said smoothly. \"I won't let anything happen to my surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan smiled in relief, glad he had called his nephew. \"That's what I wanted to hear,\" he said. \"Bye, Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Uncle B.,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his phone closed and slipped it back into his pocket. Still seated, he tilted his leg and looked at the crushed remains of the filthy roach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't bother anyone again, sucker,\" Zack said, chuckling. He reached for some tissue paper and cleaned most of the remains from the rubber sole of the sneaker. The tall, muscular jock stood, lifted the seat off the toilet and flushed the tissue and bug remains. He frowned as he watched them swirl down the drain and out of sight. Not much got on the big jock's nerves, but he hated bugs with an almost irrational zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's in that package that has Uncle Bryan in such a state,\" he said aloud. \"Well, guess I'll find out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, he almost wished he hadn't taken that precaution as the reeking odor of sweaty jockwear permeated the interior of the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist coughed and gagged as the stench grew even more intense without any fresh air entering the closed gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack arrived in the locker room to find most of his teammates already changed into their practice uniforms. He unzipped his bag and removed the clothing he needed, shoving aside the package in his haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed quickly and was ready to zip the bag closed when Chad, the team's towering center, approaching him with a sheepish look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, do you still have that spray?\" Chad asked as he scratched at his crotch. \"I'm itching bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed. The lanky basketball player had suffered from jock itch and athlete's foot ever since he had known him. \"Fungus loves you, Chad,\" Zack ribbed his teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have it or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stood. \"It's in my gym bag,\" he said. \"Just put it back when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack hurried from the locker room, not really wanting a repeat of the time when Chad had unashamedly applied the spray right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad walked over and picked the gym bag off the floor. Placing the bag on a bench, he began to dig through the shamble of contents to find the spray canister. In the process, he removed a small box. He left the container perched precariously on the bench as he continued looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE IT IS!\" Chad exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the shipping package dropped from the edge of the bench, landing on the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad applied the spray and gave a deep sigh of relief. He then returned the canister to Zack's bag, but never bothered to pick the small box off the floor as he hurried to join his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had just started to feel better when some unseen giant again began moving the box. Then the moving stopped, only to be followed a moment later by a lurching drop and a sudden hard impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he recovered, he decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Putting on a fresh pair of socks, he reached down and snagged the waist band of his discarded boxers. Standing up he let the towel drop and then pulled the boxers on. Spraying deodorant he pulled on his t-shirt then pulled his jeans on. Slipping into his shoes he quickly ran his hand through his hair and was ready to go. Stuffing the rest of his clothes in his bag he scooped the towel up and tossed it in a basket for cleaning. <br>\r\nHis friends were ready about the same time and they headed out to their cars.</span></div></div>",

Expecting the giant student to notice him was as stupid as expecting a skyscraper to notice him.<br>\r\nAs Bryan's bare feet slapped down on the tiled floor, he loomed even larger, then Bryan had more serious matters to worry about as the colossus casually reached out a foot a nudged the clothing aside. That mere nudge was like the worst earthquake ever to Bryan. The surface beneath his suddenly lurched sideways several hundred feet. He was sent tumbling over fabric hills.<br>\r\nAs his head cleared and he pushed himself to his hands and knees he thanked his stars that he was still on fabric and not on the bare tiles. A flash of movement to the side had him flinching in fear. In awe he watched as a vast array of fabric was lifted into the air. It took a moment for him to recognise them as boxer shorts. <br>\r\nWhen the towel dropped away to leave Zack standing naked, Bryan once again felt his jaw drop at the sight miles above him. <br>\r\nAs Zack pulled on the boxers Bryan forced himself into action, he had only seconds left before Zack would be ready to leave.

In total darkness he had no idea that the all important box was almost directly below him at this point, shoved deeper into the gym bag.

It was completely quiet and absolutely pitch black but the need to do <i>something </i>itched at him. Crawling cautiously over the coarse fabric of the jeans he started to rely on his other senses. Deprived of sight and with nothing to hear, his sense of touch felt much more acute. He was also become aware of some rather distinct aromas, most of them unpleasant.<br>\r\nThere was a faint whisp of something pleasant, probably cologne or deodorant that had rubbed off onto a shirt and there was a faint smell of cleaning product from the last time they were laundered. These smells were hard to detect however over the more noisome scents of manliness in the sports bag.<br>\r\nSomewhere in the bag there was definitely a pair of shoes. Bryan was surprised that his sense of smell even let him locate them. They were somewhere below him and to his left. He would have to try and remember to stay away from them.<br>\r\nDried sweat was another dominant scent that seemed to come from most directions. Bryan realised he had to stop thinking about all the smells - the more he paid attention to them the more aware he was of them and they were starting to make him nauseous.<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he exclaimed as his head bumped into something hard. Reaching up with one hand he encountered a cold, metallic surface. It took him a few seconds of running his hands over it to realise it was a key.<br>\r\nBryan's mind clicked into action - finally something that could help him! At some point his nephew would take the keys from his pocket and Bryan intended to go with them. Bryan's heart beat faster in excitement. He barely dared to hope that Zack hadn't updated his keyring since the last time he had seen him.<br>\r\nThe keys were tangled in the pocket and it took more time than Bryan expected to find what he was looking for. He had to climb all over the keys, pushing past folds in the pocket fabric until he found the key ring. When he found the tag he couldn't help but do a fist-pump - finally something was going right for him.<br>\r\nA few years ago Bryan had sent his younger nephew a keyring featuring a lego figure. The last time Zack had visited Bryan had noticed the key ring was still in use but somewhere along the way the legs had gone missing. Scurrying over the plastic figure which, even without its legs was more than twice his height, Bryan visualised his goal - the open cavity of the 'chest' of the lego man. He found it by touch and, sure enough, it was big enough for him to climb into. When the keys were finally lifted out he would be going for a ride with them.<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\nZack reached into the trunk of the car and pulled his back pack out. As his friend drove off he waved lazily at him, almost losing his balance in his drunken state. He didn't think he had actually had that much but his sense of balance was off and he realised that somewhere through the night he had lost track of how many drinks he had had.<br>\r\nStumbling into the dorm building he tried to be as quiet as possible. <br>\r\nStanding in front of his door he fumbled for his keys but couldn't find them. He considered banging on the door for his roommate to let him in but remembered that Drew was still at the bar.<br>\r\nMuttering to himself he dropped his bag to the floor and opened it up, rumaging through it. Finally he felt them in his bundled up jeans. Shoving his hand in he grabbed them and roughly pulled them free.<br>\r\nStanding back up, he had to take a moment for his head to stop spinning. The keys dangled loosely at his side. Pulling them up to his face he tried to focus his bleary eyes on them to find the right key.<br>\r\nOn the fifth attempt he finally slid the right key in the lock and managed to stumbled into the room.<br>\r\nPulling the key out he kicked the door closed.<br>\r\nStanding beside the bed, the room spinning around him, he dropped the keys on his bedside table and then gave into gravity, falling onto his bed. A few seconds later the sound of his drunken snoring filled the room.</span></div></div>",

Zack's normally clear and bright eyes looked bleary in the harsh, artificial lighting of the dorm hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!\" Bryan screamed from his place of concealment in the LEGO figurine's chest cavity. \"It's me! Your uncle\u2026 Help\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his tiny, unseen uncle could finish his plea for help, Zack slammed the right key into the door to his dorm. He stumbled inside, used a foot to kick the door closed behind him and stumbled across the room toward his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt dizzy and closed his eyes until the room stopped spinning. He felt his fingers release the keys, heard the jangle as they dropped onto his bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer feeling capable of an upright stance, Zack surrendered to gravity and the appeal of his soft bed, collapsing onto the bedcovers. He felt himself drifting into a deep sleep, but before slumber completely claiming him, he swore he heard his uncle screaming for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, he would have responded\u2026 but with having had way too much to drink, Zack's good intentions turned quickly to earth-shaking snores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what sounded like the bellowing respiration of some colossal, mythical dragon, the tiny scientist, badly shaken by the sudden drop from his nephew's hand to a vast, flat surface of a table, emerged from the chest cavity of the LEGO figurine. The lights inside the dorm offered slightly more brightness than the dim lights in the outer hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough only a few inches of space divided the bed from the adjacent table, it might as well have been a mammoth canyon as far as the bug-sized Bryan Smith was concerned. The sheer depth frightened him enough to keep him from venturing too close to the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a long way down,\" the tiny man said aloud, his voice swallowed in the vastness of the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his entire body tingle as he stared across the expanse at the massive form of his dozing nephew, felt the vibrations of Zack's snoring rock through his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerized, the tiny man weighed his options\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No matter how much he wished his brain would stop converting what should be tiny gaps into vast distances, he couldn't turn his brain off. <br>\r\nWhat should have only been three inches between the bedside table and the bed was suddenly turned into a 36 foot canyon. What should have been a two foot tall bedside table had become a monolith at least 300 feet tall.<br>\r\nThe clock-radio with it's bright blue numbers, shedding enough light to see by, was now taller than a five story apartment building.The nearby key ring glinted in the blue light and the tiny scientist realised that he was so small that he would almost be able to slip inside the lock that the front door key fit.<br>\r\nHis eyes slipped uneasily over the scattered debris that littered Zack's beside table, his restless mind unhelpfully providing a running commentary. A discarded tissue, nearly twenty feet tall. The tissue box, 50 feet tall. A coffee cup ring, 40 foot across. A tube of something, lying on its side, over 80 feet long. <br>\r\nIt was the next item that helped Bryan realise just what the tube was and made him freeze, stunned. A square, foil packet, 20 feet by 20 feet and nearly as tall as he was. The immense condom packet was lying right next to the tube of... personal lubricant.<br>\r\nBryan swallowed nervously, strangely embarrassed to be looking at the paraphanalia of Zack's sex life. And that, of course, sent his damned mind into comparisons of himself to his nephews sexual organs. He felt his knees go weak even as his eyes unconsciously sought out his unconscious nephew's body, sprawled across the bed.<br>\r\nAs his mind filled with unwanted images of his nephew slipping that condom onto a tower of manhood which would stand close to a hundred feet tall and two feet thick, the smell emanating from the discarded tissues finally made sense. His young nephew hadn't been using them to blow his nose, he had been using them to clean up cum from an earlier jack off session. <br>\r\nBryan felt himself starting to swoon and had to plant his feet wide, bending over and resting his hands on his knees while he sucked in deep breaths of air, unintentionally concentrating the smell of sex.<br>\r\nThe recognition that he really hadn't prepared himself for the reality of being this small once again left him shaking his head at his own stupidity. Looking around he desperately searched for somewhere to hide. He was going to have to build up his courage before he could even think about trying to get Zack's attention.</span></div></div>",

Looking around at the general state of cleanliness, or rather, lack of cleanliness on the bedside table, he realised that at such a tiny size he didn't really need anywhere special to hide. Walking over to the clockradio he lay down in front of it, sheltering under an overhang. He figured as long as he didn't do anything to attract attention he would be reasonably safe. <br>\r\nHe really needed to observe Zack in action for a while before he could come up with a plan that balanced the hope of being seen with the danger of being seen as nothing more than a bug to be squashed.<br>\r\nThe thought of having a plan, treating the situation like the scientist that he was, started to make Bryan feel more comfortable. He had been impetuous and abandoned his normal, methodical way of working. That was how he had ended up in this mess. Now he would stay rational, impartial and analytical. Sleep dragged him down into darkness.<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\nZack woke up slowly. The after effects of last night's drinking hit him between the eyes and he groaned in regret. Never again, he promised himself, knowing even has he muttered those words that he had said the same thing last time and would most likely be saying them again before long.<br>\r\nHe realised with distaste that he was still fully dressed, his mouth tasted like the bottom of a bird cage, his head throbbed, his stomach threatened to rebel and his bladder was screaming for attention.<br>\r\nThe last item on his list was the easiest to take care of. Stumbling into the bathroom he unzipped and released a strong, steady stream. He sighed in relief, amazed at the difference a good piss can make.<br>\r\nStripping off he tossed his clothes back through the open doorway. Stepping into the shower he looked through the door at his alarm clock. Good, he still had several hours before his afternoon classes.<br>\r\nAs he soaped up and washed the stale sweat from his body he realised there was another urge that his body was encouraging him to take care of.<br>\r\nAs he stepped out of the shower, toweling off, his cock started to fill, raising to half mast until his jutted out in front of him.<br>\r\nThrowing the towel on the bathroom floor he flung himself on the bed. Rolling over he fished his notebook out from under the bed and sat it on his flat stomach. Surfing one-handed, his left hand massaged his balls and cock. His favourite porn site came up and he smiled as he saw the new content. Taking a pause for a moment he reached over to his bedside to grab his tube of lube<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing that big could do anything quietly and even the seemingly gentle rustle of sheets and soft creaking of the bed were incredibly loud to the tiny scientist. Cowering under the shelter of the clock radio he tried to remain an impartial observer as his nephew slowly and reluctantly woke up.<br>\r\nEvery movement of the behemoth in front of him was fascinating and terrifying. The sheer size of Zack transformed him into something super human. The logically focused scientist shied away from the word 'god' but if any being deserved the term, it was this enormous mountain of a man in front of him. The size differential made it almost impossible not to feel a world of difference in status. Bryan didn't necessarily feel like he had been diminished or had somehow become inferior - it was that Zack was so stupendously superior to him. That made Bryan pause. How could he not feel diminished when that was exactly what had happened?<br>\r\nHis confusion was interrupted as the covers were thrown back and, with a groan, the giant god-like being stood up unsteadily.<br>\r\nBryan cowered in fear, confident that he was unseen and relatively safe but terrified of how little effort it would take to be snuffed out of existence.<br>\r\nHe couldn't see his young nephew in the bathroom but he could hear the thunderous pounding of piss splashing into the toilet, followed by the roar of the flushing. An avalanche of clothing was suddenly ejected through the doorway to land on the floor and Bryan let out a very undignified squawk of fear at its unexpected appearance.<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself a moment later as the shower roared to life.<br>\r\nAll the sound of that water made Bryan realise he really needed to relieve himself as well. For a moment he was at a loss but then decided to just walk to the other end of the clock radio and piss around the corner. It was so small a puddle that Zack was unlikely to think anything of it.<br>\r\nHe had just returned to his sleeping spot when Zack stepped back into the room. Bryan felt his dick shrivel into insignificance at the mighty beast that faced him. Bryan was a skyscraper to a skyscraper and the proud jut of his manhood preceded him back into the room. As the giant jock flung himself onto the bed, Bryan couldn't drag his eyes away from that ultimate testament to masculinity as it bobbed and weaved around.<br>\r\nWhen his nephew dragged out a battered notebook computer, Bryan barely noticed the porn that popped up. He was fixated on Zack's cock and was somewhat surprised to notice that his own shriveled cock had recovered and was now throbbing in empathy with the tower of terror that was slowly being fisted by Zack.<br>\r\nWhen Zack turned towards the bedside table Bryan nearly shit himself as Zack seemed to look straight at him and was even now reaching towards him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two of those finger tips could easily pinch him into a smear.<br>\r\nThe hand deviated downwards and Bryan was shock from his feet as the hole bedside table vibrated as Zack opened the drawer directly below the tiny scientist. A little fumbling was followed by the hand retracting, a massive cylinder in the fingers grasp.<br>\r\nBryan swallowed the lump in his throat as he made out the red letters, each taller than he was, that spelled out lube.<br>\r\nTwo massive globs of clear, glistening gel dropped into Zack's other hand as the plunger was pushed in twice then the cylinder was rudely smacked down on the bedside table obscuring most of Bryan's view.<br>\r\nHe couldn't help himself. Giving the massive tower of personal lubricant a wide berth, Bryan hurried to the other end of the clock radio just in time to see his giant nephew grasp his thick meat and smear the lube the entire length. That massive tower of manhood gleamed wetly as Zack's fingers traveled slowly up and down it.<br>\r\nBryan couldn't take his eyes off Zack's cock, almost unaware that his own hand had drifted to his own cock and was gently pulling at it at the exact same pace as this mountain in front of him. He sank into perfect sync with Zack, all his senses narrowing down and fixated on that most incredible sight of seeing a living mountain pleasure himself.<br>\r\nA piercing buzz split the air, shocking Bryan out of his semi-hypnotic state and forcing him to cover his ears at the sharp pain. He barely heard a muttered grunt from Zack but watched confused as the giant sat aside the laptop and stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was slowly building towards climax when his cell phone started ringing. For a moment he was tempted to let it ring but the buzzing had killed his mood. Sitting aside his laptop with the hand that wasn't sticky with lube, he stood up and paced over to his desk. Using the same hand he picked up the phone and saw it was one of his best friends. Hitting 'answer', he stepped back towards the bed. <br>\r\nAs the two friends chatted about what they would do over the weekend, Zack took the time to pause the porn on his laptop then stood beside the bed, making sure he didn't drip lube everywhere. <br>\r\nNot paying attention, his still semi-hard cock came into contact with the bottle of lube, knocking it over. It rolled to a stop against his clock radio, scattering a few tiny drops of lube as it rolled.<br>\r\nFinally the two friends agree on a time and place to meet up and Zack hung up. Tossing the phone on the bedside table he sank back onto the bed. Realising his lube had mostly dried up he reached out and pumped some more gel into his palm before wrapping it back round his cock, urging it back up to full hardness while the porn started playing again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the giant leaned over the bed to do something to the laptop he mooned his little uncle. A corny sci-fi reference popped into the tiny scientists head \"that's no moon.\" <br>\r\nWhen the giant turned around his semi erect cock, glistening with sticky lubricant flew around and smacked into the bottle of lube, knocking it down with a loud thud which continued into a rumble as it rolled towards Bryan's shelter.<br>\r\nHe yelped and tried to push himself deeper into the overhang but it made no difference as the curvature of the bottle meant it was in no danger of rolling over him. Three massive globs of lube had splattered down onto the wooden surface, each one bigger than Bryan's entire body.<br>\r\nThe bottle lurched suddenly and a pale pillar of flesh plunged down right in front of Bryan. He gasped in shock at the sight of the massive digit, the fingernail on it bigger than him. It was almost within reach and, without thinking, Bryan reached out to touch his nephew. Just as he touched it it pulled away from him and he recoiled in terror but it was simply the finger contracting around the lube and picking it up. <br>\r\nAfter squeezing out a couple of more generous dollops of lube the bottle was dropped back into the bedside drawer and then the whole world shook as Zack used his thigh to roughly push the drawer shut. <br>\r\nThe tiny scientist staggered at the impact, taking several steps out into the open. He saw one of the globs of cum right in front of him and screaming, \"noooo\" he staggered and fell right into it. <br>\r\nThe bubble of lube exploded around him, coating him instantly.</span></div></div>",

Repeated strokes increased in their ferocity as he raced toward climax, impatient to meet his friend but unwilling to suspend his need for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the flat vista of the desktop, his shrunken uncle squirmed like a pale worm to near the edge of the bubble of thick, sticky lubricant. He felt completely exhausted, almost willing to sink below the surface, but he rebelled against surrender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!\" He shouted. \"Look over here! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did gain a response when his nude, muscular nephew roared in abandoned delight as he felt the surge of cum shoot from his cock, causing his hand to tighten around the pulsating organ. Second later, a massive sigh followed and the young man let his body relax on the bedcovers. A trail of white dots littered the landscape of his lower abs\u2026 one of the glistening pools had reached as far as his right pec. Still trying to escape the bubble of lube, the speck-sized scientist let his imagination wander, speculating what it might have been like to be trapped in a droplet of Zack's hot cum rather than this cool, sticky lube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head on the pillows was deceptively close to the desktop and, when he turned his face toward the clutter of his clock radio and tube of lubricant, he saw something else. It was a feeble, pale insect of some sort, stuck and squirming in one of the lube bubbles. Grabbing another lazy moment before getting up to shower and get ready to meet his friend, Zack dabbed a fingertip into the bubble of lube. The sticky liquid adhered to the tip of the massive digit, pulling the unlucky tiny scientist with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack brought his hand close to his face and stared at the strange bug mired in the translucent lube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny uncle, suspended upside down in a pearl of personal lubricant, tried to get his bearings and make sense of the gigantic world suddenly gone topsy-turvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!

He sank back into a insensate stupor, too exhausted and assaulted to even think of digging his way out of the tissue and climbing out of the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zack went about his normal routine, still slightly bothered at the disappointing package from his uncle but not allowing it to bring him down. He took a quick rinse in the shower to clean up after his jerk-off session. He had almost finished getting dressed when his roommate arrived back from his first class of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick dropped his backpack on their small table and noticed the overflowing waste basket. \"I told you to take that trash downstairs to the dumpster,\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot,\" Zack said, trying to let Rick's bossiness wash past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do it on your way to your class,\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already running late,\" Zack answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stinking up the whole place!\" Rick retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the plastic bin liner, still struggling to escape the crumpled tissue sheet, one tiny man listened with increasing alarm. He had already endured so much. He couldn't let Zack or his roommate just toss him with yesterday's garbage. Or, judging from the intensity of the reeking odors, perhaps a whole week's worth of garbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally crawled through a minor tear in the tissue's fabric, but that only introduced him to an untidy, unsavory array of disposed items inside the trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!\" The shrunken scientist cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted for his colossal nephew's attention. \"Here! In the trash! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A gush of thick, transparent gel had spilled from the uncapped tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA primal moan escaped Zack's mouth as he bore down on his cock with a squeeze from a tight, encircling fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unseen uncle stood mesmerized as Zack continued to apply violent strokes to a fully erect cock that loomed almost 170 feet, the size of a city skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first application of lube evaporated, Zack reached again for the night table. This time, his uncle found himself trapped between the advancing hand and the opening of the tube. A gigantic finger slammed into him, plowing him through a layer of thick lubricant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack lifted the tube from the surface of his night table, giving no notice of the tiny, thrashing form of the speck stuck near the lube-smeared opening of the tube. He squeezed a pool of lube into the open palm of his other hand, never noticing the tiny speck caught up in the rush of gel from the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god no!\" His tiny uncle screamed. \"Zack\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cries got cut off as Zack moved his hand and prepared to smear the new supply of lube along his hard shaft.</span></div></div>",

The discolored rubber looked like the hull of some giant ocean-going vessel that had capsized onto its side. The frayed canvas sides of the shoe looked amazing. He saw each frayed thread, only they looked like thick ropes to the bug-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around to face the opening on the other side of the overturned shoe. As he did, he got a whiff of the powerful, rank odor coming from the cavernous interior of the sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" he whispered quietly, his voice soaked up by the enormity of the college locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis senses felt overloaded, and his body stirred, aroused by the novelty of finding himself so tiny in a world of gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cruelly torn from his daydreams when a shirtless titan thundered into the room, his sneakers pounding on the concrete floor of the locker room as he headed right toward the very bench near the speck-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeague was already trying to strip off his street clothes as he entered the locker room, already late for practice. The 19-year old college athlete showed a firm, very smooth torso after he removes his T-shirt, flinging the garment onto a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen tiny Bryan saw the advancing titan, he reacted in panic and ran closer to the only protection available to him... his nephew's enormous sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, he got a great view as the titan sat on the overhead bench and proceeded to change from his street clothes into his practice attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of the titan's junk sent the tiny voyeuristic scientist into an emotional frenzy. \"My god. It's as big as an office tower!\" Bryan whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Teague finished suiting up, he was about ready to head to the court and join the rest of the team when he saw a tiny package on the floor near a gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, plucked the package off the floor and placed it deep inside Zack's bag. Always a good buddy, Teague looked after his friends and didn't want Zack's package to disappear or get damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, watching, felt a sickening wave of fear when the giant unexpectedly grabbed the package and returned it to Zack's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" He yelled, leaving the shelter of his nephew's overturned sneaker. \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his hurry, Teague bent over one last time and collected Zack's sneakers, placing them atop the bench. The locker room was infested with pests, and Teague never left his stuff on the floor where they could crawl into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed as he saw Teague's muscular arm reaching right toward him. \"No!\" The bug-sized scientist yelled. He was still screaming when he realized Teague had simply re-positioned Zack's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that left him exposed in the middle of a vast floor without any available cover whatsoever.

He squeezed the little box, causing it to buckle and compact, then tossed it towards the receptacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason leaped onto his skateboard and took off down the sidewalk towards the nearby apartment building. He didn't give the small box another thought. It had been nothing more than a boring empty box to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aim had landed the box...</span></div></div>",

He had been indignantly screaming at the giant above when suddenly everything had upended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably have a concussion...!\" The shrunken man squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his tattered form out of a cavern sized fold in the handkerchief. All his appendages pulsed a steady soreness and blood from his cheek made him queasy. How could his harmless adventure have turned so wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan then frowned. \"Tommy...\" He slid down a slope of the enormous fabric, heading towards light that gleamed in the darkness. \"That careless teenager must have lost the package! How could he be so irresponsible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I be so stupid... Trusting a teenager with my life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was undoubtedly Tommy's fault. Somehow the helpful kid had lost Bryan's box, allowing it to fall into the hands of another unknown teenager. He knew that Tommy wasn't completely to blame; after all, how could he have known how important the small package was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have called Mike to do it. He would have delivered it no problem. Even Matt would have been able to deliver it, I'm sure!\" His high-pitched rants were absorbed by the massive space around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cardboard crate had fallen on its side. Light flooded in from the seemingly biblical sized flaps that had been rudely sliced open by the gigantic teenager. Bryan passed through and into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first reaction was to cover his eyes. Then, after adjusting to the outdoor light, Bryan gazed around in an awe-struck stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" Was all the tiny scientist could muster in reaction to his magnified surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what he should have expected. The shrinking formula had reduced him to a mere speck - smaller than most bugs! The world had responded accordingly. Everything was humongous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming high and wide unlike anything Bryan could imagine was a trashcan. He knew this by the intense smell of rotting, putrid garbage and the giant scraps of rubbish that seemed to be strewn all around. The package had apparently been intended for the trash, but instead fallen to the ground like some many other forsaken scraps. Soggy monuments of paper to jagged structures of crumpled aluminum towered all around. It seemed to resemble a fallen city more than mere bits of litter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was nervous, afraid even, yet his scientific mind was brimming with wonder and curiosity. He wanted to explore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remembering, he pulled the box out and placed it on the table. He walked to the kitchen utensil drawer and removed a butter knife. Walking back to the table, he sat down in a chair and used the dull knife to slice through the cardboard, not caring if he destroyed the package in the process. He impatiently pulled back the cardboard pieces and peered into the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Mason exclaimed in irritation. \"It's empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled apart the box, looking closer, just to make certain. He pulled out a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a plain handkerchief,\" he said. \"Who would go to the trouble to mail this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hopes dashed, he crumpled the box in his fist and tossed it toward the garbage bin under the sink. The box hit the edge of the bin and bounced off, just as Pete entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete, a gangly red-headed youth with tattoos on both arms and one of his legs, reached to the floor. \"Missed again,\" he kidded his friend as he scooped up the cardboard and then dropped it into the close to overflowing garbage bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it on the bus,\" Mason said. \"I hoped it might have something valuable in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor tiny Mr. Smith, his first indication that matters had gone awry came when a huge, blunt metal instrument stabbed through the cardboard walls of the package. He screamed, but before he could do much else, giant fingers tore apart the carton with shocking ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in a fold in the huge handkerchief he had himself stuffed inside the package, the bug-sized man looked up at the face of an unfamiliar giant. The titan's body was covered by blue and green striped tank-top under a wrinkled, unbuttoned shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little speck of a man stared at the giant's distant face. He had dark brown, unkempt hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Mr. Smith yelled as loudly as he could. Instead of hearing him, the giant stared into the box and spoke in a loud, terrifying voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT! IT'S EMPTY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the unseen little man had a chance to make the titan realize his error, the giant reached into the box and plucked out the handkerchief. At first, the shrunken scientist went with the huge square of cloth, but then he fell, dropping back into the nearly demolished carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man heard the giant making loud, disapproving comments about the handkerchief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" He yelled again. He started to run out of the box when the giant's fist closed around it. The cardboard walls buckled instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the world lurched around him, followed by a massive impact. The force of the impact knocked him from the crumpled cardboard. He landed, hard, on a cold, dingy linoleum floor. He hadn't quite recovered when a red-headed giant wearing only a pair of boxer shorts towered over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISSED AGAIN!\" The giant bellowed. The bug-sized man screamed as the giant reached for the cardboard. He saw the giant drop the destroyed box into a towering garbage bin, and knew that the first giant must have tossed the carton into the garbage, only he missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as a result, the tiny man was stranded on the floor. Straight ahead of him, he saw the red-headed giants two massive bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the first giant's story about finding something on the bus. Everything came together in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the tiny man groaned. Obviously, Tommy had forgotten the package on the bus. Now, he was stranded in a giant apartment with two huge titans in complete ignorance of his presence. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the size of a poppy seed, the huge kitchen counters loomed seemingly miles high. Tiny Bryan Smith gazed up at their distant surfaces helplessly and even more so as he took in the massive expanse of filthy linoleum floor that stretched for miles around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I rely on an teenager to mail the package?\" The tiny man groaned as he saw the crushed shape of the shipping box sticking from the distant trash bin. He considered momentarily that being crushed with the box would of been preferable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt like he had crash landed on some mysterious planet, and had to figure some way to find help. Bryan gulped nervously as he glanced back at the looming countertops. There was no visible way of scaling them, but they still seemed his best option in this foreign apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man jogged to the base of the counters in a short time, noting again how filthy the floor was, especially from his tiny perspective. Crumbs, mud, and numerous varieties of unidentifiable gunk covered the floor. At normal-size, Mr. Smith would of refused to even step foot in this kitchen, but at his size he had little choice in the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the lofty counter base, he found even more dirt and dust. The young male tenants obviously just swept most refuse under here. As Bryan walked around a truck-sized pretzel piece, he jumped back in shock at the site of three large ants. Terrified of the monster insects, Bryan hid behind the massive pretzel piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for his imagined death by bloodthirsty ants, he sat petrified. Nothing happened. He was sure they had seen him, why wasn't he being pursued by the disgusting creatures? With a great effort Bryan looked around his shelter and saw the three monstrosities in the same position as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dead. Stepping out, he realised that the floor before him was coated in a sticky residue, it was a glue trap! The tiny man saw he had just missed falling into the same trap as the ants by a small margin. More ants were visibly caught throughout the trap, along with a lady bug. Looking at the wall he also became aware that a trail of ants stretched over the length of the glue paper and into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tiny man heard a loud commotion in the other room. He had almost forgotten the strange giants that occupied the place.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\nWith a slam of the door, Tony entered the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What's up?\" Greeted Mason from his position on the living room couch as flipped through the television channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just had a pretty shitty day, man.\" Tony grunted in a deep voice. Throwing his tattered backpack to the ground, the 19 year old stretched his arms and yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony was a good example of your easy-going guy. He liked all sports, but had a knack for BMX biking and worked at,the local bike shop. His muscled 6 foot-tall frame was clothed in a long sleeve shirt, loose cargo pants, and dirty black skate shoes. A backwards baseball hat covered his short brown hair, and a pair of sunglasses were propped up on his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason listened as Tony recounted his day, and chuckled at his nasty description of a customer. Then they both cheered as Mason settled on channel featuring a college sports game. Tony stood up suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna grab something to eat, Fucking starved.\" He stated before stomping to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiniscule Mr. Smith was anything but prepared for the titan that appeared. He gaped in awe at the titanic youths looming form, which caused the huge space of the kitchen to suddenly appear small. After a brief pause, the mammoth young adult proceeded into the kitchen with heavy thunderous steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked in terrified awe at the moving mountain of muscle. The colossus appeared to move in almost slow-motion, each gigantic step causing heavy vibrations through the dirty linoleum floor. The bug-sized man was thrown to the ground when a sneaker the size of a cruise ship slammed down near him crushing a few stray ants. The colossal guy took no notice of the tiny ants he just crushed as he reached the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting all about getting help, Bryan just crawled back in terror at the site of this titan and his deadly sneakers. The footwear was incredibly intimidating, as he looked at the logo which featured a skull with crossed bones over the brand name \"CIRCA\". Tiny Bryan couldn't believe such a monstrous being was in reality an easy-going 19 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart racing, Mr. Smith's mind raced as he tried to comprehend a plan. He did not want to face this terrifying sneakers and end up like those ants. He couldn't just hide forever though and wait to be eaten by ants. His thoughts were interrupted by a huge pop! accompanied by loud fizzing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" A deep voice boomed from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, huge drops of green bubbling liquid came crashing down from above. Jumping out the way, Bryan barely avoided one. The festering liquid lay in pools all about him, forgetting his plight Bryan approached one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRAP, FUCKING ANTS.\" Thundered the same terrifying deep voice from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan quickly craned his head back to see the youthful titan's face looking at him. The giant held a can of soda near his mouth, his huge brow was furrowed with annoyance at the sight of another ant. Tony was considered by all who knew him a nice helpful guy, but like most males, that doesn't apply to bugs which to him were just pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man screamed desperately at the looming form of the huge unforgiving giant. Mr. Smith squealed in horror when he saw one of the mammoth sneakers lift up. The area was covered in shadow as the gigantic shoe loomed overhead. Bryan stumbled as ran, glancing back he took in the terrifying sight of the massive sole. An aggressive tread gave a skater or biker good grip and support, this made it look all the more terrifying to the little man as he also noticed the same skull and crossbones logo in the middle. He saw the various pebbles, dirt and mud, unlucky insects that crossed his path, and even a partly intact cigarette butt wedged near the toe area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong force hit the tiny man like a train, and darkness enveloped him. Bryan, opened his eyes to the utter darkness. He wasn't dead! A loud creaking was heard, and sudden light blinded him. The gargantuan sneaker lifted away, raining bits of dirt from the grimy treads. The little man lay still as he felt the heavy, thunderous footfall stomp away. The titanic BMX rider didn't even consider that the insignificant ant would survive, his mind more concerned with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to the safety of the counter baseboard, Bryan noticed the gargantuan youth had returned to the fridge. Bryan looked over the floor, he saw dozens of flattened ants around the spilled soda. The oblivious giant crushed them while stomping back to the fried, and the ants weren't as lucky as Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan figured now was his chance to escape the kitchen, or find a better position before the teen began to move again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tony was a typical guy that often downed large quantities of food, pulling a large assortment of ingredients, he began to prepare a large sandwich. He haphazardly removed some slices of bread, causing tiny crumbs to fall to the floor.  As the burly teenager worked, his mind went over the latest bit of hardware he bought for his bike and the better control it would offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Tony idly shifted his large feet around flattening the crumbs and many tiny ants. This simple, rather involuntary action was of no consequence to Tony who was oblivious to the minuscule creatures on the floor.  Due to the un-kept nature of the young male tenants, the entire kitchen was infested with these black carpenter ants no larger than a few centimeters. These minute scavengers traveled via the kitchen counter baseboards easily avoiding the glue traps, unfortunately without the foresight gifted to more intelligent species, the ants frequently ventured out into the open linoleum floor where they would fatally encounter one of the mountainous male tenants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Hell.\" Tony grumbled as a stubborn mustard bottle cap dropped to the floor and under the counter. Tony stepped over and crouched down to retrieve it, licking a bit of mustard from his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was indecisive of how to act. In actuality, he was down-right petrified. Never in his wildest dreams could he of prepared himself for his current situation. A loud slam rumbled the area as the gargantuan being that dominated the space closed the fridge. The tiny man watched the huge teenager with refreshed awe, stunned at the sheer size and power the colossal guy displayed with casual actions. His body trembled as his gaze focused the titan's cruise ship-sized footwear shift positions with dull booms. Bryan's eyes widened as he became aware of the minuscule ants that were foolishly trying to collect crumbs, only to be mashed under one of the dangerous sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" He gasped. \"This guy doesn't even know I exist, much less that I am not an ant!\" Bryan moaned as he kept his gaze on the gigantic youth. He was stranded, no larger than a bug on the kitchen floor of a strange apartment with his vial of antidote possibly destroyed in the crumpled box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Bryan lit up in realization. His gaze shot over to the distant trash bin containing the cardboard box. If he could somehow scale the bin and get to the crushed box, maybe, he thought, the antidote will still be in intact! The tiny man's new-found hope was suddenly interrupted by huge object crashing nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCKING HELL.\" The huge BMX biker grunted. The tiny scientist just had time to look as a large mustard-stained lid landed before a massive mud-stained skate shoe slammed down nearby, knocking him down. Bryan felt despair as he took in the now familiar sight of the teenagers huge hulking form looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baseball cap (since turned forwards) cast a shadow over the masculine features of the enormous 19 year-olds face. Bryan watched in horror as the giant casually licked the from his thumb as his cold blue eyes focused on the stray mustard lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony grabbed the lid with his stadium-sized hand and prepared to stand up when he noticed a line of ants coming from the baseboard stretching out to the refrigerator. His brow furrowed with annoyance as he rose back up to his full height, his muscled 6 foot frame dominating the landscape of the kitchen floor. Tony lifted his right sneaker and stomped it down on a group of the pesky ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cocky male mind thought nothing of crushing bugs, which was just a mundane act to him and happened often without his knowledge. Easily crushing the remainder of the nearby ants, his annoyed gaze locked on to a lone ant trying to escape at a pathetic pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, he easily overtook the bug and cut it off with a lumbering step unaware that this was the very ant he failed to crush with earlier, the determined Tony smirked and prepared to deal with this lone ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist froze with fear as the monstrous teenager rose back up to his natural towering height. Tony's height may be considered average height to some, but to the ant-sized scientist at his feet there was nothing average about it. The young titan loomed seemingly two miles high to tiny Bryan, his muscular shoulders and thick tattooed arms made him look even larger, and gave him the appearance of a destructive god rather than a typical nineteen year old guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stood still briefly, his Circa skate shoes firmly supporting the massive man's weight. A such a minute size, the massive actions of the giant seemed slowed down, even from his slight distance, the sound of the grimy rubber sneaker tread lifting from the sticky linoleum floor made the tiny man cringe. The humongous footwear stomped heavily on a group of the helpless ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing through his terrified mind, the tiny scientist imagined the terrifying skate shoe logo on the sole of this young guy's sneaker being the last thing the ants see. Bryan sprung into action, and began clumsily sprinting in the opposite direction of the destructive giant crying out in vain. He dared a backwards glance as another heavy boom was heard, seeing the titan stomp his foot down on more of the doomed ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing where he was going, the little man raced to the opposite end of the kitchen where a looming archway led to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning a huge object crashed down in-front of him, missing him by only a few feet and sending tiny Bryan on his backside. Towering before him was one of the terrifying sneakers. Bryan was aware of the smell of warm rubber as he took in the sight of the shoe, its rough mud-stained rubber sole, and the worn black suede material with frayed stitching that made up the body of the popular brand of footwear. Covering the top of the shoe was the thick dark khaki coloured pants that seemed to stretch endlessly into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'm not a bug!\" He yelled desperately with tears streaming down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible feeling of deja-vu crept over the tiny man as he remembered his close call not long ago, he didn't feel so lucky this time.</span></div></div>",

I'm a man, not a bug!\" He shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heart attack, or perhaps even a car accident is how the tiny scientist envisioned his life ending. A stain on the sole of a massive teenager who barely passed basic Algebra? That would of sounded simply mad to the little genius before now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sticky squelch, the humongous sneaker raised off the filthy floor and loomed over him. Recently flattened ants were visibly pressed into the colossal tread, along with mud and bits of unidentifiable refuse stuck in the aggressive pattern. The mortifying skull logo embossed in the rubber seemed to glare right at him, a bit of muddy grass wedged near it, informing the tiny man of his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a moment later and with terrifying speed, the massive footwear crashed down. Tiny Bryan Smith's vision went black instantly as his tiny life-form was successfully flattened once and for all under the enormous sneaker. His entire existence reduced to nothing, all his remarkable scientific accomplishments meant nothing at his minute size, especially against Tony's cruel sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this mattered little to the towering teenager, who viewed all bugs to be non-sentient beings that served only to be invasive pests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole ordeal taking only a few seconds, Tony lifted his foot and chuckled. The cocky youth thought nothing of the little ant, nor the dozen others he had crushed. Gazing around the floor he didn't spot anymore visible ants, and took that as a \"job well done\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of how terrifyingly huge, and cruel he appeared to such small creatures, Tony casually returned to his nearly finished food. A few finishing touches later, he revealed his highly anticipated sandwich in-hand, and rushed out of the room to watch TV. Not a second thought was given to the kitchen ants, as Tony heavily propped his sneakered-feet on the coffee table causing it to creak in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long, bro?\" Mason said with a brief glance at the sandwich, \"Don't tell me that is only the third course?\". Mason jabbed the bulky Tony in the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfection takes time, dude\" Tony responded with a full-mouth and an exaggerated wave of his hand. Before he could come out with another clever zinger, Tony reacted to a sudden positive change from the flickering television. \"Fuck yeah! Kick their asses!\" He exclaimed, spitting out half-chewed food all over the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours and Xbox games later, after Mason and Pete went to bed, the tired Tony prepared to do the same. He pulled off his shirt, dropping it to the floor, and stomped to his room lazily. Pulling off his large, stinky Circa sneakers, he dropped them heavily before the base of the bed and plopped himself back. With a stomach full of digesting sandwich, and an obliviously content mind, the teen fell asleep with loud snores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneakers hit the ground hard, and almost unnoticeable to someone like Tony, tiny crushed insect-parts and hardened bits of mud dislodged from the heavy tread of his footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong them, the ant-sized remains of a once brilliant scientist who single-handedly discovered a shrinking formula with fatal results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who gives a shit?\" he says looking back at Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this place is infested...\" Tony replies. Pete looks around to see ants crawling on the floor, as well as finally noticing the ones he had tread on. Pete was the worst of the bunch when it came to making a mess and usually was the last one to start cleaning. He didn't want to get blamed for anything and honestly didn't really care that the kitchen was so filthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" he paused but Tony, confused, said nothing. \"They're just ants, what are they gonna do to you? On the floor all they can do is get stepped on. Big deal, I'm not worrying about it!\" Pete reached to the counter to grab the potato chips he had come for originally. With his prize he walked out of the room, never looking down to see what ended up beneath large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony watches him leave and then glances at the floor. He doesn't see the bug he had been after. For all he knows Pete stepped on it, or it had gotten away. Tony decides Pete is right and as long as the bugs leave him alone, he won't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spins around facing the counter to continue constructing his sandwich, his mind focused on what he can do to make it as good as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan backed away slowly from the massive sneakers, the fraying pieces and smudges so much more evident at this size. Suddenly stomps rattled him to his core and a roar sounded from above. Bryan jumps and spins around to see the red-headed giant entering the room. The one who almost crushed him had seemed so impossibly large, but this giant towered even higher. Seeing these giants kept reminding the tiny scientist just how insignificant he had made himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giant, in a pair of blue and black Vans, carelessly stomps through the kitchen. His massive footwear crashes onto the oblivious ants, crushing them without even noticing. Above him the giants speak to each other, but Bryan barely listens. He is horrified, now surrounded by two enormous pairs of deadly shoes. He hears a laugh from above. He sees the red-head looking down before moving his sneaker over a few lucky ants he had missed. Flattened ant bodies rain from his sole to the ground below as he moves the shoe. The kitchen rattles as his shoe slams down, the ants disappearing underneath. Bryan looks back up to see the giant already staring at his friend again, clearly unconcerned about the fate of the bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan finally snaps into action. As the giants keep talking, he bolts towards the fridge. Behind him he hears voices and the occasional shifting of massive feet. However he doesn't look back, scared of what he might see. To his complete relief he makes it beneath the towering appliance safely, although he realizes he still must be wary of any other tiny inhabitants of the teens' kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom beneath the fridge he watches the blue and black Vans shift towards the counter before stomping out of the room. The black Circas don't move at first before spinning around, making a terrible squeaking noise. They tiny man cringes and covers his ears. The feet shift slightly every now and then and after a few minutes they approach the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cries out and starts to run before remembering he is safe. He trembles as the massive footwear steps right in front of him. Above he hears the fridge door open and light floods the shoe, illuminating the grimy floor at the titan's feet. When the door is slammed shut, dust rains onto the tiny man sending him into a coughing fit. The shoes finally turn and stomp out of the room, leaving Bryan alone once more.</span></div></div>",

There was no movement to be seen, and no near sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gone.\", Mr. Smith said to himself in a relieved tone. And after the relief his logic mind jumped back into action. \"Now or never.\", Mr. Smith said while standing up. He still was laying on the kitchen floor, where he stumbled moments ago in a sudden rush for escape where he already was safe, \"I have to go for that trash can\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill very unsure if this was the right decision, \"But wait, of course it was the right decision.\", he thought to himself, \"This should be easy, the trash can isn't that far away from here. Just start moving and hurry.\", Mr. Smith looked one final moment to the left, then to the right, and after a brief moment, a tiny single ant, just a mere speck, and not very easy to detect, if it wasn't moving, could be seen from a normal human point of view, how it was slowly, very slowly, leaving its secure hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\", Pete asked Tony with a grimace, who was just joining the two other teens, \"Did you have another problem of dealing with your bugs?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, dickhead\", Tony spat to his roommate while taking a seat next to Mason, who again was switching through the channels, but then half minded asked, \"Bugs? What bugs?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was faster than Tony and interrupted, \"Oh it seems we have a little pest problem in our doom bro, you guys are just soo messy\". He looked over to Tony with a dirty smile on his face, and because of Tony's reaction to his face, he knew he poured some salt into the conversation. Pete loved this kind of fun. He always tried to mock his friends and play little tricks on them. He was a typically high school jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony thought if he should say something in response, but while he was thinking what to say, Mason did for him. \"Uhm guys, that's disgusting, I hate all kind of insects, they freak me out. You say there are bugs in our kitchen? Not cool. Really not cool.\", while saying the last sentence he looked to his right where Tony was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", finally Tony found back his words, \"Why are you looking at me? You know who the messy guy here is, and it's definitely not me.\", and both teens changed there angle at the same time over to Pete, who had just opened his chips bag and shoved one huge chip into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax...\", he spoke while spitting tiny little bits of chip mass out of his mouth. \"They are just tiny ants, OK?\", \"No roaches or shit. Just relax man.\". Shortly said, he shoved another chip into his dry mouth, and suddenly remembered something. He had forgotten to bring himself drink with his chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well,\", Pete said while licking his fingers clean, \"If it calms you down, I will reduce any leftover shitty bug I encounter to a smear under my shoes, that's better for you? And besides ladies, I forgot to bring me a drink, does someone else want something from the kitchen?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the conclusion of high school, Mason and Pete contacted their good friend Tony who had graduated a year earlier and the three decided the pool their resources for an apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis apartment rested on the second floor of an old building in town, and looked dated and abused. Old wallpaper torn and stained in the living room and bedrooms, and the plaster walls were scuffed and cracked in the kitchen and hall. All rooms, but the kitchen and bathroom, featured aged carpeting that proved popular in the late 1960s and was matted with grime. Because of this unpleasant hygiene, the apartment was an easy target for all manner of invasive pests such as ants, flies, and spiders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the busy landlord, the three young adults cared little for clean surroundings, and readily rented the space for a reasonable amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving shrunken himself only just that morning, Bryan Smith made slow progress across the vast kitchen floor of the apartment, huge crumbs littered the floor all around. The once white linoleum now appeared a dingy yellowish colour, and was sticky to the touch. A fact that went unnoticed to the teenage occupants powerful feet, but made the tiny man's progress more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the gargantuan teens left, the tiny insect inhabitants repopulated the food-laden floor, causing Bryan to take care in avoiding their notice. He didn't want to think what would happen should he be found interesting to a vehicle-sized ant. Holding his breath, he avoided a particularly large ant that was investigating a smashed pretzel-piece.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I am almost there!\" He thought with vain hope. The still distant trash bin seemed reminiscent of a looming mountain from his minuscule perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete stood from his chair, having only briefly sat down before realizing his forgotten beverage. Yawning lazily, he lumbered towards the kitchen, deciding if he should grab a soda or a sugary juice drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet thumped heavily on the floor. At his size, Pete never considered the heavy vibrations his large threatening feet caused the tiny occupants of the flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Murphy's Law kicked in as tiny Bryan felt dull, heavy vibrations approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whipping motion, he turned back to the doorway. He felt his heart sink as Pete's towering visage dominated his view. The huge, gangly red-headed youth would dwarf any skyscraper. Clothed in fitted jeans, a black t-shirt, and large Vans skate shoes, Pete was pale and lanky, but had a lean build from his many years spent skateboarding and participating in other activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering huge distances with each lumbering stomp, Bryan screamed in terror watching the titanic teen head right for him. His tiny form had only brought him to the middle of the kitchen floor, right in the giant Pete's path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not again, just let me be! Please!\" His wailing voice didn't even phase the huge teenager. Running, arms in the air, and with a clumsy fashion, Bryan was thrown roughly back as Pete's huge sneaker crashed down before him with powerful concussion. The rough rubber sole loomed before him, easily three-stories high and stained with dirt and grass from outside. Before he could even crane his head, a powerful boom was heard distantly and the footwear before him suddenly lifted off the sticky linoleum with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth agape, the tiny man watched the huge sneakers stomp heavily away, the ground trembling with each booming step. Noticing he wasn't the only one suffering, he saw many tiny ants disappear under the colossal Vans, not to be seen anymore when the large shoe lifted away, raining clods of dirt and dislodged pebbles. The terrifying teen came to a stop before the fridge, pulling the humongous door open with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here!\" The realization struck him, and looking around, he clumsily hurried to safety. He still felt shell-shock from his close call, his little heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Scientist's mind returned to the familiar state of panic and shock he'd been experiencing since he shrunk. This young guy was simply walking through his kitchen, utterly unaware of the destructive force his unimaginably huge sneakers posed. His feet running at a desparate pace, the little man thought he was safe when an ominous shadow covered the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was preparing to return to the living room, his lofty perspective not picking up the tiny speck trying to get out of his way. Two quaking steps brought the huge sneakers right before the bug-sized man, and with cruel patience, the right sneaker lifted over Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill running, tiny Bryan was given a full view of the filthy waffle-sole of the gigantic teen's skate shoe. The thick tread took everything it crushed with it, mashed-ants, pebbles, and a dirty wad of gum near the toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's lungs felt like they would burst as he let out a blood-curdling scream, watching the impossibly huge sneaker come down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through the doorway into the kitchen, Pete continued to the refrigerator without even glancing at the floor. A rough pull, and the contents of the fridge were before him, displayed in the yellow light from within. Deciding he wanted something carbonated, he reached his pale hand in and snatched one of the many sodas, not noticing the tiny ants crawling up the side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually stomped back through the kitchen, oblivious to the ants he flattened underfoot. The excitable teen had already lost interest in the infestation, and didn't give anymore thought to the minute insects on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy plop, he seated himself back in his previous chair, and popped his can of soda open. His keen hazel eyes focused on the flashing screen, and he idly propped his feet on the coffee table before him, revealing the filthy sole. Unknown to him, an ant-sized scientist was pressed in to a wad of gum that became stuck to the tread of his Vans sneaker at the skate park earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden vibrating in his pocket alerted Pete to a text message on his cell phone, pulling it out, he idly began typing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mason watched the flickering television with an intent expression. This episode had been long in the waiting, and he was excited to learn of the outcome of the plotline, and the possible battle between rival characters. The scene ended, and the annoying jingle of a local grocery mart sounded as the commercial break started. With a slightly sour expression, Mason glanced towards Pete, his buddy intent on his texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete had his sneakered-feet propped up before him, exposing the soles to his two buddies sitting across from him on the couch. A wad of dirty pink gum was clearly visible, stuck in the waffle sole of Pete's skate shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his eyebrow, Mason smirked and said, \"Dude, you got some gum stuck to your shoe\". Pete glanced up briefly, \"Yeah, yeah, sure I do...\", he laughed sarcastically, returning his attention to the cellphone, idly swatting a bothersome gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Pete. There is fucking gum on your shoe.\" Mason re-stated, gesturing to Pete's feet. Tony gave a quick grunt in agreement, his attention focused on a commercial for an up-coming film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight frown crossed the red-headed teen's face, and he pulled his tattered sneaker to view the sole. Sure enough, the wad of gum was where it was rumoured to be. \"Shit...\" Pete grumbled, his temperament dampened. He hated stepping in gum as it could be a pain to peel it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, he dug his hand through Tony's backpack, which was slumped against the wall near his seat. With a swooping motion, he brandished a quarter with dramatic triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, keep your freaking hands out of my backpack!\" Tony warned as he noticed what Pete was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm your panties, I am just going to use it to scrape off the gum. It will survive.\" Pete retorted half-mindedly as he prepared to scrape the pesky gum off his shoe with the purloined quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan had never felt so low, much less disgusting, in his life. Here he was, smaller than a common house ant in some strange apartment, and pressed into a wad of revolting chewing gum stuck to the sole of a teenager's sneaker. He couldn't even feel thankful that he survived underneath the huge footwear. He was literally lower than a wad of gum stuck to someone's shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worse part was that the three behemoths had no idea he was even there. They didn't even know him personally, much less know that he had shrunken to ant size and was scurrying around their filthy flat. He kept his eyes closed, not wanting to look at the seated titans, and trying to ignore their thunderous voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this self-pitying came to an abrupt end when Bryan's situation fluctuated once more. After the giant's finished speaking, the sneaker moved suddenly from its placid state, causing the tiny man feel like he was stuck on some out-of-control carnival ride. His brain spun wildly as his environment changed, his little eyes trying to adjust at the intense speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT...\" Roared a deep, but now familiar voice directly above him. His vision cleared and with a gasp he saw the colossal red-headed guy's face towering above. The gargantuan teenager's head was tall as any skyscraper. Bryan felt his heart leap when he saw the lake-sized eyes seemingly look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little speck-like form burst into pathetic struggles, his shrill, squeaky voice squawking with new-found vigor. \"How could he not see me from this range?\" Mr. Smith thought in excitement. The huge face showed no sign of recognition, at his size, Bryan looked like a tiny speck, unimportant to the massive Pete. The tiny man frowned as the gigantic Pete turned away. His frown contorted into screams of terror when the face turned back, revealing a massive round metallic object held before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quarter. This huge metallic object was a quarter! With little further time to react, the parking lot sized currency crashed to his side, digging into the chewing gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Help me! I am in the gum, please look! Help me!\" The little man's pitiful cries didn't even reach the large youth's ears. The firm, yet sticky gum contorted around him, pushing him out somewhat. He watched in horror as the gum gave way to the huge piece of change, a colossal thumb visible at the top of the quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rush of vertigo and his world began spinning wildly, air whipping all around his pink rubber prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a forceful push, the slightly hardened chewing gum lifted from the thick waffle tread of Pete's Vans sneakers. He grinned, glad that the gum gave in so easily, and completely unaware that the small black speck on the surface was a tiny scientist and not a grain of sand. With a happy-go-lucky motion, the careless youth flicked the gum-covered quarter towards the trashcan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" Tony growled, annoyed that the petulant Pete used his quarter to scrape gum off his shoe and then proceeded to throw it away. He roughly threw his baseball cap at the chuckling red-head with annoyance. Pete was quite satisfied with this outcome, having been able to frustrate the slightly older Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clinking sound reported that Pete's throw was off, as the quarter landed at the base of the trash bin. Not really caring either way, Pete returned to his idle text-chatting, placing his feet back on the coffee table, uncaring of the plethora of other refuse stuck in the thick waffle tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He especially disliked when people took his stuff, even if it was just a quarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashing television screen brightened suddenly as a commercial break began. With an annoyed expression, Tony stood up, trying to tune out the annoying commercial jingle and stepped over to his backpack. He easily lifted the heavy bag and stepped back to the couch, dropping it with a heavy thump next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to sit back down, the teen thought about his wasted quarter. Glancing over to the kitchen doorway, he grunted, and decided to just go retrieve it. He could probably just take the gum off and drop it on the floor in Pete's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight grin resulted as Tony considered it. Stepping around his backpack, he lumbered to the kitchen with heavy  steps. Unknown to him as he stomped through the archway, his huge footfall sent strong vibrations through the floor, alerting the tiny insects of his approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the kitchen ceiling, a small spider had just entered via an air vent, this strange new world fascinated the recently born aracnid. Tony's booming steps actually caused everything in the kitchen to rattle slightly because of the unstable floor. The surprised spider as not prepared for the seismic display, and fell down to floor, far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a chance to even get back on it's many legs, the helpless creature looked up just in time to see Tony's titanic Circa sneaker crash down. The aracnid's first human encounter was also it's last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the tiny lifeform he just crushed underfoot, Tony stopped before the grimy trash bin. Gazing inside the receptacle, the teen saw no sign of the misused quarter among the slimy trash inside. Happening to look straight down, Tony spotted the gum covered quarter resting near his left foot. It figured that Pete would miss, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down to retrieve it...</span></div></div>",

He could barely think straight, only knowing that he wanted this nightmare to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he has fully recovered, a quake shakes him to his core. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he laments, turning to face upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is greeted with the sight of a black and filthy shoe sole slamming down onto him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony grunts as he leans down and snatches up the quarter. Prize in hand Tony returns to the living room, deaf to the aged floor's creaks of protest caused by his heavy footfall. Without pausing, Tony slugs Pete in the shoulder as he passes. Pete grunts in surprise, but decides not to directly retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, is Tony mad at me?\" he taunts as Tony drops into the beat-up recliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony needs you to shut the fuck up!\" he snaps back, staring pointedly at the television. Pete grins; he really knew just how to press Tony's buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn guys! So much hostility!\" Mason says, mocking concern. Pete chuckles and Tony grunts, but no more words are exchanged. Still in control of the remote, Mason starts flipping through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tony grabs the sandwich and finally takes his first bite. \"Shoulda put more mustard...\" he thinks to himself as he chews. With the quarter still in hand, Tony uses his thumbnail to absently start picking at the gum clinging to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan winced, letting out a pathetic high-pitched squeal as the titanic shoe slammed down. When the only impact he felt was a gust of wind, he gingerly opened his eyes. He was still in light and was staring at the smudged rubber wall that was the side of Tony\u2019s shoe sole. He whooped in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever his celebration was short lived. A shadow was cast from above, drawing Bryan\u2019s gaze. He screamed yet again as long fingers reached down for him. Still screaming, Bryan felt his lungs relocate to his stomach as the coin was wrenched upwards, resting in Tony\u2019s expansive palm. Before he knew it he was closed in semi-darkness as Tony held the quarter in a loose fist. Bryan couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by the calloused skin that surrounded him in every direction. At his current size Bryan could easily fit between any of the wrinkles in Tony\u2019s palm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan takes a deep breath, trying to clear his mind. He didn\u2019t have time to marvel at this behemoth\u2019s size, he needed to focus on getting it the antidote. When he had been flung towards the trash he could see the thing was still full, and though he hadn\u2019t seen the package, he knew that\u2019s where it was. Fortunately it seemed none of the massive young men had any interest in taking out their overfilled trash can. Their disgusting habits would work to Bryan\u2019s advantage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan whoops as the thick fingers deftly move him towards the thumb. It simply didn\u2019t seem possible that such large things could move so quickly and accurately! Bryan is amazed by the wide nail bed, ending in a short nail that was pitted in places and dotted with dirt. Clearly Tony wasn\u2019t concerned with his nails\u2019 appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the thumb starts to lower over him eliciting a screeching \u201cNO!\u201d from Bryan. However with a flick the thing skips over him. Bryan winces as the massive thumb repeats the movement, this time jostling him slightly. \u201cYes!\u201d Bryan shouts happily realizing the giant was picking the gum (and by extension him) free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally good luck!\u201d he cheers turning his face upwards in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is greeted with the sight of a pair of smacking lips and a gulping noise. A monolithic sandwich, grasped in the other enormous hands soars over head as the mouth widens. Bryan grimaces at the disgusting sight of soggy piles of bread and other sandwich ingredients briefly visible in Tony\u2019s mouth before he closes his jaws around the food. With a hair-raising chomp the bite is pulled free and Tony starts to chew. As his lips part with every munch, Bryan tears his eyes away. \u201cThis guy needs to chew with his mouth closed!\u201d Bryan thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he can\u2019t help but be amazed by the ease at which Tony was obliterating the hill of food, and the disgusting display it was causing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the sandwich back onto its plate, Tony chews slack jawed; every ounce of his attention on the TV. He continues picking at the quarter, making slow progress. Just as a commercial starts up, Pete glances back at Tony. He can\u2019t help but notice Tony is still picking at the quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re such a fucking cheapskate!\u201d Pete sneers. \u201cFuck off!\u201d Tony retorts back, his words however lack force. Simultaneously his thumb flick\u2019s the filthy gum free of the quarter. It lands gently on Tony\u2019s sandwich. Tony hurriedly brushes it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw dude! That shit was on my shoe!\u201d Pete cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine! It wasn\u2019t even on there a whole second!\u201d Tony replies defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances at the sandwich, \u201cIt\u2019s clean!\u201d Tony declares, not noticing the gray smear where the gum had landed on his bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete inhales to take another jab at Tony, before deciding he had grown bored. Instead he shrugs and returns his attention to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stuffs the quarter into his pocket, and reaches down for his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bryan was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Though his body ached from the impact it seemed nothing had broken in the fall. After being  jolted free of the sticky gum he had managed to save himself from plummeting into oblivion by latching onto the oddly spongy ground. He was unable to suppress a scream as the huge chunk of gum was knocked away, bathing him in much brighter light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes adjusted Bryan could see the fearsome behemoth still towering over him. He was turned to his side, so that Bryan merely had a view of his looming chest, and neck lined with a faint stubble outlining his prominent Adam\u2019s apple. His jaw moved as the giant let out thunderous words, though Bryan wasn\u2019t focusing enough to make out what was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as he pulled himself up over the soft, white ledge. Gasping for air, adrenaline still pumping through his veins, Bryan instantly recognized where he had ended up. After being freed he had been deposited onto the titan\u2019s sandwich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching off in every direction was a pitted white landscape, though most holes weren\u2019t nearly as large as the one he had barely escaped. Immediately surrounding him were various debris that had also been shaken free from the gum upon impact. Bryan sneered in disgust at the bits of grime, twisted lint, and chunks of dirt scattered haphazardly around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head Bryan realizes rather than observing his surroundings like a scientist, he needs to flee like a survivor. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stands to run, Bryan is bathed in shadow. He looks up to see a gargantuan hand stretched out over him, each finger easily dwarfing a jumbo jet. After only two steps, Bryan is sent tumbling by a jarring quake as Tony lifts the sandwich upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony brings the sandwich to his lips, biting blindly as he stares at the television. It felt great to just kick back, munch on a sandwich, and watch some TV after being on his feet all day at the bike shop. Still munching on his bite, Tony stretched his legs to get more comfortable, resting his sandwich against his chest. The stretch brought on a small yawn, with Tony facing down in an unconscious and unsuccessful attempt to cover the said yawn. Now more relaxed, Tony brought his jaws together twice more before gulping the food down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at his tasty creation, Tony noticed a large glob of mayo and mustard that had collected at the corner of a bite mark. Bringing the sandwich to his lips, Tony slipped his tongue out to lap up the sauce before taking another savage bite of the food. He sighed, staring at the ceiling while chewing as a commercial started playing on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I can hear you chewing from over here.\u201d Mason stated abruptly, his flat tone indicating some disgust. Tony grunted, raising an eyebrow as he turned his head to face Mason. \u201cOuh\u2026 mah bahd!\u201d Tony said through his full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then leaned toward Mason, chomping his food obnoxiously. \u201cBettah?\u201d Tony asked sarcastically, sticking his long tongue out for effect. Mason made a face at the pile of soggy chewed food. \u201cDude you\u2019re nasty!\u201d Mason said with a grin. Tony leaned back, withdrawing his tongue and closing his mouth. He took a moment to swallow before responding, \u201c What can I say? I make it an art!\u201d he said as he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pete or Mason could respond, all three young men refocused on their flat screen as the show restarted. Entranced by the show, Tony continued to chow down.</span></div></div>",

Heelp meee! I'm right-...!\" His squealing cries cut off when the dirt-crusted fingertip shifted and pushed him into one of the many air holes spanning the gigantic surface. He landed in a thick pool of white goop. Bryan struggled to keep his head above the oily surface as the G-forces forced him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, he heard a strange, deep guttural noise. Looking at the source, Bryan was given a horrifying view of the behemoth's gaping mouth as it enveloped his portion of the sandwich. Thick gusts of rancid air washed over the sandwich, smelling of everything the huge teenager had consumed that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOO!\" He gurgled on a mouthful of thick mayonnaise. Bryan spat it out and flapped his arms desperately. \"Stop! Dear God, I am on the sandwich! STOP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout mercy, the giant slammed closed his gargantuan maw. A powerful symphony of tearing, crunching rang out before finishing with a loud <i>thunk</i>. The tiny man's body went ice cold as he stared before him; his heart skipping more than enough beats to stop entirely. Not more than half a dozen feet from his gooey position the young giant's teeth had met. Bryan felt time slow, watching the gigantic wall of calcium loom before him. Streams of frothing saliva coated the yellowed surface, dripping down past ridges and barely visible fissures that coated the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, horrendous sounds of wet shifting emitted from behind the building-sized teeth and they pulled away. Bryan was too busy staring at the mountianous lips slide back over them that he wasn't prepared for the sandwich being returned to the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like falling to Earth on a city-sized meteor. The oblivious giant carelessly depositing the simple snack without any real thought or exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandwich landed with a light boom upon the plane of white stoneware. Upon impact, gravity and weight caught up to the tiny man. The glob of mayonnaise lightly slid down the fresh bite mark, taking tiny Bryan and other foreign particles with it. He pealed pitifully, roughly pulled into the avalanche of thick, oily goo that tumbled down the cliff-like surface of bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan resurfaced quite suddenly, gasping and wiping thick condiments from his eyes. His physical limit had been reached and passed long ago. It was a miracle he managed to tread the gooey surface. His stomach reeled from all the intense pressure change, violent movements, and vast quantities of mayonnaise. Bryan wiggled towards a hunk of bread larger than his car and grabbed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Tony towered over the scene. The gigantic youth kept his gaze fixated across the room, allowing Bryan a similar view from before. Unlike last time, the youth exercised his massive jaw, rotating it with slow powerful crunches. Bryan could only cringe at the sight; imagining how close he came to being reduced to paste by those fearsome teeth. Tony idly reached an enormous hand up, slamming huge digits into the side of his head and scratching carelessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan clutched the pitted surface of his crumb, deciding to try his only card again. \"<i>Heeeeeeelp</i>!\" His lungs hurt terribly and his stomach threatened to dry heave. \"Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaase! Help meee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shape surfaced nearby, twitching weakly. Bryan started with a gasp, looking at it. It was nothing more than an ant: barely clinging to life, missing more than half of its legs, and trying to vainly to escape. It was a pitiable sight - the shrunken genius realized he was lucky in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow washed over the landscape of glazed ceramic and breadcrumbs. He looked up to see the gargantuan hand returning, soaring overhead with outstretched fingers. With a strong jolt, Tony wraps his huge fingers around the sandwich once more and pulls it into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught in a glob of mayonnaise and mustard, Bryan is afforded a frontal view of the titanic teenager. Both gigantic eyes looked away, uncaring of the cruelty and devastation held before them. Incredulous, Bryan shook himself and screamed as loudly as possible - a solid note of pure desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. Only a thunderous smack of the giant lips and a grotesque display when the enormous tongue appeared to coat the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was plain to him long before that any sound he made was far less than insignificant. He might sound like a shrill buzz close enough to their cavernous ears if he was lucky. Even so; he refused to give up without a fight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me! I am RIGHT heree! Just LOOK!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an answered prayer, it happened. Tony's eyes slowly moved, rotating like a planetary body to fix upon his position. Bryan felt nothing short of pure adrenaline looking directly into the giant's gaze. <i>The eyes of a god</i>, Bryan couldn't help but think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness! I'm rescu-...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many times before, his assumptions proved wrong. A mighty snort released from the monumental nose, sucking up a multitude of mucus that collected around the gaping rim. Bryan stared at the two nostrils momentarily before returning his gaze to the mouth. It opened with slow, remarkable grace and unleashed a torrent of tepid breath. Tendrils of saliva dripped down from the thick yellowish teeth, each one capable of pulverizing many buildings. From the darkness within, emerged a gargantuan tongue. It slid out sluggishly, growing larger and more terrific as the sandwich neared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan belted out with all his might, screaming. The monstrous muscle merely absorbed each minuscule note as it neared, slimy and coated with bits of food. It came right for his location, seemingly to collect the tiny man. Truthfully, Bryan was of such insignificance, the suffering ant was more viable than himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few moments, nothing more. the bumpy pink surface crashed into him with tidal force. Bryan was instantly mashed into the surrounding gobs of mayonnaise and mustard. His screams more meaningless than before as the tongue absorbed each particle it touched. The oblivious giant then retracted his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mouth, Bryan had completely lost his wit. Darkness prevailed, barely lit when the huge lips parted slightly. Beads of saliva dropped like bombs around him, crashing and holding everything they touched like glue. Bryan merely lay pasted against the warm surface below, held by a foul mixture of saliva and condiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts had all but shut down, except for one question that kept running through his mind: <i>did that stupid ant survive</i>? It was an insane thought and he could only cackle between each choking gasp for fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded the interior when the lips yawned open, the teeth raising with them, revealing large chunks of mashed sandwich caught in each groove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening...\" Bryan pulled himself up slightly. Beneath him, he could feel the tremendous muscle shifting in response to more food. \"Fuck! This is just some fucking crazy dream! I can't actually die like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the massive continent of half-eaten bread, deli meat, and condiments slowly enter the cavernous mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRUNCH</i>!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mind dazed and every bone in his body hurting, Mr. Smith vision still was too blurry to see anything. He winkled his right eye a few times, trying to get a focus. \u201cWha, what happen... where am, who's..\u201d, Mr. Smith tried to say. Was there someone speaking to him before? \u201cMy legs, uh, my legs...\u201d, \u201cEasy Mr. Smith, I'm so glad you're OK. I was worried about you when I found you\u201d, suddenly the familiar voice spoke to him again. Was it, no, that can't be, but it did sound like, \u201cIs this the package?\u201d. Package? Mr. Smith's mind got clearer now and his vision came back and he saw, no, that cannot be. \u201cTommy!?\u201d, \u201cYes Mr. Smith, it's me. Is this the package you wanted me to bring to the post office?\u201d, above him, Mr. Smith looked into the face of his well known teenage neighbor boy, who was kneeling over him, wait, over him? \u201cOh, my head\u201d, Mr. Smith touched the back of his head with his left hand and tried to sit up a little bit with his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you slipped and knocked yourself out just a few moments before I got to your house\u201d, Tommy said with a smile on his face, \u201cYou should be happy I found you.\u201d. \u201cNo..., I, this cannot be. Tommy, you, I was... you look...\u201d, \u201cYes, Mr. Smith? What are you talking about? Do you feel alright?\u201d, Tommy's smile went into a worried look while standing up. While he did, Mr. Smith could see the boy was holding a small package in his right hand. It was his package, the one the prepared to ship himself in, after he shrunk to the size of 1/8 of an inch. But that all did happen already, and it went terrible wrong. First there were those ants, and then Tommy tried to..., and he got inside, and then, wait, where was he? He was home, it was his kitchen, and he was laying on the kitchen floor, but how... \u201cAlright Mr. Smith, I'm really in a hurry. You should put yourself some ice on your neck, while I bring your package to the post office, OK? I'll come back later again to see for you.\u201d, the handsome teenager said, taking the money from the table, and went for the kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind still blurry and everything hurting, Mr. Smith tried to sit up on his kitchen floor. He didn't really know what was going on, was it all just a bad dream? Did nothing happen of what seemed to has happen before? Was his nightmare, over? \u201cEww, yuck...\u201d, Mr. Smith suddenly heard Tommy say from the left, which immediately sent a shudder through his body. \u201cMr. Smith, it seems you have ants in your kitchen. I just stepped on a few without noticing, and they were all smeared over your kitchen floor. But don't worry, I'll take care of your bug problem Mr. Smith.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... no, Tommy wait, I...\u201d, Mr. Smith's vision suddenly got blurry again and for a moment he thought he would black out again. But he was able to open his eyes, and... \u201cNooo...\u201d, Mr. Smith silently screamed in his mind. He was, he was the size of an ant again, no, he was smaller. But where was Tom..., \u201cI really hate insects Mr. Smith\u201d, a thundering voice started to speak. \u201cBut don't worry Mr. Smith, these two ants here in the corner seemed to be the last ones, and they met with their tiny little friends under my shoes, he he.\u201d. Mr. Smith looked to his right, and there was Tommy standing in one corner of the kitchen room while twisting his right sneaker. And then, suddenly he turned around, and started to walk up to the middle of the kitchen again, towards the table, and where Mr. Smith moments ago was laying on the floor. \u201cUh, Mr. Smith?\u201d, Tommy asked, while stepping closer to the kitchen table. \u201cMr. Smith!?\u201d, Tommy yelled louder, \u201cDid you go to the bathroom or something?\u201d. While Tommy came closer, his view glanced a tiny little remaining ant on the white kitchen floor and he started to smile. \u201cYo Mr. Smith, there's one ant left in your kitchen, but don't worry, I'll take care of that pest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all went so fast, that Mr. Smith couldn't even start to scream. The last thing he saw was the dirty sole of Tommy's right converse shoes, and then, nothing. His eyes shut, Mr. Smith suddenly noticed that he still had some kind of consciousness, was he alive? He tried to open, slowly, very slowly, his eyes and... what he saw sent a shock through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him sat two teenage boys, two teenage boys he got to know earlier under the names of Mason and Tony. \u201cNooo...\u201d, Mr. Smith silently screamed again. What he experienced moments before, the horror in his kitchen with Tommy, that was the nightmare, and he, he was still the size of half an ant in that flat with those three unknown teenagers. But what, where was he. Mr. Smith tried to move his right arm so he could scratch his head, but, nothing. His arm didn't move. Mr. Smith tried the same with his left arm... nothing, \u201cWhat the...\u201d, while trying to look to his left, Mr. Smith failed to do so too. But he was able to move his eyes just so far to the left, that he could see what was holding back his arm, and then he moved his eyes to the right, and then he started to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Mr. Smith just now realized, that he wasn't dead. That his nightmare wasn't far from over, and what happened to him. The careless step of Pete in the kitchen just moments ago didn't kill Mr. Smith. Actually Murphy's Law kicked in, again, and let one unlucky tiny little ant got stuck in the remains of a wad of gum. And now, Mr. Smith had no chance of escaping. His arms, his legs and even his head were glued deep into the gum. Forced to watch the two teenagers in front of him, all he could do now was listening to the sounds of the TV and the three boys, where one of them was having a wad of gum under his sneakers with a tiny little ant stuck in it.</span></div></div>",

Mason wandered after, coming to a halt next to the doorway with an thoughtful expression as he scanned the discoloured linoleum flooring. Countless tiny ants scattered in fear at the arrival of these two gargantuan beings, including one unusual \"bug\" that froze in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, they're everywhere. Shit....\" Mason stated flatly. He had been in and out of the kitchen numerous times during the day, never looking at the floor long enough to notice the tiny creatures foraging for food. He frowned as he noticed how filthy the floor was. \"This is gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Pete lumbered across the floor, only half-listening to his roommate. His soda rested on the counter next to the dated refrigerator. After retrieving it, he sauntered back to Mason. \"Yep, pretty damn messy.\" He idly sipped his frothing soda pop. \"You should clean it up before it gets worse.\" Pete hinted, always glad to push chores off to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete gave an unconcerned grunt before lumbering back to the living room. The sound of the television called to him, and he was growing bored. He didn't notice the many ants he smashed under his sneakers as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason scratched the back of his head. Like his buddies, Mason contributed to the current mess, adopting an \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude. Unlike his buddies, he was grossed out by messes when finally confronted with them. His room was the tidiest out of the three, but only by a slight margin. Better late than never, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all just an inconvenience to him. Not appreciating just how huge and powerful he was to such minute creatures, Mason approached the pantry. The aged sliding door opened easily for him, presenting a view of the sparsely stocked pantry. A few cans of soup, boxes of cereal, a broom, and a few other household supplies sat before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping his foot idly, he inspected a can of Raid, which proved to be empty. Next to it sat a box of glue traps that the landlord had left a few months ago, and a plastic-handled broom leaned against the wall. A small gnat peskily buzzed around his face as he considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud explosion from the television show caught his attention, and he looked back with annoyance at his two roommates sitting visibly in the next room. \"Lazy bastards...\" He muttered, and reached for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tiny moving specks mingled in the filth. \"Uh, yuck!\" Mason scowled. Stepping forward he prepared to begin sweeping, bent on doing at least some good to the filthy apartment the three teenagers lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason lifted his sneaker up, revealing the crunched remains of a pretzel. \"Dammitt, Tony!\" He glared at his seated buddy in the next room. Tony had spilled the bag of salty snacks a few weeks ago, and made a point of telling them that he cleaned all the pretzels up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the crushed pretzel, Mason began sweeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dear God! No!\" Bryan screamed at the sight of the humongous broom-wielding teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigantic skate shoes large as mountains crashed heavily as the teen stepped away from the pantry. Like viewing a disaster movie, Bryan saw fleeing ants disappear under the giant sneakers. A sickening crunch shuddered through the tiny man's very bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMITT!\" He managed to discern from the uproarious thunder that was the titan's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant inspected what remained of the pretzel casually. His planet-sized face scowling with annoyance only made his towering visage more frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here before this blundering fool sweeps me up!\" Bryan looked to and fro in desperate haste. His heart sank, realizing he was in the middle of the expansive floor, trapped. <i>Trapped</i>. The word seemed to echo through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden movement ahead brought him back. The titanic youth was on the move, violently sweeping destruction in massive swatches with his deadly broom. Ants and crumbs alike were swept up in the thick bristles and deposited in a pile of dirt or mangled within the hard bristles. Any that didn't get caught by the gigantic broom were carelessly crushed by the enormous shifting skate shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud boom emitted from the behemoth teen's huge mouth. The words were indiscernible to tiny Bryan, who felt as if he had been caught in the apocalypse. Ants skittered around him in fearful frenzy. Following their example, the bug-sized man sped away from the oblivious giant, squealing and waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Bryan face-planted in the dried remains of a flattened ant. \"Wake up! Just wake up! It has to be a nightmare!\" He cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to bolster Bryan's hysteria, the huge broom whipped by, scooping tiny ants and smashed crumbs into its dust-filled bristles. The tiny man cried out in shock and ran in the opposite direction. He was completely helpless. A broom larger than a small town thundered across the floor, piloted by a gargantuan teenager with little regard for anything tiny. Suddenly he was encompassed by a large shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough force to throw Bryan back, landed one of the monstrous sneakers. The huge guy stood idle, glancing at his smart phone that vibrated in his pocket. Bryan only had eyes for the looming skate shoe. Unlike the other giant's footwear, this pair was less trashed, though still well-used from its tattered stitching and grime-covered sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DCSHOECOUSA\" Bryan mouthed the large brand name that was pressed into the hard rubber. An enormous DC logo was plastered on the suede of the sneaker, in splashes of white and camo, and towering many stories high. The black suede was discoloured with dirt, and he could see clumps of mud jammed in the thick lugs of tread. His stomach turned at the site of an ant, half-crushed, struggling vainly against the unfathomable weight pressing upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving survived this long, the tiny man needed to act before he was ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the clever picture his skater friend shared, Mason had halted his sweeping and stood with his phone in-hand. He was completely oblivious to the diminutive drama unfolding at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the skateboarder looked away from his phone and frowned suddenly. \"Ugh. This is fucking lame.\" Cursed the once-determined Mason. A whole six minutes had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway done, the swept floor looked better already. It was a lighter shade, closer to the original cream colour from so many years before. The unswept floor looked a sorry sight still, more so when compared. Mason hated cleaning. It was the main task assigned to him at work by his asshole boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncaring of anything at his large feet, Mason leaned against the nearby counter and propped his foot so the sole showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the room blankly, he decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He scanned the kitchen floor, noting the patches he had missed. After pocketing his phone, he snatched the beat up broom and started sweeping haphazardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued sweeping Mason noticed that in spite of his progress, there were numerous spots where the grime stubbornly remained in place. He brought the broom to the nearest such spot, and tried to use the bristles to remove it. He could feel the broom stick to the floor as he pushed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason let out a growl of annoyance. Someone had spilled who knew what and when it had dried, the sticky spill collected all sorts of refuse from the floor. Still glaring at the spill, he could see a couple of ants stuck in it. Sneering with disgust Mason lifted his shoe over the bugs. Utterly apathetic to their extended entrapment in the spill, Mason dropped his shoe down. He felt his shoe stick to the floor, more concerned with that minor annoyance than his callous extermination of the ants. Pulling his shoe free, Mason didn't give the ants a second thought, instead wondering what was on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to miss more than he had to by mopping, Mason decided he had done the best he could with just sweeping. Snatching up the dust pan, he began sweeping up the pile of dirt and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan didn't wait to take advantage of the suddenly immobile giant. He immediately fled towards the looming counter as it was the only feasible shelter in any direction. A number of ants it seemed ad the same idea, and though they showed no interest in the tiny man, Bryan still made an effort to steer clear of the frightfully large insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous roar of disdain sounded from above. An ever curious man (as a scientist should be!) Bryan couldn't help but turn back to see what was going on, unconsciously slowing his pace as he continued to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain sized teen towered over the scene, his brow furrowed in annoyance. His eyes were grazing the floor, though his focus was more in the middle of the room rather than where Bryan currently was. Without warning, the cruise liner of a shoe lifted and swung towards Bryan with unsettling ease. Bryan screamed, picking up his pace again as the shoe landed on it's toe, the sole soaring above like a sheer cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan halts as he can't help but stare in stupor. Above him, the many crevices twisted together to form the company's logo in the dark tread. Crammed into seemingly every crevice was one type or another of debris. Near the toe were the pulverized, white crumbs of the pretzel so easily crushed. Higher where the arch of the foot would be, Bryan could see a disgusting dark mass that had been compacted tightly into the crevice. In a couple places he could see some surviving ants, hopelessly trapped in the grimy tread. They struggled fruitlessly, too simple to know of their inevitable end underneath the shoe of the oblivious giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gusting sigh brings Bryan's attention up to the giant's face again. His expression is now one of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll never be able to understand just how monstrous he is. He is so far removed from the world at his feet\" Bryan thinks to himself. \"And I've made myself a part of that world! One where I am among specks easily disposed of, often simply be being unnoticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's heart skips a beat at the last thought. His entire time in the teenagers' apartment had been hell due to their lack of attention paid to the ground underfoot. Any attempts at contact had been complete failures, and part of Bryan had accepted these behemoths would do far more harm than good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering shoe whisks away, landing on the floor with a resounding thud. The gigantic young man has resumed sweeping! Bryan had wasted precious time to escape deep in thought, and he remained out in the open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screams, resuming fleeing towards the base of the counter. The broom crashes down at random, it's rough bristles scraping the ground as it plows across the floor. As he is running, a small part of Bryan can't help but be baffled that a simple household chore had become a terrifying nightmare for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not been swept away, Bryan feels hopeful he will reach the counter unscathed. At precisely that moment, the broom slams down in front of him, eliciting an embarrassingly high pitched scream from the tiny man as he abruptly halts.The bristles bend under the pressure from the behemoth, but seem stuck to the floor. After a few seconds the broom lifts away, like a moving forest. Bryan can see ahead of him, amidst random crumbs and dust, a few ants appear to be trapped, struggling ineffectually to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been headed straight for that death trap! Ironically he had been saved by the broom wielding giant. He lets out a laugh, suddenly appreciative of the massive teen. Maybe he wasn't so monstrous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM Where there had been a group of defenseless bugs, there was now an island sized shoe firmly planted. Bryan stared in shock at the wall of rubber and suede that was starting to fray. A loud smack echoed across the expanse of the floor as the shoe ripped away. Bryan can see bits of grime raining down from the exposed sole. Even more disturbing is the brief view of ants, ripped in half between the sticky floor and filthy shoe sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconcerned with the tiny lives extinguished by his callous actions, the gigantic teen drops his foot to the ground behind Bryan. He wasn't even given an opportunity to further ponder the unknown power held by the enormous young man. Because before he could react a filthy, flat object descended from the sky. It was a dust pan, coated in a layer of grime and as expected, dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan only understood the danger he was in a mere second before the bristles of the broom slammed into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason swept up the majority of the mess onto the dust pan, not bothering with the unavoidable line of minuscule dust. He fails to notice the tiny speck amongst the crumbs, dirt, and twisted hairs. He takes a couple steps towards the overflowing trash can. Deciding he would make it work, Mason dumps the dust pan. A swoosh followed by clattering as the dust settles amongst the trash signals success, though he misses the bit of dust that gently rains onto his shoe. Mason returns the broom and dustpan to the pantry, sliding the door shut once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with a job well done, Mason pounds out of the room, unaware as ever of the helpless ants snuffed out by his careless steps.</span></div></div>",

Though a harrowing experience, he couldn't deny the feeling that he was on some giant slide. He reached the end of the dust pan and hurtled into a free fall. All around him, massive debris rained downwards. Looking down revealed mountains of disgusting garbage, the nauseating smell threatening to overwhelm the tiny man. In spite of this Bryan is thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is falling directly into the opened top of his crumpled box! Hitting the cardboard wall roughly elicits a grunt of pain from Bryan as he starts rolling down the incline towards the floor. He lands in a heap, on top of the dumped dust that had collected in the box. Looking up reveals the face of the behemoth as he leans away, disappearing beyond Bryan's sight. Quaking steps fade in both sound and intensity, signaling the giant's departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of calmness settles over Bryan, this ordeal would soon be over! He takes a deep breath that devolves into a coughing fit caused by the combination of stench and dust surrounding him. Upon regaining his breath, Bryan stands, looking around his warehouse like box. The thing sits at an angle so that the floor stretches upwards. The walls are buckled and deformed from when Mason had effortlessly ripped it open. The handkerchief is spread over the far corner, hanging over the top and out into the trash. His various supplies are half buried in the dust that had accompanied Bryan into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffs in disappointment upon realizing the antidote is not on the surface.

For the last hour they had been completely engrossed by a marathon of a mutual favorite show. On the table next to his recliner, Tony's hand rests on the final bite of his sandwich he had yet to finish off. He doesn't notice the stray ant that was exploring the hill of food. Pinching it between his fingers, Tony brings it to his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash from the kitchen gets all three boys to jump, Mason literally out of his chair. \"What the fuck was that?\" Pete asks his voice tinged with confusion and fear. Tony shrugs, staring at the doorway that leads to the out of sight kitchen. Mason shrugs \"Hell if I know bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud sounds from the kitchen, followed by gasping breaths. \"The fuck?\" Tony breathes, closing the recliner and standing up, sandwich still in hand. He stomps towards the doorway, hunching his shoulders in preparation for whatever, or whomever, was in the kitchen. Mason and Pete follow just behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner brings him a sight he would never forget. A pale, older man tiptoeing around the kitchen, avoiding the ants, mumbling apologies as he stares intently at the floor. In addition to that he is stark naked, and looks disheveled as though he had just survived in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE?!\" Tony bellows, unable to react any other way. Mason sputters in confusion, and Pete hits the ground laughing hysterically. The man looks up at them in surprise, before his features twist into anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!!\" he shouts pointing a finger, before jumping from the kitchen onto the carpet beyond the doorway. Tony stumbles backward away from the stranger, bumping into Mason who is still babbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU MONSTERS EACH ALMOST FUCKING KILLED ME!!\" the man shouted furiously. Tony doesn't respond, though his face clearly communicates his complete confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man let out a humorless laugh, \"You don't even know!\" he snapped, his voice quieter but still aggressive. \"I was just a fucking bug in your kitchen, and you all tried to kill me!\" he paused to breathe \"Hell you didn't even have to try! Your careless steps were enough without any effort on your part!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Tony exclaims. Behind him Mason has grown quiet, and Pete is wheezing from his continued laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are <i>monsters</i>!\" the man growls. \"Torturing and killing tiny bugs just because you're bigger and you can. Maybe even worse is that you're killing them just because you can't be bothered to see what's underneath your oversized feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stares at the man, unable to respond to his rant. Feeling the food in his hand, the one thing that made sense, Tony brings it to his mouth. If he was eating, then he didn't have to respond to the psycho in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pushes past his lips, the man lets out a disappointed howl. \"Oh you eat them too!\" he said, throwing his hands in the air. Tony chews and swallows his food. \"What?!\" he asks, his mouth gaping in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough that you're annihilating them with your feet, you have to eat them too?!\" the man shouts. \"I can't do this, I need to leave!\" he says taking a step forward. Tony tries to step backward, while Mason goes into defense mode behind him. The resulting collision, sends them both sprawling onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scans the living room, \"I'm taking this\" he states bluntly, snatching up a threadbare blanket form the sofa and wrapping it around his naked form. Pete, who's laughter had subdued, descends into a fit of giggles. This was absolutely ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, I hope I never see you monsters again!\" the man said haughtily, before marching to the front door, wrenching it open, and loudly slamming it shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys are left in shocked silence, aside from the sounds of the forgotten TV shows, and Pete's subsiding snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we call the police?\" Mason finally asks. Tony is still sitting on the floor, frozen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he faces Mason. \"And tell them what? Some naked fag appeared in our kitchen, yelled at us and stole our blanket?\" Mason's response was an incredulous shrug, while Pete literally started rolling on the floor laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony felt a tickle on his hand, and noticed a single, brave ant crawling over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, fucking bugs!\" he snapped, shaking it off and smashing it with his palm.</span></div></div>",

Grunting, Bryan moved on to another sections of seemingly endless dust dunes. He dug through the silty grime, uncovering large hunks of dried food, and unidentifiable wads of sticky gunk. Any calmness he felt before seemed to be quickly draining, as the tiny man felt desperation replacing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid over crumbled structure of paper half-buried in dark dust and resumed searching. Far off, Bryan could hear the dull roar of television accompanied by an occasional thunderous voice. Those damn teenagers remained completely oblivious to Bryan and his bug-sized plight. Frowning, he allowed these fuming thoughts to stoke his search, but in his fervor failed to notice the dusty soil beneath him shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bryan snapped from his jaded digging with a screech. \"What the?\" The ground beneath him shifted, and not a moment to soon Bryan rolled away just as two jagged mandibles rose out of the dust like a sea monster from the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Christ!\" Bryan screamed again, backing up to distance himself from the angry bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant remained half-buried, thrashing a head large enough to crush Bryan like a kitten. With violent determination, the ant pulled itself out of the deposited dirt, clashing and clacking. The shrunken man gasped, realizing the large creature was missing two legs and appeared painfully twisted as it trundled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized many more ants were slowly excavating themselves from the devastation. Some that had already freed themselves were either attempting to escape, or searching the dusty dunes for others. It seemed reminiscent of the aftermath of a bomb. Ashen ruin all around, and the injured survivors pulling themselves free of the wreckage; it almost made the bug-sized man sympathetic for the unfortunate bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he knew such thoughts were better left alone. Somewhere in this mess was his formula - a tiny bottle, no bigger than his palm, and hopelessly mixed with thousands of pounds worth of dirt and dust from the giant's floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find it - before it was too late!</span></div></div>",

Pangs of soreness rang through his body from all the sudden exercise he had been put through. Bryan had never bothered to keep himself in shape, it never seemed important until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkittering shapes could be seen in the distance all over. The ants were returning now that the huge young residents had left. Some ants seemed to be inspecting their lost brethren. Spotting the floor, and especially visible near the fridge were the flattened splotches of these unlucky ants. It was unreal to him that all this death was nothing to the gigantic guys, only an ant infestation. The huge teenagers had no idea how destructive and cruel they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan settled near a large metal column that supported the massive appliance. The powerful hum the fridge produced felt almost comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to rest, falling into a deep slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason had been the first to retire to bed at half past 12 am.

He scratched his arm, not noticing the tiny ant that was sent flying by his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing interesting appeared to him from the flickering screen. Clicking the device off, the young guy stood up, sweeping sandwich crumbs off his shirt. He stopped before the archway leading to the kitchen, his eyes blurry with sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered grabbing something else to eat, desiring more fold solely from boredom. Tony didn't noticed a group of ants that hurriedly sped moving their purloined cheerio after seeing the gargantuan Tony stomp into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning lazily, he decided against it and lumbered off to his room, his steps rattling the tiny inhabitants.

He had been dreaming that none of this had ever happened, that his entire ordeal with the shrinking formula was just a dream itself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling hum generated by the gargantuan appliance help set in the cruel reality. He was still smaller than an ant, resting under a refrigerator in a strange home occupied by unknown giants. Bryan covered his face with his hands, stifling a pathetic cry. It all seemed so hopeless. Looking up again, the huge expanse of kitchen floor only disheartened him further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis make-shift resting spot didn't offer any consolation to the tiny man. Many years of collected dust now coated him, along with a foul scent that seemed to seep from the humming darkness above. He couldn't even find any edible food particles. Only some boulders, many larger than he was, and half a Cheerio that sported a mossy texture, were all that resided under the fridge. Further back into the darkness, what looked like a dead beetle sat like some forgotten memorial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan listened for any signs of the dangerous occupants. He proceeded out into the open floor with timid steps, his hands wringing nervously and his stomach feeling quite empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite end of the expansive space, a digital clock rested high on the wall. Bright red numbers read 6:58 AM, in the dimly lit room. The tiny scientist felt better knowing that the titanic teenagers would probably be asleep for many more hours. \"It is now or never... I can't waste any time.\" He breathed, not thoroughly sure what his course of action would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should try and find a way out of this place...\" Was his first thought, thinking back to how huge and oblivious the teenagers were. The layout of this apartment was unknown to him, and precious time would be wasted in exploring it. Looking up, he noted the lofty counter tops. \"There is no way I could climb that height\" He noted to himself. Trying to gain their attention from the floor was just suicidal. Hopelessness began to set in as he remained undecided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his gaze drifted to the trash receptacle on the other side of the kitchen. It rested in the corner, at the end of the counter, looking filthy. This wasn't important to him. The crumpled remains of his cardboard haven caught his attention, resting precariously on the crest of a mountain of trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The antidote!\" Bryan had completely forgotten about the carefully formulated serum. This presented itself as a very possible salvation, since the trash bin itself was only half the height of the looming counters. New hope burning inside him, Mr. Smith began the long trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis progress was naturally slow, due to his size and restless sleep. Around him, the floor slowly began to re-populate with ants, ever ready to risk their lives for food. Bryan passed many dozens of flattened ants, pressed into almost unrecognizable splotches by the careless giants. He tried to turn his head away from the dried remains, but they seemed to be everywhere he looked. Bryan reflected grimly how close he had come to the same fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the end of the kitchen, he found himself an equal distance from the trash bin and the doorway leading out. The digital clock proclaimed the time as 8:49 am, so Bryan's time was wearing thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he try and escape, or attempt to recover his antidote?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was bent on choosing between climbing a gigantic trashcan, or fleeing an apartment. Bryan pulled at his hair in frustration. Dirt and refuse had turned his usually groomed hair into a greasy mess. He wanted nothing more than to wake up in his bed, safe and normal, and destroy all of his research on this accursed formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up he noted the clock. \"I've got to get moving!\" He urged himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of encountering one of the three giants that occupied this apartment made Bryan tremble. He had far too many close calls, and his luck surely wouldn't last forever. He also didn't see himself scaling the sheer side of the humongous trashcan to retrieve an antidote that may not even be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I'm going to run...\" He bit his lip. \"What other choice is there? These blundering behemoths are far too dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, tiny Bryan Smith sprinted towards the vast doorway leading out of the dingy kitchen. It took nearly 30 minutes, but he finally crossed the threshold of linoleum to carpet. Like the sticky linoleum, the carpet was a horrifying sight itself, displaying all signs of misuse and age. Stains, dried spills, and food smashed into the fibers made the floor a revolting display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear God, how can they live like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan set his sights on the front door. It was fortunately not far off, resting on the immediate wall to his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds of footsteps, and rushing water alerted the tiny man that his time was short. At any moment an enormous teenager would come stomping out and cut his journey short. With this thought, he crossed the final stretch to the base of the massive door. The huge fixture towered a dizzying height, causing Bryan to marvel at the sheer size and power it would take to open. A thick weatherstrip lined the base of the door, worn and crumbling from age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching it slowly, he scanned for a possible gap or tear. At his size, the smallest split in the material might offer him passage. Lady Luck seemed to be smiling on him, as he discovered a spacious tear in the weatherstripping under the door that allowed him easy exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is probably how all the ants are getting in.\" He noted with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway outside the teenager's apartment was like a whole new world. The air smelled less stale. No wandering aromas of dried food or sweat assaulted his nose. Dusty linoleum covered the floor, speckled with clods of mud and boulder sized pebbles all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no closer to salvation, but hope bubbled in his tiny heart nonetheless. \"Now I just need a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned his gaze, scanning for a destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left, the hall ended suddenly with a window, and a vending machine pressed against the adjacent wall. To his right, the hall stretched on and on. Other doors leading to apartments unknown lined the hall ending in what looked like a staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBristling himself, the bug-sized man went...</span></div></div>",

Bryan had experienced his fair share of dangerously large people, but he had hardly been given a chance to explore the world from an insect's view. The vending machine, already a looming monument from afar, looking quite interesting. His grumbling stomach also led him to hope there might even be some crumbs of food to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the last of his fears, the tiny scientist trotted towards the humongous machine. Not even halfway there, he noticed a loud looping hum emanating from the appliance. It seemed to resonate through his entire body in almost a lullaby melody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" He looked up in wonderment. Displayed beverages and candies sat in display upon the glass covered shelves. \"The food and liquid in there alone is enough to end world hunger and thirst!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of this nature had helped spur his ambitions in developing the shrinking formula. He fancied himself winning a few dozen prizes and being praised as a paragon of humanity after unveiling the miraculous formula. These thoughts made him smile, but truthfully, Bryan had far more selfish desires at heart when creating his shrinking solution. These desires turned out to be far more dangerous as a reality, as evidenced by his life threatening experiences not even a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen to the regular person, the underside of the vending machine was a sight to behold. Tangles of dust, hair, and dirt had collected under the machine in large amounts, all visible enough by the sparse light filtering in. Bryan quickly forgot these when he spotted a group of large crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I won't be hungry when I go to get rescued!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had almost forgotten just how impossible it would be to find rescue at his size. Tearing a morsel free from a crumb larger than he was, he looked it over thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like graham cracker,\" He sniffed it. \"Smells like it...\" Timidly biting into the chunk, he chewed slowly. \"Not too bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther oddities were strewn under the huge machine; Crinkled wrappers, a couple bottlecaps, and a pool of strange smelling liquid dripping from the vending machine itself. He noticed he wasn't alone either. Large beetles, or at least what he thought were beetles, seemed to favour the hospitable space. He noted a couple of dead ants laying near a box that sat just under the vending machine. A hole was poked into the side of the box, allowing entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his stale chunk o' crumb, he decides....</span></div></div>",

Darkness made any writing or illustrations on the packaging unintelligible to the already near-sighted man.

Low, yet strong, the machine released an electronic <i>hum</i> that was almost soothing to tiny Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the large box, Bryan was startled by a loud commotion from down the hall. He saw the distant form of a person exiting their apartment and heading towards the staircase at the other end of the hall. Returning to his investigation, he passed two dead ants, cringing at their grisly greasy bodies, and stopped before the gaping hole punched into the side of the box. Large clumps of dust spotted the dark interior, as well as stray crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also smelled. \"...some kind of chemical scent\" Bryan noted with a wrinkled face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to enter, Bryan...</span></div></div>",

Light filtered in, becoming dimmer as each moment ticked on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...dammit...no...\" He gurbled, lips and tongue feeling heavy. \"...just gotta...gotta...get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bryan was on his knees. He couldn't figure out how or when, but then his head lurched as if he had fallen asleep momentarily. Alarm spread through his mind like wildfire, yet his body felt numb and heavier than lead. He needed to escape. The exit was right there...or was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see it anymore. Everything was dark and whatever he could discern seemed hazy, like a gauzy filter from an old movie had been put over his vision. \"Sh-shi-....shhhhiiiiiittt.....\" He said. Barely a murmur, but using the last bit of cognitive strength before he flopped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely blank dreams overtook him. Nothing, like a surgical sleep before waking what felt like mere moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't that, Bryan realized as everything shuddered with the force of a distant bomb. Sticky, congealed vomit had pooled around his head, jellifying both hair and skin to the oily surface beneath. Bryan extracted himself with a groan. His body felt immobile -- filled with sand and sorer than any after-gym experience had ever left him. Another earthquake rattled beneath, shortly followed by a distant boom. It made Bryan think a building had collapsed. Was World War III happening? He gasped, but looked around again, peering through a roughly hewn portal that looked out upon a massive world. Something moved out there...a person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunken! And....and....the poison! This strange space -- smelly, oily, and dark -- was that fucking bug motel he blundered into before collapsing. Bryan gasped again, pulling himself up. That thing outside wasn't a person; but an ant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthquake returned once more just then, rattling Bryan who had just begun shambling for the exit. Instead, the tiny man watched as something too big to comprehend rushed across the visible terrain outside. Redwood sized stalks of black, rough and matted, swept over debris and ant leaving only microbial bits behind. Bryan screamed, confused. What was happening? What was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain it returned, rushing past with hurricane force and thundering noise before leaving. Then the endless world darkened, reminding him how a huge cloud might shadow the earth. Unlike those peaceful memories, this cloud fell with such concussive result that Bryan was thrown to the ground, squishing into the cold vomit. Colossal mass of dirty, scuffed black rubber filled the view outside the box. Deep noise emanated, the vast dirt-stained surface shifted with intimidating effect that made Bryan feel thankful for his cardboard haven, no matter the poison. More noise filled the air with roaring notes of deep-toned squelching that caused the shrunken man's skin to goose pimple. It lifted and was gone, followed moments later by a deep quaking crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his breath, never considering the absurdity of it as he felt consecutive quakes. Outside, the vast landscape was riddled with chunks of dirt and chalky boulders once more, left behind by that enormous mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on? Bryan's genius mind felt cloudy, intoxicated by whatever normally benign poison was contained within this horrid trap. Nothing made sense. This all felt like some weird dream still. He had been lucky to have survived it, but he needed to get out before it got worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any action could be taken, it returned. Bryan braced himself with a terrified yelp, roughly jarred as the incomprehensible mass crashed landed outside. The muffled sounds of it returned as well, groaning and compressing like some vast industrial structure against gravity. Bryan felt a burst of foolish bravery hit him, compelling him to rush outside and face it. It struck first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared like vast heavenly pillars...no...towers belonging to some mythic god. It hit Bryan like a brick of ice, rushing with memories of everything that happened before. The tribulations he had experienced at the hand of those giants. \"Oh, god. Giants...\" Was all he could muster as he realized the enormous towers were fingers. Huge fucking fingers; and headed straight for him! Most left his vision as they neared, thudding against the ground sluggishly, like massive monuments collapsing. Contact resulted in one tiny man being flung inside as the entirety of the gigantic bug motel was pulled from beneath the vending machine and lifted into the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like some adrenaline junkie's wet dream: rough swaying, rocking motions accompanying intense G-force and wind that combined induced extreme vertigo. Some kind of vast, sheer enormity rushed past, dark material and stitching barely discernible. All the tiny, terrified scientist could do was serenade the heavenly rapture with a scream that was anything but angelic. Ghastly, blood-curdling terror. All of which went silent as something new encompassed his view outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride subsided, his teeny stomach swaying thankfully inside and vertigo subsiding, allowing Bryan to gaze out at the eye of God looking right at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh my...God!\" He tried to stand, but instead dry heaved. The floor rocked and swayed roughly, making it hard for him, but the stubborn man gazed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beautiful and yet existentially terrifying at the same time. He felt like it was consuming him, dissolving his very being like the fool Icarus who drifted too far from the mortal realm. Dark black waters seemed to swell, bits of what seemed like significant chunks of dust and debris tainting it, swirling around as the entire mass pulsed and contracted. Beyond this darkness was a vivid paradise of warm hazel and greenish tides. Bryan couldn't even look upon it wholly. It was a literal ocean. Suddenly, a low, almost watery, rushing sound interrupted and the vast eye was overtaken by a wave of towering trees followed by oily, bumpy flesh. It impacted a similar mass with a muffled thud and violently retracted, washing back over the watery ocean and out of sight. Bryan just screamed, tepidly moving forward as he vocally vied for rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed sacrilegious even to the normally agnostic Bryan, like an affront to God. Was he looking at God?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all rights, it seemed only God could be this imposing and powerful, and in agreement to that thought, this god began rattling the bug motel with cruel impunity. Bryan screamed, impacting a larger deceased denizen of the bug motel before he flung towards the entrance, barely locking fingers against the rough side to avoid falling. The vast space outside gusted happily to greet him. Humid, smelly winds rushing through his thin legs while Bryan gaped downwards. He could see dark, ragged towers stretching down to huge filthy black work boots. Vertigo shot through like a fiery harpoon. The boots were planted like mountains over the grimy linoleum floor. A tiny black ant could be seen veering past the toe of the right boot, reminding Bryan that the floor below was much more a vast landscape than it appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fucking god dressed in utility pants and work boots. Who was he? Some kind of maintenance worker? Did this guy even graduate highschool? All he had done was pick up a cheap bug motel; nothing more. Holding Bryan's tiny, seemingly insignificant, yet still-human life like some celestial creator and arbiter; and the big guy had no fucking idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been mere seconds, yet it was enough to put Bryan into an existential crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pulled himself back in. His breath quick and short, following the rhythm of his heart and his mind a flurry. The massive bug motel swayed again, jolting Bryan from his thoughts as the unfathomably huge man stirred the bug trap again and peered inside. Had he noticed Bryan? He couldn't even see this behemoth's face, much less comprehend him or his enormity. Was contact possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please! Please, help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The space seemed to be growing dimmer - the exit vanishing with it - and Bryan muttled a faint squeak. His eyes closed and his head sagged heavily as he slumped over, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was as helpless as the insects the trap was intended for. He lay there, twitching and turning a ghastly green while the toxins took their toll upon his weak body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance of another hapless victim, who thrashed and grunted violently upon realizing the danger, failed to wake tiny Bryan. His suffering didn't last long--ending a short time later when his twitching ceased and after all he had been through: he fell still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any normal human being, the tiny palm-sized box looked no more threatening than a stick of gum. In fact, the colourful design splayed across all sides of the box read, \"Non-toxic! Safe for use around pets and children!\" This of course was true for anyone but a bug-sized man; who had less resistance to the poison than some insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, the apartment building's very own janitor and maintenance guy, appeared a few hours later. His uniform consisted of dark coveralls, gloves, work boots, and a backwards cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy far, he wasn't the most thorough (or hard-working) guy. Evidenced by the buildings faulty electricity, scuffed floors, and creaking stairs. The insect problem, now plaguing most of the tenants, was all but ignored by him--who instead placed a few traps, sprayed some Raid, and told the tenants to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his tool belt, supplies, and a trashbin, Sam had been cleaning along the hallway for almost an hour before he reached the vending machine. He brought his broom around the edge of the humming machine. Bits of dust and crumbs swept out, including unsuspecting ants that were scattered on the floor near the janitor's heavy boots. Boredom and routine made his mind numb while working, and Sam swept it all into a loose pile. He was just finishing when he noticed the small shape of the box beneath the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Bout time I checked these things,\" He said, crouching down to retrieve it. \"Let's see how many it caught...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had poked the hole through the cardboard himself, using a screwdriver. Bringing it up to his scruffy face, he squinted at it with a frown, unable to peer through the tiny hole to see inside. Instead, he brought it up to his ear and gave it a little shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I got a few in there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small box was easily smashed in his hand. Crunching into an unrecognizable clump, effectively obliterating the deceased occupants. Oblivious and uncaring, Sam tossed it into the wheeled trashbin and returned to his cleaning, mentally noting the need to place another one later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fear that had been learned from his life threatening encounters with giants. He gawked at the gigantic socked feet; Shifting slightly, the toes raising up and down, one slightly visible through a worn spot. Frayed denim covered the towering legs, but past the tops of his feet, Bryan could see no more of the mysterious giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sigh sounded from above. Noises that indicated the enormous man was working the machine could he heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't get himself to move. All his blissful curiosity had melted away, leaving him a petrified man no larger than an insect. He wanted rescue, but the thought of running out there was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo ants scurried past one of the massive feet, tiny as specks in comparison. He envied their foolhardy courage as they went on their way, unnoticed by the busy giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just stay under here! He can help me, I just need to be discovered.\" He told himself, though not believably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering out from under the safety offered by the vending machine, Bryan gazed upwards. If he was to run out and risk his life, he wanted to know who he would be encountering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting at the dial pad on the machine, the gigantic man noticed nothing on the floor below. He had short dark brown hair with the same dark colour stubble covering his jaw. A white t-shirt with some band logo covered his torso, and he wore wrinkled jeans. His mouth opened into a gaping yawn as he clumsily punched in a code for the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as though he had just gotten out of bed, pulled on some jeans and left his apartment without even putting shoes on. He looked far older than the callous teens from before though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is still early...\" This guy didn't seem likely to notice him in such a groggy state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill watching the huge titan, Bryan debated what he should do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, there was a lot of food here, so he'd have some sustenance, but that would only last so long, and who knows how many bugs were living under here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided to leave the cover of the vending machine, and began running towards the impossibly huge man standing before the snack-dispensing skyscraper. The enormous socked feet of the giant guy were planted in front of the minuscule scientist. He ran and ran until he was near the smallest toe, concealed by what seemed like extremely thick cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared straight up, and instantly felt like he was standing at the bottom of the Empire State Building. He was reminded of why he had decided to make the shrinking formula in the first place; for perspectives like this one. It was so entirely fascinating. Everything looked so different, and despite being so vulnerable, it was a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, though, Bryan did realize just how vulnerable he was, standing directly in front of a huge foot. He knew that he needed to act, and he needed to act quickly, in order to ensure his preservation and eventual restoration to his original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we two choices he foresaw. One, he could try his best to get the giant's attention before he left the dirt-covered hallway. It seemed unlikely, seeing as the giant man was preoccupied with getting his early morning snack. But, Bryan thought maybe punching the toe in front of him might illicit a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other choice was to hitch a ride on the socked foot. The cotton provided many hand holds, so Bryan would have no difficulty in holding on. Then, the giant would carry him to his apartment, where Bryan could formulate a more secure plan for getting the guy's attention. The only con to this option was that he would lose his guarantee of food under the vending machine...but it did provide a longer window of getting the guy's attention than the next few seconds he would be standing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pondered, the time for making the choice quickly running out.</span></div></div>",

It seemed as though the socks hadn't been cleaned for days, evidenced by dirt stains and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud clanking that resounded through the ground alerted the tiny man. He watched a huge hair covered arm, thick with decent muscle, retrieve an enormous bottle of orange juice. There looked to be enough frothy orange liquid in there to fill an ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feared for a moment that his chance had gone, and the giant would leave. This proved otherwise, as the giant container of juice was set nearby on the ground as the titanic man began browsing for more edible goods. Looking back to the humongous socked foot before him, Bryan considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unimaginable in size. Easily larger than any battle ship, or commercial ship, the size was positively daunting. Gigantic toes concealed by sock shifted idly, curling and lifting at random. The ground trembled as the other foot lifted, shifting slightly in position as the huge stranger browsed. Despite threading that provided large enough gaps for the minuscule man to climb with, Bryan felt it would be pure folly to try scaling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at a sizable hole in the thick material, exposing an entire toe almost. \"I could get his attention right here and now,\" Bryan considered, mapping out a plan. \"He would have to feel me if I touched his bare toe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping nervously with his plan in-mind, Bryan approached the massive toe. The white sock has been worn down, the threads breaking enough to allow his middle toe to be visible. Such a tear would of bothered tiny Bryan to no end in his own socks, but this gigantic man didn't seem to care. This apathy was an opening for potential rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris let out another gaping yawn, his eyes blurry with grogginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend had nudged him awake that morning. Insistent nudges coupled with whines of, \"I'm hungry\", \"Go get something\", finally found result. The 25 year old rose from the bed, yawning and scratching. Rumbles in his midsection agreed with his girlfriend. He pulled on a t-shirt and his jeans and left their apartment. Despite being almost noon, Chris planned on sleeping in late today with his girlfriend. He worked late last night and such a rest was well earned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering out the front door, he headed towards the vending machine at the end of the hall. His filthy socks slapped the linoleum floor heavily, picking up more dirt on his large sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tapped in a three-digit code, buying himself a bottle of orange juice. That suited him just fine, but his girl asked for one of the pricier drinks. A single dollar remained in his wallet, that he stared blankly at still half-asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp to that point, he had no thought or regard of anything at his feet. Something as small as an ant would be nearly invisible to him, as well as insignificant. Slight tickling sensations bothered his right foot, which he shifted without thought. Moments later it persisted, prompting Chris to glance downwards in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his foot back a bit, wiggling the offending toe that peeked from a tear in his sock. Chris grumbled with annoyance. Ignoring it, he reached into his pocked, feeling for the change he put in there a couple days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sensation returned. \"What the hell?\" Chris muttered in a deep, groggy voice. His bleary gaze returned to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny, barely noticeable speck scuttled away from his shifting foot. He glared at it, realizing it was a stupid ant. Without much thought, he raised the harassed foot over the pesky bug.</span></div></div>",

Dirt and crumbs covered the moist sole. Bryan saw a single ant, smashed almost beyond recognition on the ball of the foot. He shrieked for mercy, incredulous at his own stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout remorse, the enormous foot descended. Bryan's last thought was one of disgust at the hideous smell given off the gigantic man's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this place is infested...\" Grumbled the bleary-eyed man, his dirty socked-foot raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot came down with a heavy <i>thump!</i> Dragging his foot back, he frowned at the sight of two other ants scurrying under the vending machine. Chris was anything but squeamish. His foot shifted, preparing to erase these newcomers in the same fashion. They vanished into the thin gap provided by the machine, safe from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stifled a strong yawn and returned his attention to more important matters. He studied the selection of quick snacks offered by the vending machine, trying to decide what his girlfriend would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea. Maya would want tea...\" Chris mumbled. Sliding the change pulled from his jeans, he clumsily punched the code in. The plastic container shifted and dropped into the chute loudly. Chris grabbed it and smiled at the container of green tea. \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to return, he blindly reached down for his orange juice. Instead he knocked the juice over, cracking the cheaply-made bottle cap. Cussing, he quickly grabbed it before more than a thumb-sized puddle could be lost. Both containers in hand (one dripping) the young guy stomped back to his apartment. Maya stood in the kitchen, nightgown covered with a robe, cooking eggs. She cooed happily at the sight of the tea and pecked him on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grinned, seating himself on the couch and propping his feet on the table. Filthy socks with soles coated in dirt, lint, and a few mashed ants were conformed around his size 12 feet. He sighed, resting his head back and taking in the smell of cooking eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant he flattened never entering his mind again as he relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A loud rumble from above shook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?\" The groggy voice roared from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man squeaked. Memories of eerily similar experiences came to him. \"God, wait I am not a bug! Wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfazed by his diminutive cries, the enormous socked foot lifted suddenly. Bryan's eyes went wide with terror at such a sight. He saw crushed crumbs, splotches of dirt and even an utterly flattened ant on the ball of the sock. In red stitching, the brand name \"HANES\" stood out on the filthy sole. Staring dumbly, the shrunken man shook himself into action and bolted with flailing arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming above, the huge toes stretched idly and the foot descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, fu-... Shit!\" Chris was groggy and rather unbalanced, causing his body to stumble and knock into his juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly steadying himself, the young guy groaned at his fallen orange juice. The lid, cheaply made in China, had cracked and precious swallows of his beverage leaked onto the dirty floor. He bent and picked up the bottle. Gazing at it sadly through bleary eyes, he noted that a good quarter had spilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCussing softly, he glanced back to the ground. The pesky ant was gone, fleeing like the lucky bastard that it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had half a mind to grope for it under the large machine, but figured that would be a little silly. \"Stupid ant...\" Chris muttered scornfully. He turned his gaze back to the snack items scratching himself idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bottle of green tea caught his gaze. \"Tea. Maya likes tea...\" He yawned, attempting to stifle it but failing. With the extra change he discovered, Chris purchased the expensive drink with a jump due to the loud clang when the drink dropped into the chute. \"Perfect...\" Sighed the young guy, holding both his juice and his girlfriend's tea in-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Chris, the \"stupid ant\" watched in fear from under the vending machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decides...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A rank stench drifted from his monster-sized feet clad in dingy socks. One of the gigantic socked feet shifted, sending a noticeable shudder through the floor. Bryan couldn't believe he survived. He was so tiny, and the young man was so impossibly huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have survived worse,\" Bryan said. \"I should of known better...\" He felt hopeless. Telling himself to not try for help was more than disheartening. Tears welled in his eyes. Bryan sniffled and wiped them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to the humongous man, who seemed to be more than a little groggy. Despite his incredibly close call, Bryan felt a twinge of excitement looking at the massive human being. More scandalous thoughts began to enter his mind as he leered at the giant man's form, taking in his muscled arms covered in dark hair, and his dangerously large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised a hand to his mouth, stifling a monstrous yawn. Bryan gawked slack-jawed. With slow, but smooth motions the giant shifted and stomped away. His huge feet raising and slamming down with powerful concussions. Glimpses of his filthy sock soles were given, reminding Bryan of his close call. He would of been flattened underneath the humongous foot, and the gigantic owner--thoughtless to just how huge and dangerous he was--would of been none the wiser that Bryan was anything but a pesky bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt a pang of regret when the gargantuan guy lumbered back to his apartment, vanishing from view with a slam of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar back out into the open floor, Bryan noticed a clumpy lake of spilled juice. \"What a callous slob... He just left it there for somebody else to clean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his stomach gurgled. The orange pulp alone would be as large as he was. It would more then suffice as a meal, and then some. The shrunken scientist was not alone in his observations; scuttling ants began to approach the juice pool already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWringing his hands, Bryan considered.

I can eat all I want when I am rescued.

This, coupled with his frequent bouts of hysteria, made him concerned for his mental well-being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to get help...\" He began, but stopped realizing he spoke out loud again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hefty crash sounded from a distance, alerting tiny Bryan. He peered out into the spacious hallway, spotting the source of the calamity. A single giant appeared from one of the doorways, lumbering with a powerful, sluggish gait. With a grunt, the titan pulled a bicycle through the door behind him and slid a backpack over his shoulders before stomping down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched - looking the young titan over as he moved. He looked familiar. The tiny man watched the enormous shoes lift and slam into the ground heavily every step. With a jolt, he realized this was the same frightening giant from before that attempted to extinguish Bryan under his huge dirty sneaker. This time, the gigantic youth was heading away, taking his large and dangerous feet with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan let out a sigh, relieved when the giant vanished at the end of the hall. He knew one thing: There was no way he was going back there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he appeared to be stranded in an apartment complex. There had to be dozens of potential liberators that didn't include the careless teenagers. All he had to do was make himself known as anything but an insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought conjured memories of his numerous close-calls. His body tensed in response, as well as ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, all Bryan's attempts had resulted in disastrous failure. Worse than disastrous, in fact, all nearly resulting in the poor man's demise! They would of murdered him and not even known it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time will be different... I am a human being,\" Bryan stated, trying to build himself up. \"A genius! This break-through is too valuable to die with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, he was shouting out loud and welling up with emotion. Instead of calming himself, an errant ant came bustling by and knocked the tiny man over as it passed. Bryan yelped, fearing his end had come in the form of a lowly ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking bug thought differently and continued without remorse, leaving the self-important man behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Bryan bolted upright and began running. He made incredibly small progress, but eventually put some distance from the looming vending machine towards the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is damn near poisonous!\" The tiny man squinted and puckered his face, waggling a hand uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been so preoccupied with the intimidating view, that the putrid odor had gone unnoticed. Now that he smelt it though, there seemed to be little else to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BETTER GRAB SOME TEA...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan clutched over his ears with a squeak. The thunderous voice seemed to boom against the ground with such power, that his whole body rattled. High above, the giant punched the dial pad with a building-sized finger. His planetary face showing an expression of grogginess and boredom. Completely above noticing some as tiny as Bryan, the monolithic man jabbed one last number before planting his meaty thumb over the \"enter\" key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud <i>clunks</i>, <i>clanks</i>, and a final <i>thud</i> made Bryan jump. He realized his window of opportunity was closing - fast! The giant would retrieve his tremendous beverage and leave... without Bryan! One last look above, Bryan turned his attention to the living mass of cotton looming before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick woven strands spanned the massive surface, creating treacherous ravines between each weave. Across this filthy surface jutted many loose strands, most within easy reach. Higher up, many spots looked threadbare and allowed the bug-man to see the enormous shifting toes hidden beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I am going to... Oh, dear! Here goes nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeled for this next adventure, Bryan leaped and latched onto a loose thread. He quickly scrambled against the woven surface, pulling himself higher and higher. Barely a minute went by, giving the tiny man only a slightly better position on the mountainous small toe. Bryan looked above and saw the giant man's tanned, hairy arm reaching overhead, loudly pulling a tower of iced tea from the machine depository. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen began the ride of his previously sheltered life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!\" He dug his thin arms into the threading, closing his eyes tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had ever been passenger on a falling meteor, Bryan could be certain this was far worse. The impact of the colossal foot was tremendous. Such force, that if he had been any lower on the toe, his tiny body would of shattered. Blood seeped from his mouth - indicating that he had, in fact, cracked some teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other foot had landed. With it a shuddering vibration rattled through the foot he was riding before it too lifted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes burning from the intense G-forces and smell, Bryan held on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVending machine drinks in-hand, Chris turns and slowly plods down the hall to his apartment door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes for granted just how effortless the journey is. To him, a mere 14 feet down the corridor, and he crossed it leisurely. It was something Chris did daily - almost mindlessly as he pounded heavily over each square of linoleum. Never once did his thoughts stray to bugs, or for that matter, shrunken scientists and other insignificant creatures. Chris only had thoughts of his breakfast and chugging down his machine-bought beverage with his girlfriend, Maya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther residents exited their doors, some greeting Chris while others minded their business. He gave a groggy acknowledgement to one neighbour dressed in jogging gear who waved back before vanishing down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the door, Chris idly begins searching his pocket for keys. \"Yeah... left it open... right.\" He mumbled, shaking his head. Two misguided ants vanished beneath his socked foot, completely unnoticed by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris turned the knob and entered, greeted by the sing-song of Maya's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tossing the bag of cookies onto the kitchen counter, Chris heads straight for his bedroom, and drops heavily onto his mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan in seconds concluded there was no way out of the bag. That was pretty clear due to the impossibly high, smooth aluminum colored walls. Not that it mattered either way. Because at the same time Bryan had concluded that he was hopelessly stuck in some frosting between the Oreo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had tried to venture out for help, the Oreo had slammed into him from above. Though not hurt, he was immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh why?\" Bryan whined. It was not a specific question but rather a why to everything that had led him to this exact point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis analytical mind quickly decided that self-pity would get him nowhere.

It had been swept from the floor when the giant had retrieved his snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crinkling from above got Bryan's heart pumping. Long fingers reached through the opening and grasped one of the dust covered cookies. \"Oh ew no!\" Bryan shouted. Through the hole he could see the giant's face. He stared at something else and never looked at the cookie before effortlessly popping it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan can't suppress a cringe as a crunch sounds from the titan's mouth. He panics and tries to find a way to free himself, but simply has no options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crinkling signals the return of the fingers. They surround Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" he screams as the fingers close on his cookie. He struggles fruitlessly as he is lifted. As he stops in front of the lips Bryan holds still. He doesn't even breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick lips, surrounded by some morning stubble, slowly part. Light floods the interior, glinting off sharp, white teeth and the strands of saliva between them. Beyond that the tongue stretches into the darkness of the throat, its surface smeared with soggy Oreo crumbs. Bryan can also clearly see a clump of dust from the floor, stuck to the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE NO!\" he screams, breaking his silence. As if in response, the gargantuan jaws snap shut, and the giant turns his eyes to the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Bryan cheers, staring into the pond-like eye. He can't even see himself in the reflection of the cookie in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA falling sensation is his only warning before he finds himself back in the bag of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK THIS!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking around presented Bryan with a layout not dissimilar with the teenager's apartment. But, instead of a wall separating the living room and kitchen, only an island countertop tiled in off-white ceramic, separated the two spaces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on this island that the shrunken scientist found himself. \"It's big enough to fit the entire city!\" Bryan remarked, padding around as he gawked at the new surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something strangely exciting about exploring some complete stranger's home - while they were home - without their knowledge. Bryan looked from the monumental bag of cookies, carelessly strewn over a massive area by the callous giant, to the kitchen. It was honestly not much to look at - cream coloured cabinets; boring appliances; and the usual condiments or supplies tucked away. Craning his neck, Bryan looked at the tubular mass of light that lit the room, emitting a low humming noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other vista concerned the living room. A simple blue couch, old-looking arm chair, and plain, but tasteful decorations made the room what it was. Bryan assumed the presence of a woman besides the man because of this, since he doubted such a oblivious oaf could ever think to decorate anything but an empty plate with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people at least seem to keep a tidy enough place - unlike those goddamn kids! I just need to find some place they can see me!\" Bryan said thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began investigating the empty landscape of field-sized tiles. Before he got far, he stopped with a gasp and narrowed his eyes. \"Fucking hell! <i>Ants</i>!\" Sure enough, on the horizon Bryan could clearly see black shapes skittering across the massive counter like himself. There were only a few, but the tiny man figured these were just scouts and more would follow in their wake. \"I need to make sure I don't get confused with those fuckers... Not again! There has to be...\" Then his little eyes settled upon something set upon the counter like a massive rectangular stadium in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan yipped as he approached - <i>it was perfect</i>! A cellphone left upon the counter with the screen facing up. The idea immediately formed in his mind: all he needed to do was climb up, sit himself upon the enormous screen, and wait for the behemoth owner to spot him upon such a conspicuous surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly decided, he swished happily towards the cellphones side. It was of the smartphone variety; thin and sleek; but loomed over twice his height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be difficult, but doable in comparison to other seemingly impossible feats he had accomplished today. Off to his left, Bryan identified a button - long and metallic against the white casing, and visibly worn from repeated use. It proved just the thing as the bug-sized man scampered up the side, grabbing the slick edges and pulling himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling invigorated for the first time, he prepared to position himself on the massive black surface.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a strange experience, Bryan thought as he padded across the slick surface. To the naked eye of a regular viewer, it was nothing but the smooth screen of a touch-pad smart phone. But, Bryan Smith had an impossibly more detailed view of it: dramatic dents coated the surface, caused by daily wear and tear. To the tiny man's dismay, the surface proved to be coated with slick oils left by the gigantic owner, along with dried gunk that dotted it like foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my best bet to be noticed,\" Bryan said, ignoring the rather disgusting state of the cellphones surface. \"I'll stand out like a sore-thumb here - it's a sure thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que, Bryan heard a terrible crash that emanated deep within the apartment. Moments later, the speck of a scientist paused to listen, both hearing and feeling distant pounds that grew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seismic disturbance grew enough that Bryan fell to his side. He bopped his head against the dark surface, quickly trying to pull himself upright. Just in time, he watched the behemoth man who unknowingly brought him here appear around the corner. The entire room seemed to tremble with every step, as if the giant enjoyed stomping around instead of merely walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unprepared, Bryan devolved into a clumsy ritual of screams and frantic flails in a plight for attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a skyscraper of mythic proportions, the strange giant overtook the horizon. Unlike such a construct, this colossus moved and flexed, lifting a monumental foot for each step that sent powerful vibrations through the countertop. More quickly than he liked, the titan headed straight for Bryan's location, halting at the counters edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts raced, bordering on panic. \"H-h... HEEELP! Pleaaase, HELP!\" Each note seemed hopelessly shrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him towered a sheer wall of white fabric. Plastered upon it, bigger than Bryan's neighbourhood, was a faded logo that resembled some sport team. The looming folds of cotton shifted against the gargantuan guy's body. A simple action that more closely resembled a snow-packed mountain crumbling before an avalanche. Bryan screamed again. High above, the unknown titan's face was visible, looking directly at him without a shred of recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck... Please....\" The ant-sized man babbled. \"Oh, fuck! Just help me dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only response was a parting of the lips and an unleash of cataclysmic sound from the giant's mouth. Even from so high up, the noise blasted Bryan with a shock-wave that sent him reeling, and large globules of saliva and meteorites of chewed cookie. The disheveled titan looked utterly unimpressed by his own power, raising a hand that could easily encompass the entire town, and wiping it against his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the same appendage was lowered rapidly towards the gigantic cellphone. The sight of the out-stretched fingers turned the minuscule man's pleas into wordless shrieks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands behind his head, Chris smacked his lips and blinked sleepily. Shifting, he looked to his wrist for a moment before realizing it lacked a wristwatch. Grabbing it from the nightstand, the time shone out to him via digital numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only 9:30? Fuuuuck,,,\" The young guy grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris groggily strapped the watch on, fumbling with the clasp, and rose up from bed looking around as he scratched. The bed was unmade, and he knew Maya would get onto to him about it. He would worry about that later. Instinctively, he reach into his pocket for his phone, but felt nothing. Blinking, he suddenly remembered and cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prolly gonna be dead,\" Opening the door, he tromped down the short hallway. \"Fucking starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor boards creaked with each step that carried him to the kitchen. Upon entering it, Chris spotted the device upon the counter, near the bag of cookies he tore into earlier. His mind determined their fate as destined for his stomach, but he focused on the smart phone that lay on the edge of the counter. In his grogginess, Chris had set it down before pounding off to sleep again, he stupidly forgot to even plug the damn thing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at it, he hoped it wasn't dead. Without a thought, he belched loudly, not noticing bits that spattered against the counter and phone. A sting of acidic orange and chocolate flavoured his mouth while he wiped crumbs and saliva off. Snatching the phone with the same hand, Chris looked at the dark screen as he repeatedly depressed the power button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" He cursed. He wanted to check his mobile games, but now he had to wait for the fucking charge to build. \"<i>God-fucking-shitting-chr</i>...\" The string of baleful cussing halted when a small form slid across the phones surface. Still sleepy, Chris attempted to hold the phone steady and squinted. The shape squirmed and then began moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little fucker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant wriggled around on the screen, sliding due to Chris's slight movements. He merely frowned at the pesky intruder, aware only of how gross and inconvenient it was to him. Never once had he ever thought of bugs as anything but a nuisance. And, this damn apartment building had so many problems with bugs: in the hallways, in the bathrooms, and especially in the kitchen. Maya hated them, and their existence annoyed Chris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a small burp, he blew on the indignant ant, sending it sliding, but it still remained. Grunting, he just tilted the phone and swept it off. The insignificant shape was lost to him instantly, and unless he spotted it fucking around again, he could care less. At least it was just an ant, and not another cockroach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to believe his intense misfortune, Bryan found himself relocated to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It appeared much like the previous apartment--except this kitchen was open to what looked like the living room. A humming fluorescent fixture cast light into the kitchen, giving the room a cold white glow. Bryan continued looking around, his eyes narrowed when he spied a hallway that emitted rumbling snores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scratching sound caught his attention. Curiosity--something to be expected from a scientist--drove Bryan to investigate the strange noise, that seemed to be coming from the living room. Crossing the span of tiled counter top, he approached the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe open space at the ledge was daunting, turning Bryan's stomach with vertigo. He peered at the vast room. Decorated with a leather couch, coffee table of teak, and an entertainment center with an impressive DVD collection. Tasteful pictures, and window dressings gave the place a homey look, and showed the definite signs of feminine touch. A pair of sneakers set next to the shelves seemed the only indication of a male presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething across the room caught his attention. His skin prickled with recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have a pet...\" He said, squinting for a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn animal of likely mammoth proportions, he figured. Judging by the size of the pet bed, it didn't seem to be a chihuahua. \"Even that would be gigantic\" Bryan mused at the thought of a Cerberus sized toy dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough. I've got to get out of here!\" The teenager's apartment had been a death trap, but he felt at least a small attachment to them. Nodding, Bryan spied the front door. \"At least they keep the door painted\" It lacked the peeling, stained texture of the teenager's apartment, and instead sported a dark blue paint job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided that escaping would be relatively easy. The open floor plan would give Bryan almost direct access to the door if he descended the looming counter that met the wall adjacent to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he hadn't already come to the conclusion to leave, the next thing he saw left him no choice. Quick and nearly silent, swept a cockroach of terrifying measures. Bryan fell back with a squeak at the sight, watching the monster bug skitter towards the spilled bag of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Dear God... cockroaches?!\" Above all insects--except arachnids--Bryan despised cockroaches. It never occurred to him how prevalent insects were until he explored the world as one. He felt queasy just thinking of such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, now more assured in his decision, looked for a way to the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Smack! Gulp!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches into the bag and pulls out another cookie, a coating of dust on one side goes unnoticed. As he raises it to his lips, his cell phone rings. With a sigh he stands and retrieves it from his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe!\" he says to Maya, her voice buzzing over the phone.

But Bryan also knows there is nothing out there for him. If he leaves, he abandons the only antidote. Having no idea where in town he is, his chances of returning home safely are nearly zero. Even if he did manage to get there, at his size, what could he do to help himself at that point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turns and faces the looming tower of trash. Thankfully the towering teens who used it had poor aim and often left things where they had fallen. The resulting mountain of trash seemed far more accessible to the tiny Bryan than it would have if everything had been inside the garbage can. Near the top of a pile resting against the side of the bin lay the crumpled remains of his box. And surely the antidote as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment was still as silent as it had been when Bryan first woke. He continued to pray that it would remain that way as he approached the trash can, heading away from the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to zig-zag around scattered crumbs and wandering ants, Bryan's progress is slow. However his determination is not dampened. This entire ordeal had been a nightmare and though he was proud of his discovery, Bryan was pretty sure he had experienced being tiny enough for several lifetimes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the mountain of trash appears taller as he approaches it. However he freezes when a creak cuts through the silence. He turns abruptly but a faded off-white wall blocks his view of what he can only assume leads to the giants' bedrooms. Nothing more happens and Bryan quickens his pace, though it seems to make little difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a couple minutes later a loud groan echoes from the unseen hall. Bryan gasps in surprise but this time doesn't stop moving. An extended creak is accompanied by a grunt and is followed by some thuds. Footsteps. Someone has awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a seconds long pause before the footsteps begin again, each one sounding closer. Bryan desperately searches for somewhere safe but has nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there is a slam of a door followed by hissing of water. Thankfully the giant, which ever one it was, was visiting the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels panic coursing through his body and fights the hysteria threatening to overwhelm him. Ahead the field of debris across the filthy floor stretches a fair distance to the mountain of trash. He is so sick of the constant fear. \u201cWhy did everything go wrong!?\u201d he shouts at the sky, or rather the far above ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muted sound of water, first a sink and toilet and then a shower, is constantly in the background. Delayed for now, at any second a giant could come thundering down the hall. Bryan smiles seeing that he has managed to cross most of the distance to the trash can, though he still hasn\u2019t reached the disgusting peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had smiled too soon as the sound of water ceases. Bryan only stops for a second, before he starts to run. After an agonizing minute there is a long creak from an opening door followed by a few thuds and a slam. Most likely the giant has gone to get dressed, which means he only has a few minutes at best. Bryan needed to make them count!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony sighs as he plods into his room, his bare feet still wet from his shower. \u2018Someone needs to sweep\u2019 he thinks unhappily,  feeling dirt and crumbs clinging to the soles of his feet. After pulling on a fresh shirt and pair of jeans, he reaches down and lifts his foot to brush it clean before pulling on a pair of socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crosses the room he ruffles his brown hair and pulls a faded hat over it. The floor creaks in protest as Tony stops next to his shoes. He glares down at the faded, and filthy pair that are starting to fray. Just the way he likes them! Slipping his long feet into them, Tony pulls his door open and slowly stomps down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rounds the corner from the hall into the kitchen, Tony stretches and yawns loudly without stopping. His footsteps shake the room, as his massive sneakers crash down onto the crumbs and helpless ants scattered across the floor. Tony however is focused on the fridge ahead and is completely oblivious to his monstrous presence in the world at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggled to catch his breath. As soon as Tony had appeared, Bryan remembered how tiny he was. Tony easily dwarfed the dated counters, tall even by giant standards. Bryan had broken into a sprint, as he was finally closer to the trash than he had been since arriving in the disgusting apartment. Each quaking footstep threatened to knock him over. He could see the wriggling forms of ants mere seconds before they disappeared beneath the gigantic shoe. Though he had seen it so much in such a short time, he doubted he would ever get over how callous and oblivious the giants were to the tiny creatures sharing their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan\u2019s yawn echoed around the room as his footsteps thundered by. He stretched, the muscles flexing in his towering frame. As Tony reached the fridge Bryan moved slowly towards the mountain of trash. He had incredibly enough reached it in one piece. No longer concerned with Tony\u2019s cruise ship sneakers and soaring height, Bryan instead focused on how to scale the mountain of trash standing before him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan was nearly out of breath as he reached the base of the huge trash receptacle. He swallowed nervously as he took in the sight. Sheer walls of dull steel rose up to meet a bulging mountain of garbage. His cardboard package, stained and torn, was just visible from his position far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall the kitchen floor was filthy with crumbs, spills and dirt, but around the trash can it seemed to be concentrated. Ants monopolized the fallen refuse, clustering around sticky lagoons of dried soda and carrying off bits of crumbs. Bryan gave a disgusted scoff as he maneuvered around the busily foraging insects. Being finicky, Bryan could not believe that people could let this much filth accumulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued, the shrunken scientist scoped the towering receptacle for any means of climbing. It was all for naught, as the dirty, yet sleek sides of it yielded no handholds. Despair began to wash over him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so close... There must be some way...!\" He sadly looked up at the package high above. A line of skittering ants easily climbed the side, which made Mr. Smith glower sourly. Why was he so weak and useless? He had no abilities beyond his intellect to aid him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage suddenly filled him. \"No! It's not fair!\" Bryan stamped his feet and flailed his thin arms in contempt. Why was everything against him? He snatched a fist sized crumb and hurled it at the climbing ants. He wasted all his time getting here for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would require an act of God to help him now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoda, milk, more soda, a bottle of beer, and various other condiments lay before Tony in the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted, considering the sparse selection. This happened nearly every morning, nothing easy to eat. Tony hated it, but he never went out of his way to restock the fridge beyond buying pizza or take-out. His eyes settled back on the carton of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCereal was always a good choice. \"Crap...\" The soggy carton of milk felt rather light, revealing that only a small amount of milk was left. An apartment with three teen aged guys was always lacking in food. A reminder grumbled from his stomach, causing Tony to sigh. The young man would have to go out for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carton of milk was still in his hand. <i>Might as well finish it off</i>, he figured. With a single gulp he drained the remaining milk and wiped a trickle that ran down his chin. He patted his firm stomach and turned away from the dated appliance, closing it with a slam. Imagining himself as a basketball star, he lobbed the empty dairy carton towards the trash bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit!\" Too much force. The carton collided with the teetering pile of trash collected at the top, causing it to fall to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, he crosses the kitchen to the mess, his heavy gait thudding on the floor. He came to a halt, standing over the mess. Almost a dozen various items of trash had fallen on the floor, some spilling whatever remaining contents they had. The offending milk carton, three Styrofoam cups, a small cardboard box, and many other trash items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony unhappily surveyed the spread, thinking only of how inconvenient and annoying it was to him. The tall youth was unable to appreciate the mortal danger he represented to the tiny world below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if the sky was falling. Huge objects, larger than buildings, crashed to the ground around him. Bryan dove to the ground covering his head in futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GODDAMMIT!\" Bellowed a deep voice like thunder from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shakily raised his head and gawked at his changed surroundings. Disheveled ants crawled around furiously. A gigantic cartoon cow leered at him from a mountain sized milk carton, and beyond that lay huge soda cans, Styrofoam cups, and... His box! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abused cardboard sat a good distance away from him, sporting a dented edge from the fall. He couldn't believe it, it was the miracle he had been hoping for! With clumsy excitement, Bryan sprinted towards the large package. His mind rang with happiness as he ran on pure adrenaline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis miracle came with another obstacle. Thunderous steps shook the floor. Bryan was knocked back to the ground as the enormous Tony approached, his huge skate shoes crashing down on the unsuspecting ants. The titan came to a stop, looming over the trash ridden landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan followed the huge denim-clad legs that towered up to a massive torso. A faded hat shaded Tony's giant face, giving a more dark and cruel appearance. Tony scanned the ground with contempt, the \"Independent Truck Co.\" logo on his black t-shirt clearly legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gulped roughly. Despite himself, he felt his little body frozen with fear. His salvation was so close, lying in wait just a short distance away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just needed to be quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, why don't those two ever take the trash out?\" He never bothered to take the trash out either, but he could hardly blame himself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony glared down at the trash. A terrible scent was wafting from it, causing him to frown more. Leaning down, Tony grabbed a Styrofoam cup laying near his shoe. Giving it a quick inspection, he discovered it was covered in tiny ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fucking gross...\" Dropping it back to the floor, he lifted his sneaker and crushed it with a muted crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the mess, he sighed and scratched his neck. The trash needed to be dealt with.</span></div></div>",

It would easily dwarf the world's tallest skyscraper, with more height and mass to spare! Bryan couldn't believe it was just an ordinary cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCKING GROSS...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRang the deep thunder from above, alerting Bryan to the real danger. Quicker than anything that massive had the right to move, loomed a gargantuan sneaker over the cup. The dark mountain of dirtied suede and rubber mercilessly smashed down upon the cup with a tremendous boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe linoleum landscape shuddered lightly, while the giant twisted his sneaker with intent. Apparently satisfied, Tony lifted his huge foot away, allowing the decimated cup to fall free from the sole. The styrofoam had been utterly, and completely, compressed with ease - its broken shape now conformed by the tread of the huge sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt more terrified than ever. Despite all his brilliance and boasting of a high IQ, he found himself staring dumbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to appreciate the grandeur of his simple action, Tony reached for the trash bin. He decided to make the most of the nearly full trash bag. It would be a waste to open another, only to fill it immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the bag from the receptacle, Tony gave it a look-over. The trash sunk a bit deeper into the bag, now suspended from his hand, but still not enough to fit the fallen garbage. He stepped around the mess, preparing to open the pantry when his gaze stopped on the styrofoam cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been reduced to compacted shreds of its former self, taking up far less space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony felt the idea bubble to life in his head. With his size 13 and a halfs, he could make short work of the remaining garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, why didn't I think of this before?\" He grinned with childish excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashing stuff was always good fun. In this case, it even helped to clean up their trashed apartment. What could he lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The titan's next actions did nothing to ease his alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, why didn't I think of this before?\" Tony bellowed in that terrifying voice that jerked tiny Bryan's gaze skyward.

He took a deep breath, but then felt more terrified than ever when the enormous structure of frayed suede and rubber hovered over the building-sized postage box that still held the tiny scientist's vial of vital antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man felt faint with fear as he heard Tony's shoe drop with a loud crunch on the shockingly fragile cardboard container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, stop,\" the little man cried out in his weak, shrill voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant moved his massive leg, forcing the sneaker to twist violently while resting atop the flattened box. This final act of destruction left the cardboard flattened and ready for addition to the enormous plastic bag nearly filled with garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan reached quickly with one hand, plucking the ruined cardboard box from the dirty floor and dropping it into the bag with the other collected garbage.

His shoe crunched a soda can into a pancake of aluminum, sending another grin across the big guy's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a kid, Tony would always enjoy stomping discarded cans. His brothers often paying him a dividend for collecting them around the neighbourhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over some flattened cans, Tony surveyed his progress. \"That went fast!\" He grunted, looking over the now compact mess. The BMX enthusiast's eyes settled on a new prize: a cardboard milk carton. \"Awwh, yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo steps and he was standing over the defenseless Cow-a-Bella milk carton. He nudged the container with his shoe, turning it over to reveal the cartoon mascot on the front. Without giving the inanimate carton a chance, he placed his large shoe over it, covering the cartoon's face. It compacted into a soggy mess easily, offering no resistance to Tony's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fucking nasty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining milk that had been left inside the container had since curdled and squished out under his sneaker. Tony scraped his already filthy shoe off the smashed carton, and kicked it a couple feet away. He figured he could pick the trash up after he properly stomped it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he felt his excitement dampen. Besides some pizza crusts, shreds of paper, and other miscellany; everything was already crushed and compacted. It seemed his fun activity was over and now he had to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bored face, he crouched and reached for the carton. It was soggy to the touch, slightly dripping rancid milk, making Tony knot his brow in disgust. He quickly tossed it into the garbage bag and prepared to wipe his hand off when a slight sensation caught his attention. Another prickle irritated his wrist as he inspected it with annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking damn ants!\" He strung together his frustration and swept the tiny black speck off, back towards the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill crouching, Tony scanned the floor and realized a good many more ants occupied the trash ridden space; crawling and writhing among spilled crumbs and pools of splashed liquid. He paused for a moment to watch the invasive pests while an idea sparked in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother grin flashed upon his face, akin to the excited expression he had earlier. Standing back up, Tony adjusted the trash bad in his grip and turned his attention to the floor. Right after he arrived home, Tony had dealt with many ants near the refrigerator, stomping them out. Yet they returned, and since he was bored, Tony was going to eradicate these in the same fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his shoe, Tony begins by slamming it down upon a group of the hapless insects, finishing with a twist. He proceeds with this, crouching intermittently to grab scraps of trash and stomping his large skate shoes on any ants he sees. Bits of food in the way end up crushed as well, pressed into the aggressive pattern of his sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for a moment did the young guy stop to think - how any of his actions could be possibly cruel. They were just mindless bugs to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony spots more ants, crawling in sprawling patterns to escape. All for naught, Tony easily lifts his sneaker over and introduces them to the huge size 13 sole. He spots the last piece of trash, a crumpled microwave meal, and quickly snatches it up. Immediately, more than a dozen ants are revealed and begin to spread out in an attempt for freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony merely grunts and raises his sneaker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each touch from a spiky insect limb elicited a thin, panicked scream from the miniaturized man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose fears were nothing, however, compared to when the quakes started, produced by the cataclysmic stomps from Tony's massive Size 13 sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering from beneath the building-sized container, the tiny man saw a group of confused ants milling around on the dirty kitchen floor. Suddenly, in one swift, final action, the colossal sneaker crashed down, obliterating dozens of tiny creatures in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrunken Bryan felt the awful reverberations of the stomp as they made their way into his very bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCKING FILTHY PESTS!\" The titanic teenager growled with the fearful scorn of a titan far, far removed from the shrunken man's new place in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the ants sharing the bug-sized scientist's shelter, spooked by the vibrations from the mega-stomp, brushed past the tiny man as it ventured into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan cried, realizing that was the last place anything tiny and vulnerable should place itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the sharp-eyed Tony spotted the little bug. \"Oh, bet they're more of you little pests hiding in there,\" he said, staring down at the semi-crushed microwave food container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony's gigantic hand reached down and snatched the crumpled microwave meal carton off the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, more than a dozen tiny, dark shapes were revealed as they scattered in multiple directions in a panicked bid for escape. Among the fleeing dark shapes he saw one tiny, pale bug mingling with the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that observation, he wasn't too interested. Bug's a bug, after all. He lifted his sneaker, ready to snuff out another dozen or so lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan Smith screamed defiantly. \"Not some damn teenager stomping me like a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran faster than he thought possible, perhaps pushed forward by his desperate fear, but he couldn't outpace the falling shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Tony chuckling as he lowered the huge shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last futile show of defiance, Bryan Smith stopped and raised his hands in an assertive gesture demanding he be accorded the measure and respect afforded to any man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crashed his foot down, relishing the fact he could so easily eliminate the unimportant, reviled pests. He twisted his sneaker over the dirty floor, ensuring there were no survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the teenager, it was simply pest eradication. How could he ever know he had just obliterated one of the world's most brilliant, if misguided, intellects?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan Smith had invented the shrink formula, but he had failed to fully appreciate the meaning of a new place in the scale of things.</span></div></div>",

Leaning down, he gingerly grabs the crushed Styrofoam cup, trying to keep any surviving ants from hitching a ride on his hand. Tony tosses it the short distance to the trash can where it strikes the top of the remaining trash before tumbling back down to the floor, bringing even more garbage with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony grumbled under his breath in frustration. Stepping up to the trash, Tony roughly pulls at the drawstrings of the bag. It\u2019s so full, the can lifts with the bag and bounces off of Tony's legs. He grunts in disgust before using his knees to push free the bag from the can with a small pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBag in hand, Tony takes a step back. A crunch from the floor grabs his attention. Under his right shoe are the flattened remains of some box. With an uninterested snort, Tony lifts his foot and kicks it towards the center of the field of trash. He circles the kitchen, kicking any errant bits towards the center, where he could pick everything up all at once to toss it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rushed forward in a panic, blocking out everything except for his battered box ahead. An earsplitting crunch, however, got Bryan to turn his head in reaction. Running in one direction and looking in another caused the tiny man to stumble and fall. Sprawled out on the ground he stared up at the towering young man, who was lifting his filthy sneaker away from a pulverized, warehoused sized cup. Bryan could see flattened ants amongst the folds of crushed Styrofoam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to meet a similar fate, Bryan quickly stands up and bolts in the other direction. As he progresses, he resists the urge to look back in spite of the various sounds and crashes of the behemoth moving uncomfortable close by. Hulking pieces of garbage crash down around him but mercifully don't strike him down. Fear courses through his veins joined by adrenaline. He keeps running without pause, knowing reaching the box is his only chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Bryan is cast in shadow. Still fleeing, a glance upwards reveals a filthy shoe sole spotted with trapped grime and dead bugs flying overhead. \"NO!\" Bryan screams in terror as a split second later it crashes down onto his box, further crushing it. With a gusting snort from above is followed by a careless kick from the shoe, sending the huge box skidding towards Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally halts and rushes sideways to avoid be mauled by what ought to be his salvation. The thing screeches to a halt where Bryan had been standing moments ago. Around him other pieces of trash come skidding in as the giant kicks them into a more dense pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan only hesitates to find an opening through which he could enter the box. Having now been crushed twice, it doesn't take him long to find a conveniently placed tear. Feeling excessively thankful at the sudden turn of events, Bryan rushes up to the box and jumps in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony leans down snatching up the trash. He drops each item into the bulging bag, only pausing to compact the trash so he can force more into it. The last thing he grabs is the crumpled cardboard box. Unaware of its significance or the tiny man frantically searching inside, Tony callously drops it into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pays no notice to the sweat forming on his palms, and saunters out the front door into the shared hall. Marching right up to the trash chute, Tony crams the bag in and sends it on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry growl comes from his stomach, reminding Tony of his need to go out in search of breakfast. He quickly locks the front door and pounds down the stairs. Emerging in the sunlight, Tony takes a deep breath of fresh air before headed down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan meanwhile is...</span></div></div>",

He rubbed it and yawned, still groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him two strained attempts to sit up properly and look around. Bryan's blood went cold when the memories of his ordeal rushed back. He found himself still nestled underneath the dust and crumb ridden fridge. A world of dimly lit linoleum spanned out before him, stretching for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cruel sensation. Upon waking, tiny Bryan had initially figured it was yet another day of persistent back pain. He didn't want to believe that his current situation was real. Unfortunately, there was no mistaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rubbed sleep from his eyes and slowly ventured from the protection offered by the gargantuan refrigerator. The flat seemed still; no sounds of footsteps or voices could be heard. Only the thrumming of the kitchen appliances and what sounded like a fan broke the silence. Hovering over the world-sized kitchen was a digital clock, hung over the pantry door. It stated the current time with harsh red numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost noon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExclaiming this made Bryan shiver once more. He felt as if such a realization would summon one of the gigantic tenants to come stomping into the kitchen. Yet the stillness remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few ants had already begun their daily grind. Bryan noticed a small ground carrying a piece of cereal, while others investigated possible candidates for food. The tiny man also noticed the nearly unrecognizable splotches that dotted the ground. Among the multitude of flattened crumbs, were the smashed remains of unlucky ants. Just looking at their grotesque appearance made him want to hide under the fridge once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need to remain calm.\" He breathed in and out, albeit weakly. \"This is my chance to... to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt abruptly struck him.

It stretched for what seemed like miles; the flatness interrupted only by slight bumps in the material and collections of crumbs and food particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his gaze upwards and squinted at the dim atmosphere of ceiling. A single light rested in the center of the popcorn spackled ceiling, draped with cobwebs and dust. Bryan expressed his distaste for the environment with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messy kids... This place is uninhabitable to anything but freaking bugs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke the words, all around existed an ecosystem of such inhabitants. Ants scurried to and fro - some with wriggling white eggs on their back and others with large clumps of food. In the stale air above them flew flies and gnats. They zagged around, seeming almost like giddy pilots enjoying the freedom of the skies. Besides these benign examples, many other tiny creatures existed in the filthy apartment - all of which Bryan preferred to <i>never</i> interact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched two ants pass by, their mandibles clutching a particularly large crumb as they moved along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all these \"tiny\" bugs existed the three teenaged renters; each mostly unaware, or uninterested, in the menagerie of insects invading their apartment. Bryan felt a chill run down his spine as he looked at the doorway leading out of the kitchen and remembered just how big the giants are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicker of red broke his thoughtful trance and Bryan gazed at the digital clock set up above the space. It now read <i>11:42 AM</i>. The constantly ticking seconds filled him with a foreboding sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have left for the day,\" The tiny man assumed and began a steady pace towards the distant doorway. \"If I want to do anything, now is the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Bryan headed towards the rooms monumentous exit. He gave a brief glance towards the trash container; his shipping box hopelessly nestled on a summit of garbage. There was no way in any dimension he could reach it. For now, he would scout the gigantic apartment out and search for some viable options of rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, gross!\" His foot pulled from a pool of slimy gook. The <i>squelch</i> it created made him slightly queasy, especially when he noticed some ants greedily feeding from the disgusting slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the open doorway in relatively good time. The ants seemed disinterested in him as they scampered about, barely giving him a cursory brush from one of their antennae. The threshold into the next room loomed tall and wide, entering into another world space of the dingy apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight dimly emenated from a sun of frosted glass set against the cracked popcorn ceiling. Bryan noted a muted effect of sparkles that seemed to be mixed into the bumpy surface. \"This place is like a nightmare from the 1960's....\" He assumed this equally dirty room must be the main living space. A lumpy couch coated in lint and dust bunnies dominated the right wall. Across from it, stood a flatscreen of impressive size and grace when compared to the flimsy stand it sat upon. Between them, a coffee table towered on square legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that these three guys could live here seemed unbelievable. It more resembled some kind of flop house than the (very) modest home of three teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo other exits led out from the squarish space: one being a tall, thick door painted red and lined with locks. Underneath, Bryan saw what looked to be some paper notice that had been slipped beneath the jam. He didn't feel comfortable leaving the place, despite his misfortunes, and turned away to survey the hallway. To his immediate right, the hallway stretched seemingly forever - though likely no longer than a dozen feet. Four doors were miraculously crammed into the walls, all closed but for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be where their rooms are.... I <i>could</i>...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off, looking from each of the huge doors. The mere thought of entering the bedrooms owned by these young giants made him feel slight elation. Entering them unbeknownst to their owners made the feeling all the more potent. When it came down to it, Bryan had had other intentions besides cheap travel for his shrinking formula. The giants in question didn't fit Tommy's standard, but were interesting nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's decision felt swayed towards exploring, yet he knew that rescue should be his top priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thick metal wheels supported the single mattress and a humongous wall of vandalized pinewood could be seen as the headboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet that is comfy!\" Bryan mused. He scrambled over a splintered pencil that lay in his path. It had been nearly an hour and his progress into the room was slight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan directed his gaze from the mammoth mattress to his destination at the foot of it. Wrappers of all colours lay heaped at the base of the bed and towering nightstand. As he approached, Bryan thought the discarded foil and plastic more resembled a debris field left in the wake of some colossal war than simple packaging for snacks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, his nose was assaulted by new smells - thankfully something besides the pertinent stench of body odour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell! I'm famished... and stale or not, this is a meal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ducked under a torn scrap of shimmering plastic, barely taking note of the grinning cartoon character that spanned the surface. Underneath the wrapping, Bryan squinted and peered in the dimness before gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate!\" He pealed while giddily swishing his thin form towards what could be a lifetimes worth of chocolate. It easily outclassed a semi truck in mass - and all made of solid milk chocolate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to dadd-...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's rollicking suddenly cut short when he found himself no longer alone. An ant peered through a tear in the wrapping, flailing and clicking inquisitively. It scuttled inside without any regard to Bryan's presence or regard to his finder's claim. A thick antennae came lashing out like whip and knocked the tiny man off his feet. The ant quickly fell upon the large chunk of sweet with feverish excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You ungodly fucking bug, that is mine! I found it!\" Despite the anger welling inside him and his hurt pride, Bryan didn't dare rise up from his fallen state. The ant - normally, nothing more than a simple, common black house ant - was capable of tearing him in twain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his tongue and watched the greedy bug with disdain. It buried both mandibles into the jagged chocolate surface and lifted the huge chunk into the air with a simple turn of the head. Bryan could only watch as the impressively adapted insect exited the plastic interior, chocolate in-tow. Just like that, Bryan was alone once again. This time without any over-sized chocolate to keep him company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Bryan cursed the rude bug, vowing to take his revenge on their kind when he returned to normal. The thought made him grin; but would have to be nestled away for later, as he had more pressing matters to attend to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the plastic foil, Bryan looked over the ruined city of crinkled, torn, and discarded wrappers. There were many more of them - and undoubtedly more crumbs to be feasted upon. Many more ants populated the area: weaving in and out of the colourful scraps, some clutching crumbs, while others busily followed in lines. His flair for exploration felt dampened after his rude altercation with the ant. Little solace was offered by a small chunk of chocolate left on the floor near his feet. It wasn't much, but something to sate him and for that he could be thankful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazy rays of sunlight beamed in from a window set high into the wall. Posters and wall hangings surrounded it, along with a clump of hoodies, jackets, and hats hanging beside it. A large draping blanket was messily pinned over the bed. Looking up at it, it was evident that this young man's decorating left a lot to be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many damn hats... Jesus.\" The bug-sized man remarked, his head craned back to better view the immediate wall. The brims of many caps could be seen poking from the ledge of a shelf. Bryan could only fathom why this kid would need so many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching his meager chocolate chunk, Bryan continued to investigate the collection of wrappers on the floor. He was less eager than before, but no less diligent because of the constant stream of car-sized ants skittering about. The bugs did good work cleaning up. Crumbs were hard to come by, even small shavings that would be insignificant to an ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan passed through a canyon created by the colourful snack foil. One side sported nutritional facts stamped in letters eight feet high, while the other depicted a group of athletes that endorsed the snack. He emerged from the ride and found himself looking over a stretch of flooring (littered with junk, of course) that ended in a tremendous closet. Darkness saturated the interior, barely visible through the yawning bi-fold doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collection of branded stickers and photographs were tacked onto the wood surface. Bryan kept his position but tried vainly to make out the subjects captured in each picture. It proved fruitless, as they were too far and impossibly high up for him to clearly make out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filtered light from the window began to dim as the day waned - a fact that went over Bryan's tiny head. He was agog with the mystery of the closet; staring at it and the surrounding objects. A skateboard was leaning against the corner beside it, one wheel was missing and the helter skelter of graphics under the deck were scratched to hell. As the crow flies, socks and a mountainous jumble of denim lay in his path - but the journey was certainly doable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, it was near enough the hallway door, that Bryan could explore it before heading back into the apartment proper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan's eyes glazed over with thoughts of what items lay inside the closet. Of course, most of those items also lay <i>outside</i> the closet; mostly strewn about the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictures pinned to the wooden bi-fold doors were clumsily pinned together, separated by stickers of various sport brands. Bryan wished he was able to will himself larger or smaller, so he could investigate all these items more easily. He digressed, and turned away from the looming closet and scanned the bulk of the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a behemoth mountain the bed dominated the majority of his view, casting a limitless shadow over the discarded wrappers and discarded clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided he would like to investigate the room itself further, and began hiking around the bed. He purposefully forsook the more direct route underneath it for reasons of safety. It was likely that ants weren't the only invaders in this room, and the darkness under the bed offered the best sanctuary for such nasties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime marched on, and so did the shrunken man. He came upon many socks; bunched up like enormous meteors of cotton, and some splayed out covering huge portions of ground. Past the foot of the bed, Bryan could see other monumental pieces of furniture: a chest of drawers painted a sickly blue and covered with scratches and more stickers. Beside it sat a red laundry basket, overflowing and supporting an expensive looking guitar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this guy has a lot of crap!\" Bryan remarked idly, turning his eyes in each direction. His own space was tidy: not a scuff of dirt, or a misplaced item in sight. Any type of mess normally disgusted him, and this space did not disappoint. Yet, in the back of his finicky mind, Bryan couldn't help but feel attracted by such... masculine clutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe neared an odd mass that rested at the foot of the bed. It made him think of a plateau; not perfectly level, but raised off the wooden floor like a dark blue mesa on the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan approached it, intrigued, and was quickly overcome with an incredible stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Jesus!\" He clapped his hands over his nostrils, but to little avail. \"It smells like... like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the thick aroma, he reached the edge of the strange mass, blinking tears from his eyes. The material had been worn down enough, that Bryan could scale the side. He was deposited atop an enormous surface. Filth seemed to call this place home, as grime, hairs, and dirt caked the surface. Bryan padded forward and immediately screamed as he slid down a steep incline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released his nostrils, more used to the intense smell and began to explore. \"What the hell is this?\" The incline he had fallen down seemed to span around the entire landscape, which stretched farther to his right by far. One could easily host four or five matches of football on this surface. He found each step to be rather spongy - almost moist. Large smears dotted the surface, ranging from small to massive, and one looked to have once been a living creature at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan continued, following a distinct line of faded white thicker than a road. It continued on and on, until he realized it was leading him in a circle. In the middle of it, Bryan noticed what appeared to be digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Numbers? Are those numbers?\" He rounded the tremendous printed circle again, trying to make the 40 foot tall digits legible. All this investigating made him feel like some sort of explorer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....12? What the fuck?\" As he spoke this out loud, the realization struck him with tidal force. \"Fucking size 12! I'm on an insole!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous plateau seemed to take on a new, foreboding light. Bryan had been scampering about this tremendous surface, like somebody traversing the grand canyon, and it was nothing more than a discarded insole! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed away from the huge digits, feeling overwhelmed. With a gooey smack, he fell back into a glob of black gunk that reeked worse than he could comprehend. The bug-sized man screamed and ran, all while trying to scrape it off. He pulled himself over the incline - specifically, the impression left by the owner's heel - and fell back onto the hardwood flooring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would anyone leave their old insoles laying around like that? It was positively revolting, no matter what light you saw it in! Bryan clucked indignantly, trying to wipe himself off against the rough grained floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan just wanted to go home; now more than ever. He was tired of being puny - tired of his life constantly being threatened. His bed and a nice Hallmark movie sounded nicer to him than anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to be rescued and end this nightmare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

He could only run under the bed, or burrow within some dirty clothes, and neither of those choices seemed enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed more than likely harbored some kind of disgusting family of insects under it, along with the ants circling around the food wrappers he'd investigated earlier. Bryan already had the opportunity to be assaulted by a particularly greedy ant, and didn't overly want to discover what other rude bugs were taking shelter under the enormous furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the choice of hiding within clothes would certainly provide shelter from being seen, the stench of doing so was not enticing for Bryan. He could hardly walk by the dirty laundry without gagging, so the thought of crawling under it made his stomach flip. Plus there was the chance of being crushed under a careless foot stepping on whatever discarded item of clothing he chose to hide under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan tried in vain to think of a spot to hide, booms came closer and closer to the room, and the tiny man recognized them as massive footsteps. Bryan saw a light turned on in the hallway outside the bedroom, and then suddenly a large figure appeared through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete entered his bedroom, after a long day at work. He was tired more than anything, and just wanted to get out of his work clothes and into something more comfortable. Pete walked over to his bed, unbuttoning his shirt in the process, exposing his muscular torso, void of hair. He caught a glimpse of his tanned skin in the mirror on his dresser, and smirked. Seeing his progress in the gym always gave him a good boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete dropped his shirt on the floor next to the bed, and then sat down at the end of the bed. He leaned down, peeling off each sock. Standing up again, he unbuttoned his pants and pushed them off, followed by his boxers. He walked back across the room and found a pile of clothes. Searching for some comfortable pajama pants, he kicked a few items of clothing away from the pile towards the bed. Finally, after finding some satin pants, he threw them on and headed back to the living room to watch TV and enjoy a beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed as Pete made his way across the room. His primary concern was not being stepped on. Running across the floor, he made it closer to the bed. He refused to go under it completely, but he was fairly close to it so it was doubtful he'd be seen. The tiny man watched as Pete undressed. This man was an absolute god from this size, his muscles looked enormous and so perfectly developed. Bryan continued to watch as Pete pushed down his boxers, and watched the giant butt cheeks flex as Pete walked over to a clothing pile. Bryan normally wouldn't be so inclined to stare at a naked man, but the display of power was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though, Pete kicked clothing away from the pile towards the bed. Bryan watched as a sock flew through the air and landed next to the bed. More giant pieces of Pete's laundry were launched by his foot, and bryan screamed when he soon found himself in the shadow of..</span></div></div>",

Yikes! What if he gathers them up for the laundry? \"I've got to get out of these!\" Bryan squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he tried to navigate the maze of green and blue squares, he felt the vibrations from each of Pete's footsteps.

Bryan watched it; both curiosity and fear glinting in his gaze. He hoped they would leave, trailing off harmlessly like in movies. They didn't; Bryan could hear the muttled speech as each tone seemed to travel through the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come in, don't come in!\" Bryan turned to run, but fell aimlessly into the tangled fibers of carpet. He wasn't prepared in the slightest! Metallic rattling and clinking could be heard as the door jolted with a sudden click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could fate be so unkind? This was the worst timing possible! He was more exposed out here than in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill screech burst from his lips when the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get any reply on 2B?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment building's manager led the tradesman from apartment 2A, turning to lock it again before responding. \"No... no. Those kids never return any calls unless I threaten them about rent increase.\" He gave the young tradesman a strange look, as if debating if he too were a \"kid\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in-front of the red door, the manager looked it over and frowned. He crouched and retrieved a sheet of red paper from under the door and scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit; they didn't even pick up the notice about it. I dropped these two days ago to inform about the visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taller than the building's owner, the tradesmen shrugged in response. \"Alright. Still want me to spray inside? The company's got me booked next week - solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager crumpled the paper, stuffed it into his pocket, and began flipping through an impressive set of keys. More than two weeks ago, he had contacted the extermination service and set up an appointment to clear the building of pests, once and for all. There was no way he was wasting the effort because of some unresponsive teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes; Definitely... This is good timing, they aren't at home. I can't afford any bugs hiding out in there and re-infesting the building.\" The exterminator smiled affirmatively and followed the older man into 2B. He had been paid in advance to do the whole building, and the rented spaces were relatively small. An easy job, if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" His boots sank into the dingy, soiled carpet and the noise from the opening door seemed to startle whatever was living here. Gnats buzzed around excitedly, eager to greet the apartments visitors. He batted them away and surveyed the room. \"This is the worst yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the exterminator a grimace, the building manager stepped back into the hallway. \"Just get rid of all the bugs in there. This is probably where they started from.\" He watched the younger man pull a pair of gloves on and snap a white face mask over his mouth. \"Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the mask back, the exterminator looked unfazed. \"None needed - no tiny critters will be left alive once I'm through.\" He was given a nod in acknowledgement before the middle-aged man strode away, muttering. The room was already lit by a ceiling fan and was sparsely furnished. Coats and hats hung on one wall, while some random parts and tools for a bike were crammed in the corner next to the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the apartment building's manager, he wasn't grossed out by the space. Even for an exterminator barely out of training - who admittedly lived in his own unkempt space - this was all par for the course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware that his presence endangered more than just bugs, the exterminator closed the door and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, shit...\" Was all Bryan could muster as he took in the new arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new giant stood tall and mighty, clad in a mass of thick clothing and gear. Bryan just took in the humongous form, his eyes both wondering and fearful. This unexpected visitor not only threw a wrench in his plans, but offered no viable reason for his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting in the thick fibers, the tiny man stared at the giant who in turn scanned the vast room. \"Great... Another one? How many fucking people live in this dump!\" The expression of anger subsided from his tiny face, becoming a frown. Seeing this giant reminded Bryan just how foolish he was reducing himself to such insignificance in a world dominated by behemoths. \"Crap, he's fucking huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even remotely appreciate tiny Bryan's opinions, the titanic stranger raised one monolithic arm to fasten a mask that hung around his neck over his huge face. Only then did the giant's gear develop significance; heavy dark cargo pants, thick long-sleeve shirt, and large work boots. All combined with the face mask, tools, and gloves to clothe what could only be one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... He's a...\" Bryan felt his face drain of blood, turning to a ghastly white. \"Oh, Jesus Christ, he's an exterminator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the previous giants he had encountered, this new (and unwelcome) addition terrified him beyond description. High above, the oblivious titan thunders deeply - his harrowing proclamation completely unintelligible due to his mask. Tools of the extermination trade are stored in a thick belt, and in both loops and pockets on his pants. All designed to eradicate pests, Bryan realized. Unlike the clumsy and uncouth teenagers, this huge man specialized in the genocide of anything tiny: including his shrunken self!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to stop him. Some how, some way, Bryan had to not only avoid being inadvertently killed, but to get this terrifying man's attention. \"And not as an insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a different plane of existence than the ant-sized scientist, the gargantuan exterminator unleashes a terrific roar upon the huge room. One huge hand raises and stifles the titan's yawn underneath the mask before he suddenly shifts into gear. The first step sends a powerful shockwave through the carpeted floor, rattling the entire room. Bryan screams and throws his arms in the air, completely forgoing contact for survival as he clumsily flees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shuddered once more, followed by a dull crash. Not an inkling of his destination, Bryan barely kept steady pace as he clambered through the grimey stalks of carpet. Each fiber was taller than himself, but coated with years of filth and grime that reduced it to a lumpy terrain instead of a tangled forest. Nearly tripping for the umpteenth time, Bryan found his immediate vicinity and beyond drenched in shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze looked up just in time to witness the cause. \"Shit!\" It was beyond comprehension: both in size and detail. Each thick lug of hard rubber blown up to city-sized scale and packed with dried mud, pebbles, and refuse from other jobs and apartments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly uncaring of yet another tiny life, the massive work boot loomed above, ready to pulverize the tiny man. Bryan feared his incredible journey had come to an end - all without the gigantic man even knowing he existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacks of boxes and containers are crammed into the fridge, only some of the food still edible. Tony decides he should clean the fridge out, but first he lays eyes on a bent pizza box. Pushing it open with his free hand he snags the last three slices. Tony sidesteps to the microwave and tosses the pizza in. His friends always thought he was weird for not liking cold pizza, but Tony preferred to have the cheese a little stretchy and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waits patiently, staring intently at the beat up microwave, as the timer counts down. Behind him he hears the TV blaring where Mason sits watching it, light flickering across the dingy room. His thoughts drift to his job where he is surrounded by parts he wished he could afford himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ring signals the pizza is ready and Tony pulls his pizza out and slams the door shut harder than necessary. His hands are full, one with soda and the other with pizza when he glances down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear his right sneaker a line of ants crosses the kitchen. Tony frowns, having assumed he had taken care of the pests already when he had grabbed his pop. He easily moves his long sneaker over the bugs and slams it down. Without looking at the bugs he had squashed he follows the line slamming his dirty shoes down repeatedly. With each footfall the top third slice in his hand shifts and when Tony is next to the counter it slips off and lands on the faded linoleum floor with a smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motherfucker\" Tony mutters unhappily as places the other pizza on the counter and snatches up the fallen slice. Glancing at the floor he decides there weren't any ants where the pizza dropped. He gives the pizza a once over. The glistening cheese, hanging off the slice in tendrils and greasy pepperoni look too good to pass up. He blows on the food and drops it onto a plate on the counter deciding its fine. He drops the other two slices of pizza on the plate, picks it up and heads into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched as the giant rifled through the fridge. He was torn between his desperation for aid and his complete fear of the titan\u2019s massive shoes. The young man steps sideways, his heavy footfalls felt and heard across the kitchen by the tiny scientist. He sees some wandering ants disappear under the sneaker unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to avoid the giant, he recalls the antidote in the overflowing trash can. He turns to the doorway between the kitchen and living room where the trash can is. Light from the TV flickers from beyond the frame giving his goal an ethereal glow as Bran begins to move towards it. In every direction the dirt and grime provide obstacles for him. The bugs that the giants for the most part seem to overlook also provide a moving danger for the tiny scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't get far before a ring fills the air. Near the edge of the counter, Bryan watches Tony pull the pizza out of the microwave with one hand. The giant turns as if to leave the room before his green eyes fall to the floor. A sneer forms on his face far above the floor. Bryan sees the line of hapless ants making their way across the floor. As the incredibly tall titan\u2019s enormous sneaker slams onto the bugs Bryan feels both terror and a bit of sympathy for the defenseless bugs, if only because he is as helpless as they are against the giant young man<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second stomp is closer to Bryan and he realizes as Tony lifts his foot again that the giant is headed straight for him. With a yelp he begins to flee but trips over some grime on the floor. The giant makes quick progress and he feels a forceful stomp rattle the area around him. Suddenly Mr. Smith finds himself engulfed in gooey warmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles to move as he hears the giant mutter under his breath, the voice muffled by whatever has landed on him. Bryan is blinded by light as he feels himself move rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!!\u201d he sputters in shock as he is stuck to something. His eyes adjust and again he yelps in surprise. Above him is the young man\u2019s face staring at him intently. From below a strong brow his green eyes bore into Bryan\u2019s soul and he feels hope rise in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the giant gives no sign of recognition and suddenly his lips, surrounded by trimmed stubble, form an \u201cO\u201d. A cold gust batters Bryan before he falls away from the giant\u2019s face. As he feels his world stop abruptly Bryan realizes where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is stuck fast on his back in warm gooey cheese, on the giant\u2019s reheated pizza. The giant carelessly drops the other two slices onto the plate. The pizza lays in a messy stack with Bryan\u2019s slice at the bottom but the tiny man is still out in the light. The giant holds the plate in one hand, making Bryan feel as though he is on a ship at sea bobbing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony drops the plate onto a scratched up end table and plops into a faded but very comfortable recliner.  He looks at Mason and nods at the TV. \u201cWell? Who\u2019s winning?\u201d he asks. Mason points at the screen. \u201cThem\u201d he says dismissively. \u201cThey\u2019re fucking dominating, it\u2019s already kinda boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony faces the large flat screen, probably the nicest thing in the apartment. \u201cThen change the channel. I don\u2019t care. Just find something good,\u201d he says with a shrug. While Mason channel surfs Tony reaches for his plate of pizza. He grabs the top slice as Mason settles on \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019. \u201cMissed this episode!\u201d he says happily. Tony grunts as he chews. As he swallows he realizes just how hungry he is and takes another large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his back Bryan can see Tony\u2019s face staring blankly ahead as light from the TV flickers across it. He stares at the giant\u2019s rising and falling jaw followed by his bobbing Adam\u2019s apple as he swallows. Tony lifts the slice up to his lips and a massive bite disappears into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles against the cheese holding him solidly in place. He manages to pull his head free, as it hadn\u2019t sunken deep in the first place. He awkwardly turns his head from side to side, taking in his environment in case it could help him escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was to question Tony\u2019s sense of cleanliness. The gigantic young man clearly hadn\u2019t looked closely at the slice of pizza. What the young titan had decided was a clean slice was actually littered with dark specks of dirt and grime from the floor. Tony\u2019s dismissive eyes had even missed a couple of ant bodies trapped in the cheese, perhaps dismissing them as small spices. The tiny scientist has to suppress a gag at the clearly filthy food the young man planned to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea shakes Bryan to the core. He is stuck to a filthy piece of food where if he doesn\u2019t do something soon, the giant towering above him will gulp him down without another thought. As if to emphasize this, Tony swallows the last bite of his first slice and burps loudly. He sighs and smiles before reaching for another slice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still very hungry, Tony reaches for the larger slice at the bottom of the plate. He raises it to his mouth and takes a large bite. He stares blankly ahead at the TV as he chews, his every thought focused on The Walking Dead. He swallows and turns his head towards Mason as the commercial starts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what would you do in a zombie apocalypse?\" he asked. \"Ummm...\" Mason trails off. While waiting Tony takes another bite of his pizza. A slice of pepperoni gets caught halfway out of his mouth and Tony starts to chew before sucking it between his lips. \"I think I'd head to Walmart or some shit like that. They've got everything there!\" Mason says. \"Defense? Weapons?\" Tony asks through a full mouth.  Mason's shoulders slump. \"Fuck\" he mutters, \"I dunno, loot a gun store first?\" Tony stares at Mason and swallows. \"That's not the shittiest plan I guess... But I got my dad's guns at home. I'd bring him along, his hunting aim is beast!\" Tony says seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are fucking retarded!\" Pete yells from his bedroom. Tony and Mason start laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These commercials last too damn long!\" Mason grumbles. \"Now I'm hungry!\" he adds glaring jokingly at Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony grins as Mason stands up and stomps into the kitchen. The show comes back on just after Mason leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Tony shouts before lifting the slice to his mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan flails as the gigantic young man eyes the slice he is on. A hand appears; its long, grimy fingers grasp the crust of the slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!!!\"  Bryan shouts in terror as he continues to thrash wildly. He feels like he is riding a roller coaster as the slice flies up to the titan's face. Bryan shouts as he looks at the young man's eyes, but they are focused in the distance. Ahead he sees the lips part, the massive tongue sliding out of the mouth like a monster. Bryan grimaces as he sees the tip of the pizza, with the bits of grime and a single ant body, enter the shadow inside the mouth. His jaw shuts quickly, a dull crunch shakes the slice. The slice is pulled away from the mouth. The cheese stretches, thins, and finally rips leaving a few strands hanging from the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive titan's jaw begins to move up and down to a rhythm, any sound of chewing masked by the TV. Bryan watches, transfixed by this everyday activity that could easily end his life very soon. He sees the jaw clench and the Adam's apple bob as the colossus swallows, sending the food on its way. The giant licks his lips to get the hanging cheese. He turns to his equally gigantic friend and asks him a question, his voice booming over tiny Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan however is in shock. He just watched, in closeup, this young man effortlessly down a huge amount of food and not even think twice about it. A few more bites and Bryan would be eaten, just as dismissively. The young man would devour the shrunken scientist, and would never know the difference from any other bite of food. Bryan shivered. He had been reduced to a mere crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm a genius! I won't be so demeaned!\" he shouted angrily. Before he can do or say anything else the slice below him flies forward. His moment of personal strength drains away as he watches the greasy lips ahead of him part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrands of saliva stretch from the roof of the mouth to the tongue as it slowly extends. Spread across the back of the tongue are the soggy lumps of crust, and tangled strings of cheese; the few remnants of the massive slices the giant easily devoured. The tiny scientist begins to scream as he sees this terrifying scene get closer. He sees the large, white molars crammed with bits of flattened pizza. In the very back the uvula hangs over the dark entrance to the throat: his final destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gags on the sour wind that gusts out of the cavernous mouth. He finally stops moving and looks up to see he is directly below the titan's protruding nose, out of sight of the eyes. \"Help me!\" he shouts desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front teeth sink down just ahead of Bryan, a wall of off-white sinking into the landscape. He feels the slice begin to move back and is overjoyed to have more time to possible escape. However he stops and moving and suddenly he is dangling from a strand of cheese attached to a piece of pepperoni held in place by the giant's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels the \"landscape\" beneath him shift as the giant begins to chew. From this close he can hear the squishing and squelching as the food is effortlessly destroyed just out of sight. Without warning the lips part with a loud smack. Bryan screams as he sees the soggy pile of crushed crust and gooey cheese spread across the mouth. The pepperoni, with him attached, slide forward into the scene of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knows it he is sealed in darkness and humidity. The giant, unaware of any tiny scientist in his mouth, resumes chewing. Bryan's shouts are drowned out by the squishes and squelches of chewing as he is thrown about randomly narrowly missing molars. He finally is flung to the tongue where he holds on tight. The cavern rumbles loudly and light flashes as the giant seems to speak. While some bits fly out, Bryan isn\u2019t so lucky. The sounds get soggier and he feels the tongue move. There is a slithering sound and then a loud squelch and gulp. The tiny man can't help but feel elated because he wasn\u2019t gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan doesn\u2019t have a chance to move as the giant deafens him by speaking again, the sound clearer and devastatingly loud without the food to muffle it. As the tiny scientist clutches his ears in pain, the mouth widens and light floods in. It begins to bob up and down as the giant laughs, a stark contrast to the terror and pain Bryan had been feeling since shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piles of food on the tongue, lit up in the light, have shifted but are still just soggy piles of crust and strands of cheese. Around tiny Bryan are the bits of grime that had come from the floor, still discernible in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it slows the lips mostly shut, allowing thin light into the cavern. Bryan finally gets his bearings. He is near a set of towering molars, the front of the mouth to his left. He stumbles forward on the soft, slimy tongue which won\u2019t stop moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he gets far the giant booms something even louder than before knocking Bryan down once more. His ears ringing, he feels the tongue under him shift. He looks outside the mouth, past the jagged teeth, to see the half-finished slice approaching the open mouth. Despair blankets his senses as the pizza enters the mouth and the lips shut, sealing him in darkness once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony watches the show, wishing the girls were a little... sexier. He stops chewing as he feels pressure in his chest. He leans back and burps loudly. Mason returns to the room and laughs. \"Nice\" he exclaims. Tony bows his head in mock thanks before swallowing. He pops the last of the slice into his mouth and focuses back on the show. He grabs his pop and washes the bite down. He leans back and stretches, getting more comfortable in the recliner. Tony kicks off his large sneakers and they pound to the floor. He stares at the TV, thoroughly enjoying the show.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unknown to the young man, a small living speck was stranded on the food-ridden expanse of his tongue. This speck was shrunken Bryan Smith, a scientist who invented the shrinking formula and foolishly decided to test it in an extravagant fashion. Now he found himself precariously trapped in a massive teenager's mouth, a teen that Bryan didn't even know personally, all this combined found the little man at his breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving miraculously survived another round of pizza, holding onto the huge, slimy muscle that was Tony's tongue, Bryan desperately searched his mind for any ideas on escaping. A deep booming sound crashed loudly through the enormous cavern, light flooding in as the huge mouth opened briefly. Bryan was able to take further glances around the moist, dripping interior, surrounded by the tall yellowed teeth, and a huge gaping darkness that lead down into the rambunctious teen's stomach. His nose crinkled in disgust from the rancid stench around him, which was only strengthened every time the giant spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, sopping with the putrid saliva, the tiny man crawled up the expanse of the tongue as if it were some steep hill. This squishy, yet firm landscape kept moving constantly, raising up and down frequently. \"Please don't eat anymore pizza...\" He begged silently, his eyes tightly shut as he crawled. A sudden reek became apparent, this one much stronger and far more foul than the normal aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden influx of light came as the huge mouth opened, strands of saliva hanging from the giant teeth. Bryan felt a howling breeze as the giant inhaled, and his heart froze as he feared what came next. His little body had no chance in holding against the explosive gale that burst forth from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComments and praises burst forth from the two teen aged males as they watched the television. Comments ranging from praises to the death scenes, to snide comments on what the characters wore, they kept a steady banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that chick? Bitch was missing her fucking jaw!\" Tony grinned bemusedly, pointing at the screen. Mason chortled at the remark, and they both clapped as said character was put down violently. \"Dude, Pete! Your missing out, this episode is awesome!\" Mason leaned his head back and called out, not taking his eyes off the screen. A low, undecipherable response was heard from the nearby hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony scratched his chin, trying to think of another zinger. His thoughts were interrupted as a familiar rumble was felt traveling up his body to his mouth, and he casually let out an intrusively loud belch. Bits of food, and a minute wriggling pale speck flew out of the teenagers mouth as he expelled the belch. After almost ten seconds, he stopped with an accomplished grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, that was epic!\" Tony's buddy said, giving him a high five. Tony grunted with satisfaction having always been known for his \"awesome\" burps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the two young men, the unseen speck landed...</span></div></div>",

He tumbled over himself finally landed sprawled  in what at first glance appeared to be ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive teenager was leaned back, his chin being a relatively level area for Bryan to land. He sat up and looked around himself. He was surrounded by the forest of brown hairs sprouting out of the skin, undoubtedly short for the giant, they were easily shrub height for the tiny man. Behind him the lip rose in a steep , glinting slope. Ahead the chin dropped away to show the rest of the giant's body stretching away like a landscape, the room like an even larger valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the ground, or rather the giant's chin, begin to steepen. Instinctively he latched onto a hair as the giant leaned forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony, having gotten his praise for his burp, sat back up. Unaware of the life that had been saved he lifted the rest of the slice to his mouth and took a savage bite. He chewed, still occasionally commenting on the show. He didn't notice the spray of saliva and chewed food that shot out of his mouth with each word. Tony easily finished the slice in just two bites and as he swallows, he rests his hand on the final slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lifts the pizza to his mouth and easily tears through the slice. Moving up and down with the jaw, Bryan can hear  the squishes and rips of the pizza being chewed. He is unable to suppress the images he has from having been inside the mouth, reminding him how close he still is to danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a slithering noise as the chewing stops and a loud gulp sounds as the giant swallows his bite. Without a second's reprieve the jaw drops as the mouth opens wide and the giant literally tosses the final piece between his lips. As he chews Bryan realizes how thoughtless the giant is of this seemingly mundane act, completely unaware of the life, Bryan's life, that is in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shakes his head. These thoughts aren't helping. Clearly he can't get to his antidote by himself. So he should try to get the massive teenager's attention! He tries yanking on the hair, but at his size Bryan lacks the strength to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can think of another plan a shadow covers him. The giant has lifted the slice above and stuck his long tongue out to catch a long strand of cheese hanging off the tip of another slice of pizza. From his perspective, Bryan can just barely see past the outstretched tongue to see a struggling ant trapped in the cheese. The giant however doesn't notice and lowers the slice onto his retracting tongue, his teeth tearing the bite free. As the sounds of chewing resume Bryan can't help but shudder for the unfortunate ant, now going through what he had just barely escaped. Deep in his recent memory, Bryan doesn't see the string of cheese hanging from the giant's lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony lifts the pizza of the plate. A string of cheese swinging from the tip catches his attention. In response Tony lifts the slice above his mouth, opens it wide, and stretches out his tongue. He fails to notice the struggling ant in his food and lowers the tip of the pizza into his mouth. His jaw shuts around the bite, as the commercials on TV start. Without another thought he begins to chew, utterly unaware of the tiny being trapped in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels a string of cheese hanging from his lips as he finishes chewing. Just before swallowing Tony laps up the loose cheese and then gulps down the bite in his mouth.</span></div></div>",

He watches the tongue retreat, like a monster returning to its cavern, its prize of the string of cheese successfully captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that every second he waits is one more to remain at this size, one more second where some random accident could spell his doom, Bryan begins to  climb sideways. The giant's unkempt stubble stretches along the jaw up towards hair, and more importantly the giant's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony continues to eat, finishing off the slice as the credits roll for the show and a preview for next week's episode plays. An itch starts in the stubble of his jaw and he idly scratches it. Mason starts flipping channels after the preview ends and Tony merely grunts in response to any channel he pauses on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's progress is slow. He is no climber, or athlete and his strength is quickly being spent. It is not made any easier by the jaw moving up and down as the giant eats, while Bryan does his best to ignore the terrible noises. Before long he is panting, running purely on adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough afraid if he stops, he will not continue, Bryan simply needs a break. He stops for a second, hanging from a hair. Feeling his arms willing him to let go he forces himself to move once more, now significantly closer to the giant's thicker hairline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments after continuing to move, a gigantic finger collides with the area he just was. Bryan tries to move away from it faster as the short, grimy fingernail digs into the skin. Flakes rain away, a terrible scratching noise sounding around him. Bryan continues to move, realizing had he remained there he could have been crushed or knocked free. He suppresses a shudder and continues to move sideways and up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason doesn't manage to find anything very interesting and finally settles on a rerun of and old sitcom. Tony however can't focus on the show because of his beard. Well... his stubble of a beard. Though no longer itchy it still seems to be... tingling. He begins to debate shaving it off.</span></div></div>",

A shaking glance towards his destination showed he had made small progress over the behemoths jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muddled on, each desperate grab quick and clumsy. Bryan tried to keep his timid mind focused, not wanting to look up at the teen's massive sized face, and especially not wanting to look down. It was like climbing the side of Mount Everest, but Everest didn't move, breath, and speak. Every time the behemoth shifted, or spoke, it caused catastrophic results to the tiny climber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Bryan, every time he moved, clutching a new hair, he caused the massive Tony slight annoyance. Even something as minuscule as the tiny man proved to be a nuisance to the huge young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intro to a good action movie began, flashes of fire and brutal action brightening the dim living room. Tony grunted in approval, able to ignore the light tingle on his jaw better when entertained. It was one of his top favourite films, so he had little trouble paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this movie sucks!\" Mason complained after a good ten minutes. He grabbed the remote, ignoring the furious glare from his buddy. Mason always preferred comedies, something that could make him laugh. He also knew Tony loved this movie, so it amused him to change it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click, the channel changed to a sitcom re-run. \"What the hell, man?\" Tony leaned over and attempted a swipe of the remote, failing. He was an easy going guy, but childish behaviour from his younger roommates peeved him. \"<i>This damn itch on my chin...</i>\" Tony thought as the sensation seemed to intensify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in, Tony roughly scratched it. To his satisfaction the sensation dissipated quickly. Grumbling, he decided to just watch the sitcom, made more bearable with the annoying tingling gone. Tony never noticed the tiny speck that had been dislocated by his large fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, he rested his muscled arms behind his head and concentrated on the flickering television.</span></div></div>",

Then the building-sized fingers returned, destructively scratching the entirety of the chin. It was like the fingers of God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Bryan survived. At this point it seemed as if fate was only keeping him alive to bring along more terrifying scenarios for him. His head span, and his empty stomach lurched as he lay, sprawled out on a strange landscape of rough dark brown fabric. Ignoring more thunderous booming, Bryan concerned himself with the sudden movement of his new placement. The land shuddered violently. Looking up, the minute scientist was given a frightening view of the ever familiar titan, his huge torso towering up above, impressive physique visible through the dark shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gawked still when the ground began moving again, the huge giant above raising his powerful arms in a breath-taking display as he casually crossed them behind his head. The tiny man wasn't prepared for the sudden slanting of the fabric land, and he tumbled roughly backwards rolling like a watermelon down the steep incline. The world darkened around him as tumbled deep into the gargantuan cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis consciousness came to a sudden halt when he collided with the lid of a massive cigarette box. His little form lay at the base of a 15-foot tall letter \"M\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tony fell asleep in the comfortably worn chair. He awoke the next morning, the television blaring loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wrist watch read, 11:53 am, the morning was nearly over. Mason was gone, the remote visibly abandoned on the air of the couch. Tony clicked it off. \"He left the TV on, the fucking douche...\" Tony mumbled sleepily as he rose from the chair and proceeded to his room. He needed to get ready for work. The owner of the bike shop was a cool guy, and often allowed his employees to be late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony groggily slid a new t-shirt on. He slid his pack of Marlboro cigarettes out of his pocket, and pulled on a pair of black and grey camo shorts. A small speck fell into the pack, landing a top a cigarette as he did this. Dropping the pack into his pocket, he lumbered back to the living room, his socked feet thudding heavily. Sitting in front of the chair he slept in were his Circa skate shoes, worn from use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had sat there for many hours while he slept, and unknown to Tony, a few foolhardy ants had scaled the huge sneakers in an attempt to find a way to kill the destructive objects that were like mountains to them. The ants had no way of escape as Tony stomped up to the shoes and slid his gigantic socked feet into the footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his backpack, Tony left the apartment, his two roommates still slumbering, and oblivious to the tiny passenger in his pocket and the insignificant bugs crushed in his huge sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMounting his impressive BMX bike, he rode to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had spent a lot of time and hard earned cash on his sport bike, all the bells and whistles that only an avid BMX biker could apply. He spent many of his free hours biking with his buddies at the local park, which offered a large area for both BMX bikes and skateboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe careless guy had decided already that he would just skip work. His boss didn't care and usually closed the shop to go biking himself. Plus, Tony's buddies texted him about a new half pipe just installed at the park. No way he would miss out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only 15 minutes to ride to the park, which was on the edge of the sprawling city park. The huge cement area was populated by many like himself. College age guys, grade school kids, and many other guys were visible. Tony shouted a greeting to a few of the bikers and skaters, as he approached the new half-pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismounting, Tony nodded casually as his buddy Scott walked to meet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, dude, didn't think to see you today!\" Scott greeted.

Bryan just continued his screams. There was nothing he could do but scream - falling for what felt like hours through vast empty space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he met the ground with a swift <i>thwack!</i> He lay there, groaning and sobbing. Most of all, Bryan rued the day he decided to concoct his formula for shrinking. Righting himself with a grimace, he suddenly yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking... My arm! Mother of God, I think it's broken!\" The offending limb was bent unnaturally, pulled farther back at the shoulder than comfortable. Bryan prodded it with his other. \"Oh dear God... I need help...\" Bryan's shoulder crunched, slipping back into socket like a door latch clicking into place. He squealed, throwing his head up in agony before suddenly falling silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTones of deep thunder cracked from above, as if God himself responded to the tiny man's plea. Fear flowed through Bryan's thin body, sending away all thoughts of mental and physical pain from his mind. Completely detached from Bryan and his suffering, loomed the behemoth that brought him here, emitting booming notes of speech in-between vast intakes of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Bryan had yet to even learn the name of this young guy - and despite a lack of introduction, this giant had put Bryan Smith through more torment and suffering than he had ever before experienced. All without ever knowing that Bryan even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Bryan was back to the ground, hopelessly craning his neck in order to even glimpse the titanic BMX riders face. The giant face that Bryan had been close enough to feel (and smell) the titan's breath. Shifting his eyes, Bryan relaxed his neck and looked upon the enormous black sneakers planted in the distance like dark monuments. Dirt coated the black rubber sole, stained a light green in some places. One shifted slightly; a mere trifle to the mountainous owner, but causing a heavy grind of gravel and sending strong vibrations through the hard ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he figured, Bryan had two options; run for it, hopefully finding someplace safe to hide, or try for the umpteenth time to be recognized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill considering, the tiny man had no chance to prepare for what plummeted from above. It landed with a tremendous crash, rolling heavily, spraying hot embers and smouldering ashes. It rolled like a tipped grain silo for many feet before slowing to a halt. Bryan yelled, coughing and brushing hot ashes from his limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" He looked at it stupidly, as if he were staring at an object from outer space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke plumed out as fuming hot embers greedily ate it away, spewing more fumes and causing Bryan to gag. He teared up. Bryan angrily racked them away, blinking dumbly when he noticed an enormous shadow overtake the scene. Realization clicked, his body whipped around to face the oncoming doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe belonging to the other giant lifted into the air. The sole slowly loomed into position overhead, completely eclipsing the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could only gape, taking in every detail of the approaching plane of ridged rubber. Various chunks of gravel were caught in the tread at random, pressed between thick canyons of tread. Grimy deposits of mud were jammed along with mangled stalks of grass and bits of white-ish garbage. Barely recognizable carcasses belonging to both ants and larger insects were spread through the deep ridges, carelessly obliterated by the gigantic owner as he stomped around the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!\" Bryan shrieked in a voice devoid of hope. He stumbled backwards, no longer cognant enough to realize any attempt would be futile against the gigantic sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to stare at the immense tread of filthy rubber. In the arch section, clearly standing out in scuffed red rubber, a gigantic letter \"E\" denoted the shoe brand, half-covered by a mass of unidentifiable black gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Bryan's step met thin air and he fell backwards just as the city-sized sole fell upon the earth with cataclysmic result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-...me and Hunter were skating it earlier. He got some serious air,\" Scott grinned at his buddy, gesturing the \"serious air\" with his hands as he twisted out the spent cigarette.\"Fucking legit! Even launched an awesome boneless and aced it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging his shoe back to ensure complete cigarette destruction, Scott continued. \"Hunter flipped it and landed on his ass earlier. Almost busted his deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few skaters zipped by on their way to the new ramp. Tony exhaled smoke through his nostrils, watching them whip over the jump with varying tricks. One landed roughly, falling to the ground but recovering quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that looks freaking awesome!\" Tony reached down and adjusted his knee guards, pulled his socks up and looked back to Scott. He took another drag of his smoke and flicked it to the cement impatiently. His step missed it slightly, crushing the stub only halfway. Tony paid no attention as he hopped back onto his bike and prepared to take the new ramp on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna try a new spin on it, check this shit out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sped off, pumping furiously to gain proper speed. Scott shot him a thumbs up, his foot still over the demolished cigarette stub. He stepped off, attention completely on his buddy, but leaned over momentarily to hock a slimy wad of saliva onto the ground. Scott never cared where it landed, instead planting a foot on his board and pushing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever thinking again about his dispensed cigarette that he inadvertently drenched with his foul saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bryan found himself lying in a crack in the cement...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His body jolted hard, landing on his back to give him a near perfect view of the enormous stranger's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Was all he could muster to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plea was lost upon the filthy skate tread. Each note of the shrill cry absorbed by the merciless rubber wall as it fell to make contact with the ground once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis minute body jolted hard from the impact, an intense wave of force smacking upon him. Bryan's teeth cracked together painfully, his head bumped hard, and his very bones rattled - yet, miraculously, he was alive! Darkness enveloped him, and in the next moment he was able to detect the distinct scent of rubber before pandemonium began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oblivious skater proceeded to eliminate the cigarette, simply twisting and grinding his shoe against the abrasive cement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Bryan, this was a completely different matter; the ground began vibrating with more intensity than an earthquake. The massive plane of aggressive rubber shifting above him, each groove of rubber deep and wide enough to easily fit the bug-sized man, but fully capable of squishing his life out. Dirt crumbled upon him, along with other things he could not identify in the darkness. Something long, thick, and segmented landed next to his face, smelling of citrus house cleaner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he feared dirt, pebbles, or tobacco shreds would suffocate him, Bryan heard dull shifting from above. The huge sneaker ceased grinding, emitting a distinct groan of deep pressure before suddenly lifting off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight immediately flooded in. Bryan trembled, watching the terrifying underside raise into the sky. He kept his stare fixated upon the spot where he should have been obliterated; a location near the base of the huge \"E\" logo. As the giant moved his foot out of view, pieces of shredded cigarette lightly rained upon the ground with bits of ash and paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Bryan was able to see his would-be murderer. Standing almost directly over the tiny crack, the gigantic young man shifted, swing his leg around to set his foot down with a distant crash. His head seemed to be watching something only he could see. Dark tangles of blond hair poked from a worn beanie the colour of his dark shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wanted to scream; he wanted to be rescued more than anything. But, he could not get himself to move - only stare timidly at the great colossus above his humble position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant animated once more. Bryan could hear the shifting of his clothes: the baggy denim adjusting as the giant moved, craning his tremendous body and pursing his large lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, what is he doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distinct sound of swishing liquid reached the tiny man's ears. Then, the uncaring giant released a large devastation of saliva in the form of a glob, directing it over Bryan's location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...! No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt collided with a loud crash. Bryan was instantly pulled into a torrential flood of thick, gooey spit. It spread over the cement, filling the small crack as it mixed with dirt and shredded cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tumbled through the depths, vainly beating his limbs to reach the surface. He inadvertently swallowed some of the foul liquid, causing his tiny body to heave and jolt in disgust. Breaking the surface, he gagged out mouthfuls and gasped for air violently. He screamed, padding to keep afloat. \"<i>Thisss.... isn't faaair</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of him burst a dark shape, squirming like he was. It bobbed in the frothy, yellowish liquid. Bryan passed it, recognizing it as an ant caught in the revolting flood. It fell still, weakened and consumed. Bryan didn't notice as he reached dry cement and tossed himself onto it like a climber reaching the summit. He immediately began racking his body: peeling off tendrils of warm, sticky spit. It smelled of smoke, energy drink, and Mexican food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there, Bryan was nothing short of incredulous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me...\" He muttered. \"Just... Fuck me and my damn formula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown giant was nowhere to be seen - thankfully. Bryan sat up and gazed at his surroundings. He was on an endless expanse of rough concrete. Large chunks of gravel and bits of small trash littered it for miles. All inconsequential to the regular eye, but nothing short of overwhelming for the shrunken scientist. Most of all, Bryan shivered. In every direction, he could see many gargantuan shapes looming. Some on skateboards, others on bikes or rollerblades, and more walking or standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be worse? Thrown off a freaking cigarette, then almost stomped like one. Just to add insult to injury, he was then doused in some huge punk's spit! \"....and I'm stranded here now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cupped his face, fending off tears. If he wanted to survive, he needed to do something!</span></div></div>",

Bryan Smith had been the same way until he found himself small enough to fall into these breaks in the cement like somebody falling into a ravine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in a painful heap, Bryan moaned painfully. Stars danced merrily with the spots, blotting out his vision while antagonizing his throbbing cranium. \"Ohh... My head...\" High above, he was able to see the oblivious youth that nearly erased him from existence. The gigantic skater stomped back onto his board and blasted off without ever looking towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain subsided quickly, despite the tiny man's heart-stopping encounter. He stood and surveyed his surroundings. The gorge was a bit over seven feet deep and ran seemingly forever in either direction. Sniffing, Bryan twisted his nose in disgust, realizing that one way was completely saturated in a monsoon of frothing liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...?\" He questioned, surveying the mass flood of vile goop. \"<i>Gross</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, he turned and padded the opposite direction to escape the horrendous smell. It permeated the air with scents of tobacco and Mexican food. Bryan barely kept himself from retching until he saw a twitching shape of a drowned ant submerged in the thick spit which sent him into a fit of heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he get himself into this mess? It seemed almost a blurred memory. Nestled in his package, retrieved by Tommy, and then disaster when his safe world had been torn asunder by a blundering giant! Why... Or, more importantly, <i>how</i> did this even happen? It seemed a series of events possible only in movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find help...\" The words sounded well-worn - used over and over to little effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Bryan decided to gather his bearings and find exactly where he had been deposited. The ravine was filled with dirt and grime, built up at random, which he found the highest point to climb from. Pulling himself so his head poked up, he immediately shrieked. He was face to face with a slimy, clacking set of mandibles large big enough to smash a park bench. Bryan fell backwards, landing hard on the dirt in the gaping crack, and looking terrified at the huge bug that peered with shining black eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me! Leave me alone!\" He yelled with flicking hand motions, hoping to deter the large ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt merely clicked at him in response, rotating a oblong head curiously. The powerful mandibles clashed together, causing Bryan to yelp and scramble backwards as the ant leaned over the ledge with flailing antennae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his already traumatized body and mind, Bryan felt nothing short of incredulous that his end might be at the jaws of this greasy bug. Determined to survive, he began padding the rough, gritty ground for any means of defense when he felt the disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began vibrating; slowly at first, and not more than the usual disturbances he had been feeling, but now rapidly increasing. A cacophony of loud grinding; the thundering of what sounded like a massive industrial machine grinding a mountain into granules. Then, before either Bryan or the ant could properly react, the glaring sunlight cut out. As if for his tormented benefit alone, time seemed to slow to a sluggish space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the ant, loomed an enormous mass of stained, gouged, and worn white plastic that rolled with thunderous power. It took but a bare second for the huge mass to roar over the slight crack in pavement. Bryan was thrown back by the tremendous shock, bumping hard against the jagged wall, failing to see or hear the reaction of the now terrified ant. He recovered quickly. The ground continued vibrating and looking up, Bryan saw a moving ceiling of random colour and gigantic images flowing past. He felt his stomach drop when the explanation suddenly struck him, but his mouth opened into another scream when a second force of giant white plastic rolled overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan curled into a ball, hoping his thin arms would guard him against the danger. The intense noise and activity quickly subsided and he dared to peer from under his limbs after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" Looking right at him, not more than a few feet away, was the beastly ant. It twitched with a slimy grunt and fell still; suspended from the same ledge in gruesome death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was enough to make his empty stomach churn. Pushing against the grimy ground, Bryan distanced himself, unable to take his eyes off the horrific display. The ant remained only partially intact - the front half; three legs, one antenna, and a body of bloated guts seeping from a popped eye and breaks in the hard armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind focused more on the cause of such a gruesome, but well-timed atrocity. \"It was...a-a-a... fucking wheel!\" He burst, almost unable to believe it despite his past experiences. \"<i>A giant, building-sized wheel</i>! Shit...!\" Bryan could hear - and feel - similar disturbances constantly roaring in the distance. He realized with a shudder that he had just encountered a common <i>skateboard</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was huge!\" It was an obvious statement, but one he couldn't help but speak. After all, you don't see a skateboard from that perspective everyday, do you? He remembered the glimpse of the gigantic wheels: big as a freaking commercial building, and with enough power to decimate a mountain range!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered, jumping girlishly when another went crashing over the crack much further down. For just a moment, he could see the looming shape of the rider - gargantuan and ominous as a god of myth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the mutilated ant, Bryan blinked and pushed it from his mind. He had far more important things to worry about than stupid ants.

He couldn't believe that his dream of shrinking himself had turned into such a cataclysmic disaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just needed to be rescued - seen for <i>what</i>, and <i>who</i> he is. Shuddering but ready, he decided upon his course of action. Go and get noticed; not matter the cost! Hiding like some pathetic insect in the cracked cement was sure as hell not helping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalling his fears and past failures behind a mental levee, Bryan scrambled up dirt slope collected against one side of the canyon and climbed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis senses were immediately assaulted by the world above. The skate park - a small section of the city park with cement slopes, metal rails, and open spans of cement - was never a destination for the pale, awkward scientist. He gasped at the world around him. It was apparently moderate day for the park, which only catered to not even two dozen skaters, bikers, or rollerbladers. Bryan could see them, towering dark shapes - slow moving in their immensity, and all around him. He saw giants of all ages: young kids, teenagers, twenty-somethings, and older. One pair of young BMXers paused, chatting far off as they obliviously towered above the world. Another behemoth with short dark hair and stubble, pushed a small child on his board, eagerly nodding as he lumbered alongside, keeping the child balanced. Many more strange giants were indiscernible as they thundered around the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's resolve began to waver. \"Oh! What the hell do I do now?\" It was too overwhelming. \"Where do I go... Who do I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck in his thoughts, he blindly ran forward without any idea or direction. In his near hysteria, he failed to notice one tall skater that thundered towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Eeek!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan flung himself, just barely avoiding one wall of gouged, dirt-stricken plastic that flew past him, crushing everything caught underneath. Laying on his back, Bryan stared upwards at a moving ceiling of tall graphic letters all but scratched from existence by heavy use. He locked eyes with a mostly intact sticker, bigger than a cul-de-sac, that featured a sneering cartoon flame. The second wheel blasted past, eliciting a terrified shriek from the bug-sized man as it flung boulders and dirt in its wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as quickly as it came, the massive structure ended and sunlight basked over the pale speck trembling on the ground. Bryan rolled over, watching the gigantic skateboarder rumble away. He was both awe-struck and incredulous. This unfathomable giant was nothing but some teenaged kid, at least 16 years old, who was innocently riding across the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his rather foolish decision to venture out, Bryan decided to find cover to avoid the same fate bestowed upon that unlucky ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world kept moving as the minuscule man had his epiphany, and the ever-trembling ground began to vibrate more violently as a massive shadow fell over the cement landscape. Bryan turned from the now-distant skater and faced a new threat with a scream that seemed to instantly evaporate in the deafening commotion. Standing atop a much-too-large board that loomed like a plateau, stood a tremendous three-year old that looked more like the colossus of Rhodes turned infant. The huge skateboard and child roared forwards, propelled by a towering man who sported an expression of warm admiration as he balanced the toddler with huge hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! HEEEEELP!\" Bryan screamed. The monster child chortled, loud but barely audible over the deafening grind of wheel against cement. \"WAAAIT! STOP, NO, STOPP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting another round of screams, Bryan tried to escape the path of the massive board. Unable to realize such a tiny existence, or care about anything in his path, the gigantic father directed the board elsewhere, his unfathomably huge feet slamming against the gritty cement as his did. The tiny man attempted to flee, but found himself thrown to the ground by such intense seismic disturbance. A heavy crash jolted the earth, caused by the giant man's tattered skate shoe landing in the distance, but Bryan barely noticed as he looked up to see the other sneaker lifting overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan overcame his hoarseness and screamed at the merciless sole encompassing his entire sky. The perforated tread had once been tan, but now looked discoloured throughout with dark smudges and trapped dirt. Each round lug looked big enough to fit his living room; and, packed with all manners of crud. Dirt and pebbles of all sizes were crammed into the holes and lines at random, with bits of gooey organic splotches smashed against the rubber throughout. Among these disgusting collections, near the heel that was almost worn flat, the identifiable remains of a small creature smashed partially into the dirty tread with a few legs crusted around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes settled in the region he was destined for, near a huge logo surrounded by blue rubber. And, as it crashed downwards with a great rumbling of air, Bryan merely screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if the sky fell upon him. The impact was beyond description: landing with such tremendous force that Bryan blacked out momentarily. His head spun, ringing painfully, his whole body throbbing. Bryan's entire form was compacted painfully into a narrow and sticky crevice; and, as he gasped, it tasted both sweet and earthy like gum dropped in the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a huge release in weight and dull creaks as the oblivious titan shifted his massive foot above. Then the ground slid beneath him and he felt himself rising up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God! Help, me - please, not like this! Help me!\" He barely wheezed the words out when a grotesque shape dangled free before him, smelling of foul house cleaner. He jolted, attempting to pull back as he struggled, when with a grinding shift, he suddenly fell almost a dozen feet with a cascade of sticky dirt and pebbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding flat, the tiny man recovered and watched the massive sole briefly lifting away before it crashed down with a powerful quake. The sneakers heel now faced him, a white sock dusted with dirt stretching up a muscled leg fraught with dark hair.  The word, \"LAKAI\", is stitched in frayed off-white letters and barely recognizably printed on the rubber heel. Bryan looked upwards, hearing another giggle from the excited child and a deep thunder of encouragement from the oblivious father who only had eyes for his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge man stomped away, easily pushing both the kid and board, his massive sneakers lifting and crashing powerfully against the ground with dull booms. Bryan just watched, completely beside himself as he saw what would otherwise be an endearing experience between father and son from the horrifying perspective of a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ! I almost ended up crushed like a bug,\" Bryan had already began running in the least populated direction as he spoke. \"This is suicide, I just need to get the fuck out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying to whomever may listen, Bryan ran for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should'da seen it!\" He recounted his story to Tony while striking a flimsy cardboard match to light his smoke. Scott absently rested a foot upon his skateboard, rolling it back and forth slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to his bike, Tony leaned against it and rotated the unlit cigarette in his mouth. He resisted the urge to chew the filter as he fished around his pocket for his lighter. A gift to him by an ex from a couple years before. Despite his young age, Tony made use of the lighter most every day--just about the only good thing to come from that relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, unknown to both Tony and his buddy, resumed a remarkable struggle for dear life upon Tony's cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting and rocking, Bryan held on to the gigantic cigarette suspended thousands of feet in the air. His hands became slick with sweat, sliding and slipping over the sheer surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-... How can this be happening! ...guugh!\" Bryan squeaked when the huge surface rocked again causing him to slip. He managed to regain his grip, albeit tenuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up presented the terrified scientist with a view of his oblivious host. The giant looked otherworldly; huge lips supporting the skyscraper sized cigarette with idle ease. The whole scenario seemed unbelievable to tiny Bryan, like something he would gloss over from a trash magazine. Yet here he was, cradling himself desperately against the end of a gargantuan cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of another reprieve in movement, Bryan lifted a thin arm and waved it at the planet-sized face directly before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ackk... Uhhm...H-..Help! He-..HELP!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother blast of air greeted him sent from the enormous nostrils that flared above like a living cavern. The huge cigarette rocked beneath him again, sending another wave of vertigo through his petrified body. His hands began to slip again, sopping with nervous sweat. Bryan cried out again. \"God, this isn't fair! Help me, please!\" He knew that falling to his death would be the least of his worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the vile smell of tobacco and the gales of stale breath, Bryan shouted up at the mammoth face again. His voice cracked, but let out strong. \"I'M RIGHT HERE!\" He craned his head. \"RIGHT. HERE! JUST LOOK DOWN, PLEASE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered, dejected. \"God... Please, look down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the clouds parted and the sun returned, the huge eyes looked downwards. The sensation of being looked upon by such a titanic being was both terrifying and thrilling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope bubbled in his frail heart. It filled him, looking into those huge eyes like one looks upon a lake from a plane. Bryan felt sure that he had been seen! Without warning, a building sized finger and thumb crash landed before him. The entire cigarette shuddered. Then he heard the disturbance below. It only sounded after the distinct feeling of something humongous moving beneath him, hovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLICK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Fucking shit!\" Came the words from the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLICK* *CLICK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen hell broke loose. With a hefty blast the lighter beneath him burst into flames, quickly igniting the flammable paper stick. Quick and swiftly, the towering flames appeared around him. They greedily ate the paper and tobacco, burning in a circle that seeming surrounded the bug-sized genius. He screamed, unable to think of anything else to do and far to incredulous at his circumstance to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper guttered and crackled beneath his hands and the air became thicker than stew with smoky fumes. Bryan felt his hair crinkling away and his skin bubble like plastic when thrown into a bonfire. He lifted his hand, only to find the skin seemingly melt away before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!!!\" The wail escaped him and without hesitation, he attempted to fling his smouldering form into free fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony lit his smoke, pinching the cigarette between his index and thumb he took a hefty drag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears pricked slightly when an odd screech; high pitched and dreadful, it seemed to come from his smoke. The BMX biker pulled it from his lips and stared. For a few moment he studied it before tapping away accumulated ash dismissively. Scott burned his own cigarette, blowing puffs of smoke at a fluttering bug, and spewing details of more \"awesome\" and \"rad\" tricks he recently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this chain is bomb, look at this,\" He nudged the off-colour chain with the toe of his shoe while Scott looked on. \"No skids or fuck ups. It's smooth as ice going over anything.\" He patted the tense springs under the seat. Tony told his own story, full of technical details only a guy like him could care about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Scott was just as interested, and the two continued enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkaters and bikers sped past the two, zipping over ramps and inclines with both impressive and comical displays. Scott pointed at one who whisked over the new half-pipe with practiced grace. Scott took one last drag, allowing the cigarette to nearly burn his calloused fingers. \"Mother fuck...\" He let the cigarette drop to the ground with a half-hearted curse. The smoldering stub bounced near the wheel of his board, which he rolled back with one foot and ground the spent cigarette with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony followed suit shortly after. He released the last round of smoke through his nostrils, gazing at another skateboarder who glided over the new half-pipe. \"Looks freaking sweet! Gonna show these fuckers how it's done!\" His thoughts rested solely on the task at hand: riding the new half-pipe. He could of cared less had he known about the minuscule sized life-form he unknowingly incinerated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked the smoking stub to the ground. It landed much in the same fashion as Scott's, bouncing a foot before stopping within reach of his foot. He lifted a worn sneaker over it, and promptly obliterated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing cinders proved nothing against the aggressive sneaker tread which easily ground it into the cement, bits of ash and grit wedging into the tread. Tony hopped onto his bike and sped around the park. Gaining enough speed, he turned towards the half-pipe with an excited grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought of another errant finger terrified him further as he progressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE FOR FUCKSAKES, THIS SHOW IS BORING!\" The huge booming voice thundered. Bryan's ears throbbed in pain from the deep voice, and to make matters worse, the giant's jaw violently shifted when he spoke. The tiny man held on desperately, determined to survive and return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy gale of wind kept blasting him at intervals. Bryan identified the source as two massive cavernous nostrils high above, the interiors coated in darkness. The bill of a mammoth baseball cap loomed higher above, looking like a mega-sized stadium canopy. It was almost inconceivable that this living mountain was just a normal laid-back guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite discomforting movements, and running on waning adrenaline, Bryan began to feel he was making good progress to the safety of the forest-like hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, for fucksakes, this show is boring!\" Tony complained loudly. His tingling stubble was making him more impatient than usual, and he had little care for the soapy old sitcom Mason chose. \"Change it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went through all the damn channels! Nothing else is on.\" Was the indignant reply, much to Tony's annoyance. The BMX-biker frowned and considered snatching the remote from his buddy's hand in order to find something, but his ever tingling stubble stopped him. He usually shaved every other morning, only leaving a slight soul patch on his chin. The past two days he hadn't bothered to buzz the facial hair off, since he had been clocking some extra hours at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting disapprovingly, Tony decided to shave the pesky stubble off. Planting his sneakered feet on the carpet, he exited the room. He was unaware of the tiny insect occupants of the apartment that watched his large sneakers stomp thunderously across the room, sending powerful vibrations through the floor. The teen was also oblivious to the minute passenger on the side of his jaw holding on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" The tiny scientist cried out in terror as the huge teenager stood up, causing violent movements and powerful gusts for the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant boom was audible as the gigantic guy walked with powerful steps. Bryan was hopelessly whipped about, his tiny hands clutching the rope-like stubble vainly. He dared a fevered glance downwards, which gave him a terrifying view of the massive sneakers thunderously stomping far below like some kind of giant doomsday robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the massive fingers soared back into view. The huge digits crashed down, almost right on top of the bug-sized man, and began roughly scratching again with disastrous results. His tiny screams prove ineffective in gaining any attention from the gargantuan Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the building-sized fingers lift away, the violent motion of Tony's heavy gait shaking his tiny form, Bryan feels his hands slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grasped for salvation from the many other hairs jutting around him. Another distant crash proceeded a violent shudder through the oblivious behemoth's body. His throbbing hand slid once more and fell free from the thick stubble, causing him to dangle dangerously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeyyaaauuugghhhhh!\" Bryan screamed as the filthy hallway floor came into view thousands of feet below. Clutching for dear life, he watched Tony's worn black skate shoe lift for another step. It slammed upon the dingy floor with a quaking thud, the thick laces settling heavily from the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could only scream as his precarious position shook from the tremendous motion. Both the intense G-forces of the gigantic BMX bikers movement, and his own weakness coupled against him in an almost deliberate way. A loud guttural boom blasted from behind the mountainous lips high above. Bryan grasped at the hair once more, gaping upwards as he did, and unaware of the looming menace approaching from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony's mammoth fingers collided with the sheer surface of the chin like buildings flung at high velocity. The index finger looked more like a cliff-side coated in thick indentations crusted with dirt and grease. It pounded against the surface, heading straight for Bryan as it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaait! Nooo - You'll kill meee!\" He pealed. \"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thrown like nothing more than a speck-sized bit of dirt. Flung into the open air with violent force, he screamed with all the energy he had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn fucking itchy stubble</i>, Tony thought as he pounded out of the living room. <i>God! Itchy as motherfucking hell!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face remained expressionless despite these thoughts and the grunt of irritation he made. Lifting his hand, Tony idly scratched at his chin again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he paused for a moment. His index finger had contacted something. Something small, but moving. With a half-hearted frown, he gazed at the fingertip: turning it slightly to check for any offending parties; he saw nothing but dirt and grime caught beneath the nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...\" Ignoring a loud uproar from the TV, he instead used the finger to rub sleep from his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face became blank again. Tony quickly returned to the thoughts at-hand and stomped the last few steps into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall was nothing short of heart-stopping. Bryan couldn't imagine this was far from what a sky diver might experience should their parachute malfunction. He screamed the entire fall, only a relative few seconds before impacting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's body stung from impact, but he remained intact - and alive. It was unbelievable. The giant youth had merely scratched his chin. Nothing but an innocent attempt to remove an irritation that was none other than shrunken Bryan Smith. For the speck-sized man, it was like being hit by a truck at full throttle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, Bryan immediately opened his mouth for a rasping yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming above him was the oblivious teenager in all his gargantuan glory. Bryan resided in between the titan's dangerous black sneakers, lying among collections of dirt and grime, as well as dark splotches plastered against the dirty floor. Looking up at the nearest shoe, he was amazed by just how massive it was. Easily spanning many football fields in length and towering over 350 feet high, it was positively monumental to behold. Looking further, Bryan follows the massive leg clad in heavy cargo pant to see the gigantic teenager inspecting his dirt crusted fingertip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels light-headed just gazing up at such a huge being, especially thinking he had been that high up. He collects himself and begins screaming vainly for rescue. It was an overused, and much failed, device - but all he had at his disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMPH.\" The giant BMX biker thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man cringed, watching him idly rub the filthy finger into his eye. Suddenly, a cascade of boulder-sized crust plummets from above, sending Bryan into frantic squeals as he dodged the massive eye crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping out of the way as one blasts the ground behind him, Bryan hears a heavy groan from above. He looks to the huge sneaker, standing like a black mountain crafted from worn, stained suede and sprouting thick cords frayed from everyday use by the gigantic owner. It shifts under Tony's unimaginable weight, and suddenly lifts from the floor with the sluggish grace of an animated cliff. The wall of black rubber changes to scuffed tan rubber that makes up the sole of the huge skate shoe. It peels  away from the floor with a deep squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rises above Bryan, breaking through the air like a jumbo jet. He glimpses the familiar sole; packed with dark dirt, huge boulders, and tiny splotches both living and obliterated caught between each heavy lug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering an immense distance, it crashes heavily with a deep quake that shakes Bryan to his core. The other lifts in the same fashion, sporting a similar display of callous destruction pressed into the aggressive treads. The oblivious titan pounds into the nearest room, flicking on a light and slamming the door with an earth shattering explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shudders. \"Fuck him...! He has no goddamm clue just how huge and terrifying he is!\" He stares at the massive door dumbly before shaking himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was back on the ground. A place proven very dangerous for anything as tiny as himself. Looking around, Bryan found himself in a new locale: one with miles of wooden flooring spotted with grime and gunk. Three doors besides the occupied bathroom loomed far off in the distance, shrouded in slight darkness. Behind him, Bryan could easily identify the living room by the flickering lights, dingy carpet, and rumbling voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man realized he should probably hide. Any interaction with these callous mega-sized teenagers seemed pure folly. Looking at a mangled mess of dried legs and carapace that was flattened against the floor only proved this. Bryan was smaller than these ants for godsakes. If they failed to notice them - how in the hell would they notice him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I've got to...\" He declared before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan screamed as the dingy floor came into view thousands of feet below him. He could see Tony's dangerous black sneaker slam down as he walked, sending another tremor through the behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan's body swung uncontrollably in response to the rough movement, his free hand grazed a rope-like hair. Immediately his hand clamped around it in an iron grip. With one hand secured Bryan was able to further secure both hands. Though Tony's steps continued to rock him about, Bryan's grip held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan celebrated his small victory with a loud cheer, before looking around to figure out where the titan was taking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony plodded into the bathroom. Ignoring the various spots and smears on the mirror, he leaned forward studying his face. He dragged a couple fingers through the stubble lining his jaw. Tony's ears didn't detect the pitiful screams of a tiny scientist as thick fingers, spotted with dirt narrowly missed crushing him. Turning the sink on, Tony snatched a can of shaving cream off the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, this is Mason's,\" he thought to himself. \"Fuck it, he'll live,\" He decided with a shrug. Tony popped the cap off, sprayed the foam into his hand, and began smearing in onto his unruly beard. Rinsing the extra foam off his hands he searched briefly for his razor before starting to shave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith smooth strokes Tony shaved off the pesky hair, rinsing the used shaving cream down the drain. He smiled at the sound and feeling of the razor slicing the hair from his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Tony put his razor down and turned the sink off. He admired his clean shaven face, rubbing his chin and grinning. \"I'm one handsome mother fucker!\" he grunted to himself. As he stood back, he noticed he had forgotten to rinse it off one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan face contorted into a frown of disapproval as the giant entered the bathroom. Every surface was covered in some form of stain, with various bottles and toiletries scattered across the faded counter. Looking forward, Bryan could see the titan studying his face in the mirror. He noted that the young man had a gruff, handsome face. Bryan realized that in spite of the terrors he had experienced because of this behemoth, ultimately he was just a teenager, oblivious to his monstrous presence in the world of tiny creatures all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed as two impossibly thick fingers narrowly missed smearing him as the were dragged across the forest of stubble. \"Hey, HEY! RIGHT HERE! HELP ME!\" He shouted, waving with one free arm. As the giant leaned away from the mirror Bryan realized even he couldn't detect his tiny form in the reflection of the giant's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan began to debate climbing, or waiting for another opportunity, ignoring the what the giant was doing at the sink. That is until he heard a loud splat nearby. Bryan's scream of terror was cutoff as a wall of white engulfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick white cream, though loose, prevented him from going anywhere. A small amount got into his mouth and Bryan gagged on the taste. Also a man, he instantly recognized it. \"Shaving cream!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately following that realization, a chilling scraping noise was accompanied by a slight movement of the skin he was stuck to. The mountainous young man was starting to shave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm tight here! ON YOUR FUCKING FACE!\" Bryan's screams, just as his movements had been, were subdued by the cream surrounding him. He did not stop struggling as he could hear the razor approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he heard the scraping noise closer than ever, and a second later a silver blade came at him. \"Augh! No!\" he shouted, trying to avoid being sliced in half. The cream that had held him prisoner, shifted removing him from danger. Bryan cried out as he fell quickly with the huge razor, it was placed onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sputtered, his heart pounding in his chest. A manic laugh burst from his chest. \"I lived! I can't possibly die, because I just keep living!\" he cheered, still laughing feverishly. Looking around he could see the cream, now looking like a white hill, its surface dotted with fallen stalks of thick hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M ONE HANDSOME MOTHERFUCKER!\" thundered the towering titan above. Bryan's gaze followed the billowing shirt, up to the titan's face far above, rolling his eyes at the unsurprising arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stupid ass! Pay more attention to you're surroundings! There's a tiny man, ME, right here!\" he shouted angrily. Tony's eyes fell to the counter and seemed to lock right onto Bryan's battered body. He cheered as the wide hand reached downward, the palm filling Bryan's entire line of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tony grasped the razor's handle and moved it towards the sink, Bryan couldn't suppress a howl of disappointment. At the same time Tony's other hand flicked the faucet on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no NO!\" Bryan screamed as he saw what was about to happen. A waterfall smothered him, violently washing his body away. He screamed, struggling to swim in the storm. The last thing he clearly saw was Tony's face, far above, devoid of emotion as he rinsed off his razor. He couldn't tell which way was up. Frothing water surrounded him as he sharply inhaled, before blackness quickly engulfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony tossed the rinsed off razor onto the counter and pounded out of the bathroom. Unaware of the life snuffed out as he had merely shaved his stubble, Tony settled onto his bed and began a successful round of COD. Bryan Smith's unnoticed corpse remained amongst small hairs plastered to the filthy walls of the sink, another tiny casualty of the oblivious actions of Tony, Mason, and Pete.</span></div></div>",

The stench and humidity are unwelcoming as the first time. He begins to sob as Tony quickly swallows, the gulp resonating around him as Bryan sinks into his esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of food lands on the growing mountain of chewed pizza in the titanic teenager's stomach. As Bryan slows to a stop partway down the slope he looks around in awe. This mountain of food seemed so excessive to the tiny man... and the giant who had just consumed it was undoubtedly unaware of its existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is at a loss. He cannot believe that this is where his adventure into shrinking would end... that this is where his life would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a genius!

He merely enjoys the feeling of fullness. Leaning back, Tony finally feels relaxed after the awful day at work. He enjoys a few hours of TV. Completely engrossed in a show an hour later, nothing indicates to Tony as his stomach begins to churn and break down the pizza. There is no care in the world at the moment for the 19 year old, because he has no way to know and thus no way to worry about the life lost to his digestive system.</span></div></div>",

Gasping he opens his eyes, amazed to still be breathing. The carpet, in spite of being old, worn, and filthy still had enough thickness to it to absorb the impact of his fall. Bryan laughs nervously and shouts \"YES!\" looking upwards in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis view quickly dampens his mood. Above him Tony's shoes hover over the edge of the recliner where he rests his legs. The massive shoe soles are easily visible, as well as the bugs and grime trapped in the tread. A look in another direction reveals a giant roommate, who's shoes rest on the floor, making a deep indent in the carpet. Bryan immediately flees underneath the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems useless as the giants remain still, light from the TV flickering across their faces. From this spot Bryan can clearly see both titans in their entirety. He is amazed by how massive they are. Their shoes each easily span a couple football fields and tower several stories tall. Naturally they don't rival the height off the hairy legs that stretch up towards their broad torsos. Their arms stretch downwards to their large hands, and thick fingers that can grasp mountainous objects and lift them with ease. Their faces, far above a fathomable height to Bryan, are similar to Mt. Rushmore; the teenagers' rugged features all the more magnified to the minuscule Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their size the giants pose danger with every mundane task. Tony's simple footsteps in the kitchen had unintentionally ended the lives of all those ants, their remains somewhat visible in the tread above. Bryan could still hear the smack and squishes as Tony scarfed down the pizza. Though a normal act, it had almost left Bryan to be digested, unnoticed deep inside the giant's body. Mason swung his hand at a pesky gnat, his gigantic hand collided with the bug, sending it flying. These giants were so dangerous, especially to Bryan at this size, and they were completely unaware of it. Their actions that seemed so normal, ended lives of bugs and quite nearly Bryan, and they didn't notice or care. They had no way to see what large, terrifying, and destructive beings they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan takes a step back, as he realizes he will have a hard time getting anything but grief from the giants. Intentional or not they are no longer normal people to him but rather monsters of devastation. He decides he must get to the antidote in the garbage on his own. And he must do it quickly before something else happens!</span></div></div>",

He tried to ignore the noticeable sour smell the carpet produced from decades of dirt and food being treaded into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the skyscraper-sized leg of the coffee table, the shrunken man felt rather safe. A feeling which gave him great relief, especially after the unbelievable trauma of having almost been eaten. The memory made him shudder. He felt a pang of resentment towards Tommy, who had carelessly left the package on the bus which brought Bryan to his current life-threatening predicament. If only Tommy had been more responsible, Bryan would be safe and back to normal at his nephew's college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan squinted, looking at the doorway that led back into the kitchen. He wanted nothing more than to make the journey, retrieve his formula, and escape this nightmare. The distance was daunting, a simple 10 feet translated to many miles of extremely dangerous terrain for the bug-sized man to cross, and then he would have to cross through the kitchen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to stay put until the two gargantuan teens went to sleep. He couldn't gamble that the  seated giants would stay put until he reached his goal, and trying to get their attention would only end in being stomped like an ant. Bryan settled himself as comfortably as possible at the base of the table leg and prepared to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist tried to rest as best he could, but the dull roar of the television and the random deep booming voices from the gigantic teens caused him discomfort. It seemed surreal, and almost funny, that he was able to occupy the same room and view the same television without their knowledge. After what seemed like hours, a large gnat landed nearby causing Bryan to jump in surprise. It seemed uninterested in him as it investigated an unidentifiable crumb, it's hideous hose-like mouth determining if it was edible. Bryan looked in wonder, noting the creatures fragile translucent wings, before it suddenly took flight as the ground shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason had shifted his large feet as he slouched in the couch. This slight action on his part caused the tiny man discomfort as he watched the mountain-sized footwear move, causing further seismic activity. Further alarm spread when he heard a distant thundering roar. It repeated, almost rhythmically, and Bryan suddenly realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snoring!\" He said aloud, his voice sounding quite gravelly from his previous terrified screeching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling around the large table leg, Bryan looked up at Tony, his huge sneakers still propped up, revealing the grime-filled tread. The giant BMX-biker's head sagged to the side, his mouth ajar as he emitted thunderous snores. A glance at the other giant showed him in a similar state, his head leaning forward sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man felt nervous, he didn't want to leave the supposed safety of the coffee table, but now was his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the low, omnipresent rumble produced by the snoring giants, the tiny man fooled himself into thinking he had the luxury of time to accomplish his goal.<br>\r\nEvery so often, he looked over his shoulder to gaze toward the giants. Tony's huge sneakers loomed overhead, and the tiny man stared up at the grime-filled tread of the massive shoes. He saw, among other debris, the remains of tiny, anonymous bugs that the unknowing giant must have obliterated without a second thought.<br>\r\n\"Well, that won't be me now,\" Bryan said aloud, confident he could overcome the dilemma now that the two giant threats were slumbering peacefully.<br>\r\nGiant Mason, the titan responsible for bringing Bryan back to this cursed apartment, had fallen asleep, too. Although his antidote awaited him, the tiny man took a moment to admire the two sleeping giants, feeling a little safer now that they were no longer stomping around the room.<br>\r\nThey looked immensely powerful, even asleep. The tiny man found himself attracted to their scale and power, but he knew that he should not let himself be diverted from his goal.<br>\r\nHe took one last look over the massive forms, and then turned away with determination renewed to get to the antidote. If he had kept staring at them slightly longer, he might have noticed the tiny gnat that kept flitting around Tony's face, causing the titan's nose to twitch as the irritating insect kept brushing against the giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe activities of the gnat became enough of a nuisance to wake Tony from sleep. He waved his hand at his face, brushing the insect away. It continued to flit around his face, and he kept swatting his hand at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he was awake now. And he felt the need to get up and use the restroom. Brushing at the gnat again, he grazed the winged bug. It recovered, however, before hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge gnat buzzed past his head alerted then tiny man to the changed situation. As the gnat stopped its spiraling crash and flew away, tiny Bryan saw the giant shoe raised overhead, suddenly plunging him into shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed, but the shoe dropped without any hesitation, directly onto the bug-sized scientist's puny form. To his horror, Bryan found himself smashed into the grime-filled treads, right next to the demolished remains of a few puny ants the giant had crushed at some earlier time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stomped into the none-too-clean restroom, his sneakers slamming onto the tiles. He planted his feet apart, with one shoe in a puddle that had formed to the side of the toilet, as he relieved himself.<br>\r\nThe tiny man survived the pounding steps across the floor, but then the shoe splashed down into the puddle. The filthy water rose up and filled the grooves in the tread. He struggled for a breath of air that didn't come. He opened his mouth to scream, but the filthy water washed into the open space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes later after a lengthy piss, Tony zipped up and went to the sink to wash his hands. He never noticed the floating pale and lifeless speck he left behind in the puddle on the bathroom floor. A few crushed bodies of ants had also fallen out of the tread to float as additional debris in the puddle.<br>\r\nNot for days did anyone bother to finally mop up the puddle, and then they just left the dirty mop in a bucket in the corner, never having noticed the tiny man's body caught up in the slimy ropes of the mop. </span></div></div>",

He is shocked when a lump of soggy crust slams into him and scrapes him into a pile of moving food. He is shifted, again randomly flying about. Everything stops suddenly and the tiny scientist hopes against odds that his presence has been detected. The lips part and he sees the outside world, framed by jagged teeth littered with bits of soggy chewed food. A loud gust rumbles the cavern from behind and Bryan recognizes the over powering stench to be a burp. The lips rapidly shut and he feels defeated. Of course he is indiscernible from a crumb, the giant had no way to even guess what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of food he is trapped in move backwards and Bryan feels it all sinking downward. \"NO!! Please don't eat me! I'm a human! I'M A GENIUS!\" he shouts hysterically. This of course gets no response and he feels himself moved down violently, surrounded by an amplified gulp, as the giant easily swallows him and the bite of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sobs as he is massaged downwards, surrounded by hulking pressure. Around him the sounds of roaring lungs and a beating heart are constant reminders of the terrible world he has entered. The soggy pile is squeezed through an extremely tight opening, and finally lands with a splat on a growing mountain of chewed pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man looks around at the throbbing pink walls that encompass him. A shallow moat of the soda the giant had guzzled earlier surrounds the mountain. Above him there is a grinding and smushing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stares at all of this, his face frozen in shock and terror. He suddenly glares upward. \"You idiot! I am a genius and you just ate me! How id you not fucking see me!\" he bellows. He lets out an animal-like wail, out of anger and defeat. Surely he can escape! He is a man of great intellect, he can't die in some guy's stomach with pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man's thoughts distract him from the gulping noise and approaching deluge of soda. He is caught completely off guard as he is battered by the incoming soda and chewed food which knocks him unconscious. His body floats in the lake of soda, bumping against the scattered islands of chewed pizza. He never gets the chance to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stares at the screen, tense as he show approaches its climax. It suddenly switches to commercials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" he grunts angrily. \"Mason turns to him \"The do it on purpose dude\" he says unconcerned. \"Doesn't mean it's not bullshit!\" Tony shoots back before looking at Mason's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? There's stuff to make nachos?\" he says surprised. \"Hell yeah!\" he says excitedly without waiting for an answer and jumps from his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Tony this motion and his short walk to the kitchen causes a storm in his stomach, battering Bryan's tiny body against chunks of floating pizza. He returns to the chair just before the commercials begin and begins to quickly down the nachos.Tony doesn't think twice about the food as he pops it into his wide mouth and chews. He gulps down bite after bite effortlessly as he stares at the TV screen. Chewed mounds of cheesy nachos splash into the stomach forming a new mountain that tiny Bryan's unconscious form washes up on. Eventually Tony finishes up his nachos and pizza, finally comfortably full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decides, with the show finished, to go ride his bike around for awhile. He rolls it outside and rides it down the street, doing tricks that impress random bystanders. This fuels Tony's energy and he goes on for over an hour. Though he'd like to go longer, he is tired from the a long day at work and returns to his apartment, sweaty but happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks up the stairs he fails to notice the gurgle from his stomach. Inside the soda has drained away, leaving only soggy piles of food churned by his movement. As he sits in front of the TV to play some Xbox live, his stomach begins to secrete acids that quickly work on breaking down the food from earlier, as well as Bryan's small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony doesn't notice a thing as his the food that had been sitting in his stomach is finally broken down. He hadn't given it any thought since quickly gulping it down earlier. He is focused on his games, unaware of what was happening at that moment, inside his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Tony passed out in front of the Xbox. He had earlier decided in spite of work it had been a good day. And for him it had just been another normal day. As he slept peacefully, his stomach moved the broken down remains of his long forgotten meal out of the stomach, the place where Bryan Smith's extraordinary day had ended. Permanently.</span></div></div>",

Bryan struggled with renewed determination at the sight of Tony reaching for another slice. The colossal guy didn't even look as he grabbed another sizable slice, and proceeded to raise it to his unforgiving mouth, pausing briefly at an intense scene from the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! I'm down here!\" Bryan whimpered, his heart sinking in despair. He was hopelessly trapped, a massive bit of pepperoni firmly pressing him into the slimy cheese. A pained glance gave the shrunken scientist a view of an ant pulling itself from a different slice above him. The insect found it's scavenging in the fridge disturbed when the teenager arrived, and was trying escape from the dangerous Tony. Watching Tony's huge hand come into view again, the giant fingers grabbing this very slice, taking the doomed ant with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cringed seeing this careless youth chomp down on this slice, his stomach turning at the thought of the poor ant. Never did Bryan forsee his current predicament. This little adventure was supposed to be a harmless surprise for his nephew's benefit, he thought, not becoming the first human bug to be eaten by a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large shadow caught his attention, and Bryan cried out in vain. A huge finger plucked the heavy pepperoni roughly pulling tiny Mr. Smith with it, dangling wildly. His eyes took in the detail of the building-sized fingernail clutching the huge meat, its filthy non-manicured appearance disgusting the prim little man. His judgement was short-lived, as the giant face of Tony encompassed his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't eat me! Please!\" Bryan's voice cracked with emotion, choking on his own tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could cry out pitifully again, everything suddenly changed. A deafening explosion blew the tiny man back, causing him to flail madly through the air at break-neck speed. His shrill little squealing went unnoticed to the two mammoth teenagers, one just recovering from a sneeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision darkened, the tiny man swore he saw stars as he recovered from the terrifying flight. His body ached, but miraculously appeared unscathed, his minute stature making him more resilient to falls, but not immune. Bryan thrust his head to the side, purging his stomach after such a violent fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBleary-eyed, the tiny man took in his new surroundings. From a normal perspective, the tiny man was flung no more than 5 feet from his original predicament. From his small position on the floor, the distance seemed great, and the recovering Tony looked distant and ever dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Dude, don't spray that all over!\" Mason started as his buddy let out an explosive sneeze. Tony glared, wiping his nose and retorted, \"Fuck you, man\". Glancing around the dim room, lit only by the flashing television and the light filtering in from the kitchen, he scowled. He had lost the tantalizing pepperoni, which alone was his favourite part of the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Tony, his unpleasant sneeze had saved the tiny scientist's life, though the floor was no safer for such a small being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man forgot, and reacted to a sudden wave of glorious violence from the TV. Tony idly swatted at an annoying, buzzing gnat as he leaned his other hand in for the last slice of filth-ridden pizza his eyes fixed on the flashing screen. Mason propped his large feet on the battered coffee table, taking a large swig of his soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! What're you two watching?\" Pete interjected, as he entered the dingy living room from the hall. The red-headed youth was fully dressed now, wearing a black t-shirt, jeans, and beat-up Nike sneakers. His goofy demeanor, and laid-back attitude made him a fun guy. The three decided to get an apartment together after high-school, despite Tony being one grade ahead of them, and since they all enjoyed sports, such as biking and skating, it was a match made in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony still glued to the TV, replied with a grunt, \"Walking Dead\". With heavy steps, the tall Pete flung himself in a tattered armchair near the couch, unaware that he almost crushed a strange little bug. A low rumble emitted from Pete's stomach, and looking over at the plate near Tony, he asked, \"Did you eat all the pizza, dude?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering youth rose from his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for him, Bryan was close to the leg of an enormous end table as a new giant entered the room. The ground trembled as a huge sneaker landed with a dull boom. Having forgotten about this third titanic teen, the little man dreaded having to deal with a third pair of massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YO\" Roared a deep voice overhead, causing the tiny genius to shield his ears. Taking this opportunity to look up at the frighteningly tall youth looming above, he steadied himself as the titan began moving again. The dangerous footwear raised up, almost in slow-motion, a frayed lace hung limply in front of the trademark Nike \"swoosh\". Heavy vibrations followed each thunderous step as the young titan crossed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy sneakers left impressions in the thick, grimy carpeting that covered the dingy room. Seeing the titanous teen taking a seat, the little man prepared to make his way back to the kitchen where he hoped to scale the trash bin in search of his antidote. Crawling through the revolting carpet, tiny Mr. Smith couldn't help but notice the variety of food and dirt in the carpet. With a shudder he even noticed the remains of a variety of insects stomped into the fibers by heavy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis journey ran uninterrupted until a deep voice thundered, causing the tiny man to turn around. The huge Pete slowly rose to his full height and without a thought for any small creatures on the floor, began lumbering towards the tiny scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turns out they just can't use someone who can't score from 10 feet away.\" Pete grinned, and Mason idly grunted a profanity in response causing Pete to chuckle. He succeeded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis youthful mind returned to more important matters, which predominately concerned food. The teen knew that once Tony came home, he would raid the fridge and eat all the left-over pizza. Pete continued to the refrigerator in question, pulling it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low grumble emitted from his stomach as his eyes rested on the cold pizza. He quickly snatched the greasy box, licking his lips in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete liked the pizza cold, so he prepared to leave so he could enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could barely comprehend the massive visage of the titan that loomed before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neck complained painfully as he craned his head back in order to look at the colossal teen's face. The tiny man felt he was looking through a fish eye lens, as the giant legs towered endlessly till they met the distant torso that supported a head that rivaled the moon in size. What further shocked him was the slight movements this gigantic being made, movements that seemed almost in slow-motion. It simply amazed him that something so huge could even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind contemplated these things, he wasn't prepared to see the giant walk. Bryan's eyes grew wide as the left foot, which more closely resembled a mountain in size, lifted off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth went dry as he broke into action, bolting in terror. The humongous foot crashed down heavily just a dozen feet away. Bryan was thrown by the powerful shock wave, his tiny voice shrieking in surprise. Landing roughly, he heard another more distant thud and felt the ground shudder as the titan continued his threatening stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist watched the young colossus open an equally huge refrigerator with ease. Bryan looked at the giant bare feet that almost smashed him only moments before. The simple action of just crossing a room almost spelled death for the tiny man. He wanted nothing more than to wake up from this horrible nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself back up, he steadied himself. \"I need to get his attention. He has to see me!\" He hoped in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe refrigerator closed with a dull boom, and Bryan watched the huge red-headed teen turn. The large bare feet thudded heavily as they shifted. The tiny man jogged forward, waving his little arms in an attempt to be rescued. He began screaming desperately when he realized that the giant couldn't even see the ground because of the grease-stained pizza box he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Down here, help me! Look down!\" Bryan stopped, jumping in an almost comic fashion. A single booming step and the huge teen was directly before him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan squeaked in shock as a cruise ship sized foot soared overhead, bits of dirt and grime falling from the filthy sole. It thundered down heavily behind him, causing the ground to lurch once more under the tiny man's feet. A couple ants on the floor were crushed beneath one of the huge bare feet. The giant didn't take any notice as he continued his dangerous journey lumbered to the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless, he thought in despair, watching the oblivious guy disappear into the hall. He was simply too small. Not to mention, these giants didn't even know he existed. The stomped ants had a better chance of being rescued than he did. His tiny body ached all over. The horrendous fall from the box, and almost being stomped upon was taking its toll. A slow progress brought him to the base of the nearby cupboards, which towered endlessly above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind spinning, Bryan sat himself near a building-sized cheerio and collapsed into unconsciousness. </span></div></div>",

One of hands raised, brushing his cheek before grabbing a clump of juicy grapes and bringing them closer for his consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I am a bit peckish! Grapes would be marv-...Ouch!\" His bashful words twisted into a screech of pain as the graceful hand slammed both itself and the plump grapes directly into his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bryan lurched from his dreams, blinking and twitching back to reality. His face smarted. Rubbing it, he glared at what seemed an unlikely \"reality\", before shrieking in terror as another painful impact hit his exposed hip. \"Shit...!\" Bruised, he scampered on his ass from a horrifying ant that loomed over him. \"What is going on! Get back you six-legged freak!\" The ant ignored this squeaking insult, and merely clacked curiously with invasive antennae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo busy glaring into the glinting eyes, Bryan was whacked in the side by one antennae again. It was an intense hit, whether the insect intended to or not. Bryan screamed and scuttled back again. The ant merely approached closer seeming more interested in the tiny man than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering a head large as his torso, the ant clicked and clacked with extreme interest. Bryan was sure the foul creature had never encountered something like himself before. He was also sure encountering an ant this close would end very badly. Hoping to avoid that end, he timidly smacked at the hard, greasy, blackened head to dissuade it from getting any closer. The ant was unfazed, until one hit made contact with a squishy black eye the size of Bryan's fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yuck!\" The tiny man exclaimed as the over-sized ant reared backwards. Twisting in pain, the insect focused a glare that consisted of a dented, gushing blob and an inky orb full of fury. \"That was...Uhh...Uh oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the simple-minded ant had in mind, Bryan never found out, as not a moment later the angry ant was suddenly overshadowed by a larger organism from behind. One sickening snap followed a violent jerk and the unsuspecting bug was plucked into the air by an even larger bug; or, more correctly: an arachnid just short of out-sizing Bryan's garage. The tiny man responded to the ant's plight by screaming for his own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider ignored the tiny squeaking pink-thing, allowing full focus upon the juicy ant now dead and ready to be devoured. Bryan screamed again, utterly beside himself with fear, and sprung up to his feet and promptly ran face first into the pocked siding of a massive stale cheerio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his back against the crispy surface, he gaped wide-eyed at the terrifying spider. \"Just...just stay back! Don't hurt me!\" His pleads washed uselessly over the large arachnid, who showed not a shard of interest for \"hurting\" Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to flee, Bryan sidled awkwardly against the Cheerio and then launched at his first opening towards the seemingly endless expanse of open floor. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seated himself on his table before consuming the contents of the small vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent that years of testing had perfected quickly reduced him to a size of a mere quarter-inch, leaving him a pale, insignificant speck on the vast tabletop. He didn't marvel for long, knowing he needed to get inside the packing crate before Tommy's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started his journey across the tabletop when a sudden cacophony of noise, combined with a fierce gale, interrupted his trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was that Tommy had arrived early, but when he saw the huge man in the green uniform, a forgotten fact clicked in his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!

The almost empty package and the crisp $100 bill, picked up by the gust of wind, lifted upward before beginning their fall back toward the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same wind swept the unprepared tiny man right over the edge of his kitchen table.

Bryan had survived the impact at the end of the plunge from the tabletop, but at the cost of feeling stunned and brain-addled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an instant to reflect on the perceived perversity of the universe. Thinking that he had planned so carefully, he was now reminded of that time-honored adage that \"anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan held his head in his hands, trying to find the strength to make it to his feet, as things prepared to get a whole lot worse...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was fight or flight time, and he knew very well the consequences of even imagining a fight against one of those enormous boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, for the tiny man, reduced to the size of a bug by his own folly, it was definitely time for flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't completely panic. \"If I can make it to the baseboard along the bottom of the wall, I can avoid his feet,\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that involved a sprint across a wide distance of open floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared up again at the enormous exterminator, his eyes took in the immense form.

The massive young exterminator dominated the room with his presence, his heavy steps reverberating through the floor.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBryan had little choice if he didn't flee. Either suffer a slow death from the horrific poison, or end up under a massive work boot. None of them were appealing, this titanic young man was too dangerous and obviously wouldn't take a closer look before spraying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the unfathomable door, a door he used only this morning, Bryan looked for any means of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis searching eyes widened as he approached the far right side of the door. A small crack in the moulding, barely noticeable to a normal person, stood at least 10 feet tall and a good many feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's how the ants were getting in...\" He muttered, noticing the hulking ants escaping through the crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy boom, followed by vibrations caused tiny Bryan to remember his plight, a quick backwards glance showing the huge, threatening Diego looming directly behind. Bryan jumped into action at the terrifying sight, hearing the ominous roar of the spraying poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swiftly darted past a slow moving group of ants, and he ducked into the cavernous crack. Barely a second later, a thunderous boom shook the ground as a gargantuan work boot crashed down outside, mercilessly flattening the slow ants underneath. The thick, scuffed sole was covered in dirt and creaked as it supported the colossal man's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man ran through the dark passage with blind hysteria. A loud explosion was heard from behind as the huge exterminator blasted the crevice with chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan dramatically burst through the exit, stumbling, and landing adage distance from the exiting crack as a plume of poisonous gas seeped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, and with heaving breath, tiny Mr. Smith sat up and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crevice had occurred naturally from the house settling with age, but was made usable by industrious ants in search of sustenance. They entered from a concealed location in the dirt surrounding the cement platform just outside the kitchen door. Bryan looked at the looming cement side, before he considered it too small and had thought about expanding it into a porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to be alive, the tiny scientist thought about his next coarse of action.</span></div></div>",

Bryan had come incredibly close to being obliterated like ant ant by the exterminator that he contracted. Now, he was safe outside... Or so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYard work never much suited the busy genius. Besides his personal reasons, his hiring of Tommy to mow his lawn was out of necessity. He had never paid the teenager to do anything else, which left the rest of the yard rather weedy and forgotten. It never mattered before, but now it was all too apparent to the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These weeds have really gotten out of hand...\" His eyes studied a huge tree-like thistle, with spiky plumage. Surrounding the wretched plant was a forest of small grass-like weeds that looked like some kind of twisted forest to Bryan. This large foliage was still small compared to the looming cement steps nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Bryan knew he had no choice but to find some sort of refuge out here while the enormous exterminator worked. A shady spot in the grass forest would be suitable, then later he could return back through the cave to his kitchen. \"This somehow works out, I won't have to worry about the ants when I go back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was being hopeful, but regardless, Bryan tried to make the best of his situation. The exterminator was just doing his job after all, right? Bryan still cringed at the thought of his close call, despite himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brittle weeds were larger than he initially thought as he walked among them. Passing large boulder sized pebbles, and massive crumpled leaves, he marveled at his surroundings. It was all so alien to him. That this strange, hostile environment was only a small part of his neglected back yard. Thoughts, fears, and regrets filled his mind as he continued into the tangle of gigantic weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he wretched to a stop. A sticky, almost wet, substance coated the better part of his right arm. \"What the...!\" He wriggled the arm in fury. It was no use, his limb was tightly stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forwards, his right leg suddenly became stuck. Bryan squirmed in confused anger, his eyes widening with horror as he looked around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entirety of his immediate area was coated in intricate silken strands, glistening with sticky strength. It was a cavern of the stuff, and the tiny man knew what it meant. \"Spider!\" Ants larger than he was were dead and bundled, even a decomposed dragonfly the size of a 747 hung loosely above. No movie could ever have hoped to capture the mortifying sight for the normal-sized person to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther on a dark hole of glimmering silk rested just under a massive leaf. Bryan swallowed roughly, knowing full well the monstrous creature was undoubtedly inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get away before the arachnid discovered him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed helpless, and the pitiful squeaks the wiggling creature made seemed to quell any fear in the large arachnid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith practiced steps, the large ghastly spider approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego released the trigger on the spraying mechanism as he coated the last corner of the infested kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surveyed the room listlessly. With sharp precision, the young man had sprayed the powerful chemicals in all the likely crannies. His gaze stopped at the base of the back door. A tiny crack in the plaster had caught his attention earlier, ants had been crawling into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching it, Diego crouched down to investigate it again. A tiny ant still moved among dozens of dead ants, struggling against the fatal poison near the crack. He smashed it under his thumb, and covered the minuscule crack with some quick-dry putty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is how they were getting in.\" He thought, standing back up. \"Probably a nest of them outside.\" More often than not this was the case, and they would return if not dealt with. The owner, Mr. Smith, would surely want the infestation dealt with thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exterminator hoisted the canister of chemicals on his shoulder, and stifled a yawn as he pulled the back door open. Pebbles crunched under his boots as he stood on the cement block outside, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego had no way of knowing what his presence meant to the home owner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had closed his eyes in an attempt to distance himself from his fate. He was going to be eaten by a spider that lived in the weeds in his back yard, and he was helpless to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sound echoed from his left. The huge spider halted, timidly crouching only a dozen feet away. From his captivity, Bryan watched in awe as his kitchen door opened.  Heavy booms were felt when the enormous exterminator stepped out onto the cement platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting all about his previous danger, the shrunken scientist gawked up at the huge man. An impossibly looming titan in green work coveralls, the young guy's presence dominated everything. Bryan watched from his tiny spot in the forest of tall weeds. The exterminator seemed to be scanning the ground near the door, his face shadowed by a company baseball cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the huge face looked down, seemingly right at him, Bryan felt his heart leap. \"I'm here! Yes! Help me, please!\" It seemed so impossible, but surely... The titanic face showed no recognition, only the hard emotionless gaze of a labourer. A chill ran down his spine as the realization of this new situation set in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once imposing spider quickly fled to the safety of it's nest. Bryan watched it vanish into the darkness helplessly, before looking back up. Lifting over the edge of the towering concrete platform, soared a humongous black work boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tremendous force it crashed down on the weeds. The leafy weed that housed the spider were mercilessly flattened under the boot. Bryan was sent reeling back as the webbing crumbled, his cries of shock tiny and unnoticeable. Shortly, a second explosive step shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan whimpered painfully, watching the gargantuan boot that almost crushed him shift. The ground, weeds, and everything else were destroyed by the thick tread. Somehow things have gotten worse for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge exterminator now loomed directly overhead, work boots callously planted into the ground, legs continuing endlessly up, and a massive hand wielding an ominous spray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He would have had no chance of scaling the vertical cliff if not for the tangle of cords and cables that supplied power to appliances ranging from his microwave to a blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought, he began the climb that, he hoped, would put him on a safer level with a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the giant was on the move again, making the bug-sized man immensely glad he was no longer on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego, having searched the cabinets for a plate, placed a slice of bread on the plate. He was ready to start building a massive sandwich when he wondered if the fridge might contain some mayonnaise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy ignoring the giant's impressive movements around the room, the tiny man climbed to the counter's surface in good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, standing far from the dangerous floor, he surveyed the room. He saw the giant on the horizon, the upper part of his huge body once again concealed within the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith raced across the counter, throwing himself onto the rim of the huge plate, rolling toward a 12-feet-tall brown wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking contact with the slice of bread, he discovered that the porous surface of the bread allowed him convenient handholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself atop the massive slice of bread just as the giant turned back toward the counter. The behemoth moved with a shocking grace that stood in sharp contrast to his overwhelming size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he felt the need to run, or at least hide, the tiny scientist stood his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would make his stand in the center of the bread slice, the place the giant would be sure to look and notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was taking a big gamble, but the alternative was to wait for Diego to douse him with a blast of bug spray.</span></div></div>",

Or, he could be proactive and undertake a trek across the wilderness of the backyard, which was all that separated his home from the residence of Tommy and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have tried to get back into his own home, but the thought of that stomp-happy exterminator caused him to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back inside, for the moment, wasn't an option. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He yelped, trying to bat away more blows. His genius mind swam, concussed, but around a single thought: this was it! He was going to be bludgeoned to death by a fucking ant the size of his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat immediately became somewhat preferable when Bryan's defensive swipes with his right arm came to an abrupt halt. Warning pain and alarm shot through his body, eliciting yet another screech. His tender, thin arm was held firmly between two rugged, wickedly shaped mandibles that clamped his arm like a machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr-uuck! No...! No!\" Bryan protested, pulling weakly. He first heard it before intense sensation tore a horrific scream from the shrunken scientist's tiny lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRRRR-UNCH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIIIIIIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely something as slight as tightening both mandibles, the ant easily shattered Bryan's arm in twain. It was held just above the elbow, now twisted unnaturally with fingers twitching sporadically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant decided the next course of action, if it was even capable of decision beyond mere instinctive reaction. It began tugging Bryan, pulling his almost upright as it attempted to gain a better hold. Such a strange, seemingly exotic catch would be a prize to present to the hive in this trying time. Bryan wanted to struggle, but his vision blurred again, blinking in and out. He was helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, this fate was still not to be. Dull sensation rumbled through the earth itself, alerting all the fleeing ants of what came not a moment after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above the water-saturated plain of dirt and weeds, the looming portal of Bryan's backdoor seemed to tremble with anticipation before violently pulling inwards with tumultuous effect. Muted quakes rattled through the landscape as one behemoth figure exited, huge boots slamming upon the cement plateau above them. The gargantuan exterminator surveyed the worldscape of Bryan's backyard, his lower face obscured by a huge face mask and the upper shadowed beneath a baseball cap. Bryan was cruelly dropped by the ant, who joined the trail of ants escaping towards the lawn, seemingly miles away. He lay there, large ants skittering past and gazed up at the massive man he hired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy had been attractive, in a sort of rough tradesman sort of way, and the company he worked for was both trustworthy and fairly priced. Afterall, Bryan gave them access to his home. And always resulting in a thorough job. None of that mattered anymore. This guy seemed like nothing short of a monster. One that wrought wanton destruction without any thought -- neither cruelty or empathy played any part, it was just a job plain and simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich seemed perfectly reasonable until Bryan found himself on the losing side with the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched his fractured arm, wincing but thankful to be freed of the large insect, and gazing upwards at the vertigo-inducing visage of the gigantic exterminator. Bryan felt a cold rush goose-pimple his flesh when the otherworldly face looked down, seemingly right at him. Distant shifting echoed from above before one work boot lifted and soared over the towering precipice of cement. It crashed down to the dirt below, landing with a quaking thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell...no, no, no,\" Bryan said, between gasps fueled by pain and the thought that this gargantuan man meant to flatten the landscape beneath his huge boots. \"Help me...please, just help me. I'll do anything--give you anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this guy was purposefully doing this. Not that he wanted to extract funds from the shrunken genius in exchange for his life. Realistically, the huge man would immediately stop his work if he knew of Bryan's plight. The guy was just doing his job -- what Bryan had paid him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan hobbled to his feet, dizzy, and watched as darkness overtook him and acres upon acres of terrain. His fears of death intensified as the giant's boot shifted, groaning beneath immense weight and pressing toe-first in the dirt while the heel rose up. Gazing up, he realized the behemoth was getting closer...crouching! Exhilaration pumped through his tiny body, mixing with adrenaline to further block out his fractured pain, and filling Bryan with hope. Surely he had been seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank fuck! Oh, my god, thank fuck! I'm...-I'm...\" Tiny peals of relief faded as Bryan found his tiny perspective utterly overwhelmed by the enormous mountain of man lowering closer and closer. Yelling to god seemed ridiculous god himself seemed to be looming right above him. Closer and closer the giant lowered, his topographic visage becoming more like the geography than face. Eyelashes akin to redwood trees framed dark hazel eyes set beneath a tangle of dark hair canopied by an immeasurably huge hat. The rest of the exterminator's face was hidden beneath a mass of fibrous plastic making up his disposable safety mask. Huge muffled blasts of deep, humid breath could be heard as the enormous man breathed. Bryan trembled, filled with fear once more as he tried in vain to comprehend, much less relate, to this titan of a man. He couldn't even tell if the giant had an expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. Despite the tiny man's hope, the huge man looked at the ground but not at the minuscule human upon it. To him, Bryan realized, he was invisible. Another speck. Too tiny for something so fucking huger to discern out of all the skittering ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking titan scanned the ground, glossing over the skittering insects, utterly incapable of understanding the utter terror his presence caused. Bryan stood again, his lame arm tucked like an injured wing and tried in vain to follow the giant's gaze. A rumbling sensation warned him moments before an enormous hand appeared overhead, thick edificial fingers poised, thumb-out. With a dull thud, the huge digit impacted the once imposing crack in the foundation, now reduced to a mere sliver in comparison. Scraping sluggishly, the crack was completely filled with a matte gray caulk, completely sealing it from the insects inside and out. Bryan kept his pace, gasping and pained as he tried to make some meaningful contact with the giant exterminator before it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ease, Bryan watched the thick digit pull away, leaving a greasy, dirty fingerprint embedded in the caulk. \"No! Wait! Wait!\" He yelled, running for it as if it alone were capable of understanding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChunks of grimy left-over caulk debris fell free from the digit, sprinkling noisily as Bryan ran himself against the calloused mass of ridged flesh. And against all odds, it worked.  Halting momentarily before raising directly above the speck of a man. Bryan staggered back, gaping up at the literal mountain of thumb just above him. Bits of dust, dried caulk, and debris lined the rough surface. He realized his mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a meteor crashing down to Earth, the thick digit fell downwards with leisurely speed and abruptly smashed Bryan and thousands of pounds of earth into itself. The crushing sensation was immeasurable. Such power that Bryan couldn't even begin to fathom, seemingly beyond that of even biblical description. He felt pain, but the strange temperature most. The harsh, ridged skin was warm. And the moist earth below was cold, but quickly warming. Then suddenly, everything lifted and it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan went upwards for a moment as well before falling many feet back to the ground. Chunky debris fell around him. Pain shot over his body, mostly from his already damaged arm, and his head throbbed, but overall he had been spared due to the softness of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fu-uck...\" He said, barely able to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud disturbance showed the humongous man had already moved on and was back to his full towering height. Bryan realized fully that contact was not only impossible, but suicidal. The guy effectively pulverized Bryan just because he dared to make even the most insignificant contact. Genius Bryan Smith was literally <i>nothing</i> to this behemoth of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no chance of rescue. Not now, at least. And it wasn't over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blur of the onrushing work boots added motivation to the shrunken scientist's efforts, but he simply wasn't quick enough to avoid the oncoming boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Diego's boots stomped down. For tiny Bryan, the sound of thunder was followed by a sickening, squishy sound. The boot lifted off the floor as the giant opened the door to the basement. Everything looked tilted and crazy as the shrunken man struggled to comprehend what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego's enormous boot had dropped right on top of him, but he wasn't dead. Instead, he found himself lodged deep into the fresh mud trapped in the tread beneath the boot. The exterminator had stepped in the mud on the short walk from the curb to Mr. Smith's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man wanted to be thankful for his evasion of a grisly fate, but it was hard to feel appreciative as Diego stomped down the flight of steps leading into the dusty, darkened basement. Piles of cardboard boxes were stored along one wall. A weight bench (a holdover from one of Mr. Smith's short-lived phases to get in better shape) stood in the center of the room. Tucked under the flight of stairs with its set of six steps was the skyscraper-like water heater. Bare concrete floors and cobwebs in corners and crannies completed the atmosphere of the forlorn basement where Mr. Smith rarely visited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego, however, knew that many insect problems began in the basement. As he stomped around the concrete floors, a chunk of mud dropped from the tread of his boots. Diego poked the nozzle of his canister of insecticide into a few likely nooks and crannies, spraying the lethal liquid in liberal doses, never noticing as a tiny, pale form squirmed out of the chunk of mud and crawled over the bare floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT SHOULD JUST ABOUT DO IT DOWN HERE,\" Diego said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man realized the true horror of his situation.

He passed beneath the colossal weight bench, which looked liked the size of some mysterious ancient monument. Its true purpose was certainly beyond him now.

Not only did they provide light, they allowed him to keep track of the passage of days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, he had spent two nights in the basement, huddled in his lodging that was nothing more than a space between the stacks of enormous cardboard boxes along one wall. During the fitful sleep between light and darkness, he often dreamed of gigantic teenagers and the destruction they could bring to helpless insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had awoken not too long ago to his third morning in the basement when diffused light shone through the windows and cast everything in the basement in a dull gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slept on a scrap of paper that at least didn't require him to bed down on the hard, cold concrete. His scrounging around the basement had not found anything that could serve as even modest clothing, so he continued to go about naked as he explored the seemingly endless basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attempts to find food and water had proved as futile as the one to find clothing, until yesterday. A slow leak from the towering water heater crammed into a space beneath the stairs had formed a pool of water on the concrete floor.

Lacking any means to collect the water, however, he was now obliged to make the long trek from the cardboard boxes to the water heater every day just to quench his thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long trek took him past the long-forgotten exercise bench, and on this day he noticed something. He saw it atop a folded towel that he must have left behind on the floor beneath the bench the last time he had made use of the exercise bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red, gold and brown foil gleamed in the dull light, but he would have recognized it even without the large letters that spelled out \"ENERGY BAR.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis empty stomach rumbled at the thought of the oatmeal and chocolate bar, which looked big enough to provide him an inexhaustible supply of food, or at least enough food to hold out until someone came to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found plenty of knotty handholds in the fabric of the towel and quickly climbed onto the vast, white surface of the towel and ran toward the discarded energy bar.</span></div></div>",

He was simply so damn small that even a thin layer of foil could defeat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to remember the day when, at his normal size, he had gone to the basement, taken a bite of the energy bar and then forgotten it when he left. He tried, but he could not recall how long ago that had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he could still remedy his exile. He could get back to his proper size. \"Tommy, or someone, will come looking for me...\" he said, trying to deny the improbability of that hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I do get back to normal, I will never, ever use the formula again,\" he vowed. \"It's too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed up a few handfuls of the oatmeal/chocolate crumbs for the long trek back to the cityscape formed by the irregular stack of large cardboard boxes. He was tempted to spend the night here. The towel provided a soft, comfortable surface, but he was also exposed and vulnerable. Once the basement was again plunged into darkness, he preferred to be tucked away in his cranny \"apartment\" wedged into a crack between two of the massive cardboard containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the long journey back across the concrete plain, he entertained himself with visions of the enormous exterminator. Seeing that massive human being from an insect's point of view had been an altering experience. He had never felt so helpless in his entire life than when that enormous boot had come down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should have been the tragic end to his experiment, but instead of crushing him, some mud squished into the boot tread had saved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that had also been the cause of his banishment from his own home when he fell out of the tread and was left behind when the exterminator left the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his dick harden, fueled by the memory of Diego's powerful form. The organ bobbed between his legs as he walked across the basement floor. He paused as he neared the lowest step in the staircase leading upstairs to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing the stairs, mesmerized by how each step loomed steeper and steeper, wordlessly emphasizing how far removed he had become from the rest of his known universe, he grunted and groaned as he jerked himself to a quick climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his life, reduced to the basic instincts... thirst, sex, hunger... he could still satisfy those needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis intellect, which had brought him here, played very little role in his daily life now. When he did entertain schemes to escape the basement, they always ended in frustration as the impossibility of any attempt loomed large in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore continuing on his journey, he visited the nearby pool below the slowly leaking water heater for one last drink of the day. Fortified as far as his needs went, he continued his way toward the boxes, arriving at his destination as the sun outside began to rob the basement of even dim light for another night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe settled onto the scrap of paper, and almost as soon as his eyes closed, he sank into a deep sleep. His exhausting daily treks across the basement desert left him with little energy for dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He belted out a shrill screech as it crashed down. Bryan woke with cold sweat speckling his face and arms as he rubbed his eyes with shaking hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dream,\" He breathed. \"Just a horrible dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he found it wasn't a dream. He was still in his basement, under a scrap of paper, smaller than a grain of rice. It was a nightmare come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy rays of light shown through the dust covered window high up the cement wall. Bryan surveyed the enormous space lain before him. He couldn't imagine that he was ever able to stride across this room in a few steps. It had always seemed too small, which is why he never put his make-shift lab down here. Now it seemed impossibly spacious, enough to fit an entire world on the expansive cement floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his tiny paper haven, Bryan ventured out. \"Damn, how the hell will I get out of here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar in the distance sat the creaky wooden stairs leading up into the kitchen. Memories from the previous day told him that it would be foolish to even attempt scaling the mountainous steps--steps that the massive exterminator climbed easily after carelessly depositing tiny Bryan from the mud-filled tread of his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of the enormous man stirred Bryan. He shook his head, scolding himself. \"I need to do something productive.\" With that notion, he began exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world that was his basement proved to be filled with fantastic curiosities. Forgotten documents lay in piles, some scattered about, unused chairs sat against a wall, their ornately carved legs towering high up, and an old gramophone given to him by his grandparents rested near the piled boxes. A single record lay flat on the ground from when he last investigated the antique. Bryan was able to seat himself in the dirt-filled grooves of the Depression era record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Bryan saw terrifying sights as well. Cobwebs, which he kept away from like the plague, and a cluster of ants that scuttled around busily, searching for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The exterminator didn't even spray down here...\" Bryan noted with an annoyed look. Turning towards his home in-between the humongous boxes, he began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought only then struck him. \"Ants!\" He shouted. \"The ants had to get in somehow!\" Spinning around, he looked to the ants that ignored his squeaking shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes squinted. Farther down the wall, following a trail of the invasive pests was a thin crack in the aged cement of the wall. Elation welled inside the tiny man's body, causing him to leap with excitement. A plan began to form in his mind, a plan that made him feel hopeful for the first time since he shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresumably, this break in the foundation would lead him either outside, or preferably somewhere in his house. He could then concentrate on returning himself to normal and ending this nightmare before it turned deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also meant engaging with the fearsome looking ants head-on. A though which sent shivers down the minuscule man's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any bug; ants, beetles, flis, and especially spiders. He had always hated the contemptible creatures, not even liking them for what benefit they did provide the world. At the current size of a speck, the tiny scientist had every excuse to fear the huge beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey easily out-sized a small automobile--jagged legs made them seem even larger--and antennae resembling large pipes swung around furiously while the insect foraged. Bryan grumbled, continuing to stare at the swirling trail of ants that stretched from the crack in the wall to a point behind a nearby box. He would have to brave them if he wanted to leave the lonely prison that was his basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well be dead if I stay trapped here,\" The tiny man remarked. \"Besides, nobody is even looking for me. Why should anyone come down here to find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of his beloved neighbor Tommy, who had probably come and gone the day before, unaware of Mr. Smith's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small man took a deep breath, pushed all thoughts out of his mind, and set towards the distant crack. It took nearly an hour to reach it, the distance he crossed only about 8 feet to the normal person. As Bryan traveled, he warily avoided the ants, preferring to keep a distance. His heart nearly stopped when a stray ant confronted him. Bryan pealed in terror, reeling backwards as the huge insect inspected him with rope-like antennae. It left abruptly with a loud disgruntled <i>clack</i> from its mandibles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't even interested in me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized this as he walked closer. The busy insects didn't offer him any attention as they raced along in either direction. He dared a nervous smile. \"Perhaps this will be easier than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he approached the hole. Standing over 10 feet tall, and many feet wide, the crack in his foundation offered an easy entrance for the invasive ants. It also offered the bug-sized man an easy escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no idea where he may end up, Bryan Smith entered the pitch darkness. His tiny form was seemingly swallowed by the inky black as he descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouldering past numerous careless ants, Bryan eventually emerged....</span></div></div>",

Traversing the pitch blackness was possibly the bravest, and potentially most foolish, thing he had ever done. More than once did he think he would be lost in the cavernous tunnels. Such thoughts plagued him, making his flight through all the more desperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things frightened him ever more though. Ungodly sounds; Rasping hisses, skittering feet, and ghastly clicks. He was convinced at one point, after hitting a dead end of soft dirt that something had been following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad to have that over with!\" He said with intense relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step was upon him now. He was outside, as he suspected the tunnel would lead. The tiny man found himself sitting upon a rugged land of loose, dry dirt, like some kind of arid planet. Towering plants with majestic leaves larger than a garage drooped above. It looked like nothing short of an alien world to tiny Bryan, complete with buzzing beasts of epic proportions soaring overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began wandering around, looking for possible landmarks to pinpoint his location. \"This is amazing...\" Bryan gawked at what was nothing more than a common milk thistle, but now blown up to impressive scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing many similar sights, he passed through shady clusters of grass, under huge overhanging rocks and twigs in wonderment. It was hard to believe this had all been insignificant to him before. This prehistoric setting was no more than some neglected weeds in a backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirst and hunger began to gnaw at him. In his excitement, he had failed to feed or drink from the meager sources in his basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" He complained. \"Perhaps this wasn't a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis regrets were interrupted suddenly.</span></div></div>",

The tiny man flung himself back just as the giant shape descended with a dull crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Bryan gawked at the monster-sized insect. \"A grasshopper!\" It might have been one to the normal eye, yet to teeny Bryan Smith it looked like some monster insect from outer space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grasshopper hunkered down before him. It presented a sight both terrifying and wondrous for the shrunken scientist. Larger than a passenger bus, every detail of the beastly bug stood out: huge crystalline eyes, long, thin, powerful legs, greasy exoskeleton covered with hideous hairs, and sharp mandibles that gnawed at the air. It made flitting movements, the many faceted eyes reflecting the light in a dazzling display as the head twitched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed completely unaware of tiny Bryan as it sat there. As if preparing to conduct a symphony, the grasshopper raised its legs and brought them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graaahhhh!\" Bryan shuttered his ears in an attempt to shield off the cacophony of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe writhed in the dirt, crying and shouting for mercy while the careless grasshopper played both legs together like an out-of-tune fiddle. Just as Bryan was convinced his head would explode, the shrill noise ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released his ears with a sigh. \"Thank God...!\" A high ringing still thrummed in his skull. He glowered at the large insect that sat dumbly before him. \"Fuck you! I hate bugs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he groped for a stone, as the dirt around him was strewn with them. Plucking a sizable one, he hurled it at the idle grasshopper with furious strength. The pebble arched pitifully but made contact with the creature's bulbous eyeball, leaving a noticeable dent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as lightning, the grasshopper reacted with a frightened cry and blasted off with two powerful legs in a fury of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man watched the grasshopper vanish into the distant horizon. He let out a grateful sigh. The whole ordeal left him feeling a deal more distressed than before, despite his slight victory over the much larger insect. He figured himself lucky that his first contact outside had been as harmless as the grasshopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rubbed his temples, then turned to resume his slow exploration of this humongous and unknown land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was stranded. He needed help--a task that would already be nigh impossible, as evidenced by his encounter with the gigantic exterminator--and he did not want to spend the night out here. The thought of what might prowl the wilderness under the cloak of darkness made Bryan's skin crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be something out here,\" He whined. \"Where did that damn tunnel take me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe persisted his wandering despite pains from his out-of-shape legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlants, or more specifically, weeds, towered over the land at every turn. Huge bristling milk thistles, fanciful dandelions, and alien-like ragweeds. He felt like an explorer than landed on a new planet filled with wondrous flora and formations. Pebbles and boulders, usually no larger than his thumb, ranged in sizes from a couple feet in height to larger than a house. It was becoming harder to believe that this entire space was likely nothing more than somebody's unremarkable backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not my yard! I could never get flowers to grow!\" The tiny man remarked as he passed underneath a forest of many coloured daisies. It felt as if he had stepped into Wonderland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne object of particular interest was an enormous quarter that he happened upon. The gigantic bit of change lay at an angle, half-buried like an ancient monument. He studied the gigantic metal coin, feeling the ridges and noting that he was of comparable height with the thickness of the coin. He felt incredulous at his own stupidity. \"Why the hell did I make myself so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirst and hunger began to weaken him. \"I can't wander forever,\" Bryan wheezed. \"This was a big mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Above all, Bryan did NOT want to be lost out here in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo; he had to keep moving - to find either his own home or some kind of shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God! There doesn't seem to be anything out here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling over another dale of packed dirt, Bryan slumped against a boulder and groaned. He had never trained himself for such exertions. Barely passing any gym classes in high school and never bothering to exercise anything but his brain. Bryan simply wasn't made for this kind of situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been through a lot, and if straining himself to keep walking was the next step... then be damned, he was going to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing himself off the rock, he steeled himself and prepared to continue. Before his first step, his whole body froze when an enormous shadow coated the land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" He bellowed and dove down the dirt incline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a tower of hard orange scales and sharp talons crashed down, covering the hill Bryan had rested on almost entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his back and exposed on the hard, packed dirt, Bryan gazed up in awe. The humongous feathered creature looked nothing short of monstrous. Two thick legs loomed upwards, stretching many stories high to support the giant body of blue and black feathers. Moving with surprisingly quick motions, the bird's head bobbed and rotated to survey the ground before it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was beside himself with panic. He would have soiled himself had his stomach had any contents to release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering above the immediate area, the bird resembled a skyscraper of fantastical design set upon towering stilts. It scanned the ground and shifted a bulging black eye to peer down at Bryan. He stared into the seed-shaped mass, unable to detect any emotion or reason within the glinting darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not like this!\" He shuffled back, still on his rear. \"Fuck, I can't die like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird responded by opening a beak larger than his garage and released an earsplitting roar.

The tiny man was anything but suited for this type of adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat began to bother him also; scratching with dehydration. In his excitement to escape his cellar, Bryan had failed to provide himself with ample food or water. The continued scorching from the magnified sun caused him further anguish as he plodded along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" He complained. Sighing deep, Bryan rubbed his scalp. \"Perhaps this wasn't a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset and afraid, Bryan looked around. Common plants and weeds grew around, seperated by large patches of rocky, dry dirt. He felt as if he had wandered onto the set of a 1950s space movie; everything looked so unbelievable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something caught his eye. Visible just through the looming fronds of a daisy, the tiny scientist spotted a structure. He immediately began sprinting towards it. Clumsily, Bryan leaped over large twigs and boulder-sized pebbles - slowing briefly to scamper over a low hanging leaf. Then he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A house!\" He couldn't help shrieking with joy. The sight of a house - albeit far off in the distance and of humongous proportions - felt like nothing short of a miracle for the tiny man. \"I'm saved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even stopping to think if he knew the home owners, Bryan began a hastened journey towards the humongous suburban home. As he traveled, his brilliant mind went over all the things he had experienced: the disastrous meeting with Tommy. The traumatizing encounter with the huge workboot; which left him stranded in his own basement. Now, his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling despite these thoughts, Bryan tried to keep positive. \"I could write a bestselling book on this!\" The thought was amusing to him, allowing him to briefly chuckle. The task at-hand called for his attention though, and Bryan slowed to a walk to gaze up at the nearing house. \"Just gotta get rescued first... Yep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one-story home would appear to any normal viewer as nothing but a modest suburban abode. Tinier than an ant, Bryan looked at it differently. He gazed at the dizzying height of it - it seemed unlikely that anything but humongous gods of old could reside in such a dwelling. A window coated in shadow towered far above. Bryan squinted at it, craning his neck in an attempt to view the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did he begin to wonder about the owners. Bryan would be putting his very life into their unknown hands. He felt the hope bubbling inside him dampen. The house was unrecognizable from this perspective. Plus, Bryan was never neighbourly: seldom bothering to leave his home to introduce himself to any of them. Could he trust complete strangers to find him? These doubts further justified by memories of the near-fatal encounter with the gigantic exterminator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... What choice do I have? I can't very well stay out here for an entire night!\" Bryan had heard many disturbing sounds produced by unknown insects while he traveled. Interactions with a monster-sized bug terrified him beyond measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cement foundation loomed ahead. Fissures, cracks, and dirt covered the worn surface. Presumably, it would be a simple matter to enter the home through any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan immediately decided against this option, viewing many ants filtering in and out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn things are everywhere...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to other fissures, he saw that they all appeared in similar states: infested, or unappetizing.

Just keep moving,\" Bryan padded through the darkness, his already battered feet contacting sharp stone and dirt as he progressed. He felt himself enter into a large space.

Free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fre-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering into the light, Bryan's excited flight was abruptly halted. Long gleaming cords, sticky and moist stretched all about him.

Yet, no matter his struggles he could not free himself. He looked up, realizing this entire corner was coated in the treacherous webbing. A ladder of webs gracefully stretched upwards, ending at a hole in the wall. Marring any possible beauty the intricate web may offer, were many dozen corpses: ants made up the bulk, while a single gnat, and a small beetle were bundled nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNestled in the webby roost above, a spider peered out to investigate the latest catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gawked at it, and screamed in horror. The giant arachnid would easily dwarf any vehicle and looked far more fearsome than any mammal he knew of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cries seemed pitiful as they were instantly absorbed by the enormous space before him. A few ants skittered nearby, consciously keeping away from the dastardly trap set by the spider. They passed by without giving Bryan, or his screeches, any notice. Despite himself, Bryan reached out with his free arm and flailed it pleadingly. His imploring gesturing had no effect on the dull insects, and he resigned himself back to trying to tear himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautious and alert, the spider proceeded slowly toward the struggling prey. Living as an uninvited guest in a suburban home, the tiny arachnid knew to venture out only when the coast was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueaking and wiggling, the soft prey continued to attempt escape; all in vain. It was likely no more than a snack, but would nourish the hungry spider nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thick strand of glistening silk held to him like super glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him were various insects that probably thought the same thing. Only for the architect of this sinister trap to creep down and extinguish their puny lives. Now it seemed Bryan would meet the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his dehydration, the tiny man felt tears begin to drip down his dirty cheeks. It was almost laughable. A brilliant man such as himself would meet his end at the gnashing mandibles of some common arachnid. A spider that - under normal circumstances - could be crushed beneath a quarter. At his size, this spider looked like it could take down King Kong, much less a quarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan let out a hysterical laugh and tasted salt as his own tears trickled into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed them away with his free arm and resumed his struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the large house spider crept past some past victims. Each step upon its webby home was done with tender, masterful grace. It kept all eight eyes on the latest catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prey was curious. The spider - with what limited mental abilities it possessed - could not seem to recognize what it was. Tiny, thin, soft, and pink. It struggled erratically and produced strange, fluctuating shrieks that bothered the hungry spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting as it was, the spider didn't pause to consider any of these thoughts and proceeded down the last stretch of webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not....\" Bryan grunted dryly. \"...NOT like this! I deserve better than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist halted his pathetic struggles when he noticed the gigantic spider nearing him. Eight golf balls of glinting black glass bored down on him from atop the horrible monster's carapace. Bryan welcomed the nearing predator with a terrific scream. It paused mid-step, one long leg poised and stared at the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was taken aback by the reaction. Then the idea struck him and he inhaled a deep breath. If the gigantic beast was disturbed by his cries, then Bryan would give him one to remember - he wasn't going down without a fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hisssssssssssss</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound made Bryan jolt and spew all his breath out uselessly. The spider seemed captivated by the noise, no longer interested in the tiny man. With a clanking thud, emerged a truck-sized ladybug from underneath the baseboards gap. It came trundling out, hissing and clacking with an air of confusion. Not a moment later, the dumb beast wandered clumsily - right into a delicate net of shimmering silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasped as all hell broke loose. The bulky beetle let out a throaty cry and began to thrash hysterically, pulling and twisting itself into more sticky strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Christmas had just dawned, the giant spider turned away from Bryan and scuttled towards the bigger and better prey. The web trembled from the beetles struggles - many sticky cords glued to the vividly red and black shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChortling at his own luck, the trapped scientist turned away. He had no wish to watch the grotesque spider silence the confused ladybug. He also knew he needed to take advantage of this distraction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He twisted, he wiggled, and he thrashed against the silken bindings - but, to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing, he glanced over at his fellow captive and gasped. The blundering beetle was in far more dire straits than himself; coated in a drape of loose, but strong webs and being actively molested by the terrifying spider. Fear flushed through his tiny body like ice, threatening to paralyze him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis resolve proved stronger. \"No! I don't want to die!\" The declaration sounded pathetic, but managed to fill the shrunken man with courage. \"I'm....going....to....<i>ESCAPE</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if somebody had pressed a button marked \"release\". The cords of silken steel twisted and broke, freeing his arms and legs in a clumsy tumble to the ground. Bryan immediately jumped up with a squeak and began running blindly, arms and head flailing wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free! I'm free! Freeeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the size of a poppy seed, the shrunken scientist's glee was nothing but silence to the massive room, but to him, he was leaping and shouting with relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll worries and woe of his journey seemed miles away. He slowed his pace, halted his celebrating, and sucked in well-needed mouthfuls of air. If anything, Bryan could publish one damn good adventure story from this. Imagining himself seated behind a table and signing copies of his book brought a smile to his tear stricken face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the reality of his situation remained and the tiny man frowned as he took in his enormous surroundings with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in the corner of a rectangular room filled with the usual furnishings found in a living room. Dated planks of wood coated the walls in a horrendous example of paneling. Bryan twisted his lips, rotating his head in order to appreciate more of the worldspace. Like a mountain of drab blue, towered a hulking beast of a couch. It faced an enormous television resting upon a cabinet that looked more like towering skyscrapers constructed of oak than simple shelves full of DVDs and electronics. Beyond the mountainous couch was a doorway leading into what appeared to be a small foyer. Light was allowed into the space from a row of windows upon the furthest wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left, Bryan was given another worldspace. This one was of white cabinetry and tile flooring: a kitchen, he realized. It looked just as humble as the living room, despite the grand scale of it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like the inside of any of my neighbour's houses...\" He said, beginning to wander with small steps. \"How far did that damn ant nest take me? I'm not even in my own neighbourhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over the landscape of huge wooden flooring, the tiny man saw bits of grit and dirt strewn at random. It looked filthy to him, but he figured it must be completely unnoticeable to the regular person. He glared back at the corner of the room with the treacherous spider web. It seemed so small in comparison to the huge baseboard. Bryan followed the wall up, squinting at photographs hung impossibly high above. Whoever owned the place seemed to be out or indisposed. The pictures were impossible to make out, and he gave up with a grunt before continuing his rather aimless wandering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement caught his gaze and he looked towards the looming portal into the kitchen. Two agile ants scurried over the transition in flooring, vanishing from sight into the distant kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not alone in my exploring!\" Bryan smirked. He watched another, no more than a skittering shape at this distance, as it sped through the spider's webbing and towards the kitchen. \"<i>Little fuckers</i>, breaking into houses witho-...\" The tiny man trailed off, feeling goosebumps prickle his skin at the realization of his own predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He</i> had broken in to this house. Here he was padding along the living room floor of some stranger's home he didn't even know. By all regards, size and all, Bryan was an invading insect! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself, the tiny man revoked that thought. He was a brilliant scientist - not some filthy insect! It wasn't his fault he had been thrown in such a mess because circumstances beyond his control. He needed to stop thinking and get rescued! Or, at the very least, find something to quench his hunger and thirst!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amidst all the dust bunnies and dirt, he would gape at the enormity of what once was a regular staircase. Now, each step loomed higher than an office building, an impossible height to Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays went by, each one melting into the other. Bryan would wake up in his cozy abode fashioned from a shred of paper. It was quite a bit larger than he was, and offered a respite from the frighteningly massive basement. He would then spend the better part of the day traversing the massive expanse of concrete flooring to reach water and food. The trek was positively draining, and he would often collapse into sleep upon returning to his paper scrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis intelligent mind had all but given up with theories on how to escape. A broom leaning against the side of the mountainous steps seemed his best option. The bug-sized man spent hours trying to scale the pillar-like bristles to no result. Unlike any common insect, Bryan was no more equipped for climbing than he was for flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way of telling time, much less the date, Bryan had no idea how much time had really passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to add a cherry on top, Bryan discovered that his mega-sized power bar had been discovered by ants. The busy insects covered the abandoned energy food, crawling over it, and carrying large chunks away. The bug-sized man didn't even try to reclaim it, as the ants were larger and far more numerous than he would ever be. Deigo's noxious repellents didn't last very long it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of a food supply hung grimly over the shrunken man. Fortunately, he had squirreled away a sizable supply of crumbs over the days, but they would only last him so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnitt to hell!\" He screeched vainly and stamped his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than often he found himself talking, yelling, and muttering to himself as of late. Before he would relish his alone time at home, and at work. Now, he wanted nothing more than for somebody to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For that matter, somebody to come looking for me!\" He cawed out loud as he returned to his safe haven between the towering boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, he lay himself down to sleep on the large paper scrap. Sleep came quickly as always, and he even dreamed that he was able to return to normal size and all his family, friends, co-workers, and even Tommy, were happy to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wretched back to consciousness to the a distant thumping. His vision was blurry from sleep as he squinted his eyes over the expanse of concrete to look at the stairs. What was that noise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud slam rumbled from above, and Bryan heard heavy footsteps and deep voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody is there!\" He realized. It didn't even bother him slightly that somebody had entered his house, his only thought was the possibility of rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just appeared from his cardboard haven when the sound of a door opening and thunderous footsteps were heard coming from the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's mood changed for the worst as he realized the intruders were...</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t spend much time down there during the last visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, boss,\u201d Brent said. A pleasant young man, Brent was still a probationary trainee for Diego\u2019s exterminating service. But, he had impressed his boss by doing a thorough, effective job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his boss, Brent looked good in the gray uniform with the company logo. An inch shy of the six-foot mark, he wasn\u2019t as tall as Diego.  He opened the door to the basement and felt for a switch. Finding it, he flipped on the lights, immediately providing some bright illumination for the dim, shadowy basement. In size 12 work boots, Brent stomped down the flight of stairs carrying all the tools of his trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny man, the sight of a huge man in a gray uniform, a canister of insecticide draped onto his muscular body with a shoulder strap, petrified him. He stood in the shadow of the row of cardboard boxes. He had wished for so long that someone would come to the basement. Now, he simply wanted them to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he stared up in terror, he realized it wasn't the same exterminator. In addition, he heard the clomp of more distant footsteps as an unseen second giant stomped around upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the basement, Brent made a cursory inspection, which soon revealed an ant-covered energy bar on a towel beneath an exercise bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a sure way to attract pests,\u201d Brent said as he reached for the chocolate bar. Picking it up in one hand, he looked for a place to dispose of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, his actions were observed with increasing horror by the tiny basement occupant. Even claimed by the ants, the energy bar had represented his only food source. He didn\u2019t want to consider the consequences of being left without food in the bleak basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprinted across the concrete plain, desperate now to make contact. He waved his arms and tried to shout for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take that,\u201d he screamed. \u201cI need that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent, seeing the row of boxes stacked along one wall, figured he might find a place to get rid of the bar in that direction. He began stomping across the concrete floor, unaware of the shrunken man running headlong toward him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shrugged off the heavy chemical container and set it down to take a look around the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo trash receptacle of any shape or form stood out to him, so he set the rancid energy bar on a box which disrupted a plume of dust. The entire row was coated in a thick layer of dust and littered with dozens of dead moths. A few small moths wafted through the dusty air near him, and were easily swatted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like there might be a moth infestation.\" The young probee remarked. He crushed the wiggling moths under his boot and turned back to the box..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a cardboard flap, more dead moths were revealed as well as a tiny spider that darted away to escape his huge hand. Dark recesses lay between each box, giving insects and spiders perfect places to hide and breed. The exterminator clicked a small LED light on and peered through one of the small gaps. Dust-covered cobwebs coated the tight space like tiny clothing lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna have to move these to spray back there\" Brent said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his neck thoughtfully. The entire basement would need thorough spraying, along with traps to catch any remaining insects. Most infestations tended to start in the basement, and this one seemed no exception. Brent liked to be more than thorough, not only out of pride, but because any input from a satisfied home owner was good for his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, he turned to retrieve the energy bar and head back up stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached for it, he happened to glance downwards. Well-trained vision allowed the youthful exterminator to spot the tiny scurrying speck. It was headed for a gap in between the boxes furthest from Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bastard!\" He exclaimed loudly and quickly covered the distance with two strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware of the danger, the insect jerked quickly into the cover between the two boxes. A space barely large enough for Brent to stick his thumb into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Brent kicked the toe of his work boot against the gap, causing the ant to flee further into the darkness. He didn't consider for a second how the terrified bug felt and just how monstrous he looked to the such tiny creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking his flashlight on again, he crouched and directed the powerful beam into the gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, he made a quick inspection. A crumpled scrap of paper, likely another food wrapper, and little crumbs mixed with dirt lay around it. He didn't see any ants, but previous trade experience told him this was another attractant. He would have to retrieve the wrapper before spraying chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, he leaned back and pressed his hand into the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his state of desperation, Bryan knew when he was facing folly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous guy dominated the seemingly spacious basement with his bulky form. A pair of work boots carelessly stomped around on the grainy cement floor. Ants that had seemed so fierce before were flattened under the gigantic boots without notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking at the ground, the oblivious exterminator turned and stomped towards the boxes. Bryan halted his flailing procession as a dark brown boot, larger than a cruise ship, slammed down near him. The powerful concussion threw the tiny scientist to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here!\" He shrieked. How did he think approaching the titan was a good idea? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRescue was his utmost desire, but he knew a close encounter with one of those massive boots was a guaranteed death. The bug-sized man decided that he best return to safety and concoct an actual plan for rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan ran with terrific ferocity towards the gaping crevice created by the two mountain-like boxes. Memories flashed through his mind of his previous encounter with the other exterminator a month before. Despite his desperation for rescue, Bryan knew at his incredibly minute size, he would have no more luck contacting the enormous man than the ants did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderous rumbles could be heard as the giant muttered to himself. The huge man sat the impressive tank of poison on the ground, and began inspecting the boxes furthest from Bryan. With wide eyes, the minuscule scientist watched the exterminator swat foolhardy moths out of the air and grind them out under his frightening work boots. Closing his eye tightly, he continued running and tried to adopt an \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart beat lividly inside his chest and his lungs threatened to burst as he slowed to a walk. Yawning large as the Grand Canyon was the sheltering safety between the boxes just ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LITTLE BASTARD!\" The sudden thunderous roar caused him to look back in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror filled him once again, causing Bryan to run faster than he thought possible. Violent tremors followed the tiny man, causing him to leap dramatically in an attempt to secure his shelter in the gap. He skidded on the ground, and turned to see the humongous exterminator's massive form dominating his view. The giant work boots stood very close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the mountain of scuffed leather lifted and rushed towards tiny Bryan, slamming into the cardboard edges with shuddering result. The terrified man squealed in horror, pulling himself up and running frantically for cover. He settled behind the flimsy scrap of paper, shaking violently from such a tremendous close call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" He cried. \"What the hell is he doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic boot lifted away, landing with a dull boom farther away. From his bug-sized view, the boots were mountains of rough, worn dark brown leather with powerful heavy lugged soles. He swallowed weakly at the sight, paralyzed at the thought of ending up beneath one. Like a glacier, the boot began shifting, causing a calamity of vibrations and noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked up, realizing the huge man was crouching down to get a closer look. He felt an elation of hope, despite his fear (and urine-soaked pants). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'm not a bug!\" Bryan waved his thin arms and prepared to reveal himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud 'click' and a bright light burst to life. It was like a spotlight the size of an intersection and instantly caused tiny Bryan to reel back, covering his eyes. His head throbbed and tears streamed down his face. Bryan could see the harsh white beam scanning the area, searching. He truly felt like prey being hunted. A tiny bug hiding from an incredibly huge and powerful predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man had been so excited at the prospect of being rescued, he had underestimated his size and the exterminator's size. It would be nothing short of a miracle for him to be noticed at his size. Especially to somebody that denotes anything tiny to an \"ant\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get worse for the tiny man, they did. Huge building-sized fingers probed the tiny space with thunderous result. The hand was covered in a glove made of thick suede, giving it an even more alien like and monstrous appearance. At his miniscule size, Bryan would be instantly mashed by the smallest of movements made by the huge hand. With amazing power, the invading fingers expanded the small gap by pushing the heavy boxes apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" He yelled. \"Just leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched in horror as the gigantic digits carelessly decimated what had been Bryan's home. His hard-earned cache of crumbs were instantly dusted and ruined. Bryan was forced to retreat further back, watching his paper shelter get flattened and roughly pulled out by the huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting it to his face, the enormous man examined the small crumpled scrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST A PIECE OF PAPER\" He noted loudly, looking dejected as if he expected something else. Without delay, he crushed the paper in his hand and dropped it back on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched this with dread. Everything he had made and known in his time being trapped down here was just instantly destroyed without care by this giant. He wanted nothing more than to be left alone, and never to see another human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the exterminator began to move, he was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's no possible way out of the basement. He finally sinks back to his knees on the white, knotty surface. It's so unfair. He feels really small and helpless now, all ego obliterated by the fact he cannot even manage the wrapping of a candy bar at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pout, he gets back onto his feet. Maybe there are other sources of food in the basement. The room looks huge, more like a sprawling metropolis than a dank storage area below his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to make a thorough search,\" he says aloud to help him focus his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some wandering through the changed realm that is his basement, he finds something in a dark corner tucked behind some building-sized boxes. A thin film of sickening green has spread across the concrete in the eternal shade. From it, ghostly pale mushrooms have sprouted on spindly stalks. A few of the tiny fungi are taller than him, but there are dozens of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless sauteed with a juicy steak, he's never been much of a mushroom fan. As he steps closer, his feet squish in the pale, green slick. How does he even know they're edible? They could be highly toxic. If he gets hungry enough, perhaps death by poison mushroom might be preferable to starvation. He hasn't reached that point, so he leaves the shaded canyon and continues his search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, exploring beneath an old desk chair consigned to the basement, he finds a cobweb. The silk cords are anchored against one of the chair's four wooden legs, stretching across the space of a few inches to attach to the concrete wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clearly saw the sticky silk threads and had no intention of stumbling into the trap. His focus was on the many trapped insects held fast in the web. Hadn't he read that insects are a great source of protein...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgggh. He groaned at the thought of extracting one of the plump gnats from the web and dining on it. Up close, they looks so bizarre with all those legs, the gossamer wings and spiky appendages. Not at all appetizing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, there was the challenge of getting them out of the web. This meal would require some work, unlike the stationary mushrooms just standing in rows for the taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in a contemplative state, he looks down and sees a gleam on the floor. Looking closer, he finds a tiny shard of glass that he picks up in one hand. With this crude cutting edge, he could saw through each silken cable if he does need to extract the trapped insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, inspiration strikes. With this bit of broken glass, he could saw through the foil wrapper on the energy bar. He feels a surge of excitement until...</span></div></div>",

And, this bundled dinner of dead gnat was as good as any meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo tentative steps forward and the bug-sized man suddenly froze, gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intricate construction of webbing created a sort of quasi-cathedral between the chair leg and the concrete wall. Many bundled insects adorned arching strands of glimmering silk, hanging like macabre chandeliers at almost every turn. This was not what halted the shrunken man. Higher up, against the looming surface of pitted concrete, were situated many pockets of silk: almost like hotel rooms built into a mountain side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom such a pocket, Bryan watched one jagged leg at a time poke through, allowing a spider of monstrous scale to pull itself through. It was like something crafted from the depths of Hell itself. Not only larger than a car, but coated in fine, greasy hairs across a hardened body of black and brown exoskeleton. His whole body became trembling ice when the collection of gibbous eyes looked right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting his surge of excitement, the tiny man squealed and about-faced.

He attempted to right himself, clumsy in his haste. \"My hands...Christ almighty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis palms had been savagely shredded by his makeshift weapon allowing warm bursts of blood to coat the ground. Unaccustomed to pain, Bryan lay prone in a fit of gasping terror. An hourglass seemed to dangle playfully over the writhing scientist. Each granule of sand representing his time to escape certain doom clinking away with nauseating speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodied hands slipping over the saturated cement, Bryan's right suddenly made contact with the dangerous shard of glass. His fingers clumsily wrapped around it and he brandished it before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh!\" The spark of determination re-igniting in his eyes as he grunted out his second wind. It mapped itself out in his mind instantaneously: wield the shard of glass like Excalibur, twist around and skewer the vile spider like the dragon of yore. \"I...refuse...to...die...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Fate was a bitch and Fate's finger a fickle bitch at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bryan could enact his resurgence of will, he heard a tremendous cascade of movement followed by a looming presence from behind. Uncaring of any cardboard speech the injured man had been speaking, the huge spider fell upon him and buried two enormous fangs deep in Bryan's exposed back. Moments of sheer pain followed and Bryan heralded every second with a howling aria of high-pitched shrieks that would never be heard by another human. The spider, stone-cold and opaque-eyed, lifted the tiny, squirming man from the ground and allowed him to dangle as intricate muscles viciously pumped liters and liters of toxins into the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per usual, the spider began the task of prepping a meager, but nourishing meal. It lavished the catch no more than any other. Bryan was just another bug foolish enough to blunder within reach. It held no concept of how horrific or cruel the process would be for this strange pink victim. Meanwhile, Bryan felt the pain ebb away until nothing of his extremities could be felt or moved. A double-edged blade: he was spared any further signals of physical torment reaching his brain while his vision continued to work. He would witness every second of his nightmarish end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts zipped through his head slower than the last. Slowing, slowing, slowing until only a few could be coherently understood to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why.....This has to be a dream.....Fuck my shitting luck with a stick.....but, I discovered the impossible....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, Bryan's mind pictured himself enjoying a day at the beach with his favourite nephew and neighbour.

Only then did he remember his weapon that lay dangerously close to the descending monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked back, feeling as if he would turn to salt if he did, and squeaked. The huge arachnid touched down, gracefully landing on all eight legs like some hideous dancer and stepping over his forlorn weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForsaking the rare tool, he bolted as fast as his tiny - and comically thin - legs would allow him.

I mean, it can't be THAT bad!\" The tiny man reasoned while squinting at one bundled gnat closest to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping nearer to the glittering strands, he looked up at it. His foot nearly brushed a large pile of webbing. Thankful for his lithe build and nimble step, Bryan managed to avoid other strands and bits of sticky silk as he neared the captured gnat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire structure of webs was nothing short of a marvel. The bug-sized man found himself gazing around, slack-jawed with curiosity. Never before had any biologist investigated the intricacy of these arachnid homes with such first-person detail. Dozens - no, hundreds of the silken strands stretched around and overhead. Some glimmered dully in the meager light of the basement, while others sagged heavily from collections of dust and dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very remarkable, but I need to concentrate!\" Bryan shook his head and turned his attention back to the hopeful source of food. \"Just a couple more feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he froze. A scratching, gnawing sound had pierced the relative silence, sending a sharp chill down his tiny spine. \"What the hell...?\" Again, he heard it, so much louder that he almost dropped his precious weapon in surprise. It was behind him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned, his eyes wide and his hands already sweating. He immediately qourked in terror. An insect - if it could be called that - skittered from the shadows and began a furious rampage directed at tiny Bryan. Only a tiny beetle to the normal human: this beetle looked nothing short of a tank of heavy plate with glinting eyes and clashing mandibles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was upon him more quickly that he anticipated. Many quick legs allowed the hulking beast to move quickly and with tremendous force. Bryan stepped back, feeling his legs squish into a slimy strand of silk, effectively trapping him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck me!\" Then the beetle crashed through the webbing that separated them and hurled itself into Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's thin, diminutive form was flung backwards violently. He felt himself collide with the bundled gnat and break through many ropes of spider silk. Abruptly, he came to a stop seemingly mid-air. His entire body was covered in scraps of sticky silk, while he backside was held suspended by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful collision had his brain in a whirl. His vision threatening to go black into unconsciousness. Bryan shook his head into awareness and groaned painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis groan was met with a hissing response, which made the tiny man jolt. More than ten feet before him lay the enraged beetle that caused this. It clacked and thrashed lightly, before sinking to the ground with a final hiss. Bryan stared in both shock and disbelief, unable to remove his eyes from the horrific insect that assaulted him. Atop the bulky bug's small head, the shrunken man noticed a dull object that jutted from a bulbous eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The glass shard!\" The beetle, driven by instinct, failed to notice the pointed shred of glass wielded by the tiny prey. It had pierced through the beetle's head with ease upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was fine and dandy - yet Bryan had now been forced into a worse predicament. He was hopelessly trapped!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Realization of the web's true purpose now dawning upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan fell still; Only turning his head back and forth. Besides the now dead beetle and a few dangling victims, Bryan saw no signs of the webs architect. He allowed himself a few minutes to relax before continuing his escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suspended many feet above the ground like a puppet. Half a dozen sticky strands fused to both his backside and right leg, allowing only his other leg and both arms any effectual movement. Beneath him lay a bundled gnat - the very one he contemplated consuming. It's size rivaled that of a small sedan and it was almost within the tiny man's flailing grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could reach it, I might be able to pull myself off...\" Bryan clenched his teeth and attempted to grab the nearest appendage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed hopeless, when he had another spark of inspiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan slowly began to shift his weight: forward, then backward.

Bryan found himself swinging forward - still held by two strands of silk - and face-first into the deceased beetle's carcass. It was like colliding with a plate glass window - a window coated in grease and sharp bumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his hands, Bryan steadied himself. As he did so, he released a yelp of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin realistic reach of his thin arm, protruded his make-shift glass shard weapon sticking proudly from the beetle's bulging eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, Lady Luck shines on me for once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan reached for the shard and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One hand bumped against the surface and pain screamed through his whole body. Blood from the long cuts wept steadily, seeping down his thin arms and dripping to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass shard remained adamantly stuck, uncaring and unmoved by his attempt.

Underneath Bryan saw the gnashing mandibles capable of grinding his tiny, pink form into a shapeless paste. The tiny man yelped and wiggled violently, his broken nose continuing to spurt blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider frothed hungrily at him.

The teenager's eyes remained closed, and his breathing sounded even more thunderous at this close proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Mr. Smith shouted. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's eyes fluttered as he woke, slowly at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized scientist felt the teenager's giant body start to shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" The little man screamed, running toward the huge face. \"Tommy! Here! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he woke, Tommy heard an irritating drone, sort of like the buzz of an insect. Still groggy from his nap, he squinted his eyes and saw the source of the sound \u2014 a tiny bug crawling across the front of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn, he complained, \"Awww, fuck! Not another damn bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith heard and panicked. \"No! No!\" He shouted again. \"It's me! I've shrunk... you've got to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy lifted his right hand. \"I can't believe Mr. Smith lets these little pests run free in his house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shouts of no avail, he abandoned attempts to communicate and turned to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's raised hand cast a dark shadow, quickly outpacing the bug-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan would of thought it was nothing more than a statue if not for the terrible pulsating eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calamity of noise, coupled with a terrific gale of wind accompanied the opening of Bryan's now colossal backdoor. Held tight in the spider's clutches, he turned his head to view the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, BRYAN! YOU HOME?\" Exploded a deep, booming voice that sounded more god-like thunder than human speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting all about his plight, Bryan stared dumbly at the impossibly huge being the loomed in his doorway. It took him a moment to even recognize who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!\" He gasped. \"Thank God! Mike!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over him at this fortunate realization. Mike was Bryan's next door neighbor and known as the \"go-to guy\" in the neighborhood because of his friendly nature and mechanical know-how. He was dressed casually; t-shirt, jeans, and a navy-blue cap over his cropped hair. Bryan could usually rely on the guy for anything, often more than Tommy who was known for occasionally slacking off. The spider continued to stay frozen, but Bryan felt anything but fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was one problem: <i>Bryan was tiny</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked nothing short of colossus. His already tall, built form was now blown to impossible size, causing him to appear like some mythic titan of old. Slamming the door behind him, Mike lumbered towards the counter where Bryan was held by the large spider. Heaving vibrations accompanied each movement the enormous man made, along with dull booming that reminded Bryan of distant bombs going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, he's huge!\" Said the shrunken man. \"Hey! Mike! Down here! He-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRYAN!\" Humongous Mike rudely interrupted without noticing any diminutive cries. \"BROUGHT YOUR DVD BACK\" Mike came to a halt before the counter, planet-sized face gazing around the kitchen and his gigantic hand holding a massive DVD case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly felt fear. Fear of his trust and friendly neighbor who was now towering over him unlike any mountain Bryan had ever seen. Thinking himself prepared and ready, the shrunken scientist had never anticipated any of his current situations. He never considered being confronted by any insects, nor had he ever planned on encountering a human at his diminished size--especially a Navy man like Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan did dream of it though. Secretly, the thought both thrilled and frightened him. Now, he found it mostly frightened him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miiiiike! Help me!\" Bryan shouted up at his huge neighbor. Wiggling, Bryan batted his thin arms against the stubborn spider. \"I need to get Mike to notice me, if I can just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerful vibrations rattled Bryan when Mike suddenly moved again. The bug-sized man gaped up at him again, remarking on his thick muscles visible through his shirt that jolted slightly with every step the huge man took. As if in slow motion, Mike stomped towards the living room door and thundered his neighbor's name again. Bryan screamed vainly from his spot on the counter, which Mike heard none of. His gigantic form turned back to the counter, large feet thudding heavy, looming over it once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant hand laid the massive DVD case down on the counter top, covering many city blocks worth of space. Bryan cried in terror, fearing that he may be crushed beneath it. \"No! I'm here, right here! <i>Heeeelp</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE...?\" Bryan felt a shiver go down his spine when Mike gazed directly at him. \"A BUG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had a bad feeling. \"The spider! Help me! Get rid of the spider!\" He demanded in a shrill wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis giant face showed no signs of recognition as Mike raised his hand, thumb poised, as if in response to Bryan's diminutive plea. The spider, stubborn and foolish, was convinced that standing perfectly still would make it invisible to the colossal human, but Bryan was not so foolish. The huge digit lowered quickly. Its immense size blotted out the owner, leaving Bryan a view of the huge fleshy surface covered in dirt-filled ridges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist belted out one last plea for help before the massive thumb pressed down upon both human and arachnid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bryan! You home?\" Mike called out to his neighbor's empty kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held Bryan's copy of \"<i>Dirty Work</i>\", a comedy that Mike had been wanting to see for years and Bryan had been nice enough to lend it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His car was in the driveway...\" He told himself as he stepped inside and closed the door. Mike had been over to his neighbor's house so often that he felt not qualms about entering without invitation. Bryan had nicely told him to visit whenever he felt like it. His wife, Ella, had him mowing the lawn most of the morning. Mike jumped at the chance to return the DVD to Bryan and maybe have a chat with him. Bryan was nice, but oddly never seemed to be doing anything important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike remained ignorant of how his presence affected one teeny speck held captive by a small spider on the counter before him. He stopped next to the counter and looked around, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan!\" He bellowed. \"Brought your DVD back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but a very faint squeaking noise returned his summons. Ignoring the minor noise, he called into the living room with no result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must of gone out or something...\" He thought, still looking around the kitchen as if his missing neighbor would pop from the woodwork. Turning to the counter again, he muttered. \"Guess I'll just leave it here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike set the plastic case down on the counter, paying a cursory glance to a small package already sitting there. His eyes then settled on a small black shape near the box. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bug.\" More specifically, a spider, but Mike never bothered much for any insect. Tiny and thoughtless, and notably, invasive. Just the other day, Mike had dealt with an ant hill that seemed to periodically appear on his front lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot squeamish in the least, Mike brought his large thumb down flat on the stagnant bug, barely feeling it crunch under the calloused skin. He smiled at the mashed remains, thinking how Bryan freaked out over the single beetle that appeared when he was at Mike's cook-out a few months back. He figured it was the least he could do for his neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give him a call later\" Mike said, wiping his thumb off on his jeans and left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whistled as he strode across the lawn heading for his own, oblivious to anything that ended up under his larger sneakers, and stopping suddenly when a kid approached up Bryan's walkway. The teenager looked like he was in a hurry as he rushed to the back door, paying Mike no attention. He shrugged, and returned to his own home<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla called out to Mike, asking him to wipe his feet and announcing lunch, all thoughts of Bryan Smith were instantly forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The box represented strange terrain, however, and the creature's pre-wired instincts were cancelled by undue caution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy arrived right on schedule, saw the tiny box on the table and scooped it into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider and shrunken man were jostled inside the box as Mr. Smith's huge neighbor gripped the small package, causing the cardboard walls to smash inward slightly from his tight grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith wanted to scream for Tommy to stop, but he dared not make a sound. He tried to burrow deeper into the handkerchief, in anticipation of the package being mailed, as well as to try to avoid any encounters with his fellow occupant in the warehouse-sized cardboard carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider, thoroughly distressed by the unpredictable movements, found its own crevice in the cotton folds and stayed put. It could patiently ride out this storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy followed his instructions well. Less than 24 hours after he dropped the package at the post office, it arrived at the dormitory of Mr. Smith's nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so many hours of unceasing movement, the stillness when the package arrived at its destination conveyed information to both the tiny man and the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the horrible predator, the stillness translated as an opportunity to emerge from hiding and explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny man, he knew he had succeeded. Soon, he would be reunited with his nephew and he could reverse the folly of his plan. He imagined that he and Zack could share a few laughs about the adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the shrunken man felt excitement at his arrival at the college dorms, the spider felt only one thing: hunger. As it began to navigate the complicated folds and tunnels formed by the crumpled handkerchief, tiny Mr. Smith heard the raspy noise of its legs on the cotton fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, waiting in the box for Zack didn't seem like such a great idea. \"I've got to get out of here before that monster finds me!\"</span></div></div>",

Steven presented him with a delivery addressed to Zack from his favourite uncle Bryan. Never fail, Uncle Bryan sent Zack a gift for any occasion, often than not for no reason at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels light,\" Zack strode across the room towards his desk. \"Probably a gift card!\" He grabbed for something to open it with on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking a screw driver from the pencil jar, Zack set the small package onto the desk. While excited for the gift, he couldn't help but think of his Uncle's promised arrival in the flesh. Bryan seemed to think that gifts were all his nephew wanted, often never bothering to visit more than once or twice a year. These thoughts caused him to frown slightly, his readied arm drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he'll call at least...\" Zack muttered with a nod. Readying the tool, he broke the sealing tape and began working the cardboard flaps open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enthusiastic reveal fell completely flat upon pulling back the flaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" His eyebrows raised curiously at the contents. Nothing more than what looked like a plain handkerchief. \"Is this some kind of joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pulled the airy scrap of fabric out for inspection. Turning it over, he unfolded it. \"Is that-...\" A dark shape appeared from a crease in the cloth causing Zack to wretch his hand back. \"Bloody shit! A Spider!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell! Where'd it go?\" The swatch of cloth fluttered to the ground, spider and all, landing between his feet. Zack scowled, spying the dazed arachnid as it scuttled into the open carpet. Without hesitation, he lifted his foot and stomped the gross creature before it could react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dragged his sneaker back, grinding the spider against the abrasive carpet and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that about?\" He said quietly, reaching for the small package again. \"Does Uncle Bryan think that crap is funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer seemed plain. The box and the handkerchief appeared empty, leaving a cruel joke as the only conclusion. Zack grunted, tossing the box back onto his desk and furiously punching his Uncle's phone number into his cellphone (another gift from Bryan!). His annoyance was only fed by the seemingly cheeky voice of his Uncle's answering service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and frustrated, Zack stood before his desk and redialed.

His hands thankfully finding a grip in the pitch darkness of the box. Lugging himself over a crest, he prepared to continue when in his haste, his footing slipped sending him sliding down the steep fold of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of many legs on cardboard gave the tiny man a shot of adrenaline. He quickly recovered from his tumble, blindly tripping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight made itself known as he passed another fold. It seemed as if the spider was right upon him as he threw his trembling form through the tear and into the heavenly light. Bryan didn't stop there, he hurriedly picked himself up and ran as fast as his thin legs would permit. Ahead of him lay a large object that he wasted no time in taking cover behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor tiny Bryan, he felt like a helpless animal being pursued by an unstoppable predator. Gulping nervously, he timidly peeked from his cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing appeared through the ominous portal that was just a minuscule tear in the large shipping box. The shrunken man breathed a sigh of relief. He was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just need to find Zack.\" He looked around in an attempt to figure out just where he was. Excitement about his breakthrough surprise he had planned began to return, overshadowing the frightening encounter he just escaped from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around him was unimaginably enormous. Bryan backed away from the object he had taken cover behind, squinting curiously at what appeared to be writing pressed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIRADO 174-No.2\" Read the letters in a font larger than he was. He could only gape at the enormous object that in reality was just a regular pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling very small and insecure, Bryan realized his location was...</span></div></div>",

Two large panes of glass allowed soft rays of sunlight to illuminate the otherwise gloomy surroundings. The bug-sized scientist stood on a desk of sorts, but there was no computer or any other signs of any of the items usually found on a college student's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the carton, the desktop was bare of most items. Toward the center of the expanse, a wide plateau of blue rose from the wooden surface. The tiny man made his way toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief journey, he reached the blue plateau, but a 20-foot cliff seemed to block him as he made his way around the edge of the object. Frustration began to replace his excitement about what seemed to be the arrival at his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe package might have been delivered, and he might be safe from that awful spider, but he didn't seem any closer to his nephew. Then he saw the huge cylinder that leaned against an edge of the blue plateau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pen!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the huge object, which leaned it a convenient angle to allow him to climb it like a bridge. In little time, he had ascended and was greeted by some other massive letters scrawled hurriedly into the blue surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVISITORS PLEASE SIGN IN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read the message, and everything clicked into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't in his nephew's dorm room. Someone had delivered the carton to the dorm, but left it on the sign-in table in the entrance hall into the dorm building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, eventually Zack would arrive and claim the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt a splash of fear. Yes, Zack would arrive, see the package, take it and leave him stranded and tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get back inside,\" the tiny man realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and ran back toward the pen, definitely alarmed at finding himself so tiny and separated from his only means of uniting with his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the spider still lurked in the dark interior of the shipping carton. He would just have to evade the predator a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had reached the desktop and started across the vast plain toward the towering cardboard crate when the front door to the dorm building opened.</span></div></div>",

Hideous and large the persistent spider peered out from the safety of the cardboard crate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider cautiously poked a long, pointed leg out, as if to test the stability of the ground. More legs appeared from the dark gap, and Bryan felt the eight-eyed beast return his stares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the spider in the light again reminded the shrunken man just how horrifying it truly was. He backed away, his knees threatening to buckle, his body trembling with fear. Bryan had forgotten all about the opening of the front door, but heavy vibrating reminded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SWEET!\" Thundered a familiar voice. \"THE PACKAGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface of the desk shuddered heavily as the humongous student approached. Bryan chose to ignore the emerging spider, turning to gape at his nephew who approached with booming steps. \"He-... He's freaking enormous!\" Squeaked the reduced scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was in fact more than just \"enormous.\" To bug-sized Bryan, his nephew's size was near unfathomable as it towered over the desk surface. Bryan continued his dumb-struck stare, looking up towards his nephew's moon-sized face, currently showing an expression of excitement. Minute details of his gigantic nephew's appearance stood out immediately to him: light stubble coated his jaw like an alien forest. Zack's godly physique looked more impressive than ever as it filled out his grey university hoodie. Bryan could even see a cut, barely an inch long, under his nephew's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had never expected his first encounter to be such a wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of his tiny slack-jawed audience, Zack reached a huge arm over the desk towards the small package. The spell of awe broke too late for Bryan as he realized his folly. \"Wait Zack! I'm supposed to be in there! Wait for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge building-like fingers wrapped around the box and lifted it off the desk with remarkable ease. Zack failed to notice the tiny tear or the small spider that made a quick descent from the moving box via silk strand. It landed with a thump, all eight eyes locked onto the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his danger, Bryan looked at the monstrous arachnid in horror. His fearful screeching of the spider's quick approach was suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack smiled looking at his own address written on the box in his Uncle's clean writing. Lack-luster in weight, Zack's mind still raced with thoughts of what might be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been notified by Bryan of the packages existence. Ever since he was a small child, Zack had been showered with girfts from his Uncle. All of them containing something of great value more often than not. The car his Uncle Bryan had purchased him recently was good evidence of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick movement caught the college student's notice. He squinted at the desk. \"Gross, a spider!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily laden backpack in one arm, Zack raised the cardboard box with his other hand. The small arachnid halted its flight, sensing Zack's intent, and suddenly reversed direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got'cha!\" Zack slammed the box down with a hard thwack and a twist. He lifted it to inspect the remains. \"What the-... Where did it go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clever spider hurriedly fled back towards the pile of other boxes, vanishing from sight. Zack grunted, resisting the temptation of pursuit. It was just a dumb tiny spider after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, he wanted to see what his uncle sent him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This one smaller, and rather strange looking. Zack shrugged. He might as well take care of this one at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-adjusting his heavy backpack, he raised the package over the wiggling speck with his other hand. \"You won't get away, you little bugger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm had just begun its descent when a voice from behind the desk surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Z-Man! What's happenin'?\" Greeted Steven, the front desk clerk, who appeared from a doorway behind the desk and sauntered over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating, Zack stared blankly for a moment before replying. \"Hey man,\" He replied. \"Was just crushing this ant here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven raised his dark brows and peered down at the desk. The little pale ant seemed to be attempting escape, which Steven responded to with a sweep of his hand that sent the tiny insect flying. Zack looked shocked at that, glancing around for where it landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, bud. Just a tiny bug.\" Steven remarked in his casual tone. \"Live and let live, I always say.\" He didn't pay attention to where his hand sent the bug, nor did he care that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack suddenly felt sheepish at his behaviour. It was just a <i>stupid</i>, <i>tiny</i> bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was a fellow student, though a year above him in both age and classes. He was regarded as a likable and easy-going guy, always getting to know everyone in the building and conjuring nick-names for them at moment's notice. He landed the desk job a few months ago, gladly accepting pay and points for an easy position that required him to sit back and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got your box? Awesome. Can ya give a quick signature right here?\" He presented a clipboard to Zack, who scrawled his name down. \"Sweet. You're good to go dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving forgotten the two tiny creatures, Zack grinned at his buddy and hurried off with box in-hand, oblivious to his bug-sized uncle he left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan on the other hand had been swept...</span></div></div>",

In that moment, they were not fellow humans. They looked liked destructive gods, and the tiny man's nerve failed. He ran blindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live and let live, I always say,\" Steven said, swiping his hand across the desktop to catch the bug up in a clean sweep. Almost as soon as he had done so, he forgot about the tiny bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the titans noticed when the tiny man fell hard onto the floor.

I've got to catch up to Zack!\" The recent memory of Zack's attempt to crush him already seemed like a distant dream. Inside him, Bryan knew Zack would be his saviour! \"He's the reason I did this, and he'll recognize me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly convinced, Bryan glanced around one last time before bolting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briefly caught sight of two enormous sneakers lifting off the floor and out of sight. A distant crash signaled their landing upon the desktop high above.

The \"terrain\", as he painfully realized, was an utter wasteland of filthy floor. It stretched seemingly forever in every direction, ending with different vistas in each direction. Each one made up of objects normally uninteresting to the tiny scientist, but now blown up to proportions that made them otherworldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such option was the hallway Zack went down. It stretched onward, looking close to something plucked from a surrealist painting. To his right, Bryan was presented with a distant wall of towering glass. Bright beams of light filtered in past potted plants and mountainous furniture positioned against it. Two huge doors were the focal point: looming like the gates to a dimension of titans and gods. This was all more evident by the huge shapes that lumbered sluggishly outdoors, barely recognizable as mere college students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe met no opposition to his goal. Bryan kept along, running and circumventing the occasional deposit of dirt or mud.

Alone, the moulding was taller than most office buildings, coated in a layer of dirty scuffs from years of student activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost...\" The shrunken man heaved, clutching his strained chest. \"...to... <i>uurgh</i>... Zack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan dared a look behind. His progress was admirable, as the distance he crossed was nothing short of many miles. Now in his view, the giant that swept him off leaned back in a chair, his feet propped against the desk.

It contained a multitude of tables, lined orderly in rows flanking a wall of windows. Only a few students occupied the small study space, sitting idly out of the tiny man's view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan quickly passed through the passage, before gasping at his next worldspace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so small!\" Was his only thought, looking out into the huge span of floor occupied by towering tables and chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cussed softly. From here, the room led out into different corridors - all of which looked identical. Bryan realized with a shiver that he had absolutely no idea which passage to take! A stepped mountain was evident farther in the distance, barely recognizable as stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack might even be upstairs... I can't remember!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan clutched himself like a forlorn child. The ground trembled lightly, distant crashes tensing his tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, he watched a huge student pound up the stairs with a large pack over his shoulders.

Underneath the table, dust bunnies, dirt, pebbles, and fallen scraps dominated the landscape. Bryan passed a pencil that easily surpassed any city-street he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe retreated to the monumental leg of a chair, pressing himself against it. The ground trembled, signaling the entrance of new giants who stomped past without regard to anything in their path. Each monumental step slamming against the floor, easily crushing various particles that would have been obstacles to tiny Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God! What have I gotten myself into?\" He screamed. Just then, two enormous sneakers headed his way, the giant owner dropping his backpack against the tabletop above. \"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cried out when the pillar of metal he clutched was wretched away. He was flung with shocking force, hurling many dozens of feet before landing roughly. Next to him, the ground dipped suddenly as it gave way to an electrical outlet inset into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening screech rang across the floor, causing Bryan to clutch his ears as the titanic student easily maneuvers the mountainous chair. The giant's sneakers thud heavily against the floor as they shift allowing their gigantic owner to settle into the chair. The enormous piece of furniture groans in protest under the huge student's weight, creaking loudly with every movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLain on his side, Bryan cowers with shaking limbs. Staring up a tower of thickly-haired legs which meet a pair of dark shorts and red t-shirt that stretches further upward to the dark underside of the table, obscuring the unknown giant's face. Distant sounds of commotion thunder from above as the giant unloads his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring up with disbelief, Bryan is unprepared when an intense aroma invades his nostrils. It reeked of something both earthy and sweaty; rubber, dirt, and god-awful odor. He wipes tears away as he identifies the source: one of the giant student's filthy sneakers. Heavily abused, the low-top Vans sneaker towers dangerously close. Bryan is afforded a front row view of the footwear. Every smudge of dirt, deposit of grime, and dark stain of grass are plain against the off-white wall of rubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sneers with disgust, his face red with humiliation. Rising above the stained sole is a surface of soiled dark canvas sporting fraying rope-like stitching that ends with a pillar of sock that wraps around a thick leg coated with thick forests of dark hairs. The huge shoe shifts suddenly, shaking the ground as it drags backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout allowing the tiny man a moment of preparation, Bryan screams as the ground darkens. From above, looms the monumental shape of an enormous hand. The fingers, longer than office buildings and powerful enough to reduce a city to dust, clutch a huge object with large metal teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't hurt me!\" Bryan shrieks. His first assumption that him and only him are the center around which everything rotates. \"Eek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe throws himself to the ground, wrapping himself defensively. The ground lurches with an impressive crash as the giant shoves the huge plug into the outlet. Bryan peeks from his vain defense to watch the gigantic fingers press the towers of metal into the plastic slots. They inset with a dull boom, causing Bryan to squeak and scamper away as the massive fingers lift away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there is a thunder from above. Bryan gazes upwards dumbly, gawking as he deciphers the godly speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He babbles with confusion. Something along the lines of \"<i>Fucking</i>\" and \"<i>Ant</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a peal of protest, the tiny man flings into action - waving his arms and screaming for help against this mistake. \"I'm NOT an ant! Heeeelp! <i>I am a man</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding his cries, the gigantic hand looms into view; the huge index poised above the tiny speck of a man. The ridged finger tip is coated in grime and dirt that fill each groove of skin. Bryan is offered only a moment to react as it descends towards his location. He leaps to his side, falling into a groove between the floor and a wall of hard plastic just as everything turns dark and the ground lurches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, the thick pillar of flesh lifts off, shifting to present the unseen owner with the crushed victim. Bryan hold his breath, shaking with fear. He hears a deep grunt and screams when the huge dirt-filled digit returns and crashes into the ground again, attempting to flatten him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan merely wept tears of terror, sputtering incoherent pleas to the uncaring digit of destruction above. It lifted away once more, raining bits of dirt. Light basked the tiny man who gasped out mouthfuls of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God... Oh... God...\" He remained wedged in the incredibly small space. Trembling, all his senses remained peaked as he waited for something worse - but nothing happened. \"Is it over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decides...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room was beyond huge from the minute perspective Bryan commanded. Chairs loomed with dizzying stature against massive tables that seemed large enough to hold the entirety of a city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was overwhelming to say the least. \"I need to find Zack!\" He said with breathless determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch thoughts of salvation from his beloved nephew were all he could focus on to keep himself from panicking. Sun shone in from a distant wall of windows lining the opposite side on the room. Bryan looked away from the harsh light and tables, instead focusing upon the stars and doorways leading out. Zack could reside down any of them. Even with a destination in mind, the trek would be nothing short of Olympic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, oh man,\" Bryan whined, coming to halt in order to stare desolately at the distant visages. \"I-I-I can't remember!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he could just ask the front desk clerk, he joked internally. That oversized moron was what put him here in the first place! Bryan could only scoff angrily, not even wanting to glance backwards at the reclining giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that was the least of his problems. Bryan started when the ground suddenly vibrated. Then again. Shortly after, it began shuddering enough to send him reeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreaking with usual fervor, Steven glanced up at the front door. A tall, ripped, guy passed through the doors, clearly having returned from a game of basketball. Sun reflected off sweat coating his blondish hair and limbs as he nodded towards Steven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wassup Steve-o?\" He said with a friendly grin, stepping into the lobby. Glancing up, Steven grinned. \"Yo Matty!\" He replied cheerfully without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for me today?\" Matt asked as he crossed the lobby. He paused briefly, watching Steven relinquish his phone to lean over and glace at the few boxes nestled on the desk. Unbeknownst to either of them, a tiny spider hid among the looming containers, hissing at the giant face peering above. \"Nah dude, nada de nada,\" Steven shook his head, leaning back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright man, see ya around,\" Matt replied as he continued towards the common room, headed for his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The tiny man reacted. Panic overwhelmed him, and quite roughly, his body was thrown to the floor by the now violent earthquakes. \"Oh no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing in a vain attempt to halt the approaching behemoth that now towered above his ability to see. Far ahead, but only a mere step away to the titan, crash landed a high-top sneaker big enough to flatten a stadium and then some. Huge glistening globules of sweat fell from above at random, breaking against the ground with loud splashes. Bryan abandoned his cries and devolved into wordless screams. Confusion, terror, disbelief, and a distinctly warm sensation in his pants fueled his panic. He lay on his back, bruised and frozen as he stared at the immense basketball sneaker, watching it creak and groan as the leather and rubber mountain adjusted to the giant's unimaginable weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother drop of sweat larger than himself plummeted from the heavens, exploding nearby and dousing Bryan with warm liquid. As his vision cleared, he screamed again. Blurred by distance that was now quickly shortening, the other high-top soared overhead. Bryan remained frozen long enough to realize his doom when the massive rubber sole blocked out both sky and light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis instincts kicked in full-throttle. The tiny man ran: running faster than he thought he was capable of, and not a moment too soon. The ground seemed to lurched from under his feet accompanied by a power wall of displaced air when the immense sneaker crash landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuuuuuu-...guuurckkkaaaahh</i>!\" Bryan flew forward, his head throbbing as if a bomb had just gone off. The worn wall of rubber looked stained and rough like the side of some tall building. Loudly, sounding like a great beast was entrapped, groans and creaks rumbled from the sneaker. It lifted away with sluggish grace, seemingly impossible due to such unfathomable size, but still with ease of such massive power. Bryan was nearly deafened by a thunderous squeak from the cracked rubber. It pulled away from the floor, lifting from it to reveal the complicated tread pattern packed and lined with dirt and boulders from the court and campus. Darkened gunk entrapped the remains of both pulverized and twitching ants that were larger than Bryan but utterly insignificant against the deep grooves of rubber around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant student continued his step, slamming his mammoth high-top far ahead with a jolting crash. The other followed, soaring like an alien battleship built to completely decimate the planet, blasting the air apart as it moved with little effort. Then it landed far away with a distant crash and duller quake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping from his frozen gawking, Bryan booked it. He ran -- despite himself -- in the wake of the god-like student, not in pursuit, but hoping to find Zack and a safe haven from gigantic feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegs like skyscrapers out of fiction carried the oblivious basketball player far ahead. Each step of his worn sneakers sending duller and duller vibrations, much to the shrunken man's relief. But then Bryan gasped, slowing his pitiful gait and feeling his already traumatized heart beat harder. From a distant doorway entered another behemoth, dressed not in the athletic clothing of the first student, but in casual clothes that did nothing to downplay his rivaling stature and obvious athleticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ on a pogo-stick! Fuck!\" Bryan cursed, as the sweat-soaked giant thundered a greeting, raised a thick arm and slammed his massive palm against the new giant's in a high-five of cataclysmic proportions, sending angry waves of meteor-sized sweat crashing to the floor. Like any scrappy young guys would do, but this seemed ridiculous to the speck-sized scientist. It looked more like two gods greeting, then one passing off the job of stomping hapless scientists to his buddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giant grinned, nodding at his buddy and then the two passed: one leaving for the stairs, the other headed straight for Bryan who gawked at the massive white AF1s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to try fate again, Bryan began hoofing it away from the approaching student. His screams were nothing but gasping whispers at this point, all his breath long since exhausted. He ran. A flight filled with wild screaming, all but fruitless as the gargantuan student was upon him quickly. An enormous shadow was all the warning Bryan had that his time ran out, and suddenly he was bathed in darkness. A momentary look upwards was all he had to see the landscape of descending white rubber, discoloured and worn, and completely unfeeling to his minuscule life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in-between canyonesque rings of tread, it stomped down over Bryan. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His life had been saved by his giant nephew, Zack, who wasted no time in chasing the hideous spider away. That had been fine and dandy, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thought I was a bug.\" It had hit Bryan like a load of bricks. The same box had been lifted overhead, poised to destroy him. The same box that brought him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if an oblivious nephew of humongous scale wasn't enough, another behemoth of equal size hunkered over from behind. Bryan just ran at that point, pure adrenaline fueling his flight. Then a monstrous hand slammed down, throwing Bryan's tiny form into a violent flight with a simple brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he lay, seemingly safe but still hopelessly away from the box that contained the antidote. He pulled himself up, straining to listen to their thunderous conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIVE AND LET LIVE, I ALWAYS SAY.\" The deep, rumbling voice of Zack's buddy roared from afar. His head throbbed as they continued their booming speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SWEET,\" He discerned. \"YOU'RE GOOD TO GO DUDE.\" Bryan lit up at that despite his rough tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to Zack's humongous form. The giant raised a hand in farewell and grinned. \"No! Don't go, Zack! Don't leave without me! Please, just look! Zack!\" Without any sign of hearing the tiny man's cries, Zack turned and stomped away, vanishing from sight in a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was in tears. \"Waaaaaait!\" How could his plan have gone awry? He had planned everything so carefully. \"That damn spider...!\" The minute man screeched and stamped his feet causing spears of pain in his battered legs. A heavy pounding brought him out of his self-pitying thoughts, and Bryan suddenly remembered the other titanic guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack had left, unknowingly leaving his shrunken uncle at the mercy of this new giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few visit Bryan had made to the campus had allowed him to meet a multitude of Zack's school-mates. Gazing up, from his position at the base of a cup filled with pencils, Bryan studied the huge youth. His face had a friendly look to it; ear length black hair poked out from beneath a frayed black and white cap with a skate logo on it. Unlike Zack, he sported a chin strip of dark facial hair and trimmed, yet un-shaven, cheeks. Another logo featuring a black skull over the words \"ZERO\" stood out on his white t-shirt. Bryan did seem to recognize the giant young man, but failed to recall his name as he studied the impossibly massive human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous youth turned his head from side to side, scanning the room only visible from his lofty perspective. A giant hand large as many city blocks rested on the edge of the desk, idly tapping the surface with powerful motions. The sheer power from such a simple action was unbelievable. Friendly and easy-going he might appear to somebody of normal stature, he looked just the opposite to one as tiny as Bryan. What the giant took for a \"helpful\" sweep of the hand, could just as easily resulted in Bryan's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile true, these observations weren't getting him anywhere. \"I need to do something...\" The tiny man considered, never taking his eyes off the idle giant. \"If I can get his attention, he can help me reach Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the huge stranger moved. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven sighed as he sat down into the desk chair. After Zack had headed upstairs, he had been left completely alone in the lobby of the large dorm. Warm sunlight streaming through the large windows reflected off the white floors, giving the room a cheery glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven began picking through the other packages that had been delivered while he had been away from the desk. He mentally noted the names so he could deliver the boxes to the guys as they came through the lobby. As he lifted the last box, a spider scurried across the desk. Steven, not the least bit afraid, smiled. \"No, no little guy, not up here!\" he muttered. Acting on his \"live and let live\" policy, Steven brought his hand towards the fleeing bug and flicked it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with the packages, Steven fished his phone out of his pocket. Leaning back he propped his sneakers onto the desk to get more comfortable. Not seeing any messages, he opened a game to keep himself occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, the spider he believed he had spared, lay in a crumpled heap in the middle of the lobby. It fought to find cover despite two mangled legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak from the front door got Steven's attention. A ripped guy walked through the door, clearly having returned from a game of basketball. Sun reflected off his sweat as he nodded towards Steven. \"Wassup Steve-o?\" he said as he stepped forward. \"Sup Matty!\" Steven replied cheerfully without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for me today?\" he asked as he crossed the lobby. As Steven shook his head in reply, Matt's sneaker landed squarely on top of the struggling spider. \"Alright man, see ya around,\" Matt replied as he headed towards the stairs. In his wake was a smear on the floor, unnoticed by Matt. Steven, in spite of his good intentions, had gotten the spider crushed. Unaware of this, Steven refocused on his game in the once more empty lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant let out a gusting sigh as he dropped into the chair behind him. Even sitting down he towered far above the desk. In spite of the warm glow that filled the room and made the young man look even friendlier, Bryan couldn't shake the paralyzing fear of his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched in awe as the giant easily shifted through the building-sized packages. When the last one lifted, something shot out from underneath it. The spider from earlier was fleeing its compromised hideout. And it was headed straight for Bryan. \"Oh dear God no!\" Bryan wailed in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, NO LITTLE GUY, NOT UP HERE!\" the giant thundered from above. Out of nowhere a set of thick fingers appeared and with a simple flick the spider was gone. Bryan sighed in relief, thankful to the giant for getting rid of the spider. That is until a thought struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis behemoth had no understanding of the power he had in his simple motions. He my have believed that he was \"living and letting live\" but as Bryan already knew that spider was probably in a world of pain. Not that Bryan was concerned for the monstrous spider. However getting this giant's attention wouldn't be his only obstacle. Being recognized as more than a bug would keep him from being carelessly flicked away or swept aside once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud rocked the desk, shaking Bryan from his thoughts. He jumped backwards with a yelp. Just in front of him were a pair of sneakers, one crossed over the other. Bryan was unable to tear his gaze away from the titanic shoes. They had a brownish waffle tread that was packed with dirt and pebbles. Bryan could also see what looked to be a couple of ants smashed into the worn tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for live and let live!\" Bryan scoffed. Beyond the shoes, the behemoth laid back in the chair. Unaware of his tiny audience, his mammoth face remained focused solely on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak at the door got Bryan to spin around. In walked an Adonis, dressed in basketball attire. Roaring to the guy at the desk, his pounding footsteps shook the desk as he approached. Bryan unintentionally stepped backwards as the giant neared. He suddenly stopped and turned abruptly towards the stairs Zack had disappeared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT MAN, SEE YA AROUND!\" he thundered as he left. Bryan watched him leave, ignoring the titan still at the desk who didn't move as he returned to his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack is in this building, I should just find his dorm!\" Bryan reasoned. \"Of course if I got this guy's help, that would make finding Zack much easier...\" Bryan stood still for a moment. He then decided to...</span></div></div>",

While he still debated a new plan of action, the spider scurried toward him, having fastened it eight eyes on his bug-sized body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith screamed at the shockingly swift advance by the horrid-looking creature. He raced in a diagonal lining, hoping to keep distance between them and also make his way back toward the all-important shipping carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto this life-or-death struggle, Tommy arrived, more or less on schedule, humming cheerfully a tune that had been stuck in his head for the past several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him, the teenager walked toward the kitchen table, spying a small cardboard box in the exact location Mr. Smith had told him to expect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze that followed Tommy's opening of the back door rushed across the surface of the table. With eight legs, the spider resisted the sudden surge of air that slammed into the shrunken man and sent him sprawling toward massive metal and glass towers in the center of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sudden hurricane suddenly ceased with the closing of the back door, the battered little man saw his gigantic teenaged neighbor walking toward the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Mr. Smith screamed. \"It's me!

Freakin' spider!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found what he needed by turning and grabbing yesterday's newspaper from Mr. Smith's kitchen counter. He rolled the newspaper into a tube and wielded it into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact as he slammed the newspaper down on the itty-bitty spider rocked the table. The unseen little scientist was knocked off his feet in the shadow of the salt shaker. Before he could get his legs back under him, Tommy scooped the package off the tabletop in one huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait, please!\" The shrunken scientist screamed. \"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed away from the strange towers of glass and gleaming stainless steel, mindless that Tommy was still holding the newspaper in his other hand, having already demonstrated a lethal tendency to strike first and ask questions later...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that kind of cash at stake, however, he had remained silent to keep from jinxing such an unexpected opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow impatient to get the task done, he placed the rolled up newspaper back on the kitchen table and then started for the backdoor to his neighbor's home when his ears detected a faint squeak, one so feeble it was almost beyond his ability to detect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd, squeaking noise delayed his departure, and caused him to turn and gaze around the room. He didn't see anything, at first, so after a cursory glance he turned again.  Then, he heard the squeaky noise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?\" Tommy said aloud in mild irritation. He continued hearing the teeny, irritating squeaks and scanned the room for the source. He tilted his head, trying to pinpoint from which direction the sound was originating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took a few steps closer to the table, the squeaks grew more insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom near a set of gleaming stainless steel and glass salt and pepper shakers, Tommy saw a tiny bug scurry into the open space of the table, close to the spot where he had swatted the disgusting spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S WITH THE BUG PROBLEM?\" The teenager said aloud as he stretched his huge body over the table as he reached for the rolled-up newspaper for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only taken his eyes off the bug for that brief instant, but he lost track of its location. Finally, from the corner of his eye, he saw the itty-bitty bug running back for cover near Mr. Smith's salt and pepper shakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy put the package down on the table. \"NOT SO FAST,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, he lifted the pepper shaker and transferred it to the other side of the table.

He heard the noise again, and the idyllic scene faded as he returned to the pain of consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO, WE CAN HANG HERE THIS WEEKEND?\" A loud, boisterous male voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURE. MR. SMITH WON'T MIND,\" Tommy informed his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy led the way as he and Joe entered the kitchen. He had ran into Joe on the way back from the post office after mailing Mr. Smith's important package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's first steps sailed over the tiny bug on the floor near the massive doorway. Each time his shoes made contract with the floor, the shock of impact sent out rumbling tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man, jolted back to consciousness, felt the searing pain in his injured leg. He didn't have time to cry out, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother set of massive shoes crashed down on either side of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOUND! POUND!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth Airwalks rent the stillness with their awesome crashes as the giant teenager stepped inside the kitchen. The shoes covered the space of a football field!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" the little man whimpered, sure that he was about to be stomped like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't fair. He needed to get the attention of the two teenaged giants, but he could not even get onto his feet with the leg injured earlier when Tommy had missed stomping him flat by only a fraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomp hadn't been a direct one. That would have pulverized him. Instead, he had merely been dealt a glancing blow, barely caught by the front of the huge shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he wondered if it might not have been mercifully quicker to have simply been squished under Tommy's sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full horror of his situation overwhelmed him. His antidote was gone, on its way to his nephew in California. Without access to the antidote, he was trapped, smaller than most bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, he had been seriously injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL SHOW YOU THE REST OF THE HOUSE,\" Tommy told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's marched away, his massive Airwalks thudding on the floor with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan watched them with both dread and relief. He tried to crawl as best he could, but being unable to walk severely hindered his progress. He needed something he could utilize as a crutch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw something interesting on the underside of the monolithic wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplinters. Tiny shafts of wood that were gradually being shaved away from the door. Several of them were too massive for him to handle. He kept searching and found one that looked right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo reach it, he had to stand, trying to support all of his weight on his good leg. He almost toppled forward, but he managed to grab the rough splinter. His hands held tightly to it as he struggled to tear it free from the rest of the massive wooden door. He produced fresh gashes in his hands, but that was a small price to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he achieved his goal. Once torn free, he used the splinter to support himself and keep weight off the injured leg. He could move, although not very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way out of the kitchen and toward the living room and the giant teenagers. They were his last hope, and his biggest peril.</span></div></div>",

He could only speculate that some sort of experiment had gone terribly wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU WORRY, MR.

It has the antidote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager was scanning the room, confusing the tiny professor. But Tommy found what he needed. He left the table, but he soon returned with a small glass canister collected from Mr. Smith's cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell does he mean to do with that?\" The tiny man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get in here,\" Tommy said. \"I'll take you home with me, but first I will mail that package. I remember how important you said it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicked man backed away in shock. \"No! Leave the package! It has the antidote I need....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man stopped talking and screamed when Tommy reached down and without any ceremony simply plucked him off the tabletop between two massive fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, you'll crush me,\" the tiny many shrieked as the massive digits held him in a crushing grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the pinch with the fingertips lasted only long enough to drop the tiny man into the deep glass container that Tommy immediately lifted to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU SHOULD BE SAFE IN THERE, DUDE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the thick glass blocked the painful force of the teenager's loud voice, but it also effectively muffled tiny Mr. Smith's desperate squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had protectively placed his shrunken neighbor in the glass canister, Tommy found the package and the payment his neighbor had left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pocketed the money and left the house with the cardboard box and a tiny glass bottle, Tommy felt good that he was helping out his neighbor.

He felt sick to realize that Tommy's helpful actions had been the worst possible action the teenager could have taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe antidote that could have restored him was now on its way cross country to his nephew. He had been a helpless, mute observer as the gigantic teenager made the trip to the post office and handed the package over to a giant postal clerk. Mr. Smith felt like crying as he realized how horribly wrong things had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to get Tommy to listen to me,\" he said, changing plans to keep pace with the developments outside of his control. \"He can reach Zack and tell him it is vital that he bring the package and the antidote here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realizes that he is placing a lot of faith in a teenager. With a shake of his head, he realizes that he has very little choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip from post office and back to Tommy's home is mercifully brief. When Tommy arrives home, he makes a beeline for his room, locking the door behind him before he removes the small glass container and places it on the desk in front of him. He is somewhat relieved to see that Mr. Smith still seems all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets a goofy grin on his face as he stares through the glass at his bug-sized neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is a good thing I looked closer back at your place, huh Mr. Smith? I came really close to swatting you. But I thought you were a bug, and well, look at you. Could you blame me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith stares in horror as Tommy nonchalantly recounts how he almost swatted him like an insect! In response, he tries to gesture at the lid of the container. \"Let me out!\" He yells, even knowing his words can't be understood by the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Tommy gets the right idea. A moment later, the tiny man is unceremoniously dumped out of the jar and onto the desktop. The teenager doesn't even seem to comprehend how harrowing it is for the shrunken scientist to simply be dumped onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally dusting himself off, he stands and looks around. He has never seen the teenager's room. It seems fairly typical. There are some posters of some skateboard celebrities on the walls. His desk is crowded with a computer, keyboard and mouse, as well as enormously oversized objects such as pens, pencils and a bright green notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, it's scary being this tiny,\" I yell at him through hands cupped around my mouth. \"Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see Tommy tilt his head toward me, but then he shakes his entire upper body, and I feel the result in the tremors beneath my feet. \"Sorry, little man. I just can't hear you. You're just so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when Mr. Smith gets what he believes is a brilliant idea. He runs over to the colossal keyboard and looks up at Tommy. Then he points at the keyboard, and then points at Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant teenager leans over him, and then a light bulb seems to go off. \"Good idea, Mr. Smith.\" His huge hands hover over the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith backs up so he can get a view of the keyboard. He patiently waits for Tommy's finger to hover over the right key. Using the trusty \"hunt and peck\" method, a semblance of a message begins to take shape on the mega-sized computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U mailed antidote. I can't get big. Contact nephew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Tommy is remorseful when he realizes what he has done, but also a little defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I know that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith tried to wave his arms to let Tommy know that there are no hard feelings. \"Just keep typing!\" He yells up as he waits for the teenager to get back to the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a painfully long process of some trial and error, he manages to convey Zack's phone number to Tommy. He watches, thrilled, as Tommy takes out his phone and begins to dial the number on the screen in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he reaches a pre-recorded greeting welcoming him to leave a message. But, when he tries to do so, he gets another message informing him that Zack's voicemail box is full. Then, with a click, the call ends and he must look down in confusion at the tiny, expectant man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mr. Smith. Your nephew needs to clean out his voicemail box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith felt his spirits sink at this other unexpected setback. But, they can always try again later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always try him again later,\" he said. A loud rumbling startled the little man, but Tommy just laughed. \"I think I could use a snack. Want me to bring you back something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith realized the loud gurgling noise had simply been the protests of the teenager's empty stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Tommy doesn't really wait for a reply. Only after the giant teenager has left the room does Mr. Smith realize that Tommy has also just left him alone and exposed on the desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very irresponsible of him,\" Mr. Smith grumbles. But, he just went to get a snack...he should be back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when he heard a strange noise, he realized it wasn't the teenager returning. Instead, it was the...</span></div></div>",

But, the feline now looked like Cat-Zilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Mr. Smith began screaming for assistance at once. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, his tiny, weak cries only attracted the curious cat, which leapt from the bed to the desktop to search for the source of the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith looked for a secure place to hide, noticed the towering container of metallic mesh that held some of Tommy's enormous pens and pencils. At the size of a mere bug, he easily passed through the mesh grille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not a moment too soon. The cat had spied a glimmer of movement and proceeded to bat the pencil container with its paw. As a result, the feline sent the container tumbling over the edge of the bed just as Tommy returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The giant teenager screamed. \"Get out of her, stupid cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat disappeared from the room with a screech and blur of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager hadn't noticed the cat knocking the container of pencils off the desk, so he ran carelessly into the room, not bothering to watch his step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, a dazed Mr. Smith crawled from the debris field of the pencils and pens as he watched Tommy's huge sneakers bearing down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distraught teenager, finding no sign of his tiny neighbor on the desktop, came to the shocking, and erroneous, conclusion that the cat had eaten the bug-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gross,\" Tommy said. \"What a way to go!\"</span></div></div>",

Everything around him might be scaled to colossal size, but the shrunken man favored his prospect more inside his huge home rather than the immense outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the tiny man, now reduced to a size of no significance even to a little fly, found himself in tantalizing proximity with Tommy. Despite his scary enormousness, the teenager represented the unlucky scientist's best hope of regaining normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!

Tommy's enormous eyes darted back and forth as he tracked the path of the irritating flying pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the tiny man cried again as he saw Tommy's onrushing hand, this time accompanied by a blast of curse words for the pesky insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized scientist knew he had to get back inside his home.

Tommy frowned grimly and followed the wavering flight of the pesky bug, ready to slam the flyswatter down on the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

On occasion, he spotted Tommy and the raised plastic fly-swatter and tried to shout a warning to the teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it! You'll kill me!\" The tiny man screamed to the oblivious teenager, who patiently followed the fly's meandering movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shrunken man's dismay, the fly zoomed in for a landing near the center of the oval patio table. As they landed, the fly released the tiny man, who tumbled across the tabletop. To his credit, the tiny man hit the surface with the immediate plan of putting space between himself and the fly. He raced across the surface of the acrylic patio table as fast as his tiny legs could carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Tommy's gloating voice behind him as he ran. \"A-HA!\" Tommy cried out as he swiped at the winged insect with the borrowed fly-swatter.

The hurricane-force wind bowled him over. On his back, he looked upward as Tommy lifted the red fly-swatter off the table. He held the destructive weapon, fashioned from little more than a plastic mesh attached to a thick plastic handle, in one of his huge hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the titan unnerved the little man. He turned left and right, looking for a place to hide. He saw a giant terra-cotta tower rising from the table's surface. A huge green plant bigger than a tree rose from the top of the tower. The gigantic potted plant offered the only available shelter on the table, but it looked very distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath, got to his feet and sprinted toward the towering object. If he had waited a few more seconds, Tommy would have already turned and headed back into the house. As it was, he caught sight of something tiny scurrying across the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY\u2026ANOTHER ONE,\" Tommy said in a loud voice, aiming the fly-swatter again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist pushed himself faster, but looked over his shoulder. He saw the titan raise his muscular arm to make an effective swat with the lethal weapon. Concentrating too much on the huge teenager, he stumbled and crashed. He scrambled onto his back just in time to see Tommy position the fly-swatter over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" He screamed. \"Wait! It's\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud WHAP from the plastic mesh against the tabletop sounded satisfactorily in Tommy's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross!\" He exclaimed, lifting the fly-swatter and seeing the splattered remains of the unidentified bug. He stepped across the deck and looked into a small storage cabinet, finding what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprayed the tabletop with a cleaning fluid and used a paper towel to wipe up the remains of both the fly and the other little bug. He wadded up the paper towel and tossed it into the backyard brick barbecue pit. The next time his neighbor had a barbecue, the soiled paper towel could help fuel the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he retrieved the package he had promised to mail and headed to the post office.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lips and teeth parted, giving the tiny scientist a front seat view of his destination. A dark, cavernous maw, already dripping with saliva and pulsing as it readied for a treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEEEELLLPP!\u201d He shrieked, fighting to get to the edge of the bag.

Winds strong enough to put a twister to shame assaulted him. Again he screamed as he swirled about with oats dust, circling the horse\u2019s mouth. He claimed and reached out for anything he could grip, but to no avail. When again the jaws opened, he air current swept the man inside, slamming him into an upper molar, or between two of them. His legs and torso squelched into a bit of stick oats paste from the previous bite, currently packed into the molars. He was able to see below at the mouthful just before the mouth closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWet, deafening noises filled the air as the horse chewed, first on one side, then on Bryan\u2019s. Some giant wet thing, presumably the tongue, hit the scientist hard, forcing him up to his stomach in between the teeth.

He was a scientist, after all, and preferred bending nature to his will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the speck of a man would have preferred to be hog-tied to the back of the horse instead of directly in the enormous beast's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! No, I am right here! HELP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the towering entities approaching alarmingly fast failed to register Bryan's cries of alarm. The ground literally jolted beneath the tiny man's feet with every cosmic impact of the horse's mammoth hooves. To make matters worse, Bryan was isolated in a rocky wasteland of asphalt: huge boulders, crevices, and debris lay around him. He had no idea which direction was his home or where Tommy went!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLOMP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne gigantic hoof lifted in the distance, soaring high and covering enormous distance before impacting the earth with immeasurable power. Terrified, Bryan shrieked at it just as another hoof raised far to his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do? This isn't fair! What do I do!\" His only option, he figured, was to run. Run blindly. Bryan did just that: he scrambled over a boulder and prepared the sprint when the sky darkened just moments before a thundering impact. Boulders both small and large were thrown like confetti by the huge force created by the appendage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, seemingly so big it was the sky itself, loomed the horse. The planetary being was forested in dark brown hair with towering stretches of dirty white coating the ankles. It resembled something out of myth. As if this great beast was the world itself and not just a simple animal. At his size, Bryan could easily establish a populated settlement of many thousands across the stomach alone. Looking at the nearest tower of leg, he could see tiny creatures - fleas or mites, he figured - leaping from their host to be lost upon the asphalt earth below. He felt so tiny against this filthy, dumb beast. Bryan's gaze shot to another tower of flesh and hair as it lifted, headed in his direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt covered insurmountable distance in mere moments and began descending right on the ant-sized man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see all sorts of matter a police horse might collect during the day, packed tightly in worn crevices and pulverized beyond recognition with each clomping step. Mud, dirt, grass, and other crap (literally and figuratively). Bryan wasn't sure if he recognised scattered chunks and bits that might have been alive at one point. It revolted and frightened him. In those slight moments, he even discerned a maker's mark forged into the hard steel shoe. Strange that the last thing he would read were huge letters, barely half-inch normally, detailing the brand and gauge of a horseshoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Bryan felt numb to this fate. He gawked upwards: Tiny, insignificant, and helpless. What could he even do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He froze in place and closed his eyes as duke the police horse\u2019s colossal hoof descended down on him. As the shadow darkened, a thought crossed his mind: maybe shrinking himself was NOT a good plan after all. Why had that not occurred to him before? Regardless, it was too late to dwell on that now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a final act of acceptance to his fate, Bryan reopened his eyes and looked up at the hoof, which was only inches from his puny frame, at which point a new thought entered his head: oh\u2026 fuck\u2026 and the hoof slammed down onto him with a resonant CLOMP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man blinked and found himself decidedly not dead. Or maybe he was. Was he? If he was, was this the afterlife? Why did the afterlife smell overpoweringly of bubblegum? While questions were surging through his mind, Bryan was suddenly lifted dizzyingly fast, and literally; it made him dizzy and his ears popped. Whatever lifted him up flicked back and moved forward, giving the scientist a good view of the Duke\u2019s titanic underbelly and manhood. Bryan began to descend again, and he realized what happened. \u201cHELP MEEE!\u201d he screamed, to anyone or anything that could possibly hear him. But no one could. No one hears the plea of a bug stuck to a piece of gum under a horse\u2019s hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke\u2019s hoof slammed down again, forcing the diminutive Bryan a little deeper into the gum. When he was again exposed to the light of day, he managed to catch a brief view of tommy walking back into his house. There was no point in yelling now. His only salvation would come from his own effort to escape before he got too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke\u2019s progress was fast, despite his casual pace. Bryan fought against the bonds of the gum, only to have his attempts at freedom undone at the end of the horse\u2019s step. On a positive note, and Bryan was surprised that he could even think of one at the moment, but had the horse not been wearing a shoe, he would most definitely have been killed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had enjoyed the ride, but he knew too much walking on the asphalt could be bad for Dukes hooves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police stables stood a few hundred feet from the station itself, only slightly off the main road. They shared a parking lot, and the horse and rider walked through it to enter the shade of the Stable. The officer dismounted barely five feet into the building and quickly unsaddled Duke, leaving only his bridle as he led him into his stall. Most of the other horses, roughly ten or so, had already returned and were absently eating the hay from the corner of their respective stalls. With an affectionate pat on the flank, the officer walked out to return to his duties.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was in a figurative hell of sound and motion. He lost track of time and had only the near deafening CLOMPS of hoof on road to tell he was still conscious. Light and dark and light again, given a clear view of duke\u2019s underbelly over and over. The gum had somewhat hardened, but in that time he had freed his arms to the shoulder. The only reason he wouldn\u2019t need traction after this ordeal was the shock absorption of the gum cushioning him, but hat wasn\u2019t helping as much now. His voice was hoarse from screaming for help every time he saw light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the hard asphalt was replaced by slightly less hard packed dirt. \u201cWhat the Hell?\u201d He muttered. Then, also suddenly, the equine behemoth stopped walking. That took a moment to register, as he had almost grown used to the motion. He fought all the harder to free himself, bending around to pry at the sticky substance and get his leg free. He was sent into a mild panic when he heard the whinnying and grunting of other horses around him. He must be all the way back at the stable! That was  early two miles from his home! He groaned and kept fighting his bonds. However, before any meaningful progress could be made, He was moving again. Four more steps of the hoof he was attached to later and the horse stopped again. Bryan found himself face to face with A stick as thick as his torso. As he looked, the floor seemed to be almost made of them. He didn\u2019t take too long to consider it and finally managed to get his leg free. It hung limp as he worked on his other one, scraping away the gum and throwing it away as best he could. When his other leg was free, he frantically wriggled his back, falling to the ground a moment later. \u201cFreedom!\u201d He cheered.  O time to celebrate, though; how was he ever going to get back home?!</span></div></div>",

He even began to enjoy it a little: trying to make out the muffled snatches of conversation outside or imagine where exactly his box might be at this precise moment. Once his mind was occupied in this way time seemed to pass more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, the movements ceased and the noises faded into the distant background. The package had been left somewhere, apparently unattended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan prided himself on his ability to plan ahead. He had arranged the fastest shipping available, but had nevertheless anticipated that there might still be hours of tedium before him. One of the pieces of \u201cequipment\u201d he had therefore taken care to miniaturize beforehand was a smartphone loaded with articles and e-books for him to read. Unfortunately, there were certain other problems that Bryan had failed to anticipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a start, he hadn\u2019t realized just how dark it would be inside the package. He should have guessed this, of course, but he had been too wrapped up in the excitement of the adventure to give it proper consideration. It wasn\u2019t immediately a problem: the phone provided its own illumination. However, his eyes soon became strained from trying to read the glare of the small screen in the otherwise near-total darkness. Finally he gave up and decided to check his email instead--only to discover there was no signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith mentally kicked himself. In its highly-miniaturized state - not to mention blanketed by the thick layers of wrapping and packaging - the device was simply incapable of connecting with the outside world. But worse was to come. Close to the icon indicating the (lack of) signal strength was the battery meter - and it was almost empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c10%?! It should be full! I\u2019m sure I charged it last... DAMN!\u201d And then he remembered. He had indeed put out the phone for charging the previous evening - only to be distracted by an unexpected phone call. How could he be so stupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time Bryan started to feel genuinely apprehensive about the situation. He was by no means claustrophobic but he suddenly became uncomfortably aware of how he was now nothing more than a tiny little speck trapped inside a rather small and ordinary parcel travelling through the nation\u2019s labyrinthine postal system. The phone hadn\u2019t simply been there to keep him amused; it was his lifeline if something serious happened and he needed to contact somebody. It\u2019s inability to function as intended meant that he was now cut off from the normal, everyday world he had previously taken for granted. He was completely alone: just a single teeny ant lost in a mysterious world of oblivious and unfathomable giants. Part of him wanted to scrabble frantically out through the minuscule tear in the wrapping and flee...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calm and logical scientist warred with the frightened miniaturized human... and finally won. Leaving the relative safety of the box at this point would truly be the worst thing he could do. He had no idea where he was, and without the aid of his phone he had no easy means to communicate with any of the people who might be outside. Like it or not, Bryan told himself he had to remain calm and wait. He was already on his way to his nephew: in a few hours he would be delivered and Zack would open the package. Everything would be fine.  He couldn\u2019t wait to see just how huge Zack would be - not to mention the expression on his nephew\u2019s face when he saw how utterly minute his uncle was by comparison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought immediately made him relax and he concentrated on dreaming about all the things he and his nephew could do together. A few minutes later he heard muffled noises outside. The cardboard walls around him creaked as a gigantic pair of hands grasped the box and lifted it up. The package shook gently as it was carried away. \u201cThere,\u201d Bryan told himself, \u201cI knew everything would work out okay. It won\u2019t be long now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tiny Mr. Smith had no idea just how wrong he could be...</span></div></div>",

The driver paid little attention to the tumbling and shifting of the cardboard boxes as he drove. This was all par for the course when maneuvering through suburban neighbourhoods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back from his GPS, the driver thrummed around a turn in the road and brought his truck to a halt at an intersection. He squinted, adjusting his cap and frowning. It was midday and the sun attempted to intrude upon his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did I put my sungl-...!\" His thought cut short when a screech of tires broke the silence. Not a second later, a tremendous crash sent the postal driver chest-first into the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" Sliding the heavy door open, he stumbled out of the vehicle with a grunt. \"What the...\" His neck and chest throbbed from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardboard boxes slid from the truck and unto the gravel-ridden asphalt. The impact had smashed the large rear-end doors, allowing them to swing loosely. An audible groan caught his attention. He spotted the responsible party in their car nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid fuck! What the hell were you doing? I was at a dead stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe postman approached the offending vehicle - a dark blue sedan sporting a cracked windshield with a crumpled hood. He pulled his company cap off, furiously scratching his short, dark hair, and proceeded towards the driver. Rubbing her head with bloodied hand, she pawed aimlessly at the steering wheel with the other. She jolted at the sound of his voice. Her eyes shone wide with terror from behind a mess of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an... Uhm, I am... It happened so-....\" Despite a broken window, she smashed the door lock shut and revved the battered vehicle. \"<i>Fuuuuuuuuck thisss</i>....!\" She bleated shrilly. The sedan lurched forward in response with a whine and a clang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man leaped back in surprise, cursing after her. She sped the car over the curb; rolling over her own fallen bumper and smashing more than a few of the scattered packages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy bitch! Fuck!\" Scraping parts against the road, the woman raced her car out of sight. The postal worker stood dumbfounded: surveying the devastation left in her wake. Many packages were either completely flattened, or partially; their contents laying in pieces on the asphalt. Other vehicles passed slowly, their drivers gawking like awe-struck children at the circus. Ignoring them, the driver grabbed his fallen hat and re-positioned it upon his head. Shards of broken goods and packing materials crunched under his boots as he inspected the devastation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne cardboard crate had been completely flattened. Electronic bits lay strewn around the ruin of cardboard, mixed with plastic packing nuts. A few other boxes were in a similar state. One particularly small package with a gash in the side sat near a dirty swatch of fabric. Grunting, he gave the little box a good kick with his boot. It landed a few feet away, sounding empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better call the main office to get this crap cleaned up...\" Meaning he would miss lunch. Worse, he would need to give a police report since the bitch ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some shit day this turned out to be...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the accident was only the beginning of Bryan's day...</span></div></div>",

He had just eaten a handful of chips when someone knocked at the door. He got off the couch, brushed a few crumbs out of his chest hair, and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery for Zack Smith,\" a man in a postal uniform announced, holding a small package in his right hand, a clipboard in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Rick said. \"He's expecting that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Zack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I room here with him,\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can sign for it then,\" the man said and handed Rick the clipboard and nodded to the pen attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick scrawled a signature on the form held in place by the clipboard, and the man handed over the small cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick grunted and closed the door. He wandered back toward the couch, box in hand. Before seating himself, he held the box to his ear and gave it a gentle shake. Nothing rattled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what the hell Zack's getting this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the box, a tiny man only a fourth of an inch tall, tried to crawl deeper into a handkerchief field's many crumpled folds to prevent himself from being ping-ponged around the box by a neck-jolting, vigorous shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Bryan Smith screamed in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had spent the last 23 hours regretting his impulsive action. From the time that his teenaged neighbor had arrived and picked up the package for mailing, the tiny man had been subject to the harrowing and bruising movements that he would never have noticed at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hungry and thirsty. Constant motion had scattered his supplies in the warehouse-sized box, and he had been too scared to venture out to search for them. Worst of all, he had lost the precious glass vial that contained the antidote. Otherwise, he would certainly have used it to get back to normal. He wasn't worried. He could always find it when he finally arrived in his nephew's hands. Until then, he tried to ignore the nausea resulting from another flurry of shocking, unpredictable motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not a car,\" Rick said, staring at the small box. \"Not a pair of sneakers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to run through the list of cool gifts Zack's uncle and benefactor had sent to him. \"Lucky bastard,\" Rick said, working himself into an envious state. \"All I ever get is a damn birthday check from Uncle Ray for ten lousy bucks or new socks and underwear from mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it was wrong, but he wanted to discover what waited for Zack inside the box. Nothing else at hand, he tore at the tape with the sharp edge of the pop tab from his can of Mountain Dew. When he shredded the tape sufficiently, he pulled back the flaps on the small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan Smith was sure he would throw up if he had to endure much more shaking. Then, he heard a raspy, grating noise and with an extremely loud roar, the flaps of the box were drawn back and he looked up to see an enormous face staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Zack's face, as it so happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick plucked the handkerchief out of the box. He then looked through the box. The only contents he saw consisted of a few crumbs and tiny scraps of cloth. \"The fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had entirely missed the tiny speck that plummeted from the handkerchief as he lifted it from the box. \"Makes no sense,\" he said, scratching his head at discovering Zack's surprise was nothing. Literally, nothing; the damn box was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! He'll blame me.\" Rick leaped off the sofa, box still in hand, and went to his desk. He took several long pieces of tape and reassembled the package. It looked a little battered, but he figured that Zack would dismiss that as normal wear and tear from the shipping process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put the package on the counter in their kitchenette. Next to the bowl for keys and phones, Zack would see that his \"surprise\" had arrived as soon as he returned from class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming his sprawled, carefree position on the sofa, he reached for his Mountain Dew and chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In answer to his own question, he drank the contents of the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the familiar sensation almost immediately. By the time he stepped off a chair seat onto the kitchen tabletop, he was only about four feet tall and going down fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple of minutes the brilliant research scientist had dwindled to a mere quarter of an inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took in his surroundings, amazed at the colossal scale of everything. His kitchen looked more like the geographical features of some bizarre landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man walked over and saw the tiny pre-shrunk clothes he had left near the transport box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll dress later,\" he decided, leaving the clothes neatly folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the distant wall clock, the time was just a few minutes past noon.  Bryan took a quick jog across the tabletop to stand in the shadow of the crystal salt and pepper shakers, which had transformed into some towering crystal cathedral structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bryan figured he had time to explore these curiosities before he needed to secure himself in the box. He began the short jog to the middle of the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a loud noise at the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Bryan said, knowing Tommy would not be this early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, admitting both a colossal titan and a hurricane-force wind that swept over the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt!\" Bryan screamed as he watched his enormous brother stand in the open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt slid the credit card he had used to jimmy the lock to the back door back into his wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the door!\" Bryan screamed as the wind blew with even more ferocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a powerful gust caught his tiny body in an updraft and the speck-sized man found himself airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt closed the door and yelled in an awesome roar. \"BRO!\" Matt's voice thundered as the storm weakened after the door was shut. \"ARE YOU HOME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt failed to notice...</span></div></div>",

A paralyzed Bryan watched him move past the rug and continue to stand in front of the monolithic refrigerator. The huge door swung open and the front half of Matt's enormous body disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" Bryan gasped as he tried to keep his gaze on his gigantic brother. Not only was he stranded, no bigger than a bug, on his kitchen floor, but the vial of antidote was packed inside the transport carton hopelessly beyond his reach on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only hope rested with contacting Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, nearly a decade younger than his older brother, also stood a few inches taller. Now that even mere inches made a big difference, he overwhelmed the kitchen, which had seemed so vast before his arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan began running over the woven rug, but found his bare feet kept getting tangled in frayed fibers. He slowed his pace to a steady jog, which allowed him to reach the edge of the rug without continually tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped uneasily onto the vast tile surface of the kitchen floor at the same moment Matt emerged from his raid of the fridge with a can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the giant no longer motionless, Bryan waited to see in what direction Matt proceeded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was a moment Bryan had always wanted to experience. Here he was, extremely tiny and observing a juggernaut of muscle and skin. Bryan fell into a state that left him almost unaware of everything save the enormity of his younger sibling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe how huge he is,\" Bryan said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he could quickly calculate the disproportionate scale that existed between them, mere numbers did little to drive home the difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a bug compared to him,\" Bryan realized with a involuntary shudder, a spasm of nervous fear. In truth, he knew, some bugs were even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard movement again, which snapped him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had pushed the chair back and stood from the table. Bryan froze in place, waiting to see what direction his giant brother would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he noticed the package in Matt's right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shipping package,\" Bryan cried, realizing that the small box held the antidote capable of restoring his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood between the table and the sink, not aware of the tiny speck on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan leaped and waved his hands in a frantic manner. He realized belatedly that Matt now represented his only hope of returning to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt!\" Bryan screamed as loudly as he could. \"Matt, I am down here! On the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny voice failed to reach his giant sibling's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, instead of turning left or right, Matt started walking directly toward the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan shouted. His mind, unable to decide which way he should flee, simply left him rooted to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow darkened everything around Bryan, who gazed up at the rapidly dropping shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneaker missed him by mere inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor something as tiny as Bryan, the miss was a mixed blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe evaded, by chance alone, being stomped beneath his brother's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the blast of displaced air as the sneaker slammed down on the tiles threw Bryan into the air. He landed hard on his back, the breath knocked from his lungs. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of his massive feet struck the discarded shoe, tilting it back into an upright position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan did have time to manage a scream, but one so imperceptible it again went unnoticed by his large brother. The shoe settled back into position as the speck-sized man landed with a soft and squishy thud on the damp bottom of the long-worn sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis peril flashed into his brain at once, but even as he ran toward the massive walls enclosing him in the shoe, Bryan realized his dilemma. At his current size, he was far too small to make his escape from the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, for the moment, Matt remained uninterested in his sneakers. Instead, he padded across the floor in his bare feet to visit his older brother's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shoe, tiny Bryan had one fleeting glimpse of his god-like brother before Matt vanished.

You must be staying here while Mr. Smith's out of town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned curiously. \"I talked to my big bro just a few hours ago,\" Matt said. \"He didn't mention anything about a trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugged and his shoulders rippled beneath his tight T-shirt, that also showed off his bulging biceps to their best effect. \"I don't know what to tell you, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had met Mr. Smith's brother, but since Matt only had a few years on him, the teenager didn't look up to Matt as a second \"Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing here...uh...\" Matt slapped at his forehead. \"Donnie, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Matt said. He strode back across the room in his bare feet and stood near the sofa. \"Did my brother ask you to water the plants or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed. \"No,\" he answered. \"He just asked me to stop by and take a package to the post office for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, leaping up and down at the bottom of Matt's sneaker, Bryan tried desperately to get the attention of one of the towering titans. He found himself awed by his youthful neighbor's now massive form. Tommy wasn't as tall as Matt, but his body looked like an impressive playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to stop thinking like that,\" Bryan said as he snapped out of his reverie. The giants had moved to the side, preventing the tiny man from seeing them. He continued to hear their loud, disembodied voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I saw a package and envelope on the kitchen table,\" Matt informed the teenager. He led the way into the kitchen and once again took the carton into his hands, but Tommy secured the envelope and removed the cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's eyes narrowed as he saw the money. \"He left that for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tommy said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at the package and saw it was addressed to his and Byan's nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my bro just took up and left town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know,\" Tommy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could save you some trouble,\" Matt said, thinking out loud. \"If Bryan's not here, maybe I should just pay a visit to Zack. I could deliver the package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy folded his fist around the money. \"I don't know. I promised Mr. Smith that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shoe, Bryan yelled for help. \"Tommy! Matt!\" He looked up as Tommy's gigantic form drifted back into view. \"Yes! Down here! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure my brother wouldn't mind.\" Matt didn't look ready to hand over the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants were now back in view. \"Please,\" Bryan screamed as loudly as he could. \"I'm in the shoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith asked me to mail the package.\" Tommy's enormous expression showed stubborn determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolled his eyes, but he handed the package to Tommy. \"Knock yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan continued to rant. \"Tommy, don't go! Don't take the box!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his panicked protest was cut short. Matt's large, tanned arm stretched down as his hand grabbed up his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, caught unready, rolled toward the toe region of the giant shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood on one leg and slipped the sneaker onto his other foot. He then repeated the process with the other shoe. \"So, did my bro leave any word on where he was going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to me,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the shoe, Bryan found the spacious environment extremely cramped as his younger brother's row of enormous toes filled up almost every fraction of space directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Matt began to walk, Bryan was hurled forward to slam against one of the enormous toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed, now feeling a little bad about giving the kid a hard time. He looked at Tommy and offered a ride to the post office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy thought of brushing off the offer, but with the price of gas, why should he shell out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" he answered. But he also shoved the money from the envelope into the front pocket of his jeans.

Nervously, he realized they represented his final hope at regaining normal size and his former life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to get back on his feet as he heard the loud, rumbling words as the titans seemed engaged in a heated discussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go when I am good and ready,\" Tommy said. \"I'm supposed to look after Mr. Smith's home while he is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt yawned. \"Where has my big brother gone, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the giants noticed the little speck making its way out of the kitchen and into the living room, trying to get closer to them without risking any unfortunate consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, it's me,\" he shouted. \"Your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his gigantic sibling didn't hear, he tried again to reach Tommy. The huge teenager, however, kept pacing around the room, bringing his stomping feet far too close for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Help me!\" Bryan shouted, sprinting forward when Tommy paused for a moment. \"It's me! I've shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tommy remained motionless, the speck of a scientist rushed toward the closest sneaker. He reached the thick, tall rubber sole. He beat on the wall of rubber. It might as well have been a wall of solid rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Please!\" The tiny scientist screamed. \"You've got to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy moved again and... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The more the merrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn dismay, the tiny man on the floor listened to a conversation that bode only ill for him and his unusual situation. Having shrunk himself to the size of a bug, the last thing Mr. Smith wanted was a house full of rowdy college students and high school kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after the earlier painful encounter with Tommy's sneaker, the little man restrained the impulse to run back into the open and demand the two giants notice him. He needed a strategy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, come back this evening, and bring all the friends you want,\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Tommy said, excusing himself. After all, Matt was Mr. Smith's brother. How could he get into trouble if Matt decided to throw a party in his big brother's house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith watched as the enormous teenager made his departure. Perhaps, he decided, Tommy's absence was for the best. He might have better luck trying to confront a single giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he needed a plan.

He decided to drive to the house of one of his employed buddies, sure they wouldn't mind springing for some of the necessary items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last second, unnoticed by Matt, a tiny figure darted across the floor toward his socked feet. The giant man padded across his brother's living room, grabbed his shoes and put them back on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the apartment, his shoes slammed down only inches from the little man that had almost ended up only a moment ago plastered beneath one of his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the ordeal his giant sibling was inflicting on him, tiny Mr. Smith wasn't sorry to see him go.

Made of brick, mortar, and heavy logs the store looked picture-perfect in the idyllic camp ground setting. It offered the only bit of civilization offered in the largely untouched woods.

Tantalizing smells of cooking meat wafted from a nearby site, making Matt's stomach rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to ignore a prickling obstruction in his shoe.

Beyond that, monumental trees loomed high into the seemingly limitless sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan narrowly avoided sliding into a deep depression.

Barely able to hold on, he used all his stamina to keep from passing out from hysteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis strength finally failed him and Bryan tumbled painfully from the giant insect's back and landed upon solid ground. He found himself in a cavernous tunnel - light glaring from one end, and blackness gaping from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying alone in the dark, Bryan cried. Fear, trauma, and his once-more lost brother. He looked upwards and shouted weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he settled backwards, detached from his dark surroundings and fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another large, bulky shape scurried past Bryan with little regard to his personal space. The tiny man leaned against the wall, watching. He was both angry and indignant, yet filled with healthy fear of these gigantic bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were beetles - or so he figured. Dozens of legs were barely visible under a canopy of hard, dense plating that made the beasts look like animated rocks instead of common bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Agh-ouch</i>! What are they doing! Get away...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pressed himself harder after nearly ending up beneath one of the sedan-sized creatures. They appeared to be moving in such frantic order and with speed that seemed beyond their abilities. None of them even gave Bryan the slightest regard; not a glance, nor pause, or even a twitch of the antennae. If anything, they appeared to be <i>fleeing</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a loud, gusting swoosh of air intruded upon the space. Bryan snapped his head to look at the entrance and belted out screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearest him, a particularly plump beetle had been trundling past. Bryan gasped when the frightened beast was simply plucked between two massive shapes of hardened skin and pulled from his view out of the tunnel. \"Holy fuck!\" The tiny man gaped at the tunnel, able to see a terrific shape blocking the rays of light. Without warning, the huge beak intruded once more. It crashed into the rough bark with a dull thud before wrenching itself free and descending upon another beetle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light framing whatever it was outside was suddenly blocked, giving Bryan a dim, but definitive view of the monstrous assailant's features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ... a..a...a bird! It's a freaking bird!\" His shrill observations seemed to echo off the hard wood around him. In the darkness, the bird peered inside with huge gibbous eyes that were devoid of anything but instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracting out of sight, the creature returned suddenly, jamming an enormous beak into the tunnel. It nearly maimed the tiny scientist, instead focusing on another insect that attempted sanctuary in the cramped darkness. A small, shrill screech was audible before the massive appendage pulled the helpless bug in and closed around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan slunk down, screaming in complete terror. He now found himself alone in the badly lit tunnel - all the beetles either escaped or devoured; leaving him to the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Afraid, alone, and unable to defend himself, the shrunken man remained coiled in preparation for his fate at the beak of an enormous bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a slight disturbance, Bryan dared a peek from his bundle of limbs. He immediately shrieked. A bulging black orb throbbed at his sudden movement, blinked, and then quickly rotated to allow entrance for a beak big enough to park his car and then some. Looking like the jaws of Hell, Bryan vainly scuttled backwards, trying to escape but ultimately failing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The huge appendage clamped around his leg, and to his horror, began effortlessly pulling his tiny form back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggled, beating his fists against the hard yellow surface. It felt as if it were made of some impossibly strong fiberglass. The beak held his thin leg tightly, pulling him roughly against the gnarled wood and out into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man dangled, his held leg straining from both the pressure of his body and the cruel strength of the gigantic bird. \"I don't want to dieee! God! Anyone, please help me!\" Bryan wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could now make out the entire bird, in all its godzilla-sized glory as it perched against the towering tree. If anything, the terrifying creature was nothing but a mere songbird - rather small, and completely unnoteworthy as far as birds go. It twitched around, attempting to deduce how to effectively swallow the tiny man without losing him. Most prey was swallowed in one bite, but this one proved troublesome as it flailed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird hopped from the tree and glided towards the ground, but failed to realize just how awkward the hold it had upon the tiny man was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aiiiiieeeee</i>!\" Bryan screamed as his leg simply slid loose of the gigantic beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, his minute body was swept up in raging winds caused by the birds flight. He sailed through the air, like a bit of pollen, and after moments of twisting and turning, smacked into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite such a tumultuous fall, Bryan rose up quickly. He searched the skies, frightened at the slightest hint of the dragon-sized bird. Suddenly, an angry chirp roared over the landscape, and Bryan about-faced to see the bird hopping two and fro in search of him. The tiny man fled to a haven of leaves and twigs, hiding himself under their canopy. He watched the monster bird as it pounded around the terrain of forest debris, scouring with globular eyes that seemed inflated with fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly seconds later, the frightening beak opened with another chirp, and the bird snatched up a fleeing ant. Bryan felt himself deflate - all fear, worry, and his impending doom escaping as he watched the satisfied bird lift off with the unlucky bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, thank God!\" He said. The ominous shape of the bird vanished quickly into the endless world of branches high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan allowed himself a respite beneath his cover, but knew he was still in danger. His locale was changed thanks to the blundering beetle, and Bryan knew his chances of finding his brother lessened with every moment wasted. It was vital he found rescue before nightfall - the mere idea of wandering this landscape in the dark, rife with prehistoric-sized creatures, was nothing but blood-curdling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, he padded forward and gazed around. He was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Body still trembling, Bryan couldn't begin to handle his current situation. Here he was: alone, desolate, and more importantly lost in the majesty of nature. This alone would normally be trouble enough to cause any person significant alarm, but tack on the fact Bryan was smaller than a mere ant? He felt near hysterics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe a damn songbird almost ate me!\" He cried to the large twigs and leaves around him. \"God almighty, what the fuck did I do to deserve this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated nature more than ever. It was cruel, dirty, and unfair. A nagging anger lurked inside him for his blundering younger brother. If Matt didn't have to be such a jerk and pop over to Bryan's house uninvited, then all this might have never happened. Bryan would be safely stowed, shipped off to surprise his nephew with such an impossible trick. It had been a sure-fire plan until Matt fucked it up. His grumbles trailed to silence before finishing with a sigh. Matt may have caused this, but he remained Bryan's only possible link in this ungodly maddness. Wherever his brother had gone, Bryan had to find him. Before nightfall, he realized with a swallow. The sort of beastly critters and bugs that lurked these woods then he hoped never to meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with his interior elucidation, the shrunken scientist stood, dusted himself off, and proceeded from his cover of over-sized twigs and dried leaves. The view was anything but beautiful. At such a small angle, the forest looked a monstrous wasteland. Huge leaves lay almost everywhere. Some broken like the facades of a building, while others gracefully shaded large patches of land. Breaking up the monotony lay twigs ranging from sapling size to larger than the tallest redwood. Dusty boulders interjected between both of these, making the terrain rough and treacherous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan saw something else that sparked a flame of hope in his eyes. Far off, almost indescribably so, stood a structure made of concrete and wood, Rustic in appearance by all means, featuring a sign that read, <i>Oakdale Supply Shop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScampering forward, Bryan quickly scaled a rock to get a better view of the distant building. He blinked at the window containing more signs advertising bait, sport gear, and camping equipment. \"Oakdale? Oakdale Campground?\" Bryan could hardly believe it. Yet there it was, the proof that he had in fact been brought to the very place he refused to go as a kid with his brother and father. \"Dammitt, Matt! Only you would walk into my house, fuck up my life, and then strand me here to top it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed deliberate. Bryan knew better of course, but he couldn't help feeling angry. Still, it wouldn't do him any good to keep cursing his luck. He needed to find help and the supply store was a monument of possibilities right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to reach it was daunting. Leaves and twigs seemed to lessen as he approached until it was just a nearly clean expanse of dusty brown dirt. Dunes and rolling hills shaped the dry land, caused by giant campers and their monster vehicles. He breathlessly traversed one, realizing that it was just one impression of many left by an unimaginably huge tire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the smashed remains of a cigarette larger than his house, Bryan checked his progress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ground was soft, unforgivingly soft that each tiny step felt sluggish and all the more exhausting. More than a few times, Bryan paused in order to thrust his head back and gasp. This, or any type of outdoorsy shit, was NOT something Bryan had any skill or taste for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet what else could he do? The intertwining threads of fate had seen fit to remove Bryan from his constructed plan and relocate him to the middle of nowhere. Tommy and his dumbass younger brother their tools. This was all their fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hill rose before him. He crested it, only to see more seemingly endless dirt-dunes, and looking back to see his trail of pinprick footsteps marking his journey. Nobody would see them, he thought with a frown. Too small. Too damn small. Why did he make himself this fucking small? The regret floated for a moment before Bryan relented, knowing full well why he chose such a diminutive stature when concocting his miraculous formula. Deep down, Bryan liked this size -- he even loved it. Well, in a sort-of superficial way one might love their most terrifying fantasy. Now it just seemed insane. A bulky black ant scurried over a neighboring dune, quickly pacing up the next before vanishing from sight. Not even vehicle-sized ants bothered him at this point. They only annoyed him. Their many legs, seemingly limitless stamina and strength. Nature had a way of adapting, and the genius man was anything but adaptable. But nature be fucked. If he could shrink himself, then sure as shit he could do something about his physical prowess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant, but startling noise brought Bryan's attention to his distant destination. From a massive doorway emerged a huge man carrying a bag in one hand and a plastic scoop in the other. Bryan felt his skin prickle, both excitement and anxiety at the sight of even such a distant, but gargantuan human being. Watching his vast legs move with slow, exaggerated animation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much longer before I get some damn attention! This guy looks good as any!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth statements seemed stale as the silty landscape ate his squeaky words up. He did feel pretty confident about getting the attention he deserved -- and then showing his irresponsible prick of a brother a thing or two. That should be easy enough. \"This guy\" was some stranger, though. His huge features mostly indiscernible at this distance. With slow, lumbering steps the giant man walked from the building, paused to spit out something on the ground, and continued towards a mulchy pile of dark dirt set against a nearby tree. Bryan stumbled down another dune, wanting to get closer and see. He quickly moved up the next one. The giant was now crouched, scooping dirt into shallow containers one-by-one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing?\" Came the unheard question out of the tiny man's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant was both too far and oblivious to hear, and instead merely finished one last scoop before depositing the container back into his bag. Then he rose back up, slowly like some mammoth force out of a space movie, and began stomping back to the supply shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched, annoyed that the titan had not remained to wait for him. That left the tiny scientist back to his journey -- back to his arduous, endless walking. He kept on, padding up, down, and over dune after dune. Just an hour or so later, he had a legitimate close call when a dark shadow swept over the land. It was easily mistaken for a dragon, which sent Bryan into comical defensive measures that belonged to the brainless peasants of a sword-and-magic story. He glanced up, realizing it was another bird, yet then doubled himself down with a yelp. Not again. Not another fucking bird. One close call was more than enough and made any dragon out of fairytale sound fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flew away, pecking up some unlucky insects, utterly unaware of the exotic meal of tiny human close-by. Returning to the vast heavens above. Bryan sighed and resumed his trek with an eye constantly turned to the distant heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log and stone building slowly but completely became the horizon. It loomed like a mountain at first, high enough to block out light and sky as the minuscule man traveled closer and closer. The terrain changed as well. Instead of rolling dunes, it flattened out somewhat roughly, populated loosely with boulders and plant life. Huge flattened cigarettes and normally tiny debris stood out, looking more post-apocalyptic than anything. Bryan also confirmed what he had thought before, that he had somehow ventured to the backside of the building and not the front. Huge garbage cans towered near an even taller door that was kept slightly ajar by a boulder. Opposing that vista was the rugged mountain of soil that he saw earlier, now appearing more like looming tundra and hills. It was odd, Bryan wondered, and the fact the gigantic man had been scooping from it was even more curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime wasn\u2019t quite on his side, but surely an excursion wouldn\u2019t hurt after all that walking? He was tiny for a reason afterall: to satisfy curiosities (among other things). What should he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Did anything else really matter right now? Bryan wiped his forehead, knowing full well that any other excursion would like waste precious time and his (very) limited stamina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, he sniffed suspiciously, the air wafting from that direction wasn\u2019t exactly tantalizing. It smelled like compost or at least something earthy and gross like that. He decided to progress his journey and head for rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRescue from that place. All he could do was gaze up at the towering portal that denoted what was only a backdoor into the building. It barely looked like a door. Bryan couldn\u2019t quite justify applying that banal word to such an entrance. It was propped open via a boulder that looked like an entire peak torn from the Rockies. High up in stark proclamation was a sign that read \u201cEMPLOYEES ONLY\u201d. Those words might have deterred the tiny man before, but it seemed anything his size or comparable was exempt of this rule, as proved by noticeable buzzing specks that entered and exited at their leisure. He gulped, but kept up his minuscule approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before a steep mound of dirt crusted metal, which was merely part of the weather strip making up the threshold, Bryan clamored over and entered a new world. The outside had made Bryan feel small. That creepy vertigo experience that happened when viewing the Grand Canyon or the enormity of any natural wonder. Now he saw such vast monuments of far greater scale than those and all created by things Bryan would normally be familiar with. Counters and shelves looming up and up, and still higher up. A cement floor that spanned out for daunting miles, coated with dirt and grime like any regular landscape might. And to make this all somewhat comical, it had the definite look of any dated interior of a backwoods truck stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere begins the next part of my \"<i>fantastic</i>\" journey...I should be keeping notes!\u201d he said, scoffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud continuous noise throbbed through the air, detectable as it even pulsed through the ground itself. The more Bryan heard, he recognized it as mere background music, rock or something similar, now exaggerated to a degree only mother nature enjoyed during a thunderstorm. He could also hear what resembled voices. Deep and powerful, and far off. Deciding to find their source, Bryan headed towards the nearest counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLining each towering shelf were shallow styrofoam containers, looking at this point like mammoth industrial canisters. By all means, not the least bit impressive but for their enormity. Each one had billboard-sized strips of tape plastered on the sides with rough marker-written names denoting their contents that made Bryan uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEARTH WORMS\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMEALIES\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUGS\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were over a dozen of them filling the shelf, all placed together with their respective labels. If he tried, the lowest shelf was even accessible to something as tiny as Bryan. He could reach them. Tiny as he was, Bryan tried to fathom the monster-sized earthworms, meal worms, and whatever bugs contained within each huge styrofoam prison. Each one could hold enough to populate a continent. All together, it seemed as if there would be enough to populate a planet. One of the containers mark \u201cBugs\u201d had been breached, dirt streaming out with stray ants or beetles escaping like animals from a twisted zoo. It occurred to him that most of these tinier bugs might be innocent collateral -- scooped up with larger victims fated for a cruel end on a barbed hook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaint noises could be heard from the \u201cmealies\u201d containers. \u201cI hate worms. Huh...better you guys stay in there than out here!,\u201d he said, feeling tinier than ever. Those \u201cbait\u201d worms were undoubtedly humongous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also enjoyed the benefit of an answer to his earlier curiosity. The giant he had seen earlier and what he had been doing and the purpose of that strange earthy mound. It was definitely a compost pile and the guy had been filling these containers with worms and other creepy crawlies for sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky I didn\u2019t venture there! Gross worms and bugs...and what if he had come back to get more?\u201d Bryan said, faltering at the last part as he nervously considered the fate of these imprisoned creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this environment seemed any better to the tiny man. He had made zero progress since he had been here and the place frankly disgusted him. The floor looked like the aftermath of a tornado, bits of debris strewn around and fallen rubbish that went unnoticed to whomever cleaned this place. Adding to the atmosphere was stale, humid air that reeked of cigarettes and fish musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh my god\u2026\u201d He said, recoiling in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot pulled back, dislodging from what at first glance seemed like further smashed grime but was clearly the smashed, congealed remains of an insect. It smelled too. Bryan seemed to recall reading at some point that insects gave off some sort of scent or something. This one was barely recognizable in such a state of obliteration. Whatever it had been, it was far larger than the shrunken scientist and had been literally flattened as if it were nothing. He looked at other stains, both dark and light, dotting the cement terrain with apprehensive eyes. What had they once been? Alive? Genius or not, it surely did bode well for Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, what had been minor disruptions became louder and clearer, rumbling from somewhere high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...ALRIGHT...WHAT BRAND YOU LOOKIN\u2019 FOR? CAMEL...SPIRIT\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan understood them, yet they seemed nonsensical and distorted. Not meant for his microscopic ears. The ground quaked, shuddering slightly as an enormous figure loomed around the counter. For but a moment, Bryan tried to comprehend what he saw, but instead gawked dumbly. Towering legs seemed to be all this behemoth was from his teeny vantage point. The huge pants capped enormous black sneakers. On suddenly shifted, lifting and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BOOOM</i></b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny speck of a scientist was sent reeling, scampering in the tumultuous wake as one colossal black sneaker slammed down nearby. Dust and dirt sprinkled around, upset by the crash landing. Another slightly duller impact was felt as the second landed. Any flooring once before Bryan had been cut off beneath an immense wall of dark, coal-gray rubber sole and high up sheer mountainside of black suede. He could hear it shifting, adjusting, groaning under what must be immeasurable weight before it lifted, loudly peeling off the floor and rising into the air. The underside became visible: tan colored lugs with what looked to be large letters spelling out some brand stretching across. Chunks of large debris crumbled free, falling in the wake as the enormity soared off, thundering over huge amounts of land in search of another crash site. Where what previously was dirty, but otherwise barren floor was now lined with dusty dirt, dried flora, and other shit dislodged and left behind. Something twisted and dark moved, bits of what looked to be legs and carapace protruding from a mangled mess of dirt and guts. Bryan gaped, feeling sick. A dull rumble took his attention and in the distance was the other black mountain, shifting before it pulled off the floor, following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched them, daring his vision upwards in order to better identify the force of nature he nearly ended up beneath. It wasn't human. All he could comprehend were gargantuan, towering columns that stretched higher than Bryan could properly conceive into the sky. Two huge monoliths of rugged brown material, cargo pockets big enough to contain entire cities stitched on the sides, ending with those enormous bulky sneakers. He could stand to discern more, but he already knew -- it had to be that guy he saw earlier, the same dude stomping around outside to scoop up more bait. Same guy who\u2019s bad handwriting was sharpied on those tape labels. The same guy who\u2019s dirty footwear tracked in all this dirt, crushed plant matter, and pulverized arthropodal fauna that was invisible to him but littered the landscape. Back then, the giant seemed identifiable, but now....fucking now....Bryan had no idea anything, much less a fellow human, could be this fucking big. Fucking huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was supposed to get his titan\u2019s attention and expect rescue? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard more thunder from above, more speech. He shambled back, straining his eyes to perceive the distant face: grinning at someone Bryan couldn\u2019t see, a swarthy face, the kind that belongs to somebody who enjoys the outdoors, would want to live and run a camp supply store. The kind of guy who would help you change a tire with a smile, but sooner swat down a gnat or fly without a second thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stark, literally cold reality began setting in. How the hell was Bryan going to get any meaningful attention from some-...-<i>thing</i>...this gargantuan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta try for chrissakes. It-....uh\u2026.<i>He</i> is my only option!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t pause to think when the huge camp supply owner finished the transaction, looming high above a world unnoticed by him. Acutely aware of his own utter insignificance, Bryan broke through his intense flight instinct and ran out, waving his arm and bounding ostentatiously. Anything to be more visible against the enormous dusty floor. Screaming all the while with enough force and emotion to make any ant-sized opera company proud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeeeeree! Dooooooowwwwnnnnnn\u2026-<i>gasp</i>-...heeeeeeeerreeee! Heeeelppp meee!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope filled Bryan as he sprinted, waving and screaming. This was it! Or was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Was it divine intervention that gave Bryan the super-human stamina, or just pure adrenaline? He wasn't sure. It allowed him to sprint forward and scream with such ferocity that this had to be the climactic end of his outlandish journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, \"the climactic end\" could go completely different than what the shrunken genius wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere speck upon a vast, barren wasteland of concrete, squeaking and squealing with such high-pitched vocal chords that the sound was all but entirely inaudible to the looming, oblivious behemoth of a man. The ground shuddered, a dull crash following the concussive shift of one huge sneaker that moved mere inches. Attention turned to the other sneaker, which groaned beneath intense weight, the colossal man adjusting his weight in preparation for movement. His shrunken sprint for rescue faltered, tiny feet skidding and changing direction. A literal mountain rose off the floor, lifted high by an endless tower of leg that directed the huge sneaker towards Bryan\u2019s location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed in vain for any shred of attention, but all he received was the distant jawline of a massive being utterly oblivious and incomprehensible in size. Then the sky was absorbed completely, dark shadow utterly drenching an enormous acreage of floor with one unnoticed speck of humanity lost within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge square lugs crossed with an aggressive S-Trac design soared above, crafted from dulled tan rubber, worn down as it framed the huge bold logo \u201cGLOBE\u201d spanning from seemingly across the entirety.  Boulders both larger and smaller than Bryan disfigured the hard rubber lugs, wedged among cemented dirt and horrifically smashed, pulverized insects that were embedded and dotted the canyonesque tread like bodies tangled on a battlefield. As a whole, it was simply too big to visualize at once. A nightmarish upside-down world looming overhead, all on display like a vast graveyard to would-be victims below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it descended. Heel first, contorting Bryan\u2019s minuscule perspective as it slammed down with roaring, concussive impact. Huge gaps in the worn lugs zoomed closer, becoming defined as Bryan was immediately absorbed beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if swept beneath a mountain slide, the shrunken man\u2019s body was forced to fit between a debris-ridden space, held tight by harsh, chalky dirt around his legs, something chunky and squishy around his head, and the rest pressed hard against rigid, abrasive rubber. Air pressure increased, enough to make his ears pop and head throb painfully. Pressure all over. And warmth, which surprised him in his shocked state. Warmth radiated from above, creating an even more uncomfortable environment. It was too much. Bryan felt his body trembling, nearing convulsions as he panicked. His screams were unreal, feeling like something out of a dream. Tears, mucus, spit pooling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a human being. A genius among them! No. Not anymore, it seemed. Now...what was he truly? What had he done to himself? Reduced to yet another of many unnoticed insects...lives...that ended up beneath this huge, towering, behemoth's vast skate shoe? His fantasies and ridiculous dreams kept hitting Bryan like cruel icy waves. This unknown titan didn't even know Bryan existed. How could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hope the tiny man might have retained was being squeezed out of him like a sponge. The pressure, weight, pain only worsened: the weight increased, signaled by deep, powerful groans from above his horrific prison. Bryan felt a heavy, dull vibration rattle the floor before-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Sccccrrrrraaaallllllccccchhhh</i></b>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet at first, getting louder as the intense weight seemed to lessen and lift. Louder and louder, then Bryan felt the impossibly dense rubber seem to flex before the cement pressing into him from below pulled away. Air rushed through, light pouring in. Bryan gasped, immediately following with a scream. The ground kept pulling further away, his head spinning and ears ringing with the roaring squelch as the treads lifted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s lungs sucked in less than he screamed out, utterly and completely absorbed with panic.</span></div></div>",

It was working, bits of debris crumbled around him, joining a varied shower dislodging all over the vast tread. Bryan felt his body shifting, one leg freed and dangling, then another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem with this: he was now many dozen feet in the air, rising fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used a free arm to grab at some smashed debris around his head. It felt hard, even hairy beneath his fingers. Clutching it for a moment before it too shifted, cracking with a gooey snap. Something large came with it, and Bryan hung on as both he and what he held onto dangled free for a moment, his eyes locking with what seem a glassy crystalline gaze set in a mutilated mask of dark greasy armor. An alien -- some kind of monster out of science fiction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo -- A fucking ant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both fell free, dropping into gusty freefall to the world below as the enormous Globe sneaker loomed above, rising higher and higher with the roaring winds. The fall lasted mere moments. Bryan\u2019s screams painfully cut off with a dull impact upon hard concrete. His breath was knocked out, allowing only sporadic gasps while he watched what resembled industrial topography of deep geometric ravines soar far overhead. It flashed memories of the huge spaceships from space films, rushing over the viewer with the intensity of a hurricane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan read the mammoth letters boldly cast in dark, dusty rubber as they rushed overhead: G....L....O\u2026.B\u2026.E. One fucking word that for some reason made this all the more terrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further fanfare, like the tail-end of a huge plane as it took off, it was gone. Soaring off in the distance at an alarming, yet seemingly sluggish rate. Then the ground lurched and the air shuddered with a concussive boom as it slammed down. Moments later, the second followed and again...and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, Bryan had to remind himself that he just experienced was nothing but this titanic man walking. Simply taking a step. A fucking step. It made him shake all the more. The amount of god-like power and destructive force behind it absolutely jellied his mind. This man; This otherwise regular guy was an absolute force of nature, an omnipotent being that seemed incapable of anything but capricious destruction. More despotic god than anything Bryan could have ever related to. Bryan was nearly killed....atomized beneath what seemed more mountain than footwear. Murdered, and yet would it have been murder? Was he substantial enough to garner such a crime?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shuddered again, feeling duller quakes through the ground from the now unseen giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done to myself\u2026.? Oh my god\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust next to him lay Bryan\u2019s tread-mate. He scuttled away from the sickeningly effaced ant splayed before him. It curdled Bryan\u2019s blood as the most horrifying sight he\u2019d ever seen. All gore and guts. Far worse than the dried smear he had stepped in before -- this one had been alive recently. Doing weird, pointless, but living ant business before it was reduced to a crushed, eviscerated mess of body parts looking more at home in a Cronenberg film than real life. And Bryan could have easily ended up the same way. Only by some twist of fate had he chanced to be wedged between the massive rubber treads and not atomized beneath like so many other tiny creatures. He had been lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now? Bryan trembled, ignoring further sounds of the oblivious store owner moving far off. Any and all contact with that monster seemed insane. Bryan was simply too tiny and that hulking fucker was too big. What was plan B?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The giant was coming back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning with all his might, the diminished scientist managed to put himself against the base of the mountainous counter nearby. Where, Bryan hoped, he would be safe. Bits of larger debris seemed to confirm this hope, chunks of rock, dirt, and other more organic pieces having collected here over time. All an unknown audience to the titanic passage of an in-cognizant behemoth whose massive sneakers obliterated anything foolish enough to venture out. The ground quaked harshly as one landed close-by, absorbing the horizon beneath a mass of dark rubber and looming over like an industrial mountain of filthy suede and stained nubuck. Rolling notes of thunder cascaded from higher than Bryan could see, noting what he realized must be a simple conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever plan B was, he needed to figure it out quick before the clueless dude flattened him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if plucked from the scroll of tropes, the subject dangled like a stretch of highway off a mountain. Constructed of synthetic fibers intertwining to create a large flat cable of dark steel that hung vertically from high above. A shoe lace, by any other name. Pros and cons rushed over his genius brain all at once. It something, to be sure, but a plan? Running up to that fucking thing? What if it moved before he got hold? What if\u2026 Bryan cursed himself. He could \u201cwhat if\u201d all day long and still be lost and in danger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it! Getting off of the floor was the best thing he could do right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stifled war cry, he bolted out and towards the colossal enormity barely associated with a shoe. It seemed as if the journey swept past, as Bryan found himself nearing the enormous rugged rubber base, dried mud and plant matter staining the textured surface. Indicative of the locale this behemoth lived in. The target grew larger and larger as well, living up to the comparison of a highway and surpassing it. The end encased in a huge plastic tube, cracked and crumbling with age and everyday abuse. Despite his stupefied curiosity, the minuscule scientist wasted no time. Rushing past the aglet and gripping the massive weaves making up the even larger lace. Each micro-weave seemed as large as himself. Hard and steely, stained with grime and oil scraped loose from towering fingers, and teeny chunks of soil having embedded itself at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt exhilarated. This was far, far beyond his comfort zone, but the thrill of adventure with an end made him almost giddier than frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above the tiny man\u2019s adventure, the colossus who cluelessly ruled over the unseen world below finished with the customer and chanced to look down. He looked past debris and microbial bits beneath his notice and instead locked on to his untied left shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach tiny hand dug into the thick weave easily, transporting him higher and higher up the now vertical mass of shoe lace. It seemed possible. All of these impossible odds suddenly seemed lighter and more in his favor. Something disturbed the usual movements and groans exhibited by the giant and his stationary shoe. From above descended living towers of flesh, splayed out in dramatic exaggeration as they seemingly fell upon Bryan and his location. Massive and rugged, one rushed underneath while another crashed down from above. His defense was but to lock in, choke up, and beg girlishly. The landmass of a thumb positioned close-by, any nearer and Bryan would have been smashed beneath. He had never seen fingers up close. Above all, they appeared as rounded formations, lined ruggedly lined and patterned with ridges designed over millennia by mother nature. Like the mantle of earth, huge splits and cracks decorated it, packed with oily deposits of skin flakes, dirt. The worst was the smell. Bryan gasped, realizing it smelt of chewing tobacco and sweat. Perhaps something else. It looked and smelled fucking in-human. Above this was a discolored keratin shelf that reminded him of rocky outcroppings, jutting out and imprisoning hard-packed grime, decaying skin cells, and microbial stalks of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the familiar feeling of helplessness and animalistic terror returned. What had appeared to be an immovable mass of shoelace began rising in the air, lifted by such god-like digits that it seemed effortless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. He needed to relocate pronto, if he wanted to live. One shrill announcement left his tiny lips and Bryan flung himself from the huge lace and against the calloused surface of the colossal thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOohhhhhhhh shiiiiiiiiiiiittt!\u201d Cried the tiny grappler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shut tighter than a virgin\u2019s legs and hands disgustingly clutched against oily calloused skin, Bryan endured the movements best he could. The rocking sensations lessened, instead becoming pure vertigo. Bryan began kicking his feet against the warm, rock-like skin. For naut, it seemed. Bryan was too tiny or this titanic dude\u2019s callouses were too thick. Maybe both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand rushed like a meteor through the air, allowing Bryan fleeting moments to view the colossus above it all. Large glazed, uncaring eyes look elsewhere upon a teratoid face of unfathomable size. Alien trees coated the upper regions, sandy-gold in color and thick like redwoods. The swarthy skin was stressed around the eyes and mouth, like ridged geography viewed from a plane, and striking Bryan that this behemoth probably had a warm, friendly smile. All viewing was cut off as the large hand rotated, showing a new landscape a fair distance below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse of all, Bryan felt his grip lessen as G-forces seemed intent on dislodging him. </span></div></div>",

The smell equally took a toll on the tiny scientist's senses, as the dried, smashed leaves still kept a potency that hung thick in the air. Bryan rubbed his face, trying his best to keep dirt and grime off, but finding it impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted nothing more than his uneventful life as a scientist at EDL Labs. This was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in cleaner air as the mess of smashed cigarette fell behind, Bryan allowed himself to daydream in order to escape his turmoil. He marched along. Relatively undisturbed by any other obstacles besides the wildly churned dirt hills and dunes created by gigantic campers and their vehicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan allowed himself to idly think about things: Tommy, his beloved neighbour. Who by now was sending off an empty package, none the wiser. His favourite day-time show. A guilty pleasure, but one he kept up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of the skies and the huge creatures that occupied it never breaching his pleasant reverie. As long as the ground didn't start up, there was no danger, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched upon a branch, far far up from the leaf-strewn ground below was a pudgy bird. A lovely blue colour washed across the feathers, turning a warm yellow near the bird's thin black legs. It twittered a likewise black beak, bobbing a deft head to and fro with two shining eyes that captured any movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a common starling. A year-round resident of these forests. Pleasant to look at, delightful to hear - that is, unless you happen to be an insect or the size of one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing up and down the branch, the starling snapped up a few stray ants that ventured too close. The tiny insects wriggled down and joined an already large array of victims waiting in the dank gizzard. They would soon be easily reduced to digestible paste by bits of sand that ground anything organic deposited inside. The starling chirped happily. It shuffled further, spying another ant that was quickly dispatched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy chance, the rotund bird peered off the branch towards the ground below. A world of leaves, rocks, bushes, and dirt was layed out and filled with numerous goodies that might tantalize the bird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something did tantalize. A small speck of movement far below in the dirt, barely viewable by something with such keen vision such as a starling. With a giddy chirp, the starling was off and descending towards the foolish insect below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScuffing down another dune, Bryan grumbled more about dirt and how much he hated it. His pleasant daydreams had long since failed him. Instead replacing with grueling boredom as Bryan crossed another rough inclined making up a small fraction of print left by a large truck only hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he gazed up, preparing to stomp up yet another steep hill that he saw the shadow drench both him and the surrounding region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked up to see the dark outline of a monstrous beast swooping through the skies. He stumbled back, confused and frightened. It took only a moment for the gigantic beast to make contact with the ground. Dirt blasted outwards beneath the large, scaled feet that slammed against the earth with a hefty thud. Bryan screamed. His cry was outdone by a terrible shriek from the monster above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunging back, he narrowly avoided a beak belonging to said monster. It crashed down, burying into the dirt not 10 feet from the tiny man. Bryan scream again, looking up the length of hard calcium and spotting a bulging black void of wet eyeball. The globular mass rotated wetly, locking onto Bryan with such fury and desire to almost drain his entire body of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh..oh! FUCK!\" He squealed at the monstrous bird. The beak pulled back lifting back into the air above the minuscule scientist. This monster was well over a hundred feet and seemed more mythical dragon than bird. Throwing his arm out, waggled it defensively. \"Back! G..g...get back! Away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncaring bird craned a huge head in order to gaze at Bryan once more. Heavy thuds rocked the tiny man as the massive creature positioned itself to better snatch him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShimmying on his ass, he screamed as the massive beak descended once more. Quicker than he could ever have liked, it snapped around him and lurched skywards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tumbled about the hard, warm interior violently. Screaming, grabbing, clawing. His hand came into contact with a thick, slimy mass larger than himself which he attempted to latch upon. It only aided in his folly, as he felt the dark death trap jerk forwards and the warm muscle lift upwards to slide Bryan's tiny form deeper in. One more scream was afforded before he slapped against a muscly wall and abruptly slid downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking shit! Oh my fucking-stick-of-shitting-fuck-fuck!\" He couldn't believe this. It happened to quick; too abruptly. He was being swallowed by a fucking bird! \"Fuck, fuck, fuck-...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without any ceremony, Bryan fell through more utter darkness and landed in tumultuous sludge of chunky, acrid paste. Pieces of god-knows-what pressed around him at all angles. Some were sharp, others blunt, and some prickly with hairs. Then the smell was enough to sedate Bryan out of his mind. It was a mixture of vile house cleaner, and something akin to shit. Worst than this sensory assault was the utter hopelessness Bryan felt. There was no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God....why!\" Prayed the defeated man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather suddenly a squishy gurgle could be heard and his hellish prison seemed to begin churning. As if to herald this wonder of nature, Bryan heard a dull, throaty chirping high above. He planned to curse it when something segmented and lined with hairs brushed past his face. His digust was brief before a suddenly blunt force crashed into him from behind. It shoved him with seemingly angry intent before he contacted another such object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shrieked as the two masses of rough stone rubbed against his soft body in different directions as they attempted to pass each other. They succeded only when Bryan's frail spine snapped and his left limb tore off at the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore revolutions followed: more hard stones impacted him to break his body further and rend it apart. Other bits of carapace and limb jabbed and skewered the doomed scientist. All in utter, soul-sapping, tormenting darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan finished with a gurgling cry before succumbing to liquidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily batting both of it's lovely blue wings, the starling ascended from the ground. It dained to land a few meters away. Some campers with their children pointed at the charming little bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See it? That's a starling, kids. Look at him walk about with his little feet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starling waddled around, allowing itself to be surveyed by the campers. It chirped playfully at the children, bouncing around. When they broke off to get closer, the starling coyly took to the sky once more. Swooping atop their vehicle, it watched them and waited for digestion. Inside the endearing little bird was a whirl of insect (and human) paste being quickly absorbed by a fast metabolism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the starling took flight again. Sweeping over a campsite, it passed over the supply shop and promptly released a warm, white glob of shit from a dainty asshole hidden by lovely blue feathers. The shit hurtled towards the ground and splatted wetly on the hat of one camper exiting the shop.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" Matt cried out after both feeling and hearing the impact on his head. An Icee in one-hand, he used the other to touch the offending force. It was warm and had noticeably chunky little bits mixed inside. None of which Matt bothered to peer closer and notice their unusual resemblance to human bones. \"Fuck! Bird poop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping it off, he glared upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on...God, why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt the hard wood beneath his shudder in response to the humongous bird outside. The light from outside the entrance suddenly became eclipsed, causing Bryan to shriek at the bulging black eye that peered inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a huge boulder, glossy and black like the darkest ink as if searched the gnarled interior for more prey. Locking onto the tiny, pale form that trembled inside, the huge eye throbbed greedily, blinked, and retracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of grace allowed the shrunken man to wipe his tears. Hoping the beastly bird had left, Bryan struggled to his feet. His muscles shook, causing him to gasp fitfully between sniffles. \"Is...Is it over...?\" He barely questioned before the light blocked out once more and his sniffling became a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's pitiable cry barely escaped before a beak the size of his garage crashed forward and snapped shut around his flailing form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracting from the twisted hole, the bird raised a sleek head upwards. With an arching motion, it swallowed the captured prey without thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interesting insect wriggled down, offering only slightly more resistance than the beetles did. All sensation ceased when the creature passed the esophagus and settled inside the bird's now pleasantly full stomach, mingling with the ants and beetles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddily chirping, the bird pushed off from the tree and swept into the sky on graceful wings. It ducked low, passing over a grumbling truck just pulling into the vacant site. The bird banked, and sped upwards. Another bird of the same variety flew by with a challenging twitter, egging the bird to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth went sweeping through the clean forest air, chirping and tweeting with the endearing innocence of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The surface below him shifted again, this time emitting an angry grunt that caused the tiny man to squeak in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" He began when the knobby surface he stood on seemed to slide. Suddenly, a pair of antennae thick as telephone poles whipped into view. \"I need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanning to slide off gracefully, Bryan stumbled towards the edge. He took care with each step, but found himself falling when the huge creature began moving. The bug-man was flung rudely, twirling through the air like some forsaken toy doll and crashing against an incline of sandy dirt. \"<i>Oof</i>!\" It was a hard landing, but Bryan recovered quickly when he saw the cause of all this disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! It's huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive beetle rose from a cover of dirt, twigs, and crunched leaves. Waving both antennae, it released a guttural roar as if to reassure the shrunken man his place in the world. Then, as quickly as it did, the landscape-turned-beetle crashed over a large rock and made off into the huge forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan just remained on his butt - staring in the direction the huge bug went. \"<i>Fuck</i>,\" He said, both terrified and incredulous. \"I mean, just seriously, <i>fuck</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until the coast remained clear for a reasonable amount of time and the hugely magnified sounds of nature were all he heard. Standing up, the tiny man looked around. Debris surrounded him on all ends; massive leaves both broken and intact sloped over hill and dale like stadium canopies. Rocks both large and small littered in between twigs bigger than the tree that shed them, while the occassion bit of trash stood out like an object from space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew that he needed to traverse this unpalatable landscape if he wanted to find help and avoid an encounter far worse than the insulted beetle. He needed to find Matt!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huge trees, bigger than anything Bryan could hope to compare, stretched endlessly into the sky. Rocks, twigs, and smaller fauna of mega proportions populated the immediate landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a frighteningly alien world to the tiny man, who had rarely ventured out of the city before this. Nature was just a boring trifle to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do I do now?\" He said himself, trying to keep his emotions under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could wait for Matt to return. On the other hand, what if Matt didn't come back? Bryan couldn't stand here all night! Help wasn't going to find him, he needed to seek it out himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him stretched the bumpy, rolling expanse of sandy dirt that made up what was likely a path. It continued out of sight in either direction for miles, leading to God knows where. Bryan clasped his hands pensively as he tried to think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose suddenly detected a pleasant aroma. The shrunken man whipped his head around and sniffed curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food!\" He exclaimed. \"Meat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low grumble emitted from his stomach, reminding him that he hadn't eaten for many hours. The sumptuous scent seemed to be coming from behind him, away from the ominous pathway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody is cooking food.\" Bryan said with an excited swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about his brother, the tiny man began stumbling through the thick brush towards the source. He found himself surrounded by tall blades of dried grass that surrounded him like a mini forest. As he continued, he began to hear distant noises. Low, exagerated voices, and what sounded like rumbling music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan noted these noises, thinking that not only would he get food, but also rescue from whomever was preparing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tantalizing aroma fueled excitement in his tiny body. He passed under a huge leaf, passed many building-sized pebbles, and scrambled over twigs that resembled fallen trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exited the grass forest through the large curled leaves of a weed to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just before the two could really get into it, a taller figure appeared from the tree line and pushed between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d he said loudly, casually shoving them aside. Luke stumbled a moment before turning around, \u201cFuck you Andrew!\u201d he glowered. His cousin waved off Luke\u2019s anger dismissively and dropped into a folding chair between the tent and fire pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoys!\u201d came a concerned warning from the man at the grill. \u201cDon\u2019t kill each other just \u2018cause you think I\u2019m not looking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m on your side Uncle Adam!\u201d Andrew replied innocently as he fished his phone out of his pocket. There was a heavy sigh from the grill, \u201cHow \u2018bout you guys find some firewood for tonight?\u201d Adam suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke ambled towards the fire pit, \u201cWe already did that!\u201d he shot back unhappily as he settled into a chair across from Andrew. Jake grunted in agreement as he crawled into the tent, presumably to start playing on his Gameboy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke scanned the clearing his family had set up camp in. It sat mostly in shade, with warm summer light streaming through the branches. Healthy green shrubs lined the packed dirt of the clearing. Coloring dotted the bushes where flowers and berries grew. Unfortunately the beauty of the scene was lost on him, as well as his cousin and brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching his legs in front of him, Luke glared down at his brand new Nike Air Force Ones. The blue and white sneakers were already covered in a layer of dirt after only having been here a few hours. He could think of a million places he\u2019d rather be. Not that he didn\u2019t like the outdoors. But to be there with his least favorite cousin and his lazy brother made it less than ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan peered around a towering blade of grass and yelped in terror as a ship-sized blue basketball sneaker slammed down in front of him, kicking up a cloud of dust. Accompanied by a monstrous roar, a white Nike Shox sailed overhead, dirt raining from its exposed sole. Bryan, fearing for his safety, cowered pathetically behind a boulder-like pebble. The thunderous noises ended abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, Bryan could see two pairs of massive sneakers pounding away from him. To his right, flattened stalks of grass were slowly regaining their shape after being stepped on by one of the behemoths. Walking beneath a twig, Bryan tried to better study the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of titans had set up a campsite in a dirt clearing amongst impossibly tall trees. It consisted of a tent, and four folding chairs around a fire pit. Judging from the fact all four had blonde hair, Bryan assumed it was a family outing. One stood at the grill, facing away from Bryan and the other three. He was dressed in a simple green t-shirt and jeans, wearing a pair of battered tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the giants sat across from each other, divided by the fire pit. The taller one was wearing an Abercrombie t-shirt and plaid cargo shorts with a pair of clean, white Nike Shox. His chiseled face had an arrogant smirk as he tapped away on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one had his long legs stretched in front of him. He clearly towered over 6 feet, thousands of feet for tiny Bryan. His flowing t-shirt and basketball shorts matched his bright blue and white Nike Air Force Ones. His steely gaze was focused on his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sign of the fourth giant at this point were his feet, protruding from the tent flap. His black shoe soles faced upwards, indicating he was lying on his stomach. Bryan could just barely see the word VANS written in red against the gray side of the shoe. He shuddered as he realized he could recognize the pulverized remains of a beetle trapped in the tread of the exposed sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems I have a couple options for help\u2026\u201d Bryan muttered to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From his little hideaway in the outlying grass, Bryan peered at the scene before him. Across the stretch of packed, dry dirt, sat the closest giant. His enormous body was settled onto a folding canvas chair like a god upon a throne. Bryan glanced once more at the other visible giants. One stood at the grill, even from behind looking to be many years older than the two that were seated near the fire pit. The last was still settled in one of the tents, only his dust-covered sneakers were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one is closest,\" Bryan noted nervously. \"and he is looking at the ground. He'll surely see me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant in question continued an idle downward gaze. Steely blue eyes, coupled with his light hair and eyebrows, made him a naturally appealing sight. Bryan stepped forth from his meager cover, glancing back at the flattened grass that still creaked back to shape. He turned back with a gulp and prepared to make contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling ridges and indentations in the dirt made the tiny man's travel difficult. Only after stumbling over many circular slopes did he realize what had been the cause. Tread prints. The entire site was covered in similar prints: the circular Air Force style, the waffle Vans tread, and the ridged pattern left by the other two. It gave a tingling down Bryan's spine, reminding him just how tiny he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth of a guy loomed closer. Bryan approached, glistening with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoredom gnawed at Luke's consciousness. He brooded idly, looking vacantly at his white and blue Nike Air Force One sneakers. Almost a month had passed since he bought them, and only now did they seem to show any sign of wear. His brow furrowed slightly at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been compelled, along with his brother, to go for a family outing. His father insisted it would be an \"adventure\", as well as \"something worth doing\". Luke wouldn't have minded that half as much had the presence of his cousin Andrew not been included in the package. The mere memory made the teenager sigh in annoyance, shifting his large feet in the grainy dirt. He then noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if his sight suddenly shifted into focus, Luke saw tiny movement at his feet. He realized amongst the dirt and pebbles between his sneakers, minutely sized black ants had been foraging. Luke's sneakers had inadvertently smashed most of the scuttling insects when he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly amused, Luke decided to entertain himself. He moved his blue and white high top: lifting one over a couple of the ants and crushing them, and shifting the other to grind more of them out. Insects, small as they were, rarely garnered notice from the tall teenager. In a boring pinch such as this, the insignificant bugs would provide him with some entertainment. Sliding his Nike over a few more, he slid it back, producing a coarse grinding beneath the hard circular tread. Luke's expression never changed from one of idle attention, nor did he consider how impossibly huge he appeared to the tiny ants below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Uncle Adam, how much longer... I'm gonna pass out if I don't eat soon!\" Andrew complained without even looking up from his phone. Luke prepared to respond, glad for the chance when his father answered. \"Gonna be a few more minutes, boys. Can't keep this grill hot enough to cook the damn things.\" Everyone resumed their activities, the sound of nature, cell phone alerts, and Jake's Gameboy breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a yawn, Luke looked back down and shifted his sneaker, revealing a mess of smashed ants, squirming victims, and unseen survivors. Luke was oblivious to this carnage. He only frowned when he figured that all the tiny bugs were gone. The blond youth shrugged, when he once more spied tiny movement near the toe of his right Air Force sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale ant was almost unnoticeable against the gray dirt. It had been hiding behind a small shred of bark and looked to be scuttling away. Luke grunted, and without wasting thought, prepared to finish it in the same fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright guys, come and get it!\" Adam called out, still facing the grill. Luke froze, with his shoe an inch off the ground. While he was distracted the minuscule bug fled underneath his chair. \"You just said it wasn\u2019t cooking,\u201d Luke said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father, still not looking back, shrugged. \"A little red meat will be good for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke\u2019s shoes crashed down onto dozens of unnoticed ants as he stood up. He looked over to see Andrew standing while still typing furiously on his phone. Wanting first pick Luke marched towards the battered folding table next to the grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Luke reached out to grab a bun, Andrew elbowed him aside. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m number one. Get used to it!\u201d he snickered. Luke was stunned for a moment before his face twisted in anger. \u201cYou asshole!!\u201d Luke shouted shoving his cousin. Andrew stumbled backwards and crashed into Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSON OF A BITCH!!\u201d Adam bellowed, dropping the tongs to grab his singed arm. \u201cYou two take this shit too damn far!!\u201d Adam snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad I-\u201c Luke began. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it!\u201d Adam interrupted, \u201cJust eat! I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Without waiting for a response, Adam stormed towards their SUV parked outside the clearing, hoping to find their emergency first aid kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed in terror as the white and blue sneakers lifted over him. \u201cNO!\u201d He screamed, \u201cI\u2019M NOT AN ANT, DON\u2019T YOU SEE?!\u201d The shoes, easily the size of cruise ships, dropped lower. Bryan screamed again, putting his hands up in futility. Grains of dirt the size of boulders rained down from the filthy tread. Brian\u2019s life flashed before his eyes before he realized everything had suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring a glance upwards revealed the massive sole still hovering above, motionless. Bryan\u2019s instinct beat out his curiosity. He bolted, grateful for the moment to escape. As he emerged from the shadow of the massive teen\u2019s sneaker, Bryan couldn\u2019t suppress a thrilled laugh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above the voices of the titans rumbled like distant thunder. Bryan stopped behind a towering chair leg, doubling over as he struggled to breathe. Looking forward he could see some aimless wandering ants for only a moment before the massive shoe crashed down mercilessly. The lofty chair he had taken refuge beneath shifted as the titanic teenager stood to his full height. With impossible ease, the giant pounded away. Bryan watched as one and then the other young titans pounded in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in awe of their immense size, something the giants clearly were unable to appreciate. Their massive footwear crashed down onto the ground, completely altering the landscape. This massive teen had been grinding the ants into the dirt it seemed because he could find nothing better to do. Bryan was sure the kid was nice enough, at least to someone of a roughly equal size. At this size Bryan was just another bug: easily overlooked and carelessly disposed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been so sure that he couldn\u2019t be confused with an ant, after all he was a human, and a damn smart one at that. But when the titan\u2019s gaze had drifted onto his sprinting form, there was no spark of recognition. Instead the terrifying behemoth had moved his gigantic sneaker to crush the scientist as cruelly as he had to the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan jumped at the rumbling of a roar at the grill. He could see the older one gripping his arm while bellowing at the two who had been at the fire-pit. He then marched away, the ground trembling as his massive shoes slammed down behind the chair. Bryan stared in shock at the clouds of dust kicked up by each of the man\u2019s footsteps. He was solely focused on his seemingly injured arm. Not an ounce of thought rested on the ground at his feet as he stomped by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wasn\u2019t only in danger at being disposed of because of he may be mistaken for a bug. No, even worse was that these giants could easily end his existence and never even notice he was ever there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared longingly in the direction he had come from. He had already been left behind by his brother Matt, whose whereabouts were completely unknown at this point. Should he venture in the wilderness he would be lucky to make it out alive, let alone actually find another person. And they would be just as threatening, if not more, than the group Bryan already had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed miserably. This family was his best hope.</span></div></div>",

He was more than happy to see Luke and Andrew in trouble, if only because he wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke glared at him before returning to his seat. He glanced at the ground where he could see his footprints from earlier. He had forgotten about the ants just before he stood up. Amongst the crumpled black forms were a few survivors, barely alive and twitching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke, uninterested in the ants anymore, glanced at his plate instead. He gripped the burger in his hands and took a large bite. It was perfect, the flavor washed over his tongue as he chewed. He couldn\u2019t enjoy it fully however as he glared across the clearing at Andrew, who was downing scoop after scoop of his potato salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his own potato salad unenthusiastically with a fork. This trip already sucked just like he knew it would! All because Andrew had to be here! He was such a dick! Andrew never let up on Luke and he wasn\u2019t sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuke! Come here!\u201d his father called gruffly from the SUV. Luke stared at his dad, worried for a moment. He then figured this would be a good chance to explain himself, or rather blame Andrew since it was all his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke dropped his plate to the ground, accidentally submerging the edge of it in dirt. He sidestepped the thick bushes beneath the thick trees, approaching his dad who patiently waited with a grim expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, it was A-\u201c he began. \u201cLuke. No. I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Adam interrupted pointedly. \u201cI don\u2019t care who started what, the point is this shit needs to stop.\u201d Luke looked away, glaring at the line of trees on the far side of their clearing. Adam sighed, \u201cLuke you can\u2019t over react to everything Andrew does. That\u2019s why he bothers you more than Jake. Jake doesn\u2019t care, and neither should you!\u201d Adam insisted. \u201cI brought both of you here because you both need to learn to get along. You\u2019re cousins for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke faced his father again, but still said nothing. \u201cIs that too much to ask?\u201d Adam asked. Luke shook his head. \u201cThank you, you\u2019re not in trouble and I\u2019m going to give the same talk to Andrew, so go eat and let\u2019s try to make this trip fun, yeah?\u201d Luke nodded, smiling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plodded back to the campsite, making sure not to walk near Andrew as his dad called his cousin over. Dropping into his chair he looked across the way at Jake who was trying to eat with one hand and play his Gameboy with the other in spite of each being a two-handed task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at his brother\u2019s ridiculousness Luke reached down for his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan remained under the chair, waiting for an opportunity to present itself. He watched the three young blonds shuffle around the table as they put their plates together, apparently shocked into silence by whatever had just happened. From this distance, they appeared more like normal boys and less like the fearsome titans they had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t last however as the monumental teenager returned to his seat. Bryan couldn\u2019t help but wince at his every footstep that crashed down. Twigs that would have spanned several blocks snapped like nothing. Lofty blades of grass taller than redwoods were flattened in seconds. As his shoes would lift away it would spray dirt backwards as a final insult to the destroyed landscape left unnoticed in his wake. Never once did Luke\u2019s eyes glance down to see what unfortunate things might be in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan trembled with the quakes in the ground as Luke\u2019s colossal sneakers slammed down in front of the seat, the dirt crunching loudly. A sudden plop and subsequent creaking signaled that Luke had taken his seat. In front of him one of the enormous shoes lifted. It seemed as though the giant teen was observing the massacred ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Bryan it appeared like a bomb had been dropped. Dozens of ant corpses were spread at random amongst the rough hills created by Luke stomping and sliding feet. Here and there he could see some survivors squirming or fleeing the scene. Above it all, like an alien ship, hovered the destructive shoe. Bits of dirt and dead ants dangled from the filthy tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the shoe dropped, landing with a dull thud over many of the remaining survivors. It seemed the giant boy was no longer interested in the puny ants now that he had a meal to focus his attention on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sputtered as he tried to process the indifference the behemoth had for the lives he had thoughtlessly obliterated. Perhaps he had not been the best choice to attempt to contact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself frozen in fear. He could not bring himself to contact the monstrous teen, and yet was too scared to flee in case he was seen and successfully crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to talk himself into some form of action, a booming voice echoed across the clearing, shaking Bryan from his thoughts. \u201cLUKE!! COME HERE!!\u201d it demanded. A city sized paper plate landed roughly in the dirt as the titanic teen stood up in response. \u201cLuke\u201d Bryan muttered as the giant pounded away. This monster\u2019s name was Luke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling safer in the fearsome Luke\u2019s absence, Bryan figured now would be the best time to flee. He sprung forward, hoping to reach one of the other towering boys before Luke returned. This took him right past the broad paper plate. He couldn\u2019t help but stop and gape at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his size, the plate appeared like a perfectly even slope in the landscape. The burger towered high like a cliff of food. Where a bite had been taken, Bryan could clearly see the glistening beef, melted cheese, and fresh veggies that were somehow more appetizing at such a massive scale. Even the misshapen hill of potato salad looked heavenly to Bryan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found he had walked up to where the edge of the plate was buried into the sand. He realized during the adventure so far he hadn\u2019t thought about food. But now presented with this irresistible display it was all he could think about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it he was sprinting across the smooth surface of the plate. It appeared he wasn\u2019t the only one with this idea. A few relentless ants also found the massive food to be a great discovery. Bryan crouched in front of a chunk of ground beef. Though undoubtedly an insignificant crumb to the giant, it could serve as many meals for the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the fear and physical strain, Bryan had been left with quite the appetite!  As he stuffed his face, all he could focus on was the rich flavor of the beef. That is until a couple of quakes shook him to his core. Bryan twisted to look at what he should have already expected. The enormous teen towered high above, the sun illuminating his muscled physique like a god of lore. Panicking Bryan snatched what he could from the chunk of beef and sped back towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he made it, a broad hand swooped out of the sky. It grasped the edge of the plate and lifted everything skywards, tilting haphazardly. Bryan couldn\u2019t even let out a whimper as he was flattened by heavy g-forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan found himself sliding uncontrollably towards\u2026</span></div></div>",

Luke wasn't very good at playing the bigger man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see his loosely built burger had collapsed when he lifted his plate. He hastily put it back together, failing to notice a couple ants who had been caught up in the avalanche. Raising the sandwich to his lips he took a savage bite. As he chewed he looked beyond their clearing, where the sun rays reflected off a nearby lake. It was pretty warm, Luke wouldn't mind a swim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling an itch in his throat Luke coughed suddenly, putting his hand to his neck. He paused for a second and swallowed hard. The unnoticed ant responsible for the itch sunk down Luke's throat with the chewed food. Luke took a moment to regain his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spit more often than you swallow?\" Jake joked from where he sat. Luke didn't bother looking, simply raising a hand to flip his brother off. Jake scoffed, \"Rude,\" he said shortly, pretending to be insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke and Jake definitely messed with each other, though it was usually just good-natured jokes. On the other hand Luke and Andrew used fighting words that often broke out into actual fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew plodded back into the clearing, fishing his phone out of his shorts. Dropping into his chair he frowned, \"Fucker's dead!\" he grunted, sliding it back into his pocket. \"Wish I could say the same about you!\" bounced around Luke's skull as he barely managed to suppress shouting out the retort. As long as Andrew wasn't directly attacking, Luke would make an effort to play nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his eyes back to his plate, Luke picked up his fork to start in on the potato salad. Munching on the first bite, Luke felt a pat on his back as his dad returned from the SUV. He felt a twinge of guilt upon seeing the large white bandage that covered his dad's arm. He glanced back at Andrew accusingly, though his cousin was leaned back, staring up at the canopy of trees as he munched on his own burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke scooped another chunk of potato salad, bringing it to his mouth. As the fork bounced off his teeth when he had an idea. Retracting the food, he used his other hand to pull the top of the fork backwards. Letting it free, he sent a chunk of potato salad flying through the air. With a splat it landed on Andrew's left cheek. Andrew's whole body flinched in shock, sitting up to look forward with a dumbfounded expression, mouth hanging open. Luke let out a booming laugh. Andrew in response scooped up a chunk of potato salad, shooting it into Luke's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez your aim sucks almost as much as you do!\" Luke exclaimed, though for once his words lacked an angry undertone. Andrew grinned mischievously and sent another chunk flying towards Luke. Upon hearing his brother's shout Jake emerged from the tent. \"What's going o-\" Jake was cutoff when Luke hit him in the forehead with potato salad. He was only down for a second before retrieving his own plate to join the food fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam stood by the grill, smiling as he chewed on his burger. Sure he wasn't thrilled about the wasted food, but he was definitely happy to see the boys getting along and having fun for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan yelped as slid and tumbled chaotically, quickly approaching the misshapen mountain of what appeared to be potato salad. The ground below tilted again as Luke placed the plate onto his lap. Bryan was bounced upward by the shifting plate, screaming as he flew through the air, his flight ending abruptly as he plunged into the soft surface of potato salad. Above him the titanic teen remained totally unaware of the shrunken scientist's screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasped, thankful to have finally stopped. Immediately he realized he was stuck fast waist deep in the mountain of slimy food. Spread before him were the collapsed remains of the burger, though the vibrant colors of the massive food still looked delectable. He stared in awe as a broad hand descended and with surprising dexterity for something so large, reassembled the burger. As the top bun was lifted to complete the sandwich, Bryan noticed a few squirming shapes in the bread's ketchup spread. The ants who had joined him on the plate were in the same situation as him! Their presence was no more evident to the massive youth than Bryan's was as he patted the top bun of his reconstructed sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick fingers bent around the sandwich as the giant lifted it skywards. Bryan craned his neck to follow its ascent. Still staring, Bryan grimaced at the loud crunched as Luke sunk his teeth into the massive burger. As he ripped away the island-sized bite, boulder-like crumbs rained down from above. Bryan spent a second wondering about the fate of the ants, before remembering he was at risk of the same one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEEEEYYY!!\" Bryan bellowed, waving his arms. Above him the smacks and crunches coming from Luke's rising and falling jaw were more than enough to drown out his screams. His eyes were staring into the distance, indifferent to the meal he was about to gulp down. His oversight would could very well spell doom for tiny Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly realizing screaming was ineffective Bryan began frantically struggling against the sticky potato salad. He made agonizingly slow progress. He paused when a thunderous cough rang out above. Once again straining to look upwards he watched as Luke pursed his lips. After a very audible gulp, Luke dropped his head down and took a gasping breath. Bryan started waving his arms in an attempt to take advantage of Luke's downward gaze, though his blue eyes seemed glazed over, not really focusing on the plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke let out a gusting sigh still recovering from choking. Bryan was buffeted by the gust that reeked of soggy beef. He was pelted by bits of food, and drops of saliva. He glared upwards, \"Hey! I'm right here! I'm not a part of your fucking meal!\" he shouted furiously. He was slammed with another gusting breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated, Bryan recovered and turned upwards again. He found himself staring into Luke's gaping mouth. There was just enough to glint weakly off his jagged molars and illuminate the uvula hanging over his throat. Spread at random across the massive tongue were soggy chunks of food. All that remained of the huge chunk of food the giant teen had just downed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's handsome face lifted upwards as his cliff-like chest continued to heave. He made no movement to continue eating, and Bryan renewed his attempts to escape in the much needed reprieve. He grunted, his scrawny arms burning from the effort as he struggled to keep his breathing even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shift of light and shadow drew Bryan's eyes upwards yet again. He was met with the Luke's apathetic gaze. Bryan didn't attempt to wave, knowing he had no chance of being noticed as long as he was trapped in the behemoth's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge plastic fork held tightly in the giant's burly fist fast approached. It crashed into the mountainside near Bryan, cutting a huge mound free. Rising quickly, Bryan couldn't suppress a gasp as Luke's long tongue slipped out of his mouth to slurp up the food. Bryan was running out of time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline gave him new strength, and Bryan shouted excitedly as after another minute of struggling he felt his bonds loosen significantly. Not a second later, an opaque clear wall crashed down to his side. Recognizing the fork Bryan shouted in despair. \"NO!!! I WAS SO CLOSE!!\" he lamented as he was scooped up and easily lifted skywards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE NOOOO!\" I'M IN YOUR FOOD, JUST SEE MEE!!\" Bryan begged as he quickly approached the widening mouth. Above him, Luke stared forward, unaware of the tiny man about to meet his end within his meal. Beyond a wall of perfect white teeth, smears of potato salad greeted him from the tongue. Bryan again looked upward pleadingly, though instead of Luke's distant eyes, he was met with a pair of dark nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOO!\" Bryan cried. As if in response the fork stopped abruptly, hitting the teeth with a dull crack. The mouth ahead snapped shut and the fork quickly fell away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!! THANK YOU!!!!\" Bryan shouted, choking on a joyful sob. A thick finger quickly approached, no doubt to retrieve him! He studied the swirls of the fingerprint, magnified to great detail as it approached. Bryan briefly panicked for a second he would be crushed against the finger tip, though that worry was put to rest as the finger inexplicably landed above him, pushing the tines of the fork back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly realized the giant still hadn't looked down once. He also became fully conscious of the position the fork was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO-\" the air was forced back into his lungs as he flew forward at seemingly light speed. The landing was rough and sudden, leaving Bryan worried about whiplash. He opened his eyes, struggling to focus on where he had landed. Just above him and to his side are a pair of lips, thinner than Luke's. They are in shaped in an \"O\" of surprise, half chewed burger barely visible in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels the wall he is on shift as the jaw snaps shut, a gulp sounding from somewhere nearby. A booming laugh threatens to burst his eardrums as the rough movement continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter rang throughout the clearing as the boys had their food fight, though they quickly ran out of ammo. What remained were chunks of potato salad that dotted the clearing. The boys started cleaning themselves up before returning to their movements. Andrew, feeling the potato salad still clinging to his cheek, tries to lap it up with his tongue. Only getting some he uses his hand to...</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes tightly, trying to shut out the outside world. He couldn't move, he couldn't think, he couldn't do anything but try to clear his head. However the giants' food fight gave him no rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after almost two agonizing minutes, everything seemed to calm slightly. Bryan cracks his eyes open, feeling hungover. The bright sun elicits a groan from him. Other than his swirling head, Bryan is pretty sure he has remained intact.He forces himself to take stock of his surroundings so he could figure out what to do next. Turning to his side he happens to see a massive tongue burst from between the lips. It slithers towards him and starts to lap at the edge of the potato salad. Bryan attempts to shrink away before realizing he is out of it's reach. The tongue withdraws having only managed to get a small fraction of the food. Sighing in relief, Bryan continues surveying his surroundings and turns to his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't get the chance to scream before the impossibly long finger smashes into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew sweeps the potato salad from his cheek with his index finger, pushing it up and into his mouth. Sucking on the small portion of potato salad, Andrew pulls his finger free with a pop, a single strand of saliva stretching from his lips to his saliva coated finger. Wiping it off on his pants he looks first at Luke and then at Jake, chuckling as they also clean themselves off. He glances across the clearing at his Uncle Adam who is smiling and shaking his head as he munches on his sandwich. Andrew swallows before speaking, \"Hey Uncle Adam, you think I could get more of that potato salad? I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four laugh for a moment as they return to their meals. Jake leaves his Gameboy in the tent and sits at the fire pit with his cousin and brother. Adam quickly joins them, bringing with him the bowl of potato salad. They all eat, talking and laughing happily for the first time since they had started the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween bites of his burger, Andrew downs a healthy serving of potato salad. Preoccupied with the surprisingly good conversation, Andrew doesn't imagine the mutilated food descending into his gut. A tiny scientist's screams as he frantically beats against the soft stomach walls go totally unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Andrew gulps down the final bite of his burger, complimenting his uncle's cooking with a firm pat to his stomach. On the other side, a tiny man finds himself trapped amongst mountains of soggy, chewed burger remnants. He laments the time wasted on his stupid shrinking formula that had lead him here to his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Luke suggests they swim, Andrew and Jake both enthusiastically agree. Adam decides to remain behind, still nursing his burnt arm. The boys head down to the lake, ripping their shirts off before jumping into the crystal clear waters. Andrew pats his chiseled abs, \"Better be careful guys! We'll drown with these full stomachs\" he says sarcastically. The jostling movement as Andrew swims serves to further imprison Bryan within the behemoth's bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later Andrew steps out of the lake, feeling strange standing on solid ground again. He feels a shift in his gut, followed by a long gurgle. \"It begins!\" he says with a smile, unable to appreciate the true horror of what was occurring within his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, Andrew joins the family as they roast s'mores over the fire. As he chews messily on his own s'more, Andrew is utterly unaware of the tiny man caught up in his healthy digestive system. Finally Bryan succumbs to the acids as Andrew gulps down his last s'more, retreating to his tent for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camping trip works wonders for the cousins. After a weekend of unexpected fun, the young men head home much closer than ever before. However Bryan had become closer to Andrew than anyone else ever could.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan returned his gaze to the giant who lay inside the nearby tent. Out of all the other giants, this one was obviously the best option for contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's laying down. Afterall, how hard could it be?\" Bryan thought with a sprig of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repressed memories of his past experiences when trying to contact his humongous brother. Dwelling on past failures would get him nowhere. For now, he had to take this opportunity while he had it. Nodding agreeably to himself, Bryan set out on his new course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately out of the thicket of grass, the shrunken man found himself plodding over a terrain of devastated dirt. More than once did he find himself crouching suddenly to avoid the notice of a wandering ant or beetle. After a good dozen minutes, he happened upon the twitching remains of a pulverized spider. The cottage-sized arachnid had been cruelly smashed into the dirt by something of immense power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous tent nearing, Bryan scuttled out of another indentation all the while glancing back at the flattened spider warily. Suddenly the obvious dashed upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-prints...!\" Bryan whispered aloud, wide-eyed. \"Oh Christ, these are all shoe prints! The entire landscape is covered with them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a phenomena that went hand-in-hand with human interaction of the outdoors, yet now it had been blown up to great significance. At a size smaller than most insects, Bryan found that even a single tread print left a rough series of indentations that would tire even the most able of outdoors men. He couldn't even comprehend the proper design due to their enormous size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing himself once again for his predicament, Bryan found himself nearly at his destination. Straight ahead--across a relatively flat, undisturbed plain of dirt--loomed the gargantuan tent. Made of two-toned material, it looked closer to a mythical monument of shiny plastic than a simple one-person tent. His gaze drifted from the huge shelter to the monstrous pair of sneakered feet protruding from it. A closer view brought the sneaker into a new light: the shoe soles sported an aggressive waffle design composed of hard black rubber with the bold red VANS logo spreading across the center of the sole at an angle. He noted the repeated logo also written in red against the dust-covered grey side of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold spikes of fear threatened to paralyze the tiny man as he gazed. \"I... Uhm... It's nothing but a young guy,\" He reasoned. \"Just need to get his attention and... Yes, just have to get his attention. Easy enough...\" The last statement sounded oddly questionable as Bryan mumbled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minute scientist continued, he passed the base of a looming tower of dark blue steel. Large, scuffed, stickers displaying various brands both known and unknown to Bryan covered the cylindrical structure. Noting large beads of liquid, Bryan discovered it was nothing more than a metal water canteen. The sheer size of it made such a possibility foreign to Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the metal bottle, he avoided more deep indentations--these clearly left by the gigantic Vans worn by the nearby teenager. Suddenly they stood before him: soles facing upwards, and frayed denim jeans slightly visible from the tent. They shifted constantly, at random, each movement unleashed trembling shockwaves and dull thundering booms. Bryan stood gawking at them. Shuddering once more as he noted every clod of dirt, blade of grass, grit of garbage, and the barely recognizable beetle remains trapped in the enormous shoe tread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bigger than many city blocks, covering impossible surface. He was simply awe-struck at the sheer magnitude of refuse packed into the tread of a teenager's shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of it is larger than I am, and this guy could care less!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping his fear, Bryan pushed away these thoughts and attempted to focus on his objective once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get his help!\" Bryan resumed, determined.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dropping it in annoyance, he reached over the folds of his sleeping bag to retrieve an already opened bag of chips that lay nestled in the corner of his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag proved to be nearly empty. Jake frowned at it, unable to recall eating that many chips. A small dark speck became visible to him as it crawled up the side of the bag, trying to get in. Creasing his brow at the pesky intruder, Jake brushed it off dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled at him. He was hungry enough to eat his tent, much less an entire bag of chips, he sighed. Jake tilted his head and poured the contents of the bag into his mouth, in the process failing to notice the tiny ants mixed among the potato chip crumbs. He made quick work of the meager snack, feeling almost hungrier as a result. The Gameboy suddenly flashed, re-announcing his sixth \"Game Over\", and prompting him to try again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked the portable device off, bored. Like his brother, Jake had been obligated to go along on the annual family camping trip. It was something his father, an outdoorsy and all-around sport fan, had planned for them since they were kids. He couldn't deny the fun of taking a break from his mother and younger sister, and the chance to do some mountain biking and other activities was a plus. Yet, his cousin Andrew always seemed to act a perfect ass every year, pissing both Jake and his brother off to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake itched the back of his head and readjusted the beanie he wore over his ear-length blond hair. His stomach emitted another reminder, leaving no room for argument. Flipping himself onto his back, he decided to investigate how the food was coming along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew spoke up just as Jake slid out from his tent and stood. \"Hey, Uncle Adam, we gonna eat anytime soon? I'm wastin' away here!\" Andrew's complaint seemed genuine, yet he didn't once look away from his phone. Jake grunted in amusement hearing a snide response from his brother before reaching for his canteen of Gatorade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say before you two?\" His father said, annoyed. \"Knock it off already!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout delay came the expected swarm of mosquitoes and tiny gnats, excited to buzz around Jake's face. They proved agile enough to dodge the teenager's idle swipes, swishing this way and that in an attempt to enter his mouth and ears. Luke was visibly having issues also, as he occasionally swatted while focusing his gaze on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs could be expected, Bryan's determined passage suddenly halted when the circumstances abruptly changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! No, not now!\" Obvious signs of movement from his chosen giant became apparent. He heard distant rumbles from inside the enormous tent, all indicating his time had run out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis courage shattering once again, stumbled back. The gigantic skate shoes began shifting violently before suddenly flipping over with disastrous results. Hefty vibrations rattled the ground, accompanied by a frightening grinding crunch of dirt and gravel as the huge footwear moved. Like a mountain rising to life, the oblivious titan pushed through the tent flap. The giant rose to his full height, completely unappreciative of his gargantuan size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny shrunken scientist shook uncontrollably, terrified. Miles of thick, frayed denim settled like rolling hills over the tops of the titanic Vans sneakers. His towering legs seemed to stretch on and on, looming into the sky before meeting the deep black t-shirt worn over the teenager's thick chest. A white logo depicting some band, or perhaps some sport's brand stretched over the shirt's surface. Bryan heard the booming thunder of what must of been the other giant's talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from his minuscule perspective, it was obvious this teen easily stood over 6 feet tall like the other giant. This average height translated to thousands of feet for tiny Bryan, who couldn't even focus on the gigantic youth's distant face. That was, until the humongous face shifted and gazed downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded, Bryan hesitated before breaking into action. \"Yes... YES! Down here! Oh God, yes! I'm right here!\" He sprung up, his thin legs sore and bruised, and began stumbling forward with flailing arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong youthful face showed nothing in the way of recognition. An expression of idle boredom, disinterest, and perhaps a hint of annoyance. Tufts of sandy blond hair poked from under a dark coloured beanie that was pulled over the titan's head like an enormous blanket covering part of the moon. He looked in his late teens, obviously athletic but with a mellow disposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the giant shifted. His Vans sneakers lifting slightly before slamming down with powerful quakes. Another shockwave sent Bryan to his rear, screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was no more than slight shifting, felt like the end for something as tiny as bug-sized Mr. Smith. He couldn't help remembering the crushed remains of the beetle, unknowingly pulverized underneath the teenager's huge shoe. Bryan cried out for mercy, thinking the giant planned to flatten him when instead he reached an enormous arm overhead. Covered in light coloured hairs, it stretched arge building-sized fingers that wrapped around the towering monolith of a canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little effort the huge structure was wretched from the dirt, showering everything nearby, and lifted high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just taking a drink...?\" Questioned the tiny man, stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his new size, even the most simple of actions looked exaggerated and nothing short of remarkable. The oblivious youth raised the tall sticker-coated bottle to his mouth and took great cascading gulps. Bryan snapped back into action too late, his gawking cost him the precious moment of the giant standing still while drinking. Car-sized drops of liquid hurled to the earth as the giant teen finished his drink. The young guy flung the metal bottle into his tent, and waved a large hand at his mountain-size face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is he doing now?\" Bryan wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding a powerful slap on his toned arm, Bryan realized the practically invisible specks that flitted around the behemoth's face. Another swipe and an injured gnat was sent plummeting to earth with a nearby crash. Two more landed shortly after, skittering painfully in the soft dirt with broken wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the giant teen was on the move again. One sneaker raised into the air, the massive sole is suddenly visible. Large sections of previously trapped dirt dislodge, raining from the thick waffle tread. High above the teenaged owner turns his gaze, unconcerned with the ground he looks away, annoyed with the pesky insects. The gigantic skate shoe slams into the ground, obliterating an injured gnat and many unwary ants. The other shifted, grinding the ground loudly before lifting and taking a step with a dull <i>thoom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dangerously close, the enormous youth...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His massive sandals crashed thunderously with each step, causing Bryan to lose his balance. Gaping, Bryan watched the huge sandals stomp by, leaving ridged tread prints and raining dirt with each impressive step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched breathlessly as the strange giant stomped over to a picnic bench. He had been completely unaware of the tiny man nearly crushed under his large sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo other young guys of equal age occupied the area already, one standing over an outdoor park grill, while the other lounged on the bench. The sandaled giant sat his impossibly huge form on the bench, placing a tower-sized beer bottle on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... They're huge!\" Bryan stuttered to himself. The sight was positively awe-inspiring, despite his previous encounters with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three behemoths looked to be in their early-to-mid twenties. More than likely college students off camping for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant that had nearly crushed him let out a thunderous laugh. He wore thick flip fops, jeans, and a long sleeved t-shirt. Raising the beer container to his lips, he took massive swigs of the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis buddy, sitting across from him, held a can of mosquito repellent. Sporting light buzzed hair, a black t-shirt embezzled with a band logo, tan shorts and a trashed pair of black sneakers. He released torrents of the chemical spray over his lean arms, pausing briefly to swat any fluttering insects. Grisly tattoos of flames and tribal patterns adorned his arms and thighs, giving him an even more fearsome appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimidly, Bryan turned his gaze to the last giant. The giant wore no shirt despite the flaring heat from the grilling meat. A dark red beanie covered his head, complimenting a nice coating of jet black stubble. Baggy cargo shorts and dirty white skate shoes were the remainder of his attire. Unable to control his stare, Bryan gawked at the mountain of rippling muscle as he idly joked with his buddies and flipped the patties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quite far away to the minuscule man. Bryan watched in amazement every move the enormous young men made. Time seemed to slow down each time they moved, as if they were in water. He could feel light vibrations caused by the giant's enormous sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had all but forgotten just how tiny he had become. Smaller than even a common ant, Bryan would have a hell of a time trying to contact them. A simple misstep would spell disaster for him, and these huge young men seemed to exude a naturally careless nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this danger, Bryan had little choice.

Though he had decided to attempt to contact the giants, he realized he needed to pick a single one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ruled out the one at the grill. The faded white sneakers were constantly shifting as the giant talked to and laughed with his buddies. Unnoticed by the giant, the grinding sound of shifting dirt under his massive shoes caused Bryan to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the process of elimination started, Bryan pressed on. He angled his direction towards the towering table. Beyond it, the top of a gray and red tent was barely visible like a distant mountain peak. Also visible was its base, behind the tattooed giant. Two backpacks slumped over, their contents spilled in front of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, the clearing amidst a rough circle of thick trees was barren. There wasn\u2019t even a car, as though the giants had hiked here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow far am I from civilization?\u201d Bryan wondered as he noted his environment, \u201cHow far from home!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo calm his increasingly panicked mind, Bryan focused on the two behemoths at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattooed one sprayed himself one last time, before capping the can and blindly tossing it into the pile by their packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, Troy! You sure you get enough?\u201d shouts the other at the table, pretending to choke. Troy glares at his friend and replies \u201cI dunno, maybe not!\u201d leaning back to reach for the can. As his hand closes around it he flicks the cap off. It flies under the table and when Troy leans forward to spray his friend in the face, his shoe crashes down onto the green cap with a loud snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched in terror as an object many times larger than himself was obliterated by accident. Troy, roaring with laughter at his sputtering friend, dropped the insect repellent behind him without giving the splintered cap a second glance.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBryan, who had already found Troy\u2019s tattoos intimidating, lost any desire to contact him. This ironically left him with the one who had nearly crushed him. Bryan sighs, realizing that ultimately none were a \u201csafe\u201d choice. He steers himself towards the one in flip-flops, with still quite a distance to cover.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe colossus lifts the beer can to his lips and slurps loudly. With a disappointed grunt he looks into the empty can before chucking it towards a tree. Bryan watches the can disappear into the woods with a clang; the ease with which it was thrown was amazing and terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSean!\u201d comes an exasperated shout from the one at the grill, \u201cThere\u2019s a deposit on this site in my name! I\u2019ll get charged if they find shit around here!\u201d Sean sighs, but stands up. His flip-flops smack loudly against his feet as he searches for the can amongst the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tries to stifle the fear rising in his chest as he nears the towering table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, having found the can, returns from the trees and\u2026</span></div></div>",

With his eyes locked on the trash can across from him, Sean pays no attention to the ground at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Kyle?\" he asks as he nears the garbage can and drops the beer into it. In the distance he can see where the path stretches away towards a lake. Slowly rowing towards its middle is a small boat with two guys in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck fishing\" he thinks to himself as he turns to return to the table. He crosses the clearing in a few strides; the crunch of a beetle goes unheard. Reaching the table Sean drops into a seat, and continues his conversation with Troy and Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan presses forward, his eyes locked onto the towering figure of Sean standing at the line of trees. After a moment of thought, Sean's gaze locks onto something across the clearing. He steps forward, not an ounce of attention on the ground at his feet. His sandal hits the ground with a resounding smack, kicking up a cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's eyes shift from the mountainous man on the move to the ground where he is headed. A black beetle is crawling across the ground. It never has a chance. Sean's flip-flop crashes down on to the beetle's back half with a gruesome crunch. Sean, none the wiser, continues marching forward, leaving the beetle twitching in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pounds across the clearing, near where Bryan had first come through, and with a clang drops the can into what must be a garbage can. After a moment of hesitation, he spins around on his feet, his face blank of expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quakes as he approaches once more. Bryan's eyes flick between Sean's towering frame, and the battered beetle. Just before reaching the table, one of Sean's flip-flops lands directly onto the Beetle, it's body disappearing from view. Bryan flinches at the sound of another crunch. Sean swings his leg onto the bench at the table and Bryan catches a glimpse of the beetle's mangled form hanging from the sole of the sandal. With a final thud, Sean plants his feet onto the ground, having taken his seat at the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice thunders from above as he continues chatting with his friends, utterly unaware of the random life extinguished by his careless steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do!\" Bryan panics, standing in the shadow of the picnic table.</span></div></div>",

He would throw it away when they packed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, his every move is being watched by a tiny scientist. Bryan waits in the shadow of a table leg, waiting for the right moment. He watches the flip-flops crash across the dirt and flatten small weeds. Sean returns to his seat at the table, his thick legs stretching upwards where the table obscures the rest of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, already having learned how abruptly things could change did not hesitate. He had already accepted that he would have to climb in order to get one of the towering young men to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the edge of the left flip-flop, Bryan stares up the side of it. Dust coated the black wall. This highlighted the numerous indentations that at normal size would be easily overlooked. Relief flooded Bryan; climbing for him would be no easy task! Any break was greatly appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, high on adrenaline, scales the sole of the flip-flop with relative ease. Heaving himself over the side of the flip-flop he gasps for air, ready to rest and celebrate his small victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he gags. In front of him is the thick flesh of Sean\u2019s bare foot. A film of sweat had combined with the dust kicked up by Sean\u2019s footsteps, creating a stinking layer of dark grime. It was spread along the length of his foot where his skin met the sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean\u2019s jeans fold under his heel. Bryan rushes towards it, trying to hold his breath. Reaching the blue fabric, he is thrilled to discover its ridges are deep enough to serve as more handholds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting another second, Bryan starts scaling the denim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean slowly downs his beer, idly chatting with Troy across the table. However a loud grumble from his stomach stops him mid-sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, how much longer are those burgers gonna take? My stomach can\u2019t run on empty!\u201d he says unhappily, a hand against his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost done, how about you grab the buns so I can warm them up?\u201d Kyle requests without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, eager to start eating, stands and heads over to their scattered supplies. He snatches the bag of buns and tosses them to Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen \u2018em!\u201d he orders as he starts digging for condiments. Troy obeys, but not without an indignant snort. Sean squats down, resting his butt on his heels as he searches. He feels a movement within his bowels and makes no attempt to suppress a fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d exclaims Troy, waving his hand in front of his nose. Kyle turns his head, giving Sean an amused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, having found everything, stands up. \u201cDude, yours are so much worse!\u201d he says to Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d Troy laughs in response, as he hands the burger buns to Kyle. Sean dumps the condiments onto the table, and leans against its edge to watch Kyle cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, Kyle\u2019s hands points to the cooler. \u201cLettuce, cheese, and stuff\u2019s in there,\u201d he says matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes your majesty!\u201d says Sean sarcastically as he reaches into the cooler for the rest of the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDamn straight! I\u2019m the cook, I\u2019m the king!\u201d Kyle snickers. Troy and Sean both grunt disbelievingly, as the grill continues to sizzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan holds tight when the giant\u2019s leg moves suddenly. Each thundering step threatens to shake him free. Dust kicked up by the feet clouds around him as everything comes to a halt. For a moment nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the wall of fabric begins to incline, becoming more level. At the same time, his area darkens, until more dark denim crashes down from above. Bryan, delighted at his surprising luck, grasps onto the new wall. It seems the giant has squatted down, thus cutting off a huge part of the climb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low gurgle is his only warning. A disgusting, noise rips past him, filling the air with noxious fumes. Bryan begins to cough violently; the sound of the titans\u2019 laughter barely registers in his mind. As Sean stands up, Bryan has little clue as to what\u2019s going on, his mind foggy from the poisonous air. His iron-grip however remains strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sean leans against the table, Bryan sees the nearby level surface. Only thinking of escaping to fresh air to rest, he lets go. Roughly landing on the table knocks the air out of his lungs, and he struggles for breath. His mind blank; Bryan lies on his back as Sean sets up the burger ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean watches Kyle scrape the last beef patty off the grill. Behind him, Troy has pulled out a large bag of nachos. A jar of salsa and a jar of cheese stand opened, just in front of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPour me some salsa?\u201d requests Sean as he unwraps the cheese and lettuce. \u201cMe too!\u201d Kyle shouts from the grill, where he is quickly toasting the buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d replies Troy, dumping salsa onto each of their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with the buns, Kyle places them onto the table, and Sean immediately reaches for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait up, wait up!\u201d Kyle says putting his hands up. \u201cLet\u2019s get picture of this! Day one of the three day weekend!\u201d Sean puts the bread down slowly and waits as Kyle digs through his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, where\u2019s my phone?\u201d Kyle asks, a look of confusion on his face. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Sean groans.<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you need to get your shit together. You lose everything!\u201d Troy laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me find it!\u201d Kyle says, ignoring Troy\u2019s comment. The three guys leave the table, searching amongst their things for Kyle\u2019s phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the surface of the table Bryan feels his strength returning. Sitting up he sees mountains of food spread before him, reminding him what drew him to the campsite in the first place!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan cannot resist the delicious aroma wafting to him. A tower of beef is just in front of him. He finds himself approaching it. The giants leave the table. Something about a lost cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! They'll be gone for awhile!\" reasons Bryan's starved mind. Before long he stands at the plate of meat. Though the edges of the plate are raised far above, a poorly placed meat patty droops over the lip of the plate, its edge resting on the table. Bryan runs right up to it and tries to take a bite out of the side. He is met with a tough, charred barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion and disappointment give way to understanding. Of course, the edges are singed! The inner part of the patty will be much more tender! He can see the giants in the distance, their eyes for once focused on the ground as they continue their search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he has time, Bryan starts scaling the side of the patty. It\u2019s very hot, but not quite scalding. Bryan however has become so consumed by his hunger that his senses are numbed to his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHauling himself onto the top of the patty he takes a few steps, drops to the surface, and digs his face into the beef. Taking a large bite, he groans happily; the warmth of the patty soothing to his aching body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Kyle feels something hard under his foot. Lifting his white sneaker reveals his phone, a dust print of the phone tracked across the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is why I prefer Droids! An iPhone would\u2019ve shattered!\u201d he says happily, dusting the phone off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDumbass!\u201d laughs Troy as all three quickly return to the table and Kyle snaps a picture of the spread of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally!\u201d Sean says happily, snatching a meat patty hanging off the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is literally stuffing his face when he hears a happy shout from behind him. He can see the shirtless giant had found his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed Bryan grabbed another chunk before standing to dismount the patty. He watches the giants move towards him and in seconds they are towering over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god they move so fast!\u201d Bryan thinks alarmed. Before he knows it Sean\u2019s hand appears and his thick fingers grasp the edge of the patty. A jarring movement knocks him off his feet, and he feels himself rolling aimlessly. With a short drop the movement halts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gray shirt stretched upwards to Sean\u2019s face which was focused on something other than the patty. Bryan stood to escape when something fell from above, smothering him. Forced to lay flat on his stomach, Bryan recognized the yellow hue. It was cheese! And it was melting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean drops the beef patty onto the bun on his tray. He fails to notice the minuscule speck that is a tiny man atop the burger. He drops a slice of cheddar onto the meat as he spreads ketchup and mayo onto the top bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him, Troy is scooping salsa onto nachos and shoving them into his mouth while Kyle rips the head of lettuce apart for their burgers. Sean grabs a leaf of lettuce, but skips the tomato. No one had sliced them, and no one really wanted to. Finally Sean pulls a few pickles out of the jar, and drops all but one into the sauce on the bun. He pops the last one into his mouth, savoring the sour flavor as he chews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis creation finished, Sean smashes the burger together. He lifts the sandwich to his mouth and takes a monstrous bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking fantastic!\u201d he says through a full mouth. Kyle nods in his direction as he starts in on his own burger. While Troy finishes putting his burger together, he asks Kyle about the hike they wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, however, doesn\u2019t join the conversation as he continues to chew. Gulping down his mouthful, he reaches for some nachos with his free hand and dumps them onto the plate. Dipping one in the salsa, he brings it to his mouth. The crunch as he bites down is music to his ears. Sean had seriously been starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean brings the burger to his mouth and takes another bite, savoring the smoky flavor of the burger flooding his mouth. Troy makes a joke, eliciting a roar of laughter from Sean and Kyle. Sean, unconcerned about manners, laughs with his mouth open. Half chewed piles of food, amidst strands of saliva stretching between his teeth are flooded with light. Bits of food go flying out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude calm down!\u201d Kyle says unhappily, feeling a few wet bits sticking to his bare chest. He wipes them free before biting into his own burger. Sean swallows his food and grunts apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill starving, he brings more salsa-laden nachos to his mouth, his long tongue extending towards the spicy snack. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Bryan was panicked would be an understatement. He was trapped by melted cheese, in some oblivious college guy\u2019s burger. He could breathe, but he could not move. And now each second that ticked by as he waited for the colossus to tear into his food was an agonizing eternity.<br>\r\nA swift upwards movement is Bryan\u2019s only warning. A deafening crunch is accompanied by a jarring quake. A glistening wall of white appears right next to Bryan\u2019s immobile arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelps in terror upon realizing it is a tooth. He had nearly been bitten in half! The teeth move away, pulling the bite free. He watches as the lips close, just as the tongue heaves the bite towards the molars. Though he can see outside, his only view is of the massive Sean, and cheese still holds his entire body hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show is not over either. As Sean begins to chew, his lips part with every movement of his jaws. Loud smacking assaults Bryan\u2019s ears as he is unable to tear his gaze away from the mouth. He can see the food, with each appearance it is less recognizable, flatter and soggier. The display is disgusting, especially at such a terrifying scale. Bryan notes it is a mere preview of what he would soon experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips purse shut and a wet gulp is audible. The lips part with a gusting sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain of food is gone. The tongue shifts in the darkness; Sean\u2019s straight white teeth the only thing truly discernible beyond the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan braces for the next bite that will undoubtedly deliver him between the destructive jaws. Instead of moving forward, Sean\u2019s other hand appears. Clasped in his fingers is an airplane sized nacho, a pool of dip glistening on its surface. The immense mouth widens, and the tongue slides forward. Bryan is disgusted to see strands of saliva stretch down the extended tongue. Soggy chunks of bread, beef, and lettuce are spread haphazardly across the tongue, with larger piles lining the sides by the molars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back an arch of pink and a gently swaying uvula frame the blackness of the throat. Bryan knew it lead into the depths of this young man\u2019s body. As a crunch blasted from ahead, Bryan sunk into deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he would follow that bite of burger and this nacho, down the esophagus and into the stomach. This guy would gulp him down and wouldn\u2019t even notice. He wouldn\u2019t know the bite from any other. He probably wouldn\u2019t even remember the meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor him, it\u2019s just a regular barbecue!\u201d Bryan thinks in defeat. How had his incredible discovery landed him here!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tremor returns him to reality. Ahead Sean\u2019s lips are parted, showing his mouth which is once more empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels himself moving forward as the cavern ahead widens. A foul wind floods his nose as he nears. Bryan however is in shock and doesn\u2019t react. He only has one thought as he passes into Sean\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy has really nice teeth!\u201d noting the lack of fillings in the towering, sharp edges of the molars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crunch, louder as it echoes around the mouth, stuns Bryan further. After a fleeting moment, chaos erupts. Crunches rumble in the darkness and Bryan feels himself moving randomly. Unable to control his trajectory, he begins screaming in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple seconds he lands on something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA molar.<br>\r\nBryan is totally unprepared for what happens next. Laughter explodes around him, as light floods the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels humiliated. He could not leave this world in a worse way. And though surely coincidence, this giant is laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thundering guffaw shakes him free, sending him\u2026</span></div></div>",

With a splat he lands roughly on the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\" he roars indignantly as the lips come together, sealing him in darkness once more. As he is re-launched into the hectic motions of chewing, his screams are mixed with sobs of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he feels the food abruptly pushed to the back of the mouth he lets out a final plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE! PLEASE DON\u2019T EAT ME!\u201d he wails. For an instant there is nothing, and Bryan foolishly allows himself to hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet squelch he is sucked into the throat, disappearing with the soggy mountain of chewed food. His agonized scream echoes for a single second amongst the chewed remains in Sean\u2019s cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later light floods the mouth as a massive nacho piled with salsa is shoved into the mouth, a crunch sounding as the jagged teeth come together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean chews absently as he listens to his friends. He cannot feel the bite of burger\u2019s descent into his chest. As the bite lands in his stomach, almost everything is drowned out by the sound of him munching on the nacho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan continues to plead for help from within Sean\u2019s stomach.  Sean however is preoccupied with an argument about which zombie video game was the best. He is completely oblivious to the drama playing out deep within his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean continues to wolf down his burger and nachos as Bryan struggles within the stomach. Troy offers him a beer, which Sean gladly accepts after putting his second burger together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a swig of beer, Sean can feel it soothingly flow down his throat. The liquid floods his stomach, leveling the mountain of food that Bryan had been climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into the next burger, creates a perfect storm for his unnoticed passenger. The tiny scientist is treading beer as chunks of burger and nacho rain down from above, threatening to strike him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean pops the last bite of burger into his mouth, chewing loudly before gulping it down and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude that was perfect!\u201d he says to Kyle as he cradles his full belly. Kyle grins and shrugs his mouth full as he\u2019s only halfway through his second burger. Sean slurps down some beer and tosses a nacho into his mouth, chewing as he took in the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that you\u2019re all calmed down, I wanna take a picture,\u201d Kyle said, putting down his sandwich. Sean shrugged in agreement. Troy and Kyle sat next to him and Kyle held out his phone and snapped a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReviewing it showed the three young men in their prime, grinning happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an awesome weekend!\u201d Troy shouted to the sky. \u201cHell yeah!\u201d Kyle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean grinned at his friends. \u201cThis weekend will be perfect!\u201d he thought happily.

Following an abrupt collision, he finds himself stuck in place, as he's still drenched in saliva. Dazed, he groans in confusion as a thunderous voice shakes his world. In his blurred vision he makes out a rough hand approaching quickly. His scream is unnecessary as it sweeps below him before retreating. Above him, a crunch of lettuce is accompanied by small but noticeable movements. As Bryan's head clears he realizes he is stuck to the shirtless giant's chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight upwards he can see the fuzzy jaw as it shifts, a muted crunch with each movement. A bob of the Adam's apple precedes a loud gulp and Bryan swears he can hear the food being squeezed into the chest and landing with a plop in the stomach below. The colossus, unconcerned with the workings of his digestive system, takes another large bite out of his burger. Bryan stares, transfixed from his perch below. The giant, unaware of his captivated audience starts to talk loudly with his equally massive friends. His voice reverberates through Bryan, whose tiny form remains thankfully in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle makes quick work of his burger. Popping the last bite into his mouth, he reaches across the table to make another burger as he chews. \"Dude!\" Kyle grunts through a full mouth. Sean and Troy turn to look at him. *Munch, munch!* \"We gotta go...\"*Gulp!* \"hiking to the lake tomorrow.\" Sean nods enthusiastically while Troy shrugs, a nacho in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as <i>someone</i> doesn't get hungover, I'm sure it won't be a problem!\" Troy pops the nacho into his mouth with a crunch while eying Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean glares back jokingly, \"It's only my sixth one!\" he says through a full mouth, spewing crumbs at Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy makes a face *Gulp!*\"If you fuck yourself up, I'm not carrying you anywhere!\" he wipes his cheek with his hand. \"Swallow before you speak man!\" he says, genuinely annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a serious problem,\" Kyle nods in agreement as he starts in on his second burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys continue to chat and laugh as they finish off their meal. Later the sun is sinking towards the horizon and a cool breeze blows through the camp. Kyle shudders, goosebumps erupting across his exposed chest. He stands up and rushes towards the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys gonna build a fire?\" he calls behind him. Without waiting for an answer he ducks into their shared tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle decides to...</span></div></div>",

He was terrified if he should try to move, he would plummet from his rather safe and lofty perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he was forced to wait as the titan devoured mountains of food. Bryan was glad he had gotten that bit of meat; whether or not it had been worth being nearly eaten and trapped on some oblivious giant's chest remained to be decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three voices thundered around Bryan, he struggled to decide how to contact one of these giants. Even if he had their attention, how would he get his message across? He really wasn't sure about that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to focus on getting someone's attention first\" he thought determinedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to set, Bryan was still plastered to the chest, unnoticed. He watched the young men talk and laugh with each other. From his safe vantage point it was almost easy to forget what destructive and terrifying beings the giants were. From here they were simply a group of friends hanging out for the weekend. However the occasional gurgle from the digesting meal in Kyle's stomach reminded Bryan just how dangerous every little thing they did could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool breeze buffeted the tiny man, and he felt the skin beneath him bunch up into small hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goosebumps!\" Bryan laughed at the magnified display at his size. He also felt his bonds loosen with the shifting skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Bryan shouted in surprise, his fear of falling returning full force. He reached for something to hold as the colossus began to walk. A few small hairs proved to be poor grips. With each step he felt his hands slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly noticing the light had gotten dimmer, Bryan looks around to see gray in every direction. He feels his grip slip, as the wall he had been stuck to tilts sharply. Bryan lets out a scream as he tumbles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment he realizes he had gently come to a stop far sooner than he had expected Looking around he realizes Kyle had laid down, because he was inside the mountainous gray tent! Bryan had merely slipped partway down his chest. Standing up Bryan sees he stands on Kyle's toned stomach. Ahead of him the chest rises and falls with every heaving breath. It is a truly living landscape. Beneath his feet Bryan can hear violent gurgles as Kyle's meal from earlier is broken down out of sight. He shudders and rushes forward, eager to escape the frightening noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passes over the ribs, Kyle's breathing becomes a thundering snore. Bryan's clasps his hands over his tiny ears and presses on. He cannot stop, he has to make contact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the neck without a problem, Bryan bypasses the Adam's Apple. He comes to the coarse, black stubble and without hesitating pushes into it. Bryan is running on Adrenaline as he feels he is nearing salvation. Using the hairs, he mounts the chin. Ahead he can see the parted lips, looking like small pink hills. The nose appears to be two pitch black caverns, a few small boogers caught in the hairs appearing like wild foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother deafening snore shakes the \"ground\", sending Bryan to his knees. The following gust of breath reeks of burger meat and salsa, causing Bryan to grimace in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can get up and continue moving, Troy pops his head into the tent and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan walked towards the mountainous patty in a daze. Its coating of glistening grease beckoned him forward. His starved mind dismissed all other thoughts. That is until he stumbled forward with a yelp, landing painfully on his knees. He glared at the culprit: a simple splinter that was over half as long as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shook his head, the small splinter reminding him of his grim reality. Oh sure he wanted food. But more importantly he <i>needed</i> rescue. He could eat after he had gotten someone to help him out. That needed to be his main priority!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan scanned the table, searching for a good spot to be seen. In spite of his new-found resolve, Bryan still couldn't keep his mouth from watering. It was impossible to ignore the colorful spread of delectable picnic foods that towered over him like mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill searching, Bryan noticed a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye. He immediately froze, turning his head to discover the source. Another flash of movement near the food caught his full attention: an ant. Bryan quickly realized he could spot a few across the table, the creatures had already discovered the meal laid out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d thundered one of the titans. Bryan spun around to see the shirtless one staring triumphantly at the iPhone in his hand. He strolls back to the table with his friends, tapping away on the device. Bryan gasps as they approach. Bryan had expected them not to seem so terrifyingly tall after climbing to this height. However they still towered above like moving skyscrapers, casting large shadows over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle snapped the picture of the tabletop displaying the meal he had put together, before dropping his phone into his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean glared at him, \u201cYou made us wait to eat and search all over so you could take a single fucking picture?!\u201d he asked in disbelief. Kyle waved him away dismissively. \u201cShut up Sean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re starving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud gurgle sounded from Sean\u2019s midsection. He laughed \u201cI think my stomach begs to differ! Hell, I feel like I could eat this whole table of food!\u201d Sean stares greedily at the spread of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down fatass,\u201d Troy said calmly as he pushed between Sean and Kyle and began building a burger. Following his lead, Sean and Kyle join Troy at the table and as they all sit down to seat, their conversation from earlier starts up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had run around ineffectually waving his arms when the giants had approached the table. They had been too preoccupied with their small argument, their eyes never dropping to the surface of the table. Bryan couldn\u2019t suppress a yelp as the tattooed one sat at the table first. His large hand soared above, each finger stretching several city blocks. He watched dumbfounded as the titans began constructing their mammoth burgers. Each titan effortlessly lifted various food items that were easily larger than a city park. Bryan simply could not get used to the power these giants had and yet were so clueless to. <br>\r\nEven worse though, was that Bryan was making no progress. Multiple times it seemed their eyes had focused on his very spot, before flicking away. Bryan was completely beneath their notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here!\u201d he yelled furiously \u201cI\u2019m right in front of you! Why can\u2019t you see me?\u201d He spun around, trying desperately to find a good perch or something to be easier to see. However the flat expanse  of the table gave him nothing to work with.  The only elevated surfaces Bryan saw were on the various plates of food. But watching the giants snatch away the buns, patties, and veggies without so much as a passing glance gave him chills. Trying to be seen amongst their meal simply wouldn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monstrous squish and crunch sounded behind him. He spun around to see the shirtless giant chewing through his first bite of burger. A piece of lettuce hangs from his lips, smeared with mayo. As Bryan watches, Kyle\u2019s tongue slips out of his mouth like a snake to catch the loose piece of food. He laps at the smeared mayo on his lips, revealing the already deformed bite of burger in his mouth. Having caught the stray lettuce, the tongue retreats into the mouth as Kyle resumes chewing. All that remains are a few stray globs of mayo clinging to Kyle\u2019s trimmed beard. Kyle doesn\u2019t seem to notice as he chuckles at whatever his friends were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that Bryan realizes he is surrounded by the sounds of chewing. He spins around to see Sean grunting as he chews. He stops suddenly, bringing a chip piled with salsa to his lips. His mouth opens, revealing the soggy half-chewed piles of burger waiting to be swallowed. Sean simply tosses the chip into his mouth, content to let it mix together as he chewed. He struggles for a second to swallow all the food in his mouth. Before sinking his teeth into the delicious burger again, Sean\u2019s voice thunders across the table as he talks with his friends. Bryan can see bits of food flying out of his mouth that rain onto the table below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally turns to face Troy, who is clearly the fastest eater in the group. He is holding a single bite sized piece between his fingers as he chews. Bryan stares at it intently. The thing is large enough to feed him for months easily. And this giant would down it in a single, effortless bite. Troy gulps, his prominent Adam\u2019s Apple bobbing. His eyes flick to the final bite of burger. As he returns to the conversation with his friends, his hand swings downward, dipping the bite of food into a lake of ketchup. His hand shifts, hovering his bite of food over the table. Bryan notices a scavenging ant in the burger\u2019s shadow. Its antennae start moving quickly as if in reaction to the nearby food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy\u2019s grip unexpectedly loosens, dropping the bite of burger onto the table. \u201cOOPS!\u201d Troy booms, gingerly picking it up, happy to see it hadn\u2019t fallen apart. As he lifts it skyward, Bryan can see furious struggles in the ketchup: the ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy, unaware of the latest addition to his food brings the burger to his lips. Bryan, still able to see the ant\u2019s fruitless struggles, starts to shout \u201cEw! No, don\u2019t e-\u201c he stops as Troy\u2019s mouth opens, his tongue sliding forward, soggy bits of bread and meat clinging to its surface. Bryan watches in terror as Troy pushes the food between his parted jaws. The struggling ant is visible until Troy\u2019s lips come together and begins to chew. The behemoth doesn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary as he chews. He speaks with a full mouth, pausing mid-sentence to swallow. Before long, Troy is pushing a chip with salsa into his maw, unaware of the life he had just unceremoniously gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan backs away. The colossal college students already overlooked him. Now it was clear that the simplest of actions like walking or eating could be incredibly dangerous. That could have been him being devoured unnoticed like a crumb! Bryan realizes with a sinking feeling he has no feasible plan. Around him, the monstrous young men continue to feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy swallows the last bite of his burger, coughing as he feels a tickle in his throat. Unaware of the ant he had just gulped down, Troy dismisses the feeling as he pops a nacho into his mouth. He continues chatting with his friends, all three unaware of the horrific display they are giving their unnoticed guest as they scarf down their meals. Troy is not the only one who sends a hapless ant on a one way trip to their gut amongst mountains of chewed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, I never even posted that pic of the food!\u201d Kyle said suddenly, reaching into his pocket to retrieve his phone. \u201cFuck I thought there was a signal here!\u201d he muttered disappointedly, placing the phone on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! End of the world, can\u2019t post the pic!\u201d Sean said sarcastically through a full mouth. Kyle snorted in annoyance but gave no more reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if we go on that hike, I bet you\u2019d get a signal at the top of the hill,\u201d Troy said, second burger in hand.  Kyle nodded, \u201cYeah you\u2019re probably ri-\u201c He abruptly stops to smash his thumb onto a wandering ant. \u201cAugh fucking ants!\u201d he says unhappily glaring at the flattened bug plastered to his thumb. \u201cWhere there\u2019s one, there\u2019s a million!\u201d Kyle says as he wipes his thumb on the side of the table. \u201cYou might even be eating some!\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy shrugs \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter. They\u2019re just ants\u2026 just a little more protein to digest!\u201d he says unconcerned, rubbing his stomach.  \u201cNow about that hike\u2026\u201d Troy begins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tries to keep himself calm, unable to think of a realistic course of action. As if on cue, the shirtless giant placed his phone onto the table with a resounding smack, before returning to the conversation with his friends. Bryan sighed dejectedly; the giant hadn\u2019t even glanced down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then an idea sparked a flame of hope. This giant, like many his age, spent a lot of time staring at his phone. And that phone was conveniently lying on the table not far away at all. Bryan started sprinting across the table to the monolithic phone as his mind fleshed out the details of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earth-shattering thud breaks his focus and sends Bryan sprawling onto his knees. Not far away, the shirtless giant has his thumb pressed to the table. Bryan is awed simply by the enormity of his hand. Lifting away, the pulverized corpse of an ant was revealed on the thumb. Bryan shuddered; that easily could have been him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did these giants not realize how exceedingly huge and monstrous they were in this world? They were taking lives without even noticing. If they did notice, they didn\u2019t even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get noticed for what I am now!\u201d Bryan panicked, resuming his sprint across the table.</span></div></div>",

Before looking away he notices a pale speck moving across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Kyle moved his thumb over the bug to smash it. Just before crushing the thing out of existence he stops. He had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Troy,\u201d Kyle says slyly. Troy looks up with a grunt, still wolfing down his burger. \u201cYou said you don\u2019t mind some extra protein right?\u201d Troy gives him a quizzical look, nodding as he gulps down the food in his mouth. \u201cProve it, try this one!\u201d Kyle says, pointing at the pathetic bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sean and Troy lean in to get a closer look, it flees away from the group. \u201cIt knows!\u201d Sean laughs \u201cRun little bug!

In order to approach the table, Bryan would first encounter the giant wielding the bug spray. This behemoth by all accounts made the teeny man most nervous. His copious amount of tattoos, both on his calves and arms that depicted scenes of fiery skulls, brazen designs, and mythical beasts, coupled with the seemingly never ending stream of toxins he kept spraying, made the table an unappetizing target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned his judgement towards the more direct route: the grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shitting Christ... He's a damn monster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view sent a tingle down his tiny spine. His tremendous back facing Bryan, the titan stood before the huge grill, shifting constantly as he worked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided he must be some sort of athlete, at the very least. His thick legs coated in tangle of dark hairs and hard with muscle, while his shirtless torso presented an impressive physique. The monumental young man was both awesome in sight and positively intimidating. Bryan couldn't help but feel aroused looking at this living mountain; but knew better than to tarry and kept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant in question turned suddenly, grinning, and boomed. \"ALMOST DONE, THESE ARE GONNA BE GREAT.\" Loud comments thundered in reply from the two seated behemoths. The shirtless one plucked a bag of wheat buns from the table and plopped it onto the ground near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched the huge, oblivious face turn back out of view to the smoldering patties once more. He suddenly felt a twinge of hunger, quickly reminding him of why he came. Thoughts of juicy hamburgers invaded the shrunken man's mind, his gait slowing and saliva pooling in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! I am famished... It feels like years since I last ate!\" He whined, looking with moist eyes at the towering grill protected by the gigantic shirtless hulk. \"I wish I was invited to eat!\" His eyes flitted to the misshapen bag of buns, laying near the giant's right shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wasn't invited, he could always snatch a crumb or two! Bryan pictured himself stealing away like Zorro, purloined food in-hand. He afforded himself a giggle at such an image. Then he realized that he might be forced into such acts, like some kind of common insect. All while these guys continued their outdoor fun, thoroughly oblivious to Bryan's insignificant theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that his mere presence here was utterly unknown to these campers made him feel slightly sheepish. He was, after all, literally creeping around and spying upon them - regardless of his intentions for innocent rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had halted: not even halfway there, with many more leagues remaining between his tiny self and the grill. He shook himself from his thoughts and began running once more. He had to keep moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRescue was imminent - or was it?</span></div></div>",

Bryan seemed to recall during his research of tiny creatures and reducing matter in size, that smaller creatures had different perceptions of time. He had no idea if this was true, but it seemed evident by the giant's sluggish movements and thunderous voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured over these theories, keeping his eyes fixed on the shirtless giant before him and his body in constant motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape was tricky for his tiny form. Indentations had been left by giant footwear had become intermingled into a mess of hills and dales. It proved irksome, and Bryan found himself running on level ground only to be sliding or climbing an incline moments later. Pebbles the size of houses and smaller dotted the land, while twigs and fragmented leaves made hefty obstacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bryan noticed a shadow coat his immediate vicinity. From above landed a tremendous structure that crashed into the ground before him. Bryan screamed, flying backwards and painfully landing on his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in God's name?\" He said, sputtering. Covered in dirt, Bryan brushed it away and gazed at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cylindrical object that loomed over a hundred feet. Strangest of all, it was a bright shade of red that seemed familiar somehow and appeared to be made of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...THERE IT IS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed one more, cowering when a humongous hand lowered from the sky and grasped the red structure with ease, lifting it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge appendage deposited the red cap onto the bench and then reached for a tower of insect repellent set near it. Bryan cried out in dismay, realizing he had inadvertently placed himself in the vicinity of the tattooed giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, Troy lay off that damn spray already, will ya?\" Sean said, frowning as he attempted to clear the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the repellent cap back onto the bench, Troy grunted and resumed his application of bug spray. He was on his third coat; having already covered his limbs twice since they arrived. Sean looked up from his phone, aware of the continued spraying and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're gonna put me in a coma!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy paused briefly. \"Fuck you. These bugs are giving me hell, I fucking need all I can get.\" Two short sprays later, he looked up once more. \"...I just have to cover my legs, just hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, the blond metalhead began generously covering his exposed calves. Both were heavily tattooed; both of which he had designed himself and enjoyed showing off. Finishing his left, he moved on to his right, quickly but thoroughly coating it with the noxious repellent. Finished, Troy happened to glance at the ground near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" He stared down at the weird creature. It was small; like, really fucking small. Troy began to leaned in closer before relenting. \"Damn bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised the can of repellent over the tiny bug. Without so much as a thought, he depressed the button and unleashed a cloud of toxins over the ground. Sitting up, Troy snatched the cap, covered the can as he stood up, and crossed the campsite to put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gawked with amazement at the colossus before him. He snapped out of it and began attempting to gain attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Help me! Heeelp! Down here!\" The shrunken genius hopped excitedly, flailing his limbs and thrashing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearest him was an enormous black sneaker. The suede surface was covered in dust and dirt, worn patches and fraying cords spotted it. Stretching out and high into the sky was a tower of painted flesh. A hellish image of piled skulls and demonic creatures spanned across it. Bryan was able to discern the word \"SLAYER\" painted in the center of a barbaric pentagram. Higher up, past the summit of the giant's knees, Bryan could see his giant face looking over the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant opened his mouth, emitting a throng of thunder that was impossible to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look doooowwn! I'm right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to his plea, the titanic metalhead turned his attention downwards, grasping the can of repellent in one hand. Bryan took cover when a torrent of noxious spray burst forth, misting over the giant's calves and lightly sprinkling the ground. The tiny man cried out, covering his mouth to keep his mouth clean. He looked up, tears and mucus streaming over his face. The giant remained oblivious; continuing his work and never glancing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Bryan inhaled once more, much to his disdain because of the putrid air, and prepared to cry out. Shifting his huge eyes, Bryan felt them lock onto him. He returned the gaze, feeling like a tiny human staring into the face of God.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes! I am a person! You have to help me! Oh, please, help me!\" Bryan yelled with all his might. He couldn't believe it - he was saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had a face of planetary proportions. It would easily rival the moon, Bryan knew, and would take just as much effort to explore. He watched the thick blond brow come together, furrowing and creasing the tremendous forehead like the wall of a canyon. Long, bushy sideburns framed the stern face, reaching across the huge jaw before meeting in a strip of hair underneath the massive lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the face neared, Bryan screamed louder and louder. He was scared beyond his wits, but knew this was the closest he had ever come. Surely fate would not screw him now? He waited for the young giant to save him, taking him home to be returned to normal and end this nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan saw nothing but callous disinterest in the giant eyes. A stylized image of a police officer drawn to resemble a pig covered the titan's black t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me already!\" The tiny scientist demanded, becoming impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the huge, chapped lips parted in response and dashed Bryan's hopes completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN BUGS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly and without warning came the nozzle of the immense can of repellent. It hovered directly overhead - so close that an errant drip from it crashed into the ground nearby with a hefty <i>thud</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the dirt-crusted finger pressed down and unleashed a tidal force upon the bug-sized man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was sent backwards. He whipped through the air violently, crashing back into the dirt many dozens of feet away, completely soaked in the slimy toxins. He imagined some broken bones, or perhaps the bruises would be the worst. Rubbing his eyes clean, he found he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench creaked deeply in protest when the giant raised himself from it. Standing higher than Bryan could fully comprehend, loomed the callous young man. \"...he-...help...heeelpp....\" His tiny croaks were weak and rasping. \"...<i>pleeaseee</i>.... <i>hel</i>-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer interested in the tiny world below, the giant lifted his shoe in preparation to move. Once again, Bryan devolved into high-pitched screams. The sky became darkened. High above, the sole of the giant's sneaker dominated everything. Bits of nature were crammed into the deep tread: dirt, pebbles, grass, and smashed bugs. It was a horrific sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please, I just want... to... go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it lifted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lay there, still tumbled, now pressed into the dirt, but alive and intact. He felt the pounding footsteps slowly lessen, before he was left to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him, the distinct pattern of tread was pressed into the dry dirt. Bryan truly realized his size, noting that he had been fortunate enough to end up in one of the raised indentations; specifically, in-between the lugs of tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSore, but able, Bryan rose up and looked around. He decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Using the spatula, Kyle applies pressure to each patty. The sound of crackling grease and fat sending his mind into quasi-primal hunger induced thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done,\" He announces, turning to grin at his buddies. \"These are gonna be great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy pauses his incessant application of bug spray to roll his eyes. \"Uh-huh, too bad we'll be dust and bones before we eat 'em...\" Sean snorts in agreement, extending his hand to grab his half-empty beer. He barely begins to swallow when suddenly he coughs it up. \"Troy, goddammitt!\" Glaring, Sean waves his hand to clear the air. \"Why the hell are you spraying that shit on the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your cool! I just saved our table from some ants,\" Sean followed his buddies gaze to the surface of the table just as Troy sweeps a few twitching specks off with his hand. \"Tiny bastards are all over the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, Troy continues coating himself with the repellant, ignoring the grumbles and curses as Sean wipes beer from his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ignores them both, knowing better, and snatches the bag of burger buns from the table. \"Dude! Sean, grab the cheese and lettuce,\" He says matter-of-factly with a nod to the plastic cooler. Kyle drops the bag next to his feet, not noticing as crumbs fall around his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, of course, your Majesty!\" Says Sean sarcastically, leaning over to drag the beat-up container closer before opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight, bro! I'm the cook, I'm the fucking king!\" He gives himself an ostentatious thumb to the chest with a grin. Both Troy and Sean snort with disbelief as the sizzling meat dominates the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man ignored the titanic commotion caused by the two seated giants. Each sound was increased to thunderous volume, sounding more like deeps booms of distant artillery than two guys having a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even caught a few words that were understandable. Boisterous slang, and even what sounded like a name. Then one word made his blood run cold, \"Ants\" - and he glanced upwards to look at the tattooed giant. Bryan gasped, in-taking breath to scream otherwise when he realized the frightening behemoth wasn't even looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-...!\" Screamed the tiny bug-sized man as three large shapes were sent hurtling to the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey contacted the ground with sickening thuds. One landed near him, the others farther away. Bryan peeked from under his raised limbs and gasped at the twitching creature. It was an ant. Coated in dirt and sticky with some kind of noxious residue; it twitched painfully, curling and contorting in the grip of death. Glancing upwards showed the tattooed giant callously uninterested in the tiny victim, already moved on as he continued his conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cringed. He couldn't help but feel thankful in a selfish sort of way. It had not been him who was so cruelly disposed of; just a common ant - yet, he still felt sickened by the act. The way in which this creature - larger than a car to him - was so mercilessly removed from the giant's sight. It made him queasy, but his mind told him otherwise. \"I'm not an ant. Even if I am smaller, they will see me!\" His statement lacked weight, and he knew it, but the shrunken man continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a moment later, the world quaked with a tremendous thud. Bryan screamed as he fell back, coughing from a cloud of fine dirt that settled around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger than a football stadium - or even a mountain, it seemed - stood an enormous white skate shoe that towered barely a hundred feet ahead.  It was colossal, like a building with deep stitching of cable-like threads stretched to their limits, the thick white leather creased and scuffed from everyday use. Bryan felt his sense of preservation telling him to flee. Out of sheer terror and awe, he wanted to just run away like the minuscule insect he had become. Bryan pulled himself up, nervously scanning the once white wall of rubber coated with dirt from the campground. The mountainous shoe creaked and groaned as the owner shifted his colossal weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an gritty grind, the sneaker lifted upwards in a gusting whoosh and crashed down further away. The quaking thud almost knocked Bryan from his feet, who looked at the massive shoe as disrupted dirt settled around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he snapped from his trance and looked towards the now visible mass of plastic containing the burger buns. His gaze caught not by the multitude of crumbs strewn around it, but by slight movement both around and on the bag. It seemed Bryan wasn't the only one interested in a quick snack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ants!\" Bryan's realization was nothing short of exasperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scavengers mingled through the battlefield of crumbs that ranged from Bryan's size to building size. Two ants closest to him worked together to transport a crumb four times their size. They passed others who greedily excavated the fallen crumbs, some picking smaller pieces up, while others rallied their comrades for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling booms of deep speech roared from above, sounding like thunder from an oncoming storm. Looking up, the tiny man watches the giant white shoe raise from the dusty ground. The giant's towering leg swings like a skyscraper-sized pendulum lifting the huge skate shoe crashes down on the ants and crumbs with a reverberating thud. The tiny scientist feared he would be next, but realized the exact opposite when an enormous hand lowered from the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers were longer than buildings, coated in a sheen of grease and dirt. Dark hairs coated the hand like foliage coating a mountain-side. It soared downwards, headed for the huge bag of buns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening crinkle of plastic echoed all around, as the misshapen bag relinquished a set of continental-sized burger buns to the titan's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ceremony, the hand raised back into the sky, effortlessly lifting the monumental bun. It was simply amazing to Bryan that these giants had no inkling the power they commanded. More crumbs rained down, falling like spongy meteor upon the dirt and bouncing off the huge sneaker. High above, the sound of the oblivious titan's laughter boomed accompanied by his equally huge buddies. The giant shifts again, lifting his gargantuan shoe as he returns his attention to the grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stretch of land where the shoe had been was now shaped into the pattern of the sneaker tread. None of the crumbs remained, and only a few squirming ants littered the stomped area. From his position, Bryan could make out the hills and dales of dirt as zig-zagging patterns deeper than irrigation canals. He realized with a shudder that the entire area was coated in various angles of the pattern, distorted and scuffed as the careless guy pounded around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels like running once more. This all seemed too impossible! How could he ever expect to gain even an ounce of acknowledgment from this massive brute? This guy was too fucking big. Bryan couldn't even look up past the giant's towering legs that seemed to go on forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose crumbs were larger than he was and the giant didn't even notice as he obliterated them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts shriek to a halt when he notices the massive bag again. It lay slumped over, the opening flush with the dusty earth and part of a bun exposed. If anything, Bryan could reach it with relative ease! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can run for it,\" He said. His tiny eyes flitting from the bun to the terrifyingly huge sneakers towering close-by. \"This is my chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to over think it, Bryan began sashaying madly across the expanse of roughly patterned dirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Running, leaping, and more often than not stumbling brought the tiny scientist across the swatch of land between him and his goal. He had to reach it; he <i>would</i> reach it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal bag of burger buns lay haphazardly piled in the dirt. Transparent plastic making up the opening mingled with the gusty dirt, allowing anything small easy entry. This was Bryan's plan. Climb the bag and then one of the magnificently huge buns. It wasn't perfect, but just having a target in general gave the shrunken man hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down another of many inclines pressed in the dirt, Bryan began scampering up the next immediate slope just as the ground beneath him shifted. He surprised himself, jumping off the twitching dirt just as a submerged ant broke through the crest of dirt, clashing and clicking angrily. Bryan dared a look back before reaching the top and nearly falling down the next slope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh, crap! I'm almost there!\" He heaved, pressing on against the debilitating terrain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, thunder rolled down from the heavens. The speck of a man was too engrossed to listen to the looming giants and their monumental conversation. Thankfully the one nearby remained still, save for minor shifts of his gigantic feet. The two at the table seemed to be making a commotion about the food, while the one looming over Bryan and the grill talked about a cellphone. The comprehensible booming was far and few, but regardless of his journey, Bryan picked up a few words. He even heard some names. <i>Sean</i> and <i>Kyle</i>, it sounded like. Such average names seemed ridiculous to be applied to these massive and powerful beings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ant nearly threw Bryan over as it hurried along, vanishing over each rough incline far easier than himself. Many ants were heaving to and fro, some running aimlessly while others worked at the dry ground to pull their injured comrades free. Bryan ignored them, skirting around the twitching carapaces that dotted the dirt. He couldn't afford to worry about these stupid bugs when he himself was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tumultuous terrain suddenly came to a stop. The tiny man blinked, looking ahead and seeing his destination a mere parks-length away. It was quick work, as the towering titan hadn't chanced to land his mega-sized feet here and compact the dirt beneath his tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hallelujah!\" Bryan squeaked as he ascended the sloping plastic mountain. \"Majestic mountains of fucking bread!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirt had been splashed over the slick surface, allowing a much easier pace for Bryan who only slid a couple times. It was as if God himself was holding Bryan's hand, spurring his minute efforts on, that he made his way up to a building of brownish crust. It was huge. Easily dozens of times his insignificant height, and spanning limitless in either direction. Like some kind of yeasty-baked Berlin wall.  Bryan jumped at it, feeling invigorated by his progress, and dug his hands into the soft surface with relative ease. And, it was rather easy: as he climbed, he simply poked through the crust with each foot and hand. He had already climbed well over a dozen feet before another climber rudely crossed his path, nearly dislodging him into a terrifying free-fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan hissed at the ant as it effortlessly climbed. It seemed to him the mindless bug was just wanting to show off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resumed. Poking, pulling, poking, and pulling. The top was soon one more poke-and-pull which Bryan flung himself over breathlessly. \"Thank Christ...I made it,\" He celebrated, lifting his weary self up and looking around. \"Now to figure out what to do next!\" Gazing over a lovely stretch of white, spongy bread was the golden domed mountain of the top bun. It reminded him of a stadium more than anything, but larger than any one he could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding upon that, Bryan began awkwardly stepping forward to cross the deeply perforated surface. He had just paused to gaze down such a hole, when a quaking crash sent him reeling. Bits of fine dirt settled over the spongy bun, irritating Bryan's eyes. He kept his balance and turned around with a gasp. More dirt settled around the stained white rubber sole supporting a sneaker that rested over almost all the land Bryan had just been traversing. He breathed in, shuddering at the sight of the creased white leather bending and stretching against the giant's step. This sight alone was enough to bring Bryan back to the harsh reality of his minuscule world. Staring dumbly, he failed to notice until too late the rest of the towering guy leaning high above, reaching down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the displacement of air, Bryan shot his attention skywards with a surprised scream. Looming now directly above him was the same hand he saw craning down from afar. Fingertips coated in grimy grease and dirt were attached to five stretching towers of flesh that connected with a palm big enough to blot out the sky. Dropping to his butt, the bug-sized scientist began a lengthy babble of shrieky nonsense as he scanned every callous and wrinkle on the giant surface above. It was all for naught. The massive hand descended, each colossal finger digging around the buns respectively with cataclysmic result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was entirely more terrifying than Bryan had planned, but in order to be seen, the giant had to lift him up with the bun! \"Ohhhh nooo!\" Bryan couldn't help but cry as he felt an intensity of vertigo crash against him as the giant lifted the buns off the ground. Memories of riding his one and only roller coaster came to him. <i>The vertigo...the rush of wind...the fear</i>. It was too much then, and this was so far beyond that experience, Bryan couldn't help but feel nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWind and g-forces buffeted him, pressing his frail body into the spongy surface as he rapidly ascended thousands of feet. Everything was cast in ominous semi-shadow by the huge palm hovering above. An oomph of air escaped his tiny body as everything came to an abrupt halt. Rough vibrations followed, and the huge hand above lifted as the giant transferred the buns to his other hand. Rough fingertips appeared, poking around the flat surface of white bread to hold it from beneath. Bryan watched the domed bun pull away, held by massive fingers that carried it off to open space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything shuddered and shifted as the giant relaxed his hand slightly, giving Bryan a stunning view of the fuming hot grill far below. Huge red coals coughed out heat, glowing dangerously beneath pylons of blackened iron that spanned over the massive grill. He watched the other hand place the upper bun upon these pylons. It pulled away again, vanishing from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was terrified, but snapped back in to action. He had to act fast! \"HEEEEEEEEEEELP!\" His scream increasing in volume as the reduced man rotated to the giant above him. Bryan immediately started, gasping at the huge man's visage now towering directly above like a climber at the base of a mountain. It was breath-taking, at the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" He pittered, gawking stupidly once more. Looking past the sloping mountains of muscle held beneath well-defined pecs coated with jet-black forests of hair, Bryan was utterly awe-struck by the godly face towering high above. It seemed so close, yet stretched so far; so high, that he felt positively overwhelmed. How could he dare speak to this man? This titan? Bryan felt so small and weak being almost face-to-face with such a gargantuan being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to -- no, he <i>had</i> to! \"Please! Help me!!! Down here, look down!\" He begged. The massive plain shifted and swayed in the titan's grasp, constantly interrupting his desperate cries. \"Heeeeeeeyyy! You have to help me! Oh, God, please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the giant opened his mouth, his massive jaw working up and down as thunderous speech exploded out. Then the giant's eyes snapped onto Bryan. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then another speck of movement dashed past the strange one, immediately diverting Kyle's lofty attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted at it, feeling rather sheepish. \"Gross! Ants!\" Kyle said loudly, turning to the table. \"Damnit, Troy, you didn't get them all!\" Both his buddies stopped their actions and looked from him to the doughy bun in-hand. Kyle held it forward as evidence. \"Dude, your goddamm spraying isn't doing a thing.

You're right.\" Troy settled back again, merely offering a shrug a help in this problem when Sean loudly guffawed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told Kyle not to toss it, pointing at Troy as he voiced his solution. \"Yeah, Troy, he's right.

It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d He said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy frowned in disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019re both fuckin\u2019 cheapskates!\u201d he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean let out a small laugh before he started helping Kyle to investigate the remaining buns for ants. Meanwhile Troy looked down at the bun sitting in his open palm. Anyone giving it a passing glance wouldn\u2019t even notice the tiny insects making their way across the bread. His eyes followed an oddly colored ant as it moved across the bun towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot gonna eat you anymore!\u201d He grunted. As if in reaction, the bug stopped and after a second started squirming. It kind of looked like it was jumping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy cracked a smile. \u201cI see you!\u201d he said as he gingerly pinched the bug between his thumb and forefinger. He brought it closer towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being mistaken for an ant and being heartlessly offered to be eaten as a dare, Bryan had felt immense relief when the two giants refused to pay their tattooed friend to devour him. His head spun as the ants around him harvested crumbs and zipped about seemingly in search of an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was shaken from his thoughts as the titan\u2019s finger tips spread out further. Staring upwards revealed the hulking man to be staring at the bun, though his gaze wasn\u2019t focused on Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about it Bryan rushed forward, waving his arms frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDOWN HERE!! PLEASE!! I\u2019M NOT A BUG!!! I NEED HELP!!\u201d he shouted at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed manically as the colossus\u2019 piercing blue eyes snapped onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOT GONNA HEAT YOU ANYMORE!\u201d he thundered. The words hated Bryan in his tracks. Though undoubtedly good news; the fact that the giant was so indifferent about eating him or not was horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the thoughts out of his head, Bryan began leaping in the air while continuing to wave his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE!! I\u2019M NOT AN ANT!!\u201d he begged.<br>\r\nAbove, the massive lips stretched to bare his wall of teeth. They glinted with a sheen of saliva, and at this size the smile hardly appeared friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SEE YOU,\u201d he rumbled. Bryan felt relief flood his senses just before he was mowed down by a wall of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped within the mammoth\u2019s crushing grasp, Bryan couldn\u2019t even inhale to scream. So he struggled silently as he was lifted even higher to the inquisitive giant\u2019s distant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a weird looking bug\u2026\u201d Troy mumbled, \u201cI wonder what it is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTroy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy\u2019s head shot to the side to face Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget the bugs and help us set this shit up,\u201d he said, nodding towards the cooler holding all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, sure,\u201d Troy grunted in response, tossing the infested bun into the grass near the garbage can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his other hand he felt the minute struggles of the bug he had plucked from the bread. Without even thinking about it, Troy rubbed his fingers together to dispose of the odd insect. Indifferent to the small life he had needlessly extinguished, Troy simply brushed his fingertips on his shorts before stepping over to help his friends.</span></div></div>",

He eyed Troy and Kyle in annoyance before sighing dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! I\u2019ll match Kyle\u2019s $5\u201d he groaned in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just in time!\u201d Kyle said brightly, \u201cThe first burger patty is done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood dumbfounded at what he was hearing. After having his hopes dashed when the first giant had mistaken him for an ant, another giant had chimed in and dared their friend to eat the ant-infested bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection: the ant <i>and</i> shrunken-human-infested bun. Not that these massive meathead had noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously not an ant!\u201d Bryan fumed, \u201cJUST LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER YOU DENSE LOUTS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared upwards at the three titans who towered high above, faces bathed in shadow as they faced away from the warm sun. Their eyes were locked on each other as they discussed payment, ignorant to the minuscule scientist they were so apathetically condemning to be gulped down by Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the situation had become hopeless, Bryan began sprinting across the doughy surface to try and reach one of the distant fingertips. He stumbled as he ran but remained determined to escape before the behemoth started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGimme the bread!\u201d Kyle ordered, \u201cOtherwise your burger will burn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted the bottom bun toasted too!\u201d Troy whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, that\u2019ll kill the bugs! You gotta eat \u2018em fresh and alive!\u201d Sean replied tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Kyle echoed, holding his hand out for the bug-infested bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d Troy grumbled, \u201cLemme just put on some ketchup first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s lungs burned as he struggled to gulp in air. Though he wasn\u2019t a complete couch potato, he had never been one to spend much time on athleticism. Now he severely regretted skipping the gym so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitted landscape of the bread heaved up and down like a ship at sea with even the smallest of the titan\u2019s movements. Bryan willed his aching legs to keep up the pace. He was fast approaching the nearest finger. Once he latched himself to the hulking man\u2019s thick skin, he could determine his next move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo deep in his self-motivation, Bryan had failed to process any of the rumblings of conversation from the colossal men above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until a shadow fell over him and the entire landscape of the bread that he turned his gaze upwards. Still running he gasped upon seeing the nozzle of a ketchup bottle seemingly aimed right at him. It hovered like an alien ship, with dark-red, flakes of dried ketchup dotted with dust coating the rim of the bottle\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Bryan shrieked, never slowing his pace. That is, until he was swept under a wave of thick ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sean handed him the bottle of ketchup, Troy looked down to see one of the ants heading towards the edge of the bun. Well he assumed it was an ant, it was colored differently but Troy couldn\u2019t be bothered to properly identify the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot getting away so easily!\u201d he snickered. With that, he pointed the ketchup at the fleeing bug and smothered it in the condiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpread the ketchup with the patty,\u201d Troy ordered as he handed Kyle the bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle obliged, pushing the sizzling patty through the pile of ketchup to spread it across the bun. Taking it back, Troy quickly finished constructing his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon <i>brave man</i>, eat it!\u201d Kyle goaded him with an entertained grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook there\u2019s one of your little victims!\u201d Sean laughed as he pointed at Troy\u2019s burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy glanced at the black ant scuttling along the side of the bottom bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s where I\u2019ll start then!\u201d Troy chuckled with a shrug before lifting the sandwich to his mouth and taking a huge bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan squirmed, bathed in darkness within the burger. He had survived the tsunami of ketchup and the heat from what he could only assume was the arrival of the burger patty, but now he was trapped with no clue which direction was his best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered. Even if he knew which way to go, his chance of making it to safety before the monstrous young man gulped him down were slim to none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm his bleak outlook, Bryan\u2019s surroundings quaked violently. To accompany that was the distinct sound of crunching lettuce and squishing meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth had taken a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn\u2019t stop the sudden flood of emotions. Mere hours ago he'd been preparing to ship himself to his nephew! Yet it felt like a decade since Matt had come over unannounced, ruining everything! Now he was God-knows-where, beaten and bruised, trapped in some guy\u2019s burger about to be eaten as a bet! It was all so insane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quake shook Bryan to his core and he screeched in terror upon the appearance of an off-white wall just an arm\u2019s length away. Its rough ivory surface was unmistakable. It was one of the behemoth\u2019s teeth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teeth pulled away, easily removing what had been an impassable wall of meat for Bryan. He squinted as he was once more exposed to the bright sunlight. Straight ahead were the giant\u2019s lips, framed by traces of a 5\u2019o clock shadow. They shifted with each movement of the jaw, occasionally parting with an obnoxious smack to give Bryan a brief view of the food being decimated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shivered unintentionally at the sight. While his life hung in the balance, he felt even worse knowing it was simply quick entertainment for the young giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm!\u201d Troy moaned pointedly, grinning at his buddies as he swallowed his first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are such pussies! It just tastes like a regular burger!\u201d he laughed before sinking his teeth into the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep that shit up!\u201d Kyle dared in a faux-serious tone, \u201cYou won\u2019t get paid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy frowned playfully as he chewed. He shook his head as he gulped down his next bite. \u201cNah! I want my easy money!\u201d he shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his eyes to his sandwich where a lone black ant was climbing up the bread towards the exposed burger patty. With a snicker, Troy stuck his tongue out to lap the ant off his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelicious!\u201d he barked, smacking his licks obnoxiously. This elicited a chuckle from Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever! Seeing you act like an ass for $10 is worth it!\u201d he teased, before taking a swig from his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy flashed a goofy smile before taking another heaping bite of the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was still struggling to free himself from the dense ketchup when a wet gulp from ahead caused him to freeze in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gaped as the lips parted, presumably to engulf him and the burger. Instead he was blasted with the young man\u2019s deafening voice that showered him in warm spittle and bits of soggy burger. Bryan choked on the lingering smell of Troy\u2019s rancid breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Bryan shouted. At least he was pretty sure he was shouting, he couldn\u2019t hear his voice over the ringing in his ears. But he continued yelling, waving his arms trying to get the enormous young man\u2019s attention. The entire burger tilted upwards, giving Bryan a clear view of Troy\u2019s whole face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the curved tip of his nose, Troy\u2019s round blue eyes scanned the burger. His face contorted into a smile, but there was no warmth in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stunned silence, Bryan stared as Troy\u2019s tongue burst from between his lips like a mythical monster. Coating its slimy, pink surface were clumps of soggy bread and chunks of mangled beef. The tip smashed onto a wandering ant on the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Troy had done this on purpose as his tongue withdrew into his mouth with a slurp. The ant meanwhile squirmed in confusion until it disappeared behind the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth popped open with another explosion of sound. Bryan put his arms up in an ineffectual attempt to shield himself from the incoming saliva and food debris. The ringing in his ears that had been fading, instantly returned in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSAVE ME!! I\u2019M A HUMAN!!\u201d Bryan pleaded desperately. His only response was Troy\u2019s lips stretching back into a smile, seemingly distorted at such a close-up. The saliva on his off-white teeth shined in the light, a couple pieces of food easily noticeable where they were caught between the ivory boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA split second later and the mouth yawned open, revealing the mouth in all its glory. Strands of saliva, thicker than Bryan himself, stretched from the surface of the undulating tongue to the roof of the mouth. Flakes of lettuce, and more soggy piles of bread and meat were spread across the tongue. Moving frantically in the middle of the scene was the innocent ant Troy had just lapped up. At the back of the mouth, between two bulging tonsils, Troy\u2019s uvula swung over the dark abyss of his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!! PLEASE!!\u201d Bryan begged as he flew forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deafening crunch, he was sealed in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy munched on his burger, not giving a single thought to the hell he was putting the innocent ants through for a mere $10. In fact his only thought at that moment was that he wanted Sean to hand him another beer. Before he could, he felt a sharp pain near the tip of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!\u201d he shouted, stopping chewing and bringing his free hand to his mouth. Sean and Kyle stared at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSean! Gimme a beer, one of the fuckers bit me!\u201d Troy grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean pulled a beer from the cooler with a laugh, \u201cHa! Your food\u2019s biting back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Troy grabbed the beer from Sean, he felt another jolt of pain from his tongue.</span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes he, swallowed forcibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Troy smacked his lips. \u201cWhether they like it or not, these ants are taking a one way trip down!\u201d Troy laughed, smacking his stomach loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Troy\u2019s stomach, the shrunken man was rocked by a sudden quake from the body surrounding him. As he struggled to move through the darkness, he tried to stifle a rise of panicked sobs. He screamed, begging for aid in spite of the air that was burning his lungs. In fact, he found not only were his lungs burning, but so were his eyes\u2026 and his legs\u2026 and his arms\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, Bryan collapsed in pain as he was quickly succumbing to the hostile environment of the stomach. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was still staring in the darkness or if he had gone blind. As his senses dulled and the pain already started to dull, Bryan focused on the rhythm of gurgles that played as the stomach shifted and secreted more acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m being digested!\u201d Bryan struggled to string his thoughts together through the haze invading his mind. \u201cI must be\u2026 first man\u2026 digested\u2026 alive\u2026 by a man!\u201d Had he been fully conscious, Bryan would have been horrified at the circumstances of his demise. Instead, he simply smiled. \u201c\u2026 first\u2026\u201d With that Bryan finally slipped into merciful unconsciousness, never to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to imagine or appreciate the horror playing out within his own body, Troy continued to wolf down the burger as Kyle and Sean goaded him on. With each bite, Bryan\u2019s body was further buried in an avalanche of chewed mush. Without another incident, Troy popped the last bite into his mouth mere minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll gone!\u201d Troy announced, following a quick gulp. With that he stuck out his tongue, revealing thick saliva strands and soggy chunks of bread and meat spread across his tongue. Sean quickly scanned Troy\u2019s open mouth, confirming he had indeed gulped down all the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle fished a $5 out of his wallet, Sean looked Troy straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know dude,\u201d he started, his face twisted into mock disappointment, \u201cI left my wallet at home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Troy laughed, standing up to slug Sean in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy polished off another burger, accompanied with good portions of chips and beer. After a good time around the campfire, he fell asleep in the tent with a comfortably full stomach, deaf to the gentle gurgles as his stomach worked to digest his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Troy was left with an empty stomach as the remains of his previous meal, a few unfortunate ants, and one tiny man were working their way through his intestines. Following a hearty breakfast of scrambled eggs, fried potatoes and bacon courtesy of Kyle yet again, Troy and his friends set out to hike up the peak that towered over their campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, the three young men stood on a ridge, taking in the majestic wildlife scenery spread before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like a giant!\u201d Sean laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a pressure in his bowels, Troy faced Sean, \u201cWell this giant needs to take a dump!\u201d he replied bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLovely!\u201d Sean said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019ll turn this place into a fuckin\u2019 toxic waste zone!\u201d Kyle joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy chuckled, flipping them off as he pushed into the thick underbrush behind them for some privacy. He found a small open space beneath a towering pine and figured it was as good a place as any. Unnoticed at his feet, a number of different insects fled from the sudden appearance of the behemoth. Quickly undoing his belt and dropping his pants, Troy squatted on the ground and let out a grunt as he started to push. He inhaled sharply as pain jolted through his anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter out than in,\u201d he muttered to himself through gritted teeth as he pushed harder. Finally the turd plopped onto the ground, eliciting a sigh of relief from Troy. Pulling a roll of toilet paper from his backpack, Troy wiped his butt as he looked down at his poop. He leaned in, hoping to learn the cause of his pain, when the smell of his shit assaulted his nose. Grimacing, Troy stood up straight and chalked it up to the ants\u2019 last revenge for being eaten. He failed to notice the minuscule human skeleton embedded into the waste that had scraped him on its way out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaffected by the ants\u2019 grisly fate within his gut, Troy carelessly dropped the waded toilet paper onto the turd and pushed through the bushes to rejoin his friends and continue their hike. Left uncovered by the discarded tissue, Bryan\u2019s skull was left with a permanent grin, staring blankly up at the clear, blue, sky.</span></div></div>",

Bryan heard derisive laughter, but he didn't care; joyfully, he redoubled his efforts to get Sean's attention. Sean broke into a disbelieving smile. \"Honestly. Come here. Look. He's absolutely freaking minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis two friends got up and came over, clearly curious and believing Sean had seen something, even if it wasn't a tiny little scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cringed as a huge fingertip tapped the bun very close to him, and Bryan realised this was Sean pointing him out to his friends. He heard two \"...wow\"s, and it was clear they agreed.<br>\r\n\"Well what is up with you, little man...\" said Sean in a low, curious voice. Very carefully, Sean carried the burger bun over to the bench and sat down. His friends followed. Bryan had to cling to the bun to make sure he didn't fall, and it was very disconcerting to have 6 gigantic eyes all staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean set the bun down on the table, but the tiny scientist stayed on it, having a feeling you were more visible there. He began yelling about what happened, but obviously it was no use. In his panic, Bryan hadn't really realised that all the old rules still applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's trying to say something,\" Kyle said, and he couldn't keep his amazement out of his voice. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, no shit,\" said Sean, but he was clearly also amazed. \"Climb on, little guy.\" And with that, Sean reached out with a finger and without hesitation you clambered onto it. It was either trust Sean or die at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held on tight as the finger was lifted up, up, up, all the way to the gian'ts ear, and before you could even think about it you were being brushed off inside it, in the cave. You clambered behind the flap, behind the bones, and Sean laughed out loud before you stopped moving, then said, \"OK...what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you told him the story so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did him and his friends react?</span></div></div>",

Without an immediate response Matt took another step forward, his shoe squeaking on the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellllloooooo!!\" he called out. \"Bryyyyyyaaaaan!\" Still without a response Matt walks through the kitchen to search the house. Every footstep Matt makes echoes around the room, but Matt fails to notice the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lands roughly on the table with a grunt and rolls to a stop. His massive brother roars overhead, his words lost to tiny Bryan who is more focused on the pain radiating all over his body. He glares in the direction of his towering sibling who is staring at the archway leading into the living room as though he expects something. He then moves forward, which oddly shocks Bryan. He hears, as well as feels, a quake-like thud which could only be Matt's footstep. Bryan struggles to comprehend Matt's odd combination of speed and size. Before Bryan knows it Matt thuds out of the room, disappearing pass the archway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first experience with a regular human fades quickly into anger. \"Damn it Matt, I said I was going on a fucking trip! I fucking said next week! What the hell are you doing here!\" Bryan directs his temper at his younger sibling. Matt had disregarded his request and as a result (unintentionally) caused him all this pain. \"Why don't you ever listen?\" Bryan wonders out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forces himself to stand up, groaning from the quickly forming bruises. Thankfully those seem to be the worst of his injuries. Bryan spends a minute wondering what to do about his brother before deciding there's not much he can do, and to just move forward. With an exasperated sigh Bryan looks across the table where the box sits at the far end. He begins walking toward it to begin his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt checks each room, continuing to call out his brother's name. After a few minutes of searching he confirms that the house is empty. Disappointed he couldn't find Bryan, Matt drops onto the overstuffed couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little short on cash at the moment... not that it was his only reason for visiting. He missed his older brother, but was generally too busy to visit... until now. A grumble from his stomach tells Matt it's time for lunch. He runs a few fast food restaurants through his mind before remembering where he's at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Matt turns towards the kitchen. Surely Bryan would rather Matt eat his food than see it go rotten while he was gone! Matt enters the doorway but stops when he stares at the table. A box sits at the end of the table. More importantly there is a $100 bill next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Matt cheers. \"Bryan you never let me down. I owe ya big bro!\" he says snatching up the money and stuffing it into his pocket. Matt then turns his attention to the small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan crosses the table ignoring the sounds of his massive brother wandering his home. Halfway to the box, the sounds stop and less than a minute later a loud plop sounds from the living room. \"How long will the freeloader stick around?\" Bryan mutters unhappily.He stops when he sees his miniature clothing just ahead. The gust from outside had sent it flying as well! Bryan decides if he's getting ready to go getting dressed was part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulls his shirt over his head he hears pounding footsteps behind him. He turns around to see his towering brother who seems to be staring at him with an excited look. \"Matt...\" Bryan says cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SWEET!\" he roars \"BRYAN YOU NEVER LET ME DOWN! I OWE YA BIG BRO!\" as he speaks he approaches the table. His tall form, which even at normal size dwarfed Bryan, soon is above the box. Matt's large hand reaches down and clutches a banner like $100 dollar bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bryan bellows. \"THAT'S NOT FOR YOU, DUMBASS!\" Bryan bolts forward waving his arms up at his titanic brother. However Matt clearly doesn't hear him as he stuffs the money into his pocket. As he runs, he see's Matt's eyes flick onto the box. A look of curiosity flashes across the mega sized face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! MATT, DON'T TOUCH THAT!\" Bryan begs.</span></div></div>",

He reaches forward and picks the box up in one hand, surprised by its airy weightlessness. He shakes the box but he doesn't detect a noise. Matt feels his curiosity getting the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Bryan doesn't know, won't hurt him!\" he reasons. Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out a beat-up pocket knife and swiftly slices through the top of the box. Pulling the flaps open Matt sees a single white handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is running at full speed as Matt leans down. His face comes rushing downward and Bryan uncontrollably stops and cowers in fear. When nothing happens he stands up straight and stares at his brother's face. His dark eyes glint in the light, his lips moving slightly as he reads the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT! GO AWAY!\" Bryan shouts as loudly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response Matt thunders \"WEIRD, DIDN'T BRYAN SAY HE WAS GOING TO VISIT ZACK?\" The force of the breath of his words knocks Bryan off his feet, the tiny man clutching his ears. He glares up at his brother as he stands to his full height again. A hand appears above the box, thick finger close around it and easily lift the massive object into the air. \"NO MATT!\" Bryan begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lifts it to his ear and gives it a rapid shake, drawing an agonized grunt from Bryan. Unsatisfied with the mystery of the box he watches Matt rummage for a moment before pulling out a pocket knife that Bryan recognizes as one he had been missing for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking dare\" he growls at his brother. His brother roars something, but in his annoyance Bryan misses it. He then viciously stabs the box and rips it open. \"NO!\" Bryan wails<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" he grunts in surprise. Pulling out the scrap of fabric reveals nothing underneath, and he stuffs it back into the box. \"What is this? Some kind of experiment for Zack?\" he muses.\"What a nerd,\" Matt laughs.

He steps up to his brothers fridge; a humming, stainless-steel monster. His mouth waters as he grabs the door. Wrenching it open, Matt's face falls. He is greeted by nearly empty shelves. Some half-empty condiment bottles, a gallon of milk, and some other odds and ends are all that the fridge holds. Matt sees little potential in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not having fucking cereal!\" he scoffs glaring at the milk, as he slams the door shut. Shifting slightly he pulls open the freezer. It offers a better selection, several types of instant food in frosty boxes. Matt stares, trying to pick one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan continues to yell and wave at his titanic sibling as he goes through the box that will at his size seem totally empty. After Matt declares the box stupid, Bryan stares in horror as he casually launches the box across the room. A loud plop sounds through the kitchen where it lands out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! You idiot!\" Bryan shouts, running towards the edge of the table. Meanwhile his massive brother, finished with the box turns away. Bryan sputters, seeing the box upside down on the distant floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud hum from behind gets his attention and he spins around. \"GET OUT OF MY FUCKING FRIDGE!\" Bryan screams furiously. Matt immediately slams the door shut, causing Bryan to grunt in surprise. \"Did he finally hear me?\" he wonders briefly. That is before Matt opens the freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of annoyance is accompanied by a wave of exhaustion. Matt's presence has worn him out, as it generally did, but at this size it was even worse. Bryan sighs and sits down to regain his energy while also trying to decide what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt settles on a couple of burritos. He drops them onto a small plate from the cupboard and places it into the microwave. While waiting for the timer to end he taps his foot against the floor impatiently. His stomach growls again, causing Matt to frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the timer hits zero, before it even beeps, Matt opens the door and snatches the steaming plate out.

He picks a spot on the floor he imagines it probably landed and stomps his sneaker over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he had done a good enough job, Matt places the plate on the table. Dropping into a chair that merely creaked in protest, Matt begins his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's breathing is heavy. He feels an insane mixture of terror and relief. One second he had been sitting on the table collecting his thoughts. The next his monstrous brother's gigantic hand was slamming into him, sending him plummeting to the ground. He had thought for sure he would die, as the off-white tile quickly approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed he was far more hardy at this size, a side effect he hadn't known about and one he would have to study later. Not to say the landing wasn't immensely painful. Now as he lay still, the pain of the impact kept him from moving. But none of that was the worst part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. The worst part was seeing his brother, with a look of disdain on his face as he raised his massive shoe overhead. The tread of the worn shoe was packed with dirt and other crap Matt failed to notice under his footsteps. The crumpled body of an unfortunate spider was plastered near the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go like this.\" Bryan had thought miserably. Against all odds Matt missed, the gust pushing Bryan a few inches further away. Matt didnt lift his shoe again and instead plopped into the nearest chair, his jeans rising up to the rest of his body and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan tried t process the terror of the ordeal he had just experience he stared at the wall of the shoe, its dirty side far better than the now out of sight sole. Bryan was so relieved that he hadn't ended up as another stain under his brother's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a few minutes, the pain fades and Bryan feels his heartbeat approach a normal rate. He looks around seeing his brother's occasionally shifting sneakers and beyond them the upside down box near the trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get there now!\" Bryan tells himself.

But, he needed to avoid getting too close to Matt's shoes. Without knowing about his brother's shrunken situation, Matt was simply too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just worked up his courage to start the trek over the kitchen tiles when Matt pushed back from the table, the enormous chair creaking loudly and scaring his shrunken brother into momentary paralysis. When the tiny man realized that Matt had just shifted slightly, he inhaled deeply and continued his progress over the tiles. He sprinted as fast as he could, hoping to put some distance between himself and his huge brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still could not shake the memories of his brother's massive shoe raised and ready to flatten him like the spider and other bugs that he had unknowingly destroyed by just going about his everyday life. As he grew tired, the shrunken man had to slow his pace toward the shipping carton. As he did so, he could not help but recall the image of the sole of Matt's shoe coming down. The well-worn tread had been packed with mud, dirt and other debris. The pulverized body of a dispatched spider was plastered right in the center of the huge rubber sole. He remembered thinking that the flattened arachnid was bigger than his current size... but that hadn't prevented one careless step from obliterating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same story could be repeated again if Bryan wasn't careful. Knowing his time might not be unlimited, he began to push himself to reach the cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could get inside, just find the antidote, the nightmare could end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, it might have, except...</span></div></div>",

He doesn't notice the chunk of burrito that falls from the plate and onto the table. Picking up one burrito he lifts it to his mouth, opens wide, and takes a huge bite. It's hotter than he expected. He fans his mouth fruitlessly as steam flows out of it. The heat is becoming too much so Matt chews quickly and swallows. He smiles, feeling the ball of heat descend into his chest. He loves that about eating hot food. Sure it burns, but the feeling of a warm meal in his stomach just felt so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill his tongue burns a little so Matt makes sure to blow on his food before taking his next large bite. It's a good thing he's eating alone because as Matt looks around the kitchen trying to decide if he could get away with staying at Bryan's for awhile, he chewed with his mouth open. Loud smacks of his chewing echo around the room, but Matt wasn't one to care about his poor manners. After a loud gulp he sticks his tongue out and pops the last bite of the burrito into his mouth. Realizing he ate the thing in three bites he tells himself to slow down and enjoy the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to snatch up the next burrito he notices a small pile of beans on the table. Using a single finger he scoops it up and with the other hand grabs the second burrito. He takes a large bite out of it, already having forgotten the promise he made himself mere seconds ago. As steam rises out of the burrito Matt pushes the pile of beans into the middle of it and then sucks the remaining grease off his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stares off into space, lost in his thoughts. When a shadow darkens his area, he takes a moment to react and look up. He sees his brother's large hand holding a white plate and before he can do anything a brown pile lands on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmph!\" Bryan grunts, unable to move or speak. This doesn't stop him from struggling. The heat is nearly unbearable and Bryan is pretty sure he is starting to form some burns on his exposed skin. This only causes him to panic and fight more though deep down he understands it is pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of struggling, Bryan stops as despair floods his thoughts. In just a few minutes his brother's arrival had sent this situation straight into the shitter. He cannot hold back the frustrated tears that flow from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at the moment he feels cool air rush in from below. Light floods his view as he feels himself move with his entrapment.Soaring upward his view is filled with the face of his brother who is staring at him in with a bored expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Matt ! Right here!\" Bryan shouts, his face clear and able to speak again. Matt doesn't seem to hear him as his mouth widens and the front end of a burrito disappears into it with a simple squishing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Bryan says, surprised to see something so large disappear so easily.He watches as his brother chews with his mouth open (as he always does) and sees the dark chunks of food flying across the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels movement again and shouts in surprise. After a moment his destination is clear: the burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he gasps \"NOOOO!\" he shouts as he is pushed into the steaming piece of food. He hears the finger pull away followed by a slurping smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" Bryan says in shock. Even just moments ago he hadn't imagined he would end up in his brother's food.

Bryan can see the writhing tongue in front of him, bits from previous bites line the side of the tongue as it pushes the mountain of food between his teeth. A loud squish is accompanied by raining bits as Matt begins to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stops very soon though and Bryan clenches his ears as the his enormous sibling speaks around the bite of food. It is truly deafening. Bryan does however catch a glimpse of Tommy just ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope in his chest Bryan screams \"Tommy! Help me!\" his voice however is no match for Matt's.

He hits the inside of the cheek and slides down, sinking below the lower molars. Here he joins a soggy pile of chewed food, the occasional piece slipping down to join. Above he hears a loud gulp and then light floods the mouth. The molars rise high above, light illuminating the soggy piles of food hanging off of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan started to cry suddenly, as he realized that his brother would sooner or later gulp him down. He would seal his older brother's fate and never realize it. \"Matt!\"\" Bryan sobbed, beating his fist against the soft gum. \"Please! Save me!\" Above he hears squishing noises as he can only assume Matt has continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagines his brother, on the outside, casually eating a burrito. No idea that his minuscule brother is trapped between his gum and cheek in his mouth, being rained on by bits of soggy burrito. The idea was ridiculous. Another gulp sounds through the mouth and Bryan hopes that somehow he could remain in this relatively safe spot. However he thought too soon. The massive tongue probes down into his secure spot and laps at Bryan and the pieces of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! PLEASE LEAVE ME HERE!\" he begs. Matt, unaware of the difference between his brother and his food, scoops it all onto his tongue. The lips are parted, allowing light to illuminate Bryan, drenched in saliva, surrounded by pieces of tortilla, beans, meat, and cheese of varying sizes spread all across the tongue. He feels the tongue move forward beneath him. Looking out he can see his brother's handsome, unconcerned face in a rear-view mirror. His eyes seem to be focused right on him. But Bryan realizes he cannot even discern himself on the tongue. All he sees are his brother's glinting, white teeth, and the large chunks of tortilla at the back of the tongue. Sure Matt could see his food spread across his tongue. But he would never notice his tiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATT PLEASE!\" Bryan pleads one last time, as the last piece of burrito held by Matt's long fingers approaches. an agonized scream follows as Matt drops the last piece into his mouth and his jaws shut quickly. Unaware of the horror he is causing Matt begins to chew as he drives down the road. At a traffic light, without a second thought, Matt gulps down the bite. The meal quickly fades out of his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater he is watching TV, only concerned with the show in front of him. Not a thought drifts to the food he had devoured earlier. Bryan is still very much awake. He had been spending his time sobbing and begging for help that he knew wouldn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt doesn't hear the gurgles as his stomach begins to flood with acid, surrounding the soggy mounds of food. His tiny brother struggles to climb upwards but before long, the acids overcome the mound of food, sweeping him into a violent digestive storm. He screams in pain as he struggles to stay afloat. All reason is forgotten, all emotion, as pure instinct to survive kicks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's stomach however proves to be too much and before long Bryan succumbs to the pain as his brother's digestive system breaks him down. Outside of the world of Matt's stomach, he stares at the TV utterly unaware and unreactive to the tragedy in his gut.</span></div></div>",

POUND!  POUND!  Bryan kept running as fast as he could as he nervously glanced back.  Closing in on him were a pair of mammoth Airwalks twice the size of a football field.  The monstrosities covered an enormous distance with each ominous stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of seconds, the gargantuan treads of an unknown giant\u2019s shoes were right on top of him, ready to flatten him with one gigantic stomp.  Bryan crouched down with his arms over his head and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan awoke suddenly in a mild sweat around noon, and groggily glanced at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a dream,\u201d Bryan thought as he checked the time.  \u201cOh Shit!  I overslept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rushed around in a frenzy getting ready for his little trip.  Tommy would arrive in just three hours, but Bryan wanted to have everything ready well in advance.  He grabbed a bite to eat and took a quick shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan carefully prepared a single batch of shrinking formula.  He went to the kitchen to give everything one last check.  He took a yellow sticky pad and wrote a note for Tommy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgrey\">TOMMY, <br>\r\nTHANKS FOR MAILING THE PACKAGE.  BE SURE AND LOCK UP WHEN YOU LEAVE.  I\u2019LL PROBABLY BE BACK IN A WEEK OR SO.  IF YOU COULD PICK UP THE NEWSPAPER FOR ME, AND KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS AROUND HERE, I\u2019D APPRECIATE IT.<br>\r\nBRYAN SMITH</span></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stuck the note next to the transport box.  He then went to his bedroom and got undressed.  He downed the shrinking formula and rushed to the kitchen and sat on the table.  Within two minutes the brilliant research scientist had shrunk to a mere quarter of an inch.  He took in his surroundings with as much awe as his first shrinking experience.  He walked over and got dressed in the clothes he had left there the night before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 2 p.m.  Tommy would arrive in one hour.  Bryan looked over nearly mesmerized at the hundred dollar bill he left for Tommy.  The  bill and the salt shaker that secured it were titanic.  Bryan figured he had time to explore these curiosities before he needed to secure himself in the box.  He began the short jog to the middle of the kitchen table.<br>\r\n</div></div>",

Bryan, far from being upset at Tommy's mooching, used the opportunity to make a dash for the forgotten vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his haste, he tripped and fell, but recovered quickly and sprinted across the tabletop toward the vial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had nearly accomplished his objective when he raised his eyes to check on Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw caused him to scream as he saw Tommy, having gotten himself a can of soda, lowering the building-sized can toward the tabletop as the giant teenager lowered his huge body into one of the kitchen chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan veered out of the path of the descending soda can which, to his horror, Tommy placed squarely between the speck-sized scientist and the nearly microscopic vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt terribly exposed on the vast tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Tommy pop the tab on the can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took a drink of soda and reached lazily for the tiny box. \"SO THIS IS WHAT MR.

He had never gotten to explore Mr. Smith's home, and decided to give himself a tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's departure gave Bryan a brief reprieve. He ran around the obstacle represented by the enormous soda can. On the other side, he expected to find the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not here!\" Bryan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the huge can. No! He couldn't have!

Luckily the giant handkerchief he had packed was cushioning most of his falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly landed with a plop on the floor of the box.  It seemed to be level and motionless.  Bryan guessed that Tommy had set the box back down on the table.  He frantically headed for the opening at one end of the box.  It was all important that he retrieve the vial of shrinking antidote formula.  He reached the small opening and cautiously peered outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Fuck!\u201d Bryan screamed as he looked out of the box and saw nothing but thin air.  Tommy was still holding the box, steady and level.  Half frozen with fear, Bryan stood at the opening petrified, gazing out at this new giant world he found himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy gently turned the box, closely examining it from each side.  Suddenly, Tommy\u2019s gargantuan face was directly in front of Bryan.  He gasped as he took in the immense hugeness of the young giant.  None of his wildest dreams or fantasies could have prepared him for this reality.  He felt truly infinitesimal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan became a little unnerved as it seemed Tommy was staring right at him.  As much as his instincts told him to back off and hide, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the magnificent sight of the giant before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, there\u2019s a little tear in the box,\u201d Tommy said aloud as he examined one of the bottom edges of the box.  \u201cI\u2019d better do something about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had noticed a roll of tape on one of the kitchen counters as he entered the house.  He took the roll and began to repair what seemed to him to be an accidental tear in the box.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, what are you doing,\u201d Bryan screamed frantically.  \u201cNo!  Tommy, please don\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy was innocently fixing the tear, he noticed several very tiny holes at different points in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, Mr. Smith, you sure didn\u2019t pack this up very well,\u201d Tommy continued talking to himself.  \u201cI\u2019d better tape this up really good so nothing happens to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooooh!

He felt like a bug when he saw the massive teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wanted desperately to end this misguided adventure, but now it was impossible.

After explaining everything, his nephew could retrieve the shrinking antidote and return him to normal size.

Multiple shelves extending to the ceiling were packed with skate shoes, ball caps, and an array of skateboard paraphernalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched angrily as Shawn and Tommy perused the vast assortment of skateboards.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the post office!\u201d  Bryan began beating on the box with both fists.

He wanted nothing more than to do some skating of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention turned to a digital clock hung above the door. \"Not even five! Come on, man!\" Shawn complained to the empty store. His pants started to slump, forcing him to pull the baggy jeans up again.

Getting to spend his time around skate gear and chat with other guys about it all while being paid. Yet when the sun began to set and business slowed exponentially, the twenty-four year old was more than ready to call it a day. Mumbling song lyrics, Shawn reflected on his thoughts, idly toying with the small box Tommy left in his care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick cardboard and masking tape made up the small container. It was barely larger than the palm of his hand, and felt incredibly light. Shawn held the box while absently scanning the shop. He tapped the package against the counter, attempting to keep beat to the song stuck in his head. Waiting, he felt a small tear in the cardboard and began idly picking at it with his fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell attached to the door rang suddenly, breaking Shawn's spell of boredom. Two familiar skaters entered, greeting Shawn with friendly nods. Glad for the reprieve, he released the box in his excitement to socialize, accidentally sending it over the edge of the counter to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" He mumbled, stepping over to it and grabbing it. Then hurriedly returning it back to the counter without looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about the box, Shawn walked over to chat with the customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Bryan found himself roughly thrown...</span></div></div>",

Not a moment was wasted by the tiny scientist. Bryan sped into action, waving and skipping to attract attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaring faster than anticipated, the strange giant planted a gargantuan shoe next to the tiny man. The impact jolted the gritty earth violently, elliciting a shriek from the minuscule man who nearly went face first to the ground. Bryan instead fell to his knees, allowing them to scrape painfully against the ground instead of his face. Moments later, the second sneaker landed far to his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gazed at the nearest, gawking like prey faced by an enormous predator. The huge footwear was filthy. No, Bryan couldn't be that kind to the towering shoe as to call it just filthy. It was <i>ragged</i>. Torn, stained, worn and utterly mouldering from use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" <i>It also reeked.</i> Bryan craned back to view the titanic owner. His feeling of rescue draining to be replaced with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp, up, and still higher loomed the massive man wearing these disgusting shoes. Long wiry arms displaying faded tattoos and bandages descended from a cascading t-shirt of stained, worn cotton. Above that was a countenance Bryan would sneer in disgust at normally. Dirt and sweat speckled the huge features, visible only through a twisting jungle of reddish facial hairs growing without fear of being trimmed. The eyes made shrunken Mr. Smith whimper. Wide and rolling, they immediately denoted their humongous owner's mental state as very unstable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely cowering between the huge feet of this drug-addled ruffian wasn't what caused Bryan to freeze: <i>This giant hobo was looking right at him.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Breathed the frightened insect of a man. What was going to happen? Was he about to meet his end underneath this filthy giant's foot? As if waiting for his internal thoughts to finish, the giant suddenly moved into action. Bryan screamed. \"HOLY SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it. He had been right! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry lowered his hand, plucking the speck-sized being between his dirty, calloused fingers. He didn't leave anything to chance and immediately deposited the fugitive in a  containment more than adequate to imprison it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, they thought it wouldn't happen,\" The thin man babbled to the plastic cap in his hands. \"I knew it though. I knew that you small bastards would come back! Just like my dreams!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vile breath washed over the trapped being, causing the flailing speck to halt any resistance. Larry peered closer, but kept a cautious distance from the conniving creature. He grinned triumphantly. Everyone would have to take back what they said about him. His brother and mother would welcome him back, begging for his protection from the coming scourge of tiny people. All the non-believers at the shelter would look at Larry differently. They had all been wrong; he was right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tick contorted his gaunt features, sending the homeless wanderer into full alert. What if there were others? They would surely attempt to save their comrade and silence Larry for good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the ground suspiciously, he held the dirty bottle cap protectively and cautiously retreated from the dark alley. He couldn't waste time gloating his discovery. If humanity would have a fighting chance, he needed to warn the authorities! He set down the street with this thought. Shambling awkwardly for a bit before another thought struck his addled mind. Larry had needs, as well. This tiny insurgent was surely worth a decent hit or two.

Gales of loud, violent wind immediately consumed his cries, making Bryan feel weaker than he already knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rough motion brought him roughly to a prone position, which disheartened and confused, Bryan allowed himself to curl up and tremble at what might possibly happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry held the seemingly uninteresting and unimportant cap in his palms as if it were an object of great power. He scuttled block after block, sidling past pedestrians who either ignored him or looked at him warily. All fools who would be eating both their cruel words and thoughts when Larry delivered the proof of an impending devastation by teeny evil people-bugs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had decided on the police station, just another block or two away. Grinning his ugly smile at the thought of vindication and becoming the modern Paul Revere for warning humanity of this invasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he spotted a familiar figure just up the sidewalk. A man in dark blue uniform, police hat, and black boots that Larry knew as Officer Curtis Graham, one of the local beat cops. And one that had been friendly to Larry over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu-huh, Curtis, h-h-hey man,\" he said, coming up to the officers side who was finishing up a cup of coffee. \"I've got, uh, I mean, they...th-th-the invasion...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry, how's it going?\" The officer responded, friendly but somewhat sympathetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dirty drug addict swallowed hard, mindful yet rather callous about the cap held in his hands. \"The invasion...I-I found one! A scout!\" He presented the rather grimy plastic cap, sticking his hands closer to the cop who glanced down at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" He said, squinting for a moment at what could only be an empty, dirty cap before noticing an ant moving around. He smirked, always a friend to the local homeless, and looked back to the excited Larry. \"Yeah...definitely got one. A big one, by the looks of him. Good work, man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked pleased, but still ready to go on, which Curtis ultimately didn't have time for. He glanced at the unfortunate ant again, and pulled a stamp-ridden deli card from his pocket, and said, \"Here, I'll take care of the, uh, invader and you take this and get yourself something to eat, alright?\" Curtis plucked the cap between two fingers and dropped the filled-out lunch card in its place. It seemed Larry wanted more, but the ragged man looked at the card and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-ou're a good, uh, real good guy. Just...make sure....be sure that it, well, that they send it to the president for questioning. I was right! Right?\" Larry sputtered, his thoughts running a mile a minute. \"Thanks a lot. Curtis, man, your a good guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry eyed the cap as if it had been a bomb and was now defused, before turning around and hurrying back the way he came, awkwardly turning to wave goodbye. Officer Graham nodded in response, glad to see the unfortunate Larry happy and with means to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He outta feel better for a week or two again...hell, until he finds another bug!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis looked down at the bug in question, frowning. He couldn't figure how Larry's mind worked. One week it was a ladybug, another week it was a moth, and many other times, like now, just an ant. \"Alright. Time to go, little guy\", He said, smirking  thoughtlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, he...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a speck-sized man in Joe's lap, the scientist decided to make his way forward, toward the T-shirt-covered torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran through a odd tunnel of fabric, a fold in the youth's boxer shorts, until he reached the spreading T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he made his way off the shorts, however, than Joe lifted back the waistband on them and plunged his hand inside. After some serious fondling, he shifted in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last movement proved too much for the undetected tiny passenger. Bryan felt himself falling. When he hit a patch of bare skin below Joe's abs, he tumbled into a forest of bristly hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe turned back to his computer screen, letting a steady stream of hot pics continue to keep him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giant's movement momentarily paused, Bryan tried to escape. \"I've got to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sat bolt upright when he thought he heard someone outside his door, but it was a false alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sudden motion only made tiny Bryan's situation more precarious. He had tumbled onto Joe's tight sack. An extremely rank smell clogged his nostrils with its pungency. He felt less significant than a flea at finding himself standing on the pouch of skin holding this young titan's balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother motivation now prompted more movement from Joe. Wanting to quench his thirst, he decided to head to the kitchen for a soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, anticipating the change of gravity, made for the only possible niche of shelter available to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nick of time, he managed to squeeze himself into a fold of skin atop the massive sack but beneath the semi-soft organ resting on it. The skin felt oddly waxy and the surrounding walls of skin quickly began to trap and collect heat all around the tiny man's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus stuck, he managed to survive the trip to the kitchen without becoming hopelessly lost in Joe's boxers. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan realized, he was now standing on the chair, but within Joe's boxers. He still couldn't adjust to the smell inside the huge tent, which increasingly became worse by the minute. Then, Bryan saw a small amount of light as Joe's hand returned inside to play around with his enormous genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was scared to turn around. He didn't want to see this guy's enormous penis. He knew though, that he had to somehow get out of this situation. The boxers were too tight around Joe's legs, so there was no way out except the way Bryan came in - through the waistband. And, the only way he could even get out through there was if Joe's hand was still inside the boxers, providing space between the elastic and his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned around, greeted by the sight of Joe's balls hanging above him, jostling as Joe fondled himself.

Tears streaming down his face all he could do is ask why this had to happen to him, all he wanted to do was surprise his nephew and now any trace of light was slowly being replaced with darkness as the folds of flesh came in around each other. \"God damn it\" are the last words he heard before he was completely engulfed in ass flesh as he entered inside of this teens ass.

But anything familiar about Tommy had vanished now that Bryan beheld him from such an insignificant perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the other giant. He looked shorter than Tommy, but his body bulged and curved from enormous muscles concealed beneath tight clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a moment of horror, Bryan stared toward the shipping package.

Their thunderous voices boomed from high above.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get outa here,\u201d Tommy said as he firmly grabbed the tiny box with one hand.  \u201cWe\u2019ll mail the box and see if some of the guys want to watch the game with us tonight\u2014in style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d Joe agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooh,\u201d Bryan screamed as he watched the God-like youths walk away.  \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He scurried over the tiles like a two-legged bipedal bug. As he got closer to the kitchen counter, he saw a possible route of ascent to the lofty counterop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twisted knot of cables and utility cords dangled to the floor, reaching a surge protector box where the different plugs delivered electricity for various appliances, such as toasters, microwaves and blenders, dotted across the countertop like mammoth examples of bizarre architecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo scale a single cord, straight up for more than 800 feet, would have moved him to declare defeat yet again. But the way the cables tangled and crossed left a network of cords that, with some luck and considerable expenditure of energy, the shrunken man felt confident he could climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I wait for Tommy and...\" The little man let his voice trail off. So far, he had enjoyed no luck at all in contacting his giant neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to start climbing. \"I'll worry about contacting him once I make it to the countertop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew one thing.  Lost on the wide surface of his oak kitchen table rested a tiny glass vial so small it would have been almost invisible for humans of ordinary size. The minuscule container contained his vital counter-agent to reverse his shrinkage into the realm of bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he climbed, he tried to channel his mind and body into a single-minded focus, but he could not seem to shake his obsession with his earlier dream... the dream that ended with him getting stomped beneath an enormous sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man, no bigger than a bug, stopped to rest. He had climbed almost 10 inches or the equivalent of 240 feet, which left at least another 600 feet to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rested, he flashed back to that awful dream. \"I don't believe dreams can come true,\" he said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, why did it bother him so much to have recognized that the shoes in his dream were the giant Airwalks worn by Tommy's friend, Joe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a coincidence,\" he muttered aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started his climb again, reminding himself that he needed to spend less time dwelling on his absurd nightmare and more time on climbing to the countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly from a position lofty enough to avoid any possible contact with the feet of either Tommy or Joe did he feel secure enough to again attempt communication with the teenaged titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered at a passing remembrance of how awesome the two teens had looked when he had gazed on them from his puny perspective of a quarter-inch tall. He had managed to climb another couple of hundred feet on the winding, twisted utility cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped to rest, almost exhausted. He could not spare much time to let his speck-sized body recover. He knew he needed on the countertop before the giants returned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sooner than he would have liked, he began climbing again. He made good time, reaching within 300 feet of the flat countertop when he slipped. Some splatter of grease from the stove had landed on the utility cord. He hadn't seen the slick spot until the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man struggled to regain his balance, but...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One titan \u2014 a familiar one \u2014 entered the tiny man's home. He recognized Tommy with a mix of awe and anxiety. He began leaping and waving his arms, doing everything he could to get himself noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The shrunken scientist screamed. \"Here! I'm here! Please... Aiiiiieee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stomped into Mr. Smith's kitchen, a new pair of vibrant sneakers on his feet. He'd bought the new shoes with part of the money he'd earned mailing Mr. Smith's little package. He was quite proud of them, continually glancing down to admire the handsome, colorful shoes. He was so grateful to Mr. Smith for making the sneakers affordable that he'd made a point to come back to the house to see if there might be something he could tidy. His eyes locked on the huge garbage can, which looked almost full. He figured the least he could was to take out Mr. Smith's trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations from the first few steps made by the titan were all that it took to dislodge the speck-sized man from the precarious perch. As he screamed, the floor rushed to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he survived. As he applied his intellect to the surprising fact, he realized something that should have been fairly obvious. At such a tiny size, a fall, even from a tremendous height, need not prove lethal. After all, ants and other tiny bugs took tumbles all the time without suffering extensive injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to celebrate his survival for long. His plunge had left him stranded on a wide, flat kitchen tile, which was now directly in the path of the bright red, yellow and blue sneakers covering Tommy's feet. With a startled scream, the tiny man's eyes darted around the room, seeking a place of refuge as the sneakers \u2014 more like a thunderous blur of colors \u2014 slammed onto the tiles, coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire floor shook beneath the immense weight of each of the titan's footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man prepared to flee from his colossal neighbor when he felt a sharp pain in his left leg. His fall to the floor hadn't been as fortuitous as he first thought. He ran, with a prominent limp, in a desperate attempt to get out of Tommy's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard the squeak of the rubber soles like a horde of bats as Tommy walked on the kitchen tiles. Like a metal spike through the skull, the horrific squeak of the new shoes erupted with sonic discomfort in the tiny man's brain as he fled a hazard that was difficult to comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day ago, Tommy had been the teenager next door, a solid, reliable youth that Bryan Smith enjoyed hiring for odd jobs around his home. Now, by merely walking into the room, oblivious to anything as tiny as the shrunken scientist, the skinny teenager became an unstoppable natural force that threatened to rain down destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Mr. Smith squeaked as one of the shoes dropped, inches from his body. The concussive displacement of the surrounding air slammed into the speck-sized man's body, almost knocking him off his feet. He stumbled, regained his balance (no small feat with an injured leg) and kept sprinting away from the vicinity of the teen titan. His progress across the vast, flat plain of the kitchen tiles was painfully slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stopped in front of the plastic garbage can. The receptacle was roughly waist high to the teenager, who used one arm to pull the stuff plastic bag from the plastic confines of the can. He twirled the bag, a trick he had learned from taking his own family's trash out on many occasions, to tie off the bag and ensure none of the smelly contents spilled onto Mr. Smith's immaculate floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he noticed that the titan's movement had slowed, the terrified scientist paused, dared to look over his shoulder at the awe-inspiring sight of Tommy lifting the full garbage can from the can. From the tiny man's perspective, the ease with which Tommy accomplished his task looked impressive and forced Mr. Smith to look at the teenager with new eyes. Tommy now looked like a powerful, strong, potentially lethal giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned to face the back door, and Mr. Smith realized the folly of hesitating even for a second. Tommy was backtracking, his enormous new sneakers bringing him right back toward the ant-sized scientist on the tiles. \"Oh shit!\" Mr. Smith screamed and began running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous garbage bag cast a substantial, dark shadow over the tiles as Tommy, holding it in one hand, carried it over the tiles. Mr. Smith, suddenly plunged into darkness and not knowing whether the shadow was cast by one of the teenager's mothership-sized sneakers, dropped and curled into a fetal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneakers slammed onto the tiles, but seemingly hundreds of feet from the shrunken man's location. The enormous door swung open for Tommy, who stepped outside with the full garbage can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, still shaken, tried to get back onto his feet. \"I could have been stomped,\" his voice wavered. \"Like a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear tears, he wanted the nightmare to end. He vowed to summon bravery enough to stand and demand attention from Tommy. His resolve melted like snow in warm rain as soon as the teenager returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his crouching position, preparatory to leaping and waving at Tommy, the tiny man instead screamed and fled once again across the tiles. At least he had an objective, his eyes fastened on the geological plateau of the kitchen table. <i></i>I've got to get under the table. I should be safe there. <i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an unfortunate expanse of open space between his tiny self and the dim shadow of the colossal table.

You're going to crush me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if in response, the first shoe, having lifted again, crashed down, inches from the tiny's man vulnerable position on his own kitchen floor. The tremors knocked the bug-sized man off his feet, putting a halt to his attempt to remove himself from the vicinity of Tommy's enormous multi-colored sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocking pink rubber soles of the sneakers looked bright enough to burn the tiny man's retinas. The yellow and blue stripes on the sides of the shoes added to the sensory overload bombarding the shrunken scientist. He looked away from the harsh display of colors to the still distant kitchen table and the security of the twilight region beneath the tabletop and four massive supporting legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just wait for him to stomp me,\" Bryan shouted defiantly as he got to his feet and headed toward the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a final insult, he finally achieved some attention when Tommy happened to glance down at the floor and noticed the pale, scurrying insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross bug,\" the teenager complained in a rumbling growl of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Bryan protested in a fit of screams. He was so close that he dared not look back. He kept pushing himself to reach the shelter provided by the overhang of the city-sized table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's easy enough to deal with,\" Tommy said. \"Gotta break in these new shoes sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan heard the teenager's gleeful laugh that punctuated the declaration. \"No, please. I've shrunk! Look closer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the tiny bug kept racing across the floor, it's path was soon darkened by an eclipse brought on by Tommy's raised right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man froze, turning to face the teenager. He scanned for Tommy's face, hoping for some way to kickstart an inkling of recognition. After all, why should Tommy just stomp something tiny without asking some careful questions first? Unfortunately, the teenager didn't normally give bugs much thought, other than enough to eradicate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was too late to find Tommy's face. His field of vision was dominated by an onrushing wall of pink rubber. He had time to throw up his arms in a futile gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy lifted the sneaker, saw the tiny blot of red and chuckled. \"Little bastard didn't stand a chance against these,\" he said, once again looking upon the new sneakers with pride. \"I really need to thank Mr. Smith for providing me the money to buy them. I wonder what was so important in that package I mailed for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never learned the answer to that question or the bigger one concerning Mr. Smith's inexplicable disappearance. He did clean up the bug's meager remains with a tissue dropped into a now newly-emptied kitchen trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He climbed over the divider that separated the linoleum kitchen floor and the hardwood floor in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man began the exploration of his now expansive living room.  Straight ahead of him was his mountainous glass coffee table and enormous black leather sectional sofa.  A black leather recliner loomed just off to the right.  The furniture was placed to ensure an excellent view of the sixty inch plasma screen television that set on a sturdy stand directly to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew that Tommy and his giant friends would probably be seated on his furniture very soon.

The world of the paranormal and supernatural, as far as he was concerned, ranked as no better than cheap science-fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day ago, he would have dismissed with his elite arrogance the entire concept of prescient dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, too late, he knew better. He knew that science is not the limits of the human experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds, the impressions, everything came together as some haunting echo of his nightmare\u2014 the dream of his destruction beneath a monstrous pair of Airwalks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost felt as if he had fallen back into his dream as he re-lived each frightening second of it, but now wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his strangled cries repeated, almost word by word, what he remembered screaming in his horrific nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a painful stitch in his side as he ran. \"Just gotta get away,\" he cried as the sound of the gigantic footfalls boomed in his ears. \"Oh god, help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOUND!

He looked over his shoulder and saw the enormous Airwalks coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOUND!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat step triggered a powerful concussion that, to the speck-sized scientist, felt like an earthquake completely off the scale. He got knocked off his feet and sprawled on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to stand, but as he looked up his sky became the underside of the gigantic sneaker's tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan crouched and brought his arms over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair!\" Bryan screamed silently in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had heeded the prophetic warning from his dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last instant, he still struggled to evade his fate.

A long time ago, his mom had put a bowl on the counter as a common receptacle for collecting keys, wallets, phones and other items as family members came into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom overuse, the bowl had filled to capacity, and family members continued to drop items like keys and, in this case, glass vials onto the counter top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the teenager's pocket, trapped inside the huge glass container, the shrunken scientist felt the vial rock from side to side after Tommy removed it from his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man fought to remain on his feet until the glass tube quit rocking back and forth. Only then did the bug-sized man run toward the enormous chunk of plastic that served as the stopper to contain the contents (in this case one shrunken scientist) inside the glass container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, he gazed up through the dome of curved glass and saw Tommy's distant, distorted and absolutely colossal form as the teenager loomed over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The tiny man shouted at his neighbor as he waved his arms in an effort to gain the giant teenager's attention. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, no longer giving the vial and the captive \"bug\" much thought, moved to the fridge and poured himself a glass of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the speck-sized man pushed against the black plastic stopper. Although he strained his muscles to their utmost capacity, his feeble strength proved no match for the stopper shoved deep into the glass vial by the teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking to his knees in defeat, the bug-sized man realized he wasn't going to get out until Tommy remembered him and decided to free him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to hope he pays closer attention and recognizes me,\" he said. \"And not think I am a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from only inches away, Tommy's cell phone began ringing. The deafening ring tones assaulted the tiny man's sensitive ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sat down his glass of milk. From his humbling prison inside the vial, Mr. Smith gazed up and saw the milk mustache on the teenager's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as he picked up his phone. As he did, his hand brushed against the vial, which started rolling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vial began rolling toward the edge of the counter, and its tiny occupant went spinning with it.

It usually worked, but then leftovers rarely survived in his household where the always hungry but eternally skinny teenager usually finished them off. So, the experience of his shoe landing in a squishy mess brought a disgusted groan as he heard the squelch as he pressed heavily on the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his shoe from the can and shook it, flinging drops of red sauce and stray noodles flying.

His front teeth hung from above, blocking his view outside the mouth. Smears of chocolate and small puddles of milk were spread across the undulating tongue. The scene while horrifying had an odd beauty and Mr. Smith knew he had a view that no one had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then shook his head.

He put the vacuum down, leaned against the counter, crossed his arms, and stared expectantly at Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's pissy attitude annoyed Joe so he decided to make a show of his last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe leaned towards Tommy and opened his mouth wide. His tongue slithered forward. Tommy could see strands of brown saliva stretching from the chocolate-smeared tongue up to the molars jammed with chewed cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy closed his eyes in disgust and shoved Joe's arm. Joe grinned as Tommy made him miss his mouth. Feeling satisfied he popped the last bite into his mouth and started to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith kept calm and debated what he ought to do. He knew he needed to find a way out of Joe's mouth, he just didn't know how he would do it. He was still undecided when Joe started his show for Tommy. The opening of the mouth widened and Mr. Smith stared outwards where he could see Joe's hand holding the last bite. Beyond that he saw Tommy's annoyed face. The whole scene seemed unreal; from his perspective his teen neighbor almost looked normal if he ignored the fact he was watching from within a young man's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith frowned as the tongue flowed out of the mouth like water, tendrils of browned saliva stretching from the monstrous teeth down to the quivering tongue. Below him a thick layer of chocolate shone in the light that had been previously hidden on the slope in the throat. Finally Mr. Smith stopped taking in the scene and looked out at Tommy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Help me please! I'm right here!\" He watched Tommy close his eyes and push Joe's hand away and the tongue retreated into Joe's mouth empty. The tiny man's screams were swallowed up by the soft-walled, moist cavern. He felt a pang of disappointment and despair in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's tongue sprung forward again as he successfully dropped the last bite of the cookie onto his tongue. The lips shut and Mr. Smith held tight as he heard the crunches signal the beginning of Joe chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe chewed up the last bite and picked up his glass of milk.

Why had he been frightened to commit to exploring how far they could have gone? If he had established some ties with Paul, and settled down, avoiding his prolonged bachelorhood, would things have turned out differently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, utterly unaware of the bug-sized man who had been mired in the chocolate chip in the center of his cookie, enjoyed the quenching coolness as the cold milk washed over his tongue and started its course down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the white river of milk smashed into the pulverized paste of the cookie, the tiny man who had managed to avoid the same fate as the cookie between the teenager's gnashing teeth, tried to grab hold of a crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumb and shrunken man were caught in the maelstrom of milk that swirled through Joe's cavernous mouth, draining far at the back, plunging like a cataract down the throat and into the youth's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized man saw the approaching uvula, a huge pendulum of flesh hanging from the roof of Joe's mouth. Exhausted, he barely focused his strength on lifting his arms from the river of milk. His tiny fingers slid along the underside of the surface of the muscular uvula, but there was nothing to grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt the sensation of falling....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wailed \"Nooo!\" as he passed the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing the bite of cookie with a swig of milk, Joe deftly finished off the final bite of the delicious cookie. He then drained the remaining milk in the tall glass and deposited the now empty container into Mr. Smith's sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinse it out,\" Tommy ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Joe said in a mocking tone. He ran the glass beneath the stream of water from the faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach grumbled and he felt a wave of nausea. \"I don't feel so good,\" he said, rubbing his stomach beneath his tight T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to eat that cookie after it fell on the floor,\" Tommy replied without much sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe patted his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith found himself on a mound of sludge, the remnants of the cookie. The milk flowed away, leaving him on the unsteady platform. He was still trying to accept this horror when another flood of milk smashed into the youth's massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe survived being washed away into the sea of acids, but he knew he could not hold out much hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt and heard an unusual sound. There was a thudding noise making its way through the walls of the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't realize at first, but then he guessed that the teenager must be patting his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let his hopes leap. Had Tommy figured it out? Did they know what had happened to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought his way through the sludge. \"Tommy! Please! Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe complained again from the nausea. \"Maybe you should go to the john and throw up,\" Tommy recommended. \"Better out than in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe frowned in distaste. Instead of heeding his friend's advice, he gave his gut a good punch, which produced a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice,\" Tommy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe smiled. \"Worked! I feel much better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another jolt from the outside to the huge stomach, followed by a definite change in pressure. But then, nothing changed. With resignation, as the cookie-mush raft began to dissolve, Bryan Smith realized there wasn't going to be a rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was way too late for that.</span></div></div>",

That hadn't been easy with the storm of crumbs, some as big as boulders, rained down around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the initial disturbance was over, and the tiny man stood still and got his breathing under control. The entire time, he stared up at his colossal teenaged neighbor, completely in awe of Tommy's sheer size that left him feeling more bug than man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was as a man, and one with a higher-than-average IQ, that he would get himself out of his self-inflicted dilemma. \"Just have to stay calm,\" he whispered to himself even as every instinct urged him to run and hide himself in some dark cranny or crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed up wistfully at the enormous teenager. \"If only I could get him to\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWUMP! THWUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist's hope was left unspoken when Tommy's equally enormous friend stomped back into the kitchen. The slap of the rubber soles of the pair of Airwalks sent frightening tremors through the floor under the bug-sized man's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you?\" Joe asked with impatience, scanning the floor and noticing the mess. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Tommy snapped. \"I can deal with it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man cowered near a boulder-sized crumb. It was too late to run. He prayed the enormous Airwalks, the very same shoes that had featured so explicitly in that bizarre dream, wouldn't stray any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his lowly perspective, the horrified little man watched, almost unable to comprehend this new reality, as the titanic teenagers stomped loudly and carelessly all around him. Even with his scientifically trained mind, the shrunken man could hardly accept how beings of such enormous size could move with such agility and speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWOP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Airwalks, as big as an ocean-going vessel, slammed down mere inches from the debris field of cookie crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful!\" Tommy cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't step on me!\" The little man added in unheard desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem now?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want you stomping through all those crumbs and grinding them into the tiles on Mr. Smith's floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed and raised up on tiptoes and pretended to walk carefully across the floor. \"Is this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy just laughed at Joe's antics. \"Let's just watch the game, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe didn't need to be asked twice and shot out of the room, providing the tiny man one last chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" He screamed as he fled the littered landscape of cookie boulders. \"Down here! Please, help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, his tiny cries for help went unheard and unheeded. He watched Tommy's distant form recede through the monolithic door dividing the kitchen from the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it have to be so hard?\" Mr. Smith whined in defeat. \"I just need him to hear me and see me!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they became more comfortable, Bryan decided his next move. By leaving the shelter of the fake plant, he could climb the back of the sofa. Closer to Tommy's massive head, the tiny researcher felt sure he could successfully contact the young man and enlist his help in resolving his sizable dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb required more energy and effort than Bryan expected. The entire climb, he remained acutely aware of Tommy's huge body. Whenever the game provided unexpected action on the screen, the giant body would shift in excitement, which forced Bryan to cling to the sofa fabric to prevent being thrown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting thirsty,\" Joe announced. \"Want a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Tommy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe left the living room to fetch some drinks from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan found himself within inches of Tommy's shoulders.

He debated what to do next and decided to get closer to scream in the youth's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt just that moment, however, Joe returned.

At least no oblivious teenager had tried to swallow them with illicitly obtained beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys, in the meantime, continued to argue about the hypothetical morality of swallowing a tiny person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you wanted their professor dad to swallow them,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a movie,\" Joe said, getting bored of defending himself from one offhand remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think of it from their point of view,\" Tommy said. \"Think of how scary it would be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, his own tiny neighbor remained confined in the lake of amber-colored beer contained in the reservoir-sized mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joe changed the channel and they got into the game, thoughts of tiny people wandering in a hostile backyard faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy reached for his mug, ready to drain it and perhaps go back for a refill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beer swayed and sloshed in the enormous glass container, Mr. Smith resumed his pitiful screams to get his teenaged neighbor's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, please,\" he shouted. \"It's me!

With a splash, a capsule about twice his size fell into the beer, tossing up more ripples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Mr. Smith wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy returned with a bag of chips, oblivious to his friend's tampering of his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already eaten a handful of chips, he reached for the mug to wash them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist knew how much of the beer had been removed from the mug. One last gulp remained. He had to get Tommy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything flowed toward the cavernous mouth as Tommy tilted the mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Smith flowed out of the huge glass, he screamed one final \"Help meeeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe watched everything with restrained anticipation.

Joe explained that the pill would have been the size of a tiny, shrunken person. \"And you swallowed it right down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a pill's still not a person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Joe said in triumph. \"You didn't even notice. So, why the fuck would you ever notice a tiny person in your drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't have a good answer, but his buddy's smugness irritated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd notice a tiny person in my drink,\" he said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy felt a little sick, too. \"What sort of pill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.

Because he was so small, he wasn't falling right through the air, he was sort of falling *over* it. Like somebody falling down steps, Bryan tumbled and fell and regained his footing as he fell through the air. It was nauseating, but slower than falling at average height; Bryan knew he would survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his eyes shut to reduce the pressure of the wind against his eyes, but he opened them for a minute. He was greatly surprised: He saw a gargantuan white cruise ship in a concrete sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Bryan made the connection. He was going to land on Andy's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made contact with the Adidas sneaker softly, considering what the fall had been in proportion to an average fall. He lay there, silent, trying to recover from the shock of his life. He had just experienced what was equivalent to a more a thousand foot drop. The wind was knocked out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground beneath him began to shift. It was a rugged white landscape, with huge wall-thick ropes latched all over. Behind him, the tongue of the shoe loomed like a mountain. Bryan couldn't believe that this new \"world\" he was on was just a guy's shoe. He was struck with a miserable lack of self-esteem: Here he was, the size of a gnat, clinging to some random teenager's (who had become a god) shoe (which was also bigger than the block Bryan's house was on). Andy might think he was some meaningless bug and kill him for fun, under his foot. Bryan felt so humiliated and humbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe shifted only a couple of inches, but it was enough to throw Bryan off his legs. He thought he had hurt his leg; it hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked at the tongue of the shoe, which seemed to be a mountain. But above it, Andy's jeans hung like a beanstalk to the clouds. But it wasn't the clouds: it would only lead to his thigh. Above that, was Andy's torso and head. He couldn't believe how huge Andy was. It was completely incomprehensible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to climb it, he realized. To get his attention, he would have to get to Andy. He hoped he would just stay still.</span></div></div>",

He can hear the muffled voices of awe as the others think Tommy just drank a bug, while not even Tommy himself was aware that the bug had been able to delay its fall by a few moments at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew a bit about anatomy, and that if he let go of the tooth which he was now firmly grasping the reaction of Tommy would be to swallow him. Since that was not the action he wanted he had to think of something else fast. He considered his situation for a moment more before realizing that Tommy was sitting back down, and that any moment he would take a drink or eat something, and Bryan would die a horrible death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat information goaded Bryan into action, and he pooled all his remaining courage into one last act of defiance at fate, God, or whatever other force had cursed him with such bad luck on a day when bad luck meant he would probably die. With little thought to what he was doing, except that it had to be completely unexpected, Bryan pushed off the tooth and fell onto Tommy's tongue. The appendage didn't even dimple under his tiny weight, but he could see saliva pooling in response to his presence and knew he had to do the first thing that came to mind before Tommy swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing all thought to the wind Bryan got down on his chest and bit into the soft flesh of Tommy's tongue. Bryan's little bit of anatomy knowledge told him, that like the eyes, the tongue was one of the most sensitive spots on any beings body, simply because it was designed to take in data naturally and transmit it to the brain. The problem was though it was sensitive Bryan was still little more than a bug, and if Tommy didn't even fell it then Bryan was about to get a one way water tube ride into a vat of acid.<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\nTommy felt weird after the shot of soda with a bug in it, more because he thought he had heard Bryan shouting at him as if from a distance as he did it. Probably about ruining a good shot glass with soda. Still he had an empty feeling in the pit of his stomach and barely grunted in acknowledgment as the other boy handed him the fiver. Sitting back down he decided to eat away his trouble, picking up a hot wing when he felt a sharp pain in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he shouted, more in surprise then actual pain.<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\nWith a look of success Bryan felt Tommy draw in a sharp breath of air that nearly carried him down his wind pipe. Letting go of his dead man's grip on Tommy's tongue Bryan literally rode Tommy's shout out of his mouth, flying once more into the open air and sunlight. Unfortunately he was falling from a much greater height than he had expected, as Tommy had sat up, and he had no way to control the direction of his fall.</span></div></div>",

Bryan made a pained face, grabbed his leg, but also grabbing onto whatever he  had hit. Above him, under him, and around him, the pepsi sloshed through in a rapid trip into Joe's throat. It was a chip, a tiny chip in the inside of the cup, he realized. It was sharp, but at least it was holding him still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe set the cup down with about one-fourth of the soda left.

His stomach, though, was strangely unsettled and with a start, he felt something electric inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking formula that had altered his body chemistry was now reacting with the carbon dioxide in the soda; Bryan's whole body seemed to go numb and his vision went hazy.

It seemed impossible to believe that this terrifying alien landscape was just in fact the abandoned lot just a short way from his own house. The property lay stagnant for months, allowing a variety of invasive weeds to grow on the dusty, dry ground, littered with small rocks and trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan Smith stood no more than a minute speck in all of this, his little feet allowing him slow progress. He struggled to climb a sizable boulder, his hands complaining of scrapes and the hot sun-baked surface of the stone. More than 30 feet above the ground to him, the boulder offered Bryan an enhanced view of his surroundings. Turning himself around, his heart sank at the realization that he was in the middle region of the normally large lot, leaving a long journey in any direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could Tommy just leave me here!\" Bryan complained out loud despite himself. The sun was directly overhead, causing the distressed scientist more discomfort. He felt like a corn kernel about to pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the lot was relatively flat, though not much so from Bryan's perspective, he was able to view the far-off street from atop the boulder-like pebble. He watched the huge form of a vehicle drive by, and a distant mountainous sign was staked near the sidewalk that bore the construction company name that owned the lot. To his distress, he could also see a variety of flying insects buzzing around like huge winged buses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan prepared to climb down the rough boulder, stepping his foot down in a crevice lightly. A sudden feeling of vertigo overtook him as he lost his balance and tumbled down the steep side of the boulder and landed in a painful heap at its base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body throbbed as he righted himself. A nasty scrape presented itself on his right shoulder, among many other minor ones on his legs and back. Dusting himself off, Bryan was suddenly made aware of a large creature lumbering from the cover of a nearby weed. The huge beetle shuffled clumsily into the open, expressing interest in a rather foul looking crumb. The tiny scientist was terrified of this monstrosity that was easily the size of a suburban garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters suddenly became life-threatening when a loud sound roared overhead, a gale of wind assaulting the surrounding area. A nightmarish creature of massive proportions landed before the confused beetle. Bryan looked up at the larger beast, his spine chilling at the realization that it was nothing more than a praying mantis. With a frightening motion, the praying mantis snatched the much smaller beetle with its blade-like claws. The beetle made a pitiful sound like a startled moose as it was raised to the deadly mandibles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shrieked as he witnessed the praying mantis kill the helpless beetle with a swift motion. He turned and bolted in the opposite direction, his bruises and scrapes long forgotten. Leaping over a log-sized twig, Bryan slid under the shelter of a street-sized leaf, his face white with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was apparent to him that the journey out of here was the least of his concerns. This new, and dangerous world was populated by huge insects that more closely resembled mythic monsters of old. He was at the very bottom of the food chain. A tiny, soft-skinned being that was slow and defenseless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was still young, and if he could survive it, he would only find more danger when night fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to...</span></div></div>",

Many dozens of miles lay between him and his destination. His mood dampened at this realization. It would take more than a day to traverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay overnight here...\" He whined to nobody in particular. After the mortifying encounter with the praying mantis, Bryan knew that he was in no position to defend himself. A gigantic human seemed like a preferable danger than the cruel monstrous insects that lived in this arid land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed on, hours seeming to fly by and the blistering sun rays feeling like fire. Bryan passed through many dusty valleys, past hundreds of towering weeds with prickly leaves, and hiding whenever he heard the roar of wings overhead. The distant form of a bird, which in reality was nothing but a common swallow, frightened him like never before. At the size of a bug, a bird would resemble an even bigger version of Godzilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge pieces of discarded trash stuck from the ground like ancient monuments, their faded, dirty brand names appearing foreign and strange to Bryan. The sun was showing the beginnings of setting, and the tiny scientist felt as if he had made very little progress. Pain, scrapes, and bruises addled his entire body and complained constantly. He needed to rest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cautious glance to the skies, Bryan settled near a tunnel-sized straw. The white and red tunnel was made of cracked plastic and covered in mud. It looked like something from an abandoned carnival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to get comfortable, fate once again threw a curve ball. This presented itself to Bryan with a horrid rumbling sound. His tiny ears pricked up immediately, looking feverishly from side to side to determine the direction. It sounded as if something huge was dragging through the dirt, almost like-....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had just began to stand when a terrific beast burst from a nearby cluster of grass. A shriek of terror spilled from his trembling lips as he beheld what was a warehouse sized snake. Coated with hard black scales, teeth that looked like stalagmites, and a tongue that slinked out hungrily. His little heart beat furiously as he tried to flatten himself against the discarded straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sickening hiss, the monstrous reptile craned itself back and glowered at the tiny insect-like man with inky black eyes. Bryan had been so absorbed in the dangers from flying predators, that he had completely ignored what might come from ground level. There was no way he could out-run the horrific beast, and no possible way he could hope to fight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaring a pair of gleaming fangs, the snake prepared to eat...</span></div></div>",

He barely registered this as he kept his eyes focused on the opening maw. Flanked by huge fangs and blade-like teeth, it looked like a dark cavern from a horror story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll breath and feeling left him as he stood frozen in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as a bullet, the garden snake swept towards the helpless victim. The tiny insect was caught in his mouth, the snake didn't need to bother biting this victim due to its diminutive size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake relished the squirming movements, feeling immensely satisfied with such an easy catch. A cruel pressure was applied to the thrashing morsel, causing an audible snap from inside the mouth. All movement ceased from the prey afterwards. The tiny creature's body could be felt as it slid down to be digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black and yellow reptile had been concerned after a day that yielded no food. The scent of this strange juicy morsel was almost overpowering, and proved to be nothing short of a God-send. Slithering back to its nearby home in a large cluster of grass and dirt the snake prepared to rest for the oncoming night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single thought was given to Bryan by the giant snake.

It was unbelievable that this creature would of been barely longer than two pencils before he shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither side of him stretched the huge straw. He would be eaten the instant he moved, so escape was not an option. A small split in the straw had offered momentary hope, but it was obvious that he would be unable to fit through the crack. If only this was a Hollywood movie, then perhaps such a fantastical plan might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes in preparation for death, when a sudden explosion burst from behind. The ghastly snake reeled back in shock, just as surprised as the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked at the crashed object, it looked like a huge yellow version of the moon had crash landed. Coated with wet bristles and lined with rubber indentations. His observations were short-lived as sudden rhythmic quakes shook the ground, a huge shadow enveloping the entire sky behind the stunned snake. The tiny man could only gawk in astonishment at what loomed above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once monolithic snake now looked its size again, flanked by two massive furry legs supported by huge paws. It was a gigantic dog. Far above, two huge brown eyes stared down in excitement. Bursts of vile dog breath washed over the area as the massive beast panted. The dog was obviously a German Shepherd. A heavy black collar hung around the beast's neck, a dirty metal tag dangling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, Bryan had no idea how to react. This canine was so huge, but surely not dangerous, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the snake decided to try its own luck at escaping from danger. Before it even moved a couple inches, the gigantic hound reacted and snatched the harmless reptile in its terrifying jaw. With a mighty motion, the titanic dog rattled the tiny snake that wriggled around in terror. As Bryan watched, he could not help but feel the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunching down, the dog killed the small worm-like snake and swiftly swallowed it. It was nothing in comparison to the dog, merely offering amusement and a minor snack. Shifting its head, the dog sniffed the air curiously. A huge paw thundered down nearby as the dog carelessly inspected the weed infested ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stay away!\" The minute man cried out. Bryan crawled back desperately as the massive canine lowered a fur-coated snout tipped with a slimy black nose towards him. After being saved from the snake by the huge beast, Bryan didn't want to end up the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensitive eyes, and a very trained nose allowed the dog to pin point tiny Bryan. The hound looked curiously as the tiny insect-like speck reeled back. It smelled human, like his master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to inspect this curious creature closer. Lowering his sizable nose, which was slightly pointed and flat on top, he scraped the tiny being from the dirt to his nose. Before he could determine what this creature was, he heard his master call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis master was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the precise moment the German Shepard was close enough to the scientist to sniff, a piercing whistle from its handler, a balding, somewhat portly police officer, made it lift its head. The speed of the dogs head rising both stole the air from Bryan\u2019s lungs, and made him continue to rise into the air a little when it stopped. He rose low above the canines head, descending after only a second or two of airtime. Also in good timing, the Police dog began to move just before Bryan would have crashed painfully onto its nose. Instead, he landed squarely between its eyes, quickly becoming buried in thick tan hairs. The tiny man held on for dear life as the air screamed against him, gripping a hair or two for support. The dog was only trotting, in truth, but things are exaggerated at the Scientist\u2019s size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his unique position, Bryan was both able to clearly see where the dog was going, and avoid its further detection, provided he remained still enough. The dog trotted happily toward its handler, who held open a police vehicle too large to accurately describe. It hopped inside, the motion straining Bryans pathetic grip, and sat down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan had always been afraid of insects, but only on a superficial basis. Now he was in danger of being eaten by the giant creatures. The thought made him shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe timidly crept out from under the spacious leaf. A distant buzzing made his heart jump, and caused him to leap back into the shadows. He sighed as the shape of a large gnat harmlessly flew overhead. Large flying insects populated the skies, their powerful wings emitting noises similar to the deadly mantis. Swallowing hard, he continued back out, the heat of the sun washing over his dirty little form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him lay a dusty valley of dirt, littered with sizable boulders, dead grass, and a huge weed with prickly leaves. Bryan's already frightened heart sank as he spied a sparse line of ants blocking the entire length of the valley from each visible end. Smaller, more agile looking ants moved quickly, their antenna whipping about as they sped along. Larger, bulkier ants shuffled at a slower pace as they carried slimy white eggs on their backs. He noted that even from this distance, the ants appeared large and fearsome. He didn't want to end up becoming dinner for the colonies hatchlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his immediate left in order to avoid the ants, Mr. Smith stumbled weakly over a crest of dirt. His mind was wandering, self-pity on his current predicament, and regret for going through with such a clumsy plan. After a few minutes of walking, Bryan suddenly wretched back as his foot nearly stepped off into a deep indentation. Suddenly aware of his surroundings, he backed up from the deep incline. It was easily almost 10 feet deep. Backing away, he realized this entire clearing was covered in the strange indentations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he climbed a slight hill, the indentation spanned a massive distance and seemed almost recognizable. The blood drained from his face at a sudden realization. A boot print. Bryan was now gawking at what lay before him. A colossal tread print left by a heavy-lugged work boot. It only appeared to be from the toe section of the boot, and near the middle of the print an obliterated cigarette butt was visible. It was positively gigantic. He had almost forgotten how small he really was when compared to a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was thankful that it looked faded, like it have been left days ago. Sprinting ahead, the tiny scientist made some decent progression through this thoroughly alien landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeds towered overhead like trees, and huge twigs looked like fallen redwoods to the shrunken man. A massive bottle cap he passed was like some kind of mountainous billboard from another world. It was near the looming visage of the discarded cap that he found a pond of tepid water. His persnickety mind revolted at the brownish, frothy liquid, but his dry mouth made him relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan leaned in to drink, he was unaware of...</span></div></div>",

From above, a truck-sized house fly descended, its powerful translucent wings beating a furious buffet of wind in Bryan's face and the surroundings area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart rate increased with fear as the beast came seemed to land right on him. The fly was hideous, huge faceted eyes that completely dominated it's head, and a grotesque mouth tube that dripped noxious acidic juices. Bryan couldn't help but cry out in terror, and struggle to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion seemed to attract the horrific fly, that previously was only interested in the refreshing water. Bryan let forth another peal of terror as the huge insect skittered towards him. A burst of green acid sprayed from the fly's mouth, aimed for Bryan. The tiny scientist clumsily rolled out of the way of the burning acid, and tried to shamble desperately away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrieked as the relentless house fly flew at him, its huge vehicle-sized body rushing at him. The fly's gangly lags were covered in a useful coat of prickly hairs, which effortlessly latched onto the squealing man taking him into the air with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape spun beneath him at a dizzying distance as the fly climbed altitude.

That was nothing compared to his current predicament, being precariously suspended on the spiny leg of a monster house fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEELP!\" He screeched. Opening his mouth to cry only made him gag. The constant beat of the fly's powerful wings made him feel as if he would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dried and rugged landscape of the weed filled lot suddenly shifted after the fly soared over a gargantuan wooden fence. Below, the landscape had changed to a lush forest of grass, the bright green looking like something out of a technicolour film.

This brief view was interrupted as the fly veered violently, causing a new wave of nausea and vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him towered a wall of plastic mesh covering a window opening, tears and resting bugs dotted it. Without slowing a bit, the fly carelessly burst through a sizable tear, probably barely larger than a bit of change, but providing easy entry for tiny insects like the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this was like some kind of roller coaster, whipping around obstacles and veering through holes. He watched helplessly as his monstrous captor navigated this new environment. Even from his nauseating perspective, Mr. Smith could tell it was a kitchen. White tiled counters and floors, with dark pine cabinetry. A huge yellowing relic of the 1970s was the fridge, that loomed over everything like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden motion from the fly caused his clothing to begin tearing.

His own kitchen floor was linoleum, easier to clean and without pesky tile grout. Cold, hard white tiles easily the size of football fields covered the floor. With a sniffle, he noted that his choice of cabinetry was much keener than the dark blotchy wood here. At least it was relatively clean so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slow look around the spacious room made him sigh. Where would he go? Bryan didn't know who lived here, nor the layout of the house. Looking over to the back door, he spotted a telephone mounted on the wall next to it. Like the refrigerator, it looked out of date with a pale green colour and out-dated cord style. This proved to be fortunate for tiny Bryan because the long cord dangled near the counter top all the way to the floor. Surely he would be able to climb it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying his pace, he headed straight for the base of the closest counter. Traveling underneath would offer him protection should any of the residents enter the kitchen, and he knew from experience how fatal that could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween each tile was a riverbed of grout, filled with dirt and grime. It was the only real obstacle, but still a rather disgusting one. When passing through one such indentation, his feet met with a sticky substance that gave off a rancid smell. Spilled juice most likely, he frowned, hoping not to fall. Even more revolting were a few crushed insects, all unrecognizable. His pace quickened at the thought of meeting their same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally reached the counter base after what seemed like many hours. The dark wooden cabinetry towered high above, resembling the grand canyon. Underneath the lofty crevice Bryan found a plethora of refuse scattered about. Dust bunnies larger than vehicles, crumbs of all varieties, and larger trash items. All the dirt probably went unnoticed to a normal person, but at such a tiny size it was plainly visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plastic bottle cap stood like a stadium, coated heavily in dust. It proved a hindrance to walk around, but uneventful. Bryan was thankful he had yet to meet any insects, or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a comparatively small distance lay the phone cord! A burst of excitement propelled him until he realized what he needed to pass. The dishwasher, a massive machine of metal and plastic, created a very frightening obstacle for Bryan. Barely visible to someone of normal size, a huge gap lay exposed under the dishwasher, inky black darkness disguising whatever lay inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan swallowed hard. Blocking the thoughts of what may reside inside the darkness, he continued forth as far from it as possible without venturing out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like something out of a Sci-Fi horror movie that was home to unspeakable monstrosities. His imagination was threatening to get the better of him. Bryan took a deep breath and focused on hurrying to his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to reach the cord,\" He assured himself. \"Almost there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still couldn't dispel a prickling feeling that he was being watched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bulbous eyes, a small lizard watched the tiny man's progression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a half inch in length, the reptile had hatched into the gigantic world that was this suburban home only two days before. It found a way into the kitchen via the back door that had been left open by the teen aged occupant of the house a few hours ago. A couple ants, and a rancid dead beetle were all the food to be found in this strange world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid and hungry, the lizard had taken cover in the warm cavern underneath the huge dishwasher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it had sight of a soft, pink prey. The lizard determined with its simple and instinct driven mind that this small victim would be an easy kill and provide much needed nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinking a long pink tongue, the tiny lizard began wiggling towards the weak creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's ears pricked up suddenly. A slight skittering noise could be heard, and it sounded as if it was coming from underneath the humongous appliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in God's name...?\" He began backing away from the frightening darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beast of prehistoric measures became visible as it raced towards him. The tiny scientist let out a comical squeak and ran the opposite direction. His heart thumped frantically, worse than it did on his sky-high trip aboard the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge reptile was far larger than he was. In reality it was a mere ten centimeters in length, but to Bryan it matched the size of two semi trucks. A terrific sensation of numbing terror pulsed through his tiny body as he fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to escape. Only bare, open stretches of colossal tile stretched before him, as he had foolishly chosen to run back out into the kitchen floor. Treacherous gaps created by the tile grout also hindered his desperate flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Bryan miraculously landed on both feet, save for a minor stumble, and continued his determined escape. The gargantuan reptile made loud hisses and scrapes while it pursued. Bryan sped his pace--running on pure adrenaline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he made his mistake. Bryan dared a glance behind that lasted only a moment, but enough to distract the already clumsy and exhausted scientist. He failed to leap over the next incline of grout. The bug-sized man's legs only stepping off the sudden descent, sending him flailing into the dirt-filled grout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiiiieeee!\" Bryan's screech seemed as if it rang across the cold tile surrounding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later, and a shadow fell over him announcing the arrival of his prehistoric sized pursuer. Bryan's eyes grew wide with terror at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnitt! Not like this, NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth, inhaled, and prepared another scream when the vehicle-sized lizard fell upon him with gnashing teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wriggling morsel slid down the small lizard's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hungry reptile was forced to snap the tiny pink creature in two, crunching it with strong jaws. It was a small, yet stubborn catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly attempting to swallow the second chunk, dull vibrations began rattling the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the flight for life that had taken place on the tiles of his family's kitchen, Trent bounded up the back porch with long strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was nothing short of sweaty after mowing the lawn. It was a simple chore, not requiring much endurance from the high school basketball star, but working up a good sweat from the tall teenager all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent reached the back door, throwing it open. He stepped over the door mat, failing to wipe his shoes as often requested by his mother. The family seemed to be out for the time being, leaving the kitchen and house quiet and still. Glad for the respite, Trent half-smiled and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely two steps in, his ears detected a muffled crunch. \"Huh?\" Trent reacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his feet, Trent leaned against the counter and lifted his right sneaker to peer at the sole. Besides the usual crud. nothing stood out against the blue Air Force tread. His muscular arm flexed against the counter as he shifted his left sneaker. Immediately, the smashed lizard was visibly pressed into the heel section of his tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The, Fuck.\" Said the teen who stared at the tiny life he unknowingly extinguished under his shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent frowned in annoyance at the stupid inconvenience. Returning his foot to the ground, the youth turned to the back door and eyed the welcome mat. He began wiping his sneakers off on the abrasive door mat. Two drags transferred the pulverized remains to the mat along with any dirt, grass shreds, and unnoticed bugs he flattened while cutting the lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing the same to his other shoe, Trent's phone vibrated. A text from his best buddy Paul made him grin and effectively returned his attention to more important matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping out a reply, he walked back inside, slamming the door and forgetting all about the stupid lizard.</span></div></div>",

He brought the dated lawnmower to a halt, and gave the yard a survey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rich green lawn looked uniformly trimmed once more, bringing the back yard nearer to its full glory. A patch of flowers that bordered the leftmost side of the yard would require some weeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will probably want me to do that too.\" Trent grumbled as he switched the mower off and rolled it to the storage shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiped his sweat-covered brow and re-adjusted his hat. It bore the colours and logo for his favourite basketball team, like most of his clothing. The tall, strapping 18  year old was a star player of his high school team, and more than looked the part. He wore a sleeveless shirt, black and red basketball shorts, and a pair of black and blue Nike Air Force high tops that he bought only a couple months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the yard, he pulled out his vibrating smart phone and began texting. He grinned at a text his friend Paul sent him, and typed a witty reply as he stepped onto the back porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't die! Not after all this!\" Bryan thought to himself feverishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny gait proved no match for a being that was not only larger, but evolved for such pursuits. The lizard caught up quickly and prepared to cut little Bryan Smith off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's tale was never without twists for him when he felt powerful reverberations coming. The humongous door that stood like a backdrop to his minuscule drama opened suddenly. A mighty gale of wind flung the shrunken man to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, the tiny scientist watched the unaffected lizard rapidly approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, NO!\" He screamed vainly, holding his arms up in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning an enormous shape lifted overhead and crashed down with astronomical force. A gigantic high top sneaker worn by a monumentally sized teenager, who was undoubtedly unconcerned with the ground at his large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched the massive shoe lift away, revealing the once threatening lizard mashed into the circular treads among a multitude of mud, pebbles, and other unnoticed gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the towering teenager who inadvertently saved Bryan from being devoured. It was immediately clear to Bryan that shouting or arm waving would be as useless as before. The giant raised an impressive arm to his forehead, sending large drops of sweat to the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough past the giant's path, Bryan still felt incredibly threatened by the humongous teenager's feet. He wanted nothing more than to be rescued, but he knew his chances of notice were far less than the unlucky lizard. A screech of rubber rang out from the shifting sneakers as the giant began moving again. Heading towards the refrigerator across the spacious room, Bryan stared at the huge footwear that moved with such shocking fluidity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a mountain of black and blue, they sent thunderous vibrations through the cold floor with each step. Bryan noted the blue sole was moist with grass residue and flecks of mud, leaving behind clods of dirt and pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of the lizard again, crushed without notice by this humongous guy. Bryan's previous plan was shot, he needed to think of an alternative fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull rumble shook the floor, alerting him that the giant was back on the move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a few more thunderous steps, he pulled a chair from the dining table. Its legs screeched against the floor. Bryan grimaced in pain, clamping his ears shut. The chair creaked in protest as the teenager dropped into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fished a titanic phone out of his pocket and began typing furiously on its screen. Bryan, expecting the behemoth to stay still while typing, seized the opportunity and rushed forward. Only a second later, Trent stretched his long legs forward. Each shoe, with a jarring thud, came to rest just in front of Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped, falling backwards in shock. Sitting up, he stares at the towering footwear presented before him. The easily visible tread hinted that the shoes were still fairly new. However they had clearly been used a lot lately. Beneath the left sneaker, the flattened lizard was easily visible, though the gigantic teen had yet to notice it. The other sole is packed with dark dirt, pebbles, and the occasional glistening grass blade. Bryan shudders as he also notices a twitching ant in the deep tread. He can only see its head, the rest of it must have been obliterated by one of the giant's careless steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh roared from above and the giant pulls his feet back. Bryan watched the filthy soles disappear from sight as the shoes are planted firmly against the ground. Bryan stood and walked backwards, prepared for movement. A glance upwards revealed the giant continuing to stare at his phone, his massive face contorted in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shouted up at him. The giant didn't react, his handsome face locked onto the phone in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent stared at his phone, impatiently waiting to for Paul's response as to whether or not they would be hanging out soon. He fidgeted while waiting, crossing his legs under the chair, and then sitting upright with them flat against the floor. Still waiting, he noticed a wet noise every time he shifted his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Trent crossed his right sneaker over his knee. Dismissively scanning the filthy tread, he failed to notice the miserable ant trapped in the grime. Dropping his right foot to the ground, he crossed his left foot over his right knee and peered at the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Fuck.\" Trent stared at the squashed remains of a tiny lizard. Blindly reaching onto the table, Trent eventually grasped a napkin. With it he gingerly scraped the flat remains off his shoe, disregarding the other crap stuck to his shoe sole. He is staring at the small life he had unknowingly extinguished underfoot when his phone dinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his focus shifted back to the phone as Trent read Paul's reply. Thoughtlessly crumpling the napkin in his hand, Trent easily tossed it into the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul texted</span></div></div>",

He continued his fidgeting, tapping his large feet, sliding them around and crossing them while he waited. Another ding heralded Paul's next message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high school athlete greedily read the text, unable to appreciate how addicted he was to receiving such minor information from his friends. \"Five minutes?\" Trent muttered under his breath. Paul was probably walking then, since he only lived a few blocks away. The youth sighed, drumming his legs and looking around the room idly. Impatience was already setting in, so he raised the mobile device back up and searched through his apps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent settled on a simple mobile game. He tapped the screen fiercely, oblivious to the world around him and beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had retreated in terror when the giant began a cacophony of movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the young face, looking annoyed as he inspected the soles of his large sneakers. Deep rumbles blasted from the giant's mouth when he discovered the smashed lizard. Without a sign of sympathy, the gigantic teen removed the tiny remains with a napkin before returning his attention to the cellphone. Bryan kept his gaze locked onto the enormous youth, leering over his impressive physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so freaking huge!\" The shrunken scientist exclaimed. Tommy had been a sight to behold, but he was nothing compared to this taller and stronger guy. \"If Tommy didn't notice me, how the hell can I get this kid's attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan glared at the phone held in the giant's hand. \"Damn cellphones...\" If only it had been possible for Bryan to of shrunk his own, then this entire mess would of never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his reservations, he couldn't wait any longer. The gigantic youth sat idle for now, his gargantuan sneakers resting flat on the floor. He gulped at the sight of them, thinking only of the much larger reptile that had been crushed without notice. He felt terrified by the memory, wanting nothing more than to run and hide in a dark corner. \"Hiding won't do me any good. This... This... giant, is the only way for me to get back to normal!\" Bryan was a genius, and geniuses didn't just give up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant moved in his seat, muttering something. Bryan feared he would leave suddenly, leaving him stranded. \"Perhaps if I climb up...\" He looked toward the massive high-top sneakers. They shifted at random, sending light vibrations through the hard tile floor. Bryan shivered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... He must see me! I have gone through too much to stop now!\" Bristled by his own words, Bryan raced towards the humongous footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The floor, despite looking relatively clean at a glance, was populated by clods of dirt, dried blades of grass, and crumbs. The grout on the other hand proved to be more filthy. To his dismay, he passed what appeared to be flattened insect remains larger than him, and practically unidentifiable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting slightly closer to a towering table and chairs, Bryan broke into a jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent brought the roaring lawnmower to a halt after finishing the last stretch of lawn. He flicked the starter, causing the machine to shut off with a clunk. The tall, athletic 18 year old surveyed the freshly cut lawn with a sigh. His mother had been asking him to mow it all week, and after threatening to get his dad involved, he finally relented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket as he adjusted his baseball cap and wiped sweat off his brow. Pulling it out, Trent grinned as he read the message from his buddy about meeting up soon. A quickly worded reply, and he started towards the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the oldest child, Trent's parents always saddled him with the labour intensive chores, such as yardwork. He was a talented athlete in school, he looked and dressed like one. Standing 6'2\", with short cropped dark brown hair, he wore dark blue shorts, a sweat-stained shit with no sleeves, and a relatively new pair of black and blue Nike Air Force high tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teen aged stomach grumbled after a good many hours of yardwork. He bounded across the back porch to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had just been approaching an interesting crumb when heavy vibrations caught his attention. The massive door, that would seem unmovable to him, burst open loudly. A strong gale of wind swept the kitchen landscape, causing the bug-sized man to steady himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolent quakes shook to ground as the gargantuan teen stomped in, two mountain sized sneakers pounding the floor. He looked up in awe at the massive guy. Large globes of sweat dripped off the young titan as he stood. This giant's size and height completely dwarfed both Tommy and Joe, and his massive sneakers looked far larger and deadlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prepared to begin his usual yelling and waving, but sudden movement by the behemoth teen halted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up at the towering teenager who stood still and scanned the room, Bryan knew that waving and shouting would be as ineffectual as before. An angry growl emitted from the giant's stomach. Bryan took a step back as the giant lifted his arm to his forehead, the simple action causing his muscles to flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly remembered he should flee and began rushing to get underneath a lofty dining table. Not a second later he heard a deafening squeak of sneakers shifting on the tile. Turning his head confirmed what he already knew: the giant was on the move. A single step halved his distance from Bryan. Craning his neck upwards the gigantic teenager faced his destination, unconcerned with the ground at his large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't stifle a pathetic sound of terror that burst out as the giant took another step.  As the shoe quickly descended Bryan's mind saw it like a photograph. The blue sole, with it's circular tread, was packed with dirt and grass blades as well as a few crushed remains of some unnoticed bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's all I'll be now' Bryan thought, the words ringing around his head as the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent slammed the door shut behind him and paused for a moment in the cool air inside. A loud growl from his stomach reminded him how hungry he was. Wiping sweat from his brow with his forearm he glanced around the empty kitchen. He decided to put his hunger on hold and change out of his sweat-drenched shirt. His heavy footsteps echoed around the tiled room as he crossed the kitchen. Never looking down, Trent didn't see a moving speck disappear under his right shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the living room and pounded up the stairs. Entering his typically messy room, he shut the door behind himself and stepped towards his dresser. He peeled the shirt off and used it to wipe away glistening sweat from his toned chest and thick arms. Finished, he tossed it carelessly towards his hamper. It missed and hit the ground amidst other discarded clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a can of Axe, he sprayed himself generously. He tossed it back onto the dresser and wrenched open a drawer. Taking out another simple t-shirt, he pulled it over his head and ruffled his hair to tame it a bit. He stomped into the hallway, slamming the door shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan blinked in the light. He certainly hadn't expected to make it this far. Sure he had survived the first footfall that he had expected to be his doom. Trapped in the grimy tread, he had moved with each jarring footstep, the floor flying by in a blur. He had no chance to process how painful the experience was or how disgusting and demeaning it was to be trapped in the gunk in the shoe tread or how incredible it was to still be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause before he knew it he lay on the hardwood floor. Planted on each side of him were the massive blue and black sneakers he had been shaken free of. Hairy legs stretched upwards to a pair of billowing blue basketball shorts. He lay still, terrified he would be stepped on once more. His head snapped to the right as a mound of white cloth hit the ground. It added to mountains of dirty clothing, pop cans, chip bags, and other objects that were scattered across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud hiss from above was quickly accompanied by a falling mist that overpowered Bryan's nose with the scent of teenage cologne. He coughed on the scent as the giant continued to dress. With little moment the sneakers spun around, with a deafening squeak. The giant sauntered out of the room and slammed the door shut. As his footsteps faded, the silence was almost overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood up and dusted himself off, deciding that he was just fine considering what he had just gone through. He took in his surroundings in better detail. He lay amidst some scattered bits that had shaken loose from the giant's shoes. The floor in this room desperately needed to be swept, chip crumbs and grains of dirt were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over the hills of garbage was an off white dresser just ahead. In the corner near the window was a single bed, its sheets hanging off in a ragged form. At the foot of that, a small flat screen TV with a game console underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were covered in various posters, some with girls, others with bands, and a few with sports team. One frame that seemed to have fallen to the floor featured what Bryan was pretty sure was the giant teenager. In the photo he was kneeling next to a basketball, a friendly smile on his picturesque face. The name Trent Parker was listed underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't believe that this picture was that of the behemoth who had nearly killed him without even noticing. \"Yet this giant... I mean Trent, is my best hope right now.\" Bryan said out loud as though to strengthen his determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill determined to get help Bryan...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't remain amongst the unnoticed dirt left behind from Trent's huge sneakers. Bryan looked around, weighing the options presented before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I could realistically climb anything in here...\" His eyes drifting from the gargantuan shape of the bed, to a cluttered nightstand next to it. Bryan bit his lip and groaned pitifully. He needed help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis watery eyes settled on the door. Huge, and ominous looking, light from the hall glowed in to the dim bedroom. \"I have got to get him...Trent, to notice me!\" Was Bryan's determined thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be an exercise in futility to make his stand here amongst all the garbage here. Bryan began trekking towards the looming door. He loathed the idea of encountering the massive athletic giant again, but what choice did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey went quickly, but felt much longer, and left him wheezing from exertion. Bryan was able to freely pass beneath the humongous door. The usually small space was many times his height. Goosebumps prickled his skin when he saw this new environment. High above, the ceiling arched like some great cathedral. The hall spanned almost endlessly in each direction, ending far to his right with a bare wall, and nearer to his left with a staircase banister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched a house fly buzz lazily high above when a loud disturbance caught his attention. A distant gurgling flush was heard, soon followed by heavy, reverberating steps from behind a door almost directly across the hall. Bryan fluttered in terror at the sight of two large shadows visible under the door. The impossibly huge door was pulled open fluidly, revealing Trent's titanic form towering over him, his large high tops planted firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time was wasted as Bryan jumped up and down, arms flapping. It was all for not, as the huge young guy was looking at his cellphone, a smirk on his oblivious face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief quiet before the storm ended, and Trent was on the move. A huge Nike Air Force high top slammed down with thunderous result. Bug-sized Bryan was promptly flung to the ground, left only to watch as the second sneaker crashed down with equal power that caused the ground to shudder. Each step away from the tiny, unseen man presented a brief view of the giant sneaker sole, still crammed with mud, grass, and what could of been insects. <br>\r\nTerrified, and desolate, Bryan watched the gigantic teenager stomp down the hall to the crest of the stairs. Trent only then paused his fixation with the cellphone to bound thunderously down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood himself up on trembling legs. How could he hope to get any recognition from this enormous youth? He was larger than Tommy, who had already been godlike to little Bryan. Bryan was working on less than a wing and a prayer, he would need an outright miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this young guy, Trent, still remained his only hope.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scene was surreal. Here he was--tinier than most ants--stranded in the bedroom of an unknown teenaged basketball jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was still in a whirl from the terrifying journey that brought him here. Cuts, bruises, and sore limbs afflicted the tiny scientist.Though none of these physical injuries stood up to the severe emotional toll that threatened to overload his genius mind at the moment. Tommy, his beloved neighbour and helper, had inadvertently caused all his misfortune. The youth carelessly invited his friends over to Mr. Smith's home, allowing them to run rampant throughout the pristine living room. Tommy then collected him in a glass and transported him to an abandoned lot under the guise of mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly a merciful gesture!\" Bryan muttered indignantly while rubbing his bruised shoulder. He couldn't stop himself from placing the blame on Tommy. \"How the hell could he mistake me for an insect? He looked right at me!\" Grumbling, the memories continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been like being dropped into a prehistoric nightmare. Huge plants, arid landscapes, and worst of all: gigantic insects! Limping to a pebble--large enough to sit upon--he settled himself down. After his most recent trauma, this reprieve was the only thing keeping him sane. Large clods of dirt, boulders, shreds of grass, and other unidentifiable debris lay scattered around him--shaken loose from the giant's sneakers like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's nose twitched in reaction to a strong smell that seemed to permeate his small form. Sniffling, it was unmistakable: sweat. He turned to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eurgh, fuck!\" A sloping mountain of moist white fabric lay where the huge teenager had dropped it. It looked more like somebody had uprooted an entire mountain than a regular T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about the enormous room held similar fascination: The bed that loomed far away, unmade with more laundry strewn over it. A white dresser stood high and mighty next to it, scuffs, scratches, and a variety of branded stickers attesting to the athletic owner. Bryan couldn't take enough of the gargantuan space in. It was so huge. More discarded laundry lay in wrinkled heaps, looking more like oddly-coloured terrain than clothing. A closet door was slightly ajar. Jackets and baseball caps were hung carelessly on it, including a lettermans jacket with Tommy's highschool logo. On the floor, a basketball that resembled a grounded planet lay near the bed. Feeling slightly recovered, the tiny man decided to explore this strange and exotic space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, the fact that Bryan's presence was unknown actually made him excited. It was enthralling to be alone in the bedroom of this young athletic guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was <i>really</i> in desperate need of sweeping, he noted wordlessly. He was smaller than most of the dirty grit and crumbs spread across the floor. Larger than a battleship towered an empty can of Mountain Dew, half-crushed. This filth naturally attracted other uninvited life-forms. Bryan shied away from two ants that scuttled by carrying their ill-gotten crumbs. The two insects encountered another ant carrying a small white egg that altered course and followed them, vanishing from sight around the fold of a discarded sock. An entire world existed in this room. A world unknown to the giant teenager that occupied the room unaware of what he shared it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped through a cavern made by a gum wrapper and passing fallen change that would out-size most buildings. \"Damn, this kid really needs to pick up his crap...\" The minuscule explorer thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the flattened remains of a chip, Bryan discovered a seemingly edible crumb. Unlike most of the crumbs, this one was nicely sized no larger than his hand and un-hardened. He wondered at it momentarily. His usually finicky and \"organic\" diet made him debate the crumb's qualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate it all the same and felt better for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musky scent given off the dirty clothing both disgusted and revolted Bryan, who held his nostrils shut. He found that the disposed socks were the worst in terms of smell and tried to avoid them as best he could. The off-white dresser loomed close at hand, dark scuffs and marks becoming plain to his curious eyes. The sleeve of a shirt hung from the top drawer; so high up that Bryan began to feel dizzy. Underneath was an abyss of darkness cluttered with more garbage and forgotten items. Humongous balls of dust were collected underneath and around the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the sticker-covered dresser was the closet door, slightly ajar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan craned his neck back and squinted curiously. It seemed an interesting--not to mention forbidden--realm that would hold more oddities for him to explore at his diminished size. He tried to comprehend the astronomically huge door being easily opened by Trent. It was difficult for him to connect this tremendous space with anything in reality. Such thoughts seemed impossible, especially that a regular teenager lived and interacted with this mountainous environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering this, Bryan continued...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan was still gaping at the towering closet door, when the sound of distant voices broke the entrancing silence. He stopped abruptly, slowly rotating to face the bedroom door. He could hear pounding, gradually getting louder. Obnoxiously loud voices swirled together, still too muffled to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly felt like a trapped animal. After everything he had experienced at the hands (and feet) of these oblivious giants, Bryan couldn't help but be mortified merely by their presence. The bedroom door was the only thing keeping him away from the behemoths. Despite his desperate need for aid, Bryan hoped the giants wouldn't come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knob twisted and clicked, but to Bryan's confusion, the door didn't swing open. A booming laugh reverberated from the hall, and Bryan looked upwards, begging whatever deity would listen to keep them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, he didn't get what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open with excessive force, hitting the wall with a resounding thwack! In the archway stood a lean and muscular teen, who towered miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Calm the fuck down!\" Bryan recognized Trent's voice drifting from the hallway. The new giant ran a hand over his buzzed blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man! Can't help my incredible strength!\" he laughed as he stepped into the room with booming steps. Bryan looked to the floor at the titan's feet. Beneath his notice, various bugs streamed away, fleeing his quaking steps. A ship sized sneaker lifted with surprising ease, and Bryan watched in horror as it crashed down onto a group of fleeing ants. A quick glance to the teen's face confirmed he had no idea what he had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan just kept walking, his foot lifting away, leaving nothing but indiscernible debris in its wake. Trent finally appeared, as fearsome as ever, and stomped into the room behind the first giant. In his hand he clutched a bulging, brown paper bag dotted with grease stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first giant reached the bed in only three booming steps and allowed himself to fall backwards onto it. The entire room quaked violently as the mattress springs creaked loudly in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just trying to break every fucking thing in my house?\" Trent growled as he pounded up to the TV at the foot of the bed. He knelt down, exposing his grimy shoe soles. Bryan couldn\u2019t help but stare at the clods of dirt, small pebbles, and a mangled spider carcass packed into the defined tread. Trent placed the bag on the floor as he began fumbling with a mess of cords around a stadium sized game console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed creaked in protest as Trent's massive friend shifted and sat back up. \"I can go home, and take the food with me!\" he taunted playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent snapped his head towards his friend. \"Paul... we don't joke about things like that!\" he said in a mockingly serious tone before returning to the console. Following a light vibration, Paul whipped his phone out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood not four feet away feeling confused. On one hand the titanic teens were monstrous and threatening with their very presence. And yet watching their friendly exchange made them seem approachable and normal. Bryan sighed, almost overcome with emotion. They <i>were</i>normal! He was the one who wasn't normal; all at his own fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shook his head. That wouldn't change if he stood here lost in his mind! He moved forward, suppressing the urge to run as Trent stood to his towering height. He took a single step, his shoe landing on a discarded potato chip. It crumbled easily and Trent gave no indication he had even noticed it. Bryan frowned, that thing had been many times larger than him! The situation didn't seem even remotely hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent dropped onto the bed next to Paul as the TV started blaring an announcement for a racing game. Their faces were blank as they became totally engrossed in the game, sounds of revving engines and skidding tires filling the room. Bryan shook his head; to him video games were a wasteful distraction from more productive intellectual pursuits. Though he supposed in this situation, that distraction would grant him safe passage right up the behemoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued marching forward, Bryan intently studied both of the titans, since they were far more interesting than anything else in the room. He watched mystified as both became increasingly tense, their incredibly long arms and legs flexing subtly. Trent had a single leg hanging off the bed, light brown hairs coated its surface, appearing like a forest devoid of foliage. His enormous shoe swayed ominously, barely scraping the ground. Suddenly sounds of crunching metal blasted from the TV and Trent, visibly excited, kicked his leg while roaring in reaction to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot connected with the forgotten bag of food, tipping it over and spilling its contents onto the floor. Bryan stopped and whimpered as plane sized fries sped towards him. The outliers just barely reached him, most of the food spread before him like a battle scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Trent gasped. With a click all of the sounds of the game ceased so that for a second only the giants' breathing could be heard. Bryan was still frozen in shock at the massive food that had rushed up to meet him. His head snapped up at the groaning and shifting of the mattress as Trent stood up. He took a quaking step, leaning down to his spilled meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasped as Trent seemed to be staring right at him. His huge body blocked out the ceiling light, leaving his chest and handsome face in shadow. Huge hands soared down, as though they would snatch him up. Instead the thick fingers deftly picked up a few of the fallen fries. Trent raised them to his thick lips that formed an \"O\" and gave them a gusting blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five second rule!\" he thundered, flashing a winning smile. He easily popped them into his mouth. While chewing he turned his enormous head towards Paul. \"Let's eat before the food gets all nasty,\" he suggested. Trent's mountainous body blocked Bryan's view of the bed, but more creaking and groaning of the mattress signaled Paul obliging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever dude, you just know I was about to beat your ass and you needed a reason to break my focus so you can try to win!\" Paul's voice rang out from behind Trent. With a couple booming steps, Paul dropped to the floor with a quake across from Trent. Trent had meanwhile started snatching up the rest of the fallen food from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To say Bryan felt nervous would be an understatement. One moment he had been approaching the two enormous young men, and the next he was surrounded by them. Bryan remained rooted in place by indecision, fearful he would make the wrong choice that would get him killed.</span></div></div>",

Paul scanned the floor of spilled food again. Bryan, too overwhelmed to react, stares dumbly at the behemoth with a sense of trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow extended out from the blond giant as his arm shot forward like a missile. Bryan watched its progress as it slammed down behind him with a deep thud. Without warning it started sweeping towards him, collecting fallen fries and other debris indiscriminately. Finally snapped out of his stupor, Bryan shrieked and began to bolt. After a second he realized he was running straight away from it in his panic, which would do nothing to help him. He sharply curved to his right, but the damage was already done. With a rough scratching the giants were deaf to, Paul\u2019s fleshy palm collided with him. Bryan was swept off his feet yelping in pain and shock as he tumbled and spun wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn\u2019t tell what was up or down, as the world became a chaotic, blurry spiral. Without warning, he found himself covered in semi-shadow. A tug in his stomach told him he was being rapidly lifted, though his destination was unknown. In spite of the thunderous conversation of the behemoths, all Bryan could hear clearly was his own heavy panting. His spinning mind struggled to hold onto even a shred of a clear thought, desperately trying to process the situation. However his typically genius intellect was too overwhelmed by his predicament to do a single thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wasn\u2019t even given a moment of reprieve, as his ascent unexpectedly became a descent. Whatever had been holding him and the fries was gone, and all he knew was that he was plummeting downwards uncontrollably. And sooner than later he would inevitably hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul dumped the fries back into the cardboard tray they had been in, swiping his hands together for good measure. Trent nodded towards the fries, \u201cDid you just sweep some shit off my floor with those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul sighed and rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, the floor was clean!\u201d he replied dismissively. Trent grumbled wordlessly in response. \u201cQuit being a pussy! You\u2019ll live!\u201d Paul snapped.<br>\r\nTrent shrugged, dropping the fries he had picked up on top of the rest so that he could start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan grunted as he landed roughly. He rolled for a second, his eyes still squeezed shut, before tumbling off some kind of edge. He let out a surprised whoop and his eyes shot open just as he landed a few feet down, squarely on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring straight up, yellow fries crossed his view like fallen redwoods. Around him were the fries that had been retrieved from the floor, as well as various bits of dust, fuzz, and debris that had been collected unintentionally. Bryan groaned as pain coursed through his body, but warmth from the fry he lay on was admittedly soothing. He could hear roaring voices from above, but was too focused on the pain to pay attention to their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning more fries crashed down from above. Bryan shrieked as he was catapulted out of the mountain of criss-crossing fries. He arced through the air what felt like hundreds of feet but was must have only an inch or two. He crashed down, still amongst the fries, howling in pain as his right side bore the brunt of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Bryan rolled onto his back, allowing the heat from the fry to comfort him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering high above, the titanic teens pulled their sandwiches from the bag, unaware of their tiny prisoner. Their broad chests loomed above like sheer cliffs, heaving in rhythm to their gusting breaths. Up above, their faces remained expressionless as they divided up their meal and Trent grunted something about ketchup. Bryan was awed by the mountains of food they were prepared to devour. He understood the monstrous appetites of teenage boys, but at this size it was insane! Worst of all, he was now on the menu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he desperately needed to get their attention before he was devoured, Bryan forced himself to sit-up. He frantically waved his arms and screamed at the one named Paul as his pasture sized hand closed around the humongous burger. Following the loud crinkling of unwrapping the sandwich, Paul didn\u2019t hesitate to sink his teeth into it. Bryan\u2019s waving became less spirited as Paul chewed loudly. With every movement of his jaw his lips parted with a smack and his breathing became obviously audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortified by this display, Bryan turns around to see Trent switching the TV back to cable before snatching a couple fries from the other end of the container. The TV blaring in the background masked the sound of the teenagers\u2019 eating on top of his own desperate pleas. He didn\u2019t even wave this time. Mostly because he couldn\u2019t help but be awed as Trent lifted the miles long fries to his mouth, stretching out an impossibly long tongue to snatch them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is impossible!\u201d Bryan fretted. Looking around him, the fry he sat on stretched away in two directions. One end towards Trent and the other end towards Paul. He had no idea which was the fastest to the edge, but he figured his chances of getting noticed would be easier if the massive teenagers weren\u2019t trying to eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting another second, Bryan started heading towards\u2026</span></div></div>",

His movement however seemed to imbalance the fly as the thing dove downwards.About to collide with the table's surface the fly pulled upward suddenly. The abrupt movement proved too much for Bryan and he lost his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled in terror as he fell downwards at an angle. Grunting on contact, Bryan rolled before finally stopping. His chest heaved as he took deep breaths while simultaneously mentally checking for any injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly buzzed away, apparently no longer interested in the tiny man. As Bryan calmed down and his breathing returned to normal, he sat up. \"Augh\" he groaned, his hand flying to his forehead automatically. The ride with the fly had made him very dizzy which was making him nauseous. In his pain Bryan didn't notice as a lawn mower outside ceased to roar outside. Sitting still Bryan hoped the sick feelings would pass, as this was only going to make to harder to accomplish anything productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent cut the motor of the lawn mower and sighed. \"Fuck, its hot!\" he grunted, happy to be done.Pushing the mower through the grass, he returned it to the lonely shed at the back fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his pocket, his phone buzzed. Trent ignored the sweat dripping down his face and pulled it out. Squinting at the screen he grinned at a message from his friend asking if he was up to hanging out. He crossed the yard as he typed out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the oldest child, Trent always ended up with the hardest chores, including yard work. Not that the 18 year old had any problem handling it. Standing 6'2\", with short cropped dark brown hair, he wore dark blue shorts, a sweat-stained shirt with no sleeves, and a relatively new pair of black and blue Nike Air Force high tops. He was a proud high school athlete, and any one could tell by looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he jumped onto the back porch his toned stomach rumbled with hunger. Trent placed his hand against it as he reached the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's head snapped up in reaction to a loud creek and gust of wind to his right. He groaned, still recovering from the flight and fall from the fly. Bright light from outside outlined a towering silhouette. A gigantic teenager strode inside, his entire body glistening in a sheen of sweat that outlined his rippling muscles. Bryan gasped in surprise with the entrance of such an impressive titan. He used his arm to wipe his brow of sweat as he slammed the door shut, causing the table to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood still for a moment, as if to give Bryan time to absorb just how large he was. A strange growl sounded through the room and the giant stepped forward. Bryan yelped as he approached the table, his footstep causing the surface to rattle. He passed by fluidly, like a cruise ship. The shirt's white fabric was drenched with sweat. Each step caused a quake that rattled the table, his footsteps squeaking loudly on the tile. Bryan was thankful he hadn't landed on the floor and thus didn't have to deal with what were undoubtedly terrifyingly large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan thuded into the living room and disappeared up the stairs, the occasional creak reminding Bryan of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better Bryan stood up and looked around the table. A smooth wooden surface, with a few minuscule crumbs that were easily overlooked by the giants were like boulders spread around him. Besides that the table was bare, there weren't even salt and pepper shakers. He had no choice but to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent paused in the kitchen allowing the cold air to engulf him before slamming the door shut. His stomach growled as he scanned the empty kitchen. Before he ate, though, he decided to change out of his nasty shirt. Walking through the kitchen, Trent was unaware how loud and heavy each of his footsteps were as they rattled the room. He rushed up the stairs to his room, his hunger making move even faster.</span></div></div>",

Having lived in the house most of his life, the now normal sound didn't even register in his consciousness. He now sported a white and blue t-shirt from his junior year football playoffs. As he crosses the living room his stomach growls again. Trent Parker is ready to eat!\" he announces to the empty kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the kitchen he pulls the ancient fridge open, its hum magnified as an orange glow bathes him. Trent frowns, scratching his short, brown hair while trying to decide. He could make nachos or a sandwich with the stuff in here. Also there were some leftovers from his mother's lasagna from the other night.  Checking the freezer revealed a frozen pizza Trent knew he would hate, and nothing else he could work with. He spun around, using his momentum to shut the freezer door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the pantry he passed the table, kicking the toe of his shoe against a table leg. \"Ha! Had my shoe on motherfucker!\" he scoffs at the table before opening the cupboard. Microwaveable popcorn and boxes of mac and cheese stood out as his only options amongst canned food and spices he had no interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent returns to the fridge, wrenches the door open, and leans down to get a close look at the food. He didn't want nachos, and he was pretty sure the lasagna was supposed to be saved for tonight's dinner. That left one option: the sandwich. Easy to make and delicious; it sounded like a good choice. Trent grabs lunch meat, cheese, a plastic jar of mayonnaise, a baggie of lettuce, and a loaf of bread. One by one they were carelessly tossed onto the table behind him, without a backwards glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jars in the fridge rattle as he shuts the door and side-steps to the silverware drawer for a knife. Tool in hand, Trent returns to the table where his sandwich ingredients rest haphazardly. Pulling out two slices of bread, Trent drops them onto the table. After spreading mayonnaise on the bread he wonders what his side dish should be. Returning to the pantry, he pulls out a bag of chips and tosses them onto the table. The bag lands on the table and falls to its side, spilling chips all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit\u201d Trent grumbles, snatching up the bag. Holding the opening at the edge of the table with one hand, he uses the other to sweep the chips back into the bag. Gently placing the bag on the table, he walks back to the beginnings of his sandwich. Still feeling chip crumbs on his palms he swipes them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops a generous amount of meat on each slice. However he places a single slice of cheese on one side, while the other gets a few leaves of lettuce. Happy with its construction he squishes the sandwich together. He quickly returns all the ingredients to the fridge, and grabs a plate from a cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his mother wouldn\u2019t like it, he decides to eat in front of the TV. Besides he had been outside for hours, he deserved a good break. Placing his food on the coffee table, Trent plops down onto the sofa with a smack and subsequent creak of protest. He leans forward and moves his food onto the sofa cushion next to him and props his feet onto the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the remote to switch the TV on, Trent feels an itch at his ankle. He reaches down his long leg and digs his fingernails into his skin. Mere inches from his hand, his shoe soles are illuminated by the TV. Though fairly new, the black and blue tread was already packed with dirt, unidentifiable grime, and a hardened piece of gum as well as blades of grass and flattened bugs from earlier that day. Trent however was utterly unaware of the devastation caused by his simple footsteps as well as the messy and gruesome display trapped underneath his shoe soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally settling on a rerun of Friends, Trent leans back into the overstuffed cushions of the couch to get comfortable. He places his plate onto his lap as his stomach growls once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick and loud series of pounds emits from the living room. Bryan, feeling better, turns towards the noise. Sure enough the incredibly tall teenager is returning to the kitchen, now dressed in a more colorful t-shirt. A strange growl emits from the giant. \"TRENT PARKER IS READY TO EAT!\" the giant roars. His voice is deafening, and rather terrifying to tiny Bryan. As the giant enters the kitchen Bryan shakes away the fear and looks closer at the new shirt. It has the logo from Tommy's high school on it! Mr. Smith is thrilled, hoping that when he contacts the young titan, he could take him to Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, each of the giant's footsteps rattle the table as the giant approaches the skyscraper of a fridge. He easily pulls it open and stands still for a moment before opening the freezer above as well. Bryan, watching the behemoth intently, jumps when his sudden movement sends the doors crashing shut with a thundering gust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently as he crosses the kitchen, his foot collides with the table and the entire surface quakes, knocking Bryan off his feet. \"HA! HAD MY SHOE ON MOTHERFUCKER!\" the teen thunders at the table, showering Bryan with a spray of saliva. As Bryan tries to clean himself off the towering young man scans the pantry before stomping back to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan can't helped but be awed by the enormous giant who exuded power with his every casual movement. That each footstep rattled Bryan's world. The defined muscles that dwarfed hills. The fact that he appeared so large, yet moved so quickly and effortlessly. Though in reality just a regular teenager (an athletically gifted one at that) the monstrous Trent strikes fear into Bryan\u2019s heart. He tries to keep calm, knowing the titanic teen is currently his only chance of rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent had reopened the fridge and leaned down, whatever he was investigating obscured by his gigantic torso. Bryan hears the sound of crinkling plastic and with a loud thud, a massive container of lunch meat crashes onto the table. He screams as Trent launches massive food items out of the fridge at random. Each one crashes down with a quaking thud, thankfully missing Bryan. His heart pounding in his chest, Bryan decides to at least get to the other side of the table. Trent is starting to seem very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rushes away as Trent retrieves a knife and returns to the edge of the table. Bryan looks back at the behemoth as he continues to flee. Towering far over the table, Trent looks like something out of a myth. His handsome face is void of emotion as he smoothly removes two slices of bread from the loaf and lets them plop onto the table. \"Right where I was!\" Bryan cries out, relief flooding his body that he had avoided that problem. Trent uses the broad knife to spread what seems to Bryan to be a boatload of mayonnaise onto the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan slows to a stop, finally across the table where he believes he can watch the titan in relative safety. Trent drops the knife onto the table with a piercing clang. Bryan cringes from the noise as the giant thuds across the kitchen once more. Before Bryan can react, Trent removes a bag of chips from the cupboard and tosses them onto the table. \"Oh, not again!\" Bryan moans as he watches the bag tip towards him in slow motion. Sure enough chips come flying out, sliding across the surface with a few surrounding Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT\" thunders the giant from above. Crinkling sounds across the table as the bag of chips is up-righted and flies out of sight. Trent's immense arm stretches overhead. Bryan yelps as immediately following a thud, he hears a quickly approaching scraping noise. Before he can move, a wall of flesh shoving the chips appears. Bryan screams as it collides with him. He sticks to Trent's vast palm with various chip crumbs. At the edge of the table he watches the chips plunge back into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming once more, Trent's arm moves wildly as he approaches his sandwich. Apparently suddenly conscious of the crumbs on his hands, he wipes them together. Bryan's body stings from the collision as he goes into free-fall with the freed crumbs. He lands with a splat in something surprisingly soft. Forcing himself to open his eyes he sees Trent's chest towering right above, before his view is obscured by a crushing pink, object. The smell is unmistakable: lunch meat. He had landed in the massive teenager's sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles, with little success, to move in the constricting sauce and meat. He can hear more things thudding onto the sandwich above, as well as sudden pressure in what he assumes is Trent finishing the sandwich. \"Good God. He\u2019s going to eat me!\" Bryan gasps. The world tilts and sways before dropping suddenly as Trent relocates to the living room. There is nearly a minute of rest before another jarring movement. As the motions cease once more, a loud gurgling noise sounds very near. The giant was resting the plate against his stomach, the ominous noise torturing tiny Bryan.</span></div></div>",

It was better than he expected, although that may have just been due to his hunger. While chewing quickly, he brings the sandwich to his lips, swallows the bite in his mouth and immediately sinks his teeth into the sandwich, ripping out another large bite. Not feeling as desperate, Trent doesn\u2019t chew as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention mostly focused on the show, Trent swallows as he reaches for the bag of chips. Grasping a small handful he brings his hand to his wide open mouth and shoves them in. As his teeth come together a loud crunch sounds across the room, followed by a rhythmic chomping. Following another loud gulp, Trent\u2019s lips part as he unconsciously uses his tongue to probe at chunks of bread stuck inside his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent makes quick work of the sandwich and chips as the show goes on. He is barely conscious of the food as it passes into his mouth and slips down his throat. After sinking his jaws into the sandwich yet again, a sudden funny moment elicits a roar of laughter from Trent. Light illuminates soggy, half-chewed piles of food in his mouth, and ropes of thick saliva. Calming down, Trent quickly moves the food to the back of his mouth and with a gulp it is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pops a few more chips in his mouth, the grinding noise drowning out the show. To remedy this Trent chews faster and swallows too soon. After a moment of struggle he manages to get the food down. He reaches towards the plate and grabs the last piece of the sandwich. Bringing it to his mouth, his tongue stretches forward, and he easily pops it into his mouth. After a few moments of chewing Trent gulps it down and can feel a satisfying feeling of fullness from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screams again as he feels the entire area shiver as Trent takes his first bite. Though he can't see anything yet, Bryan imagines Trent's jagged teeth crashing together as he nonchalantly destroys the sandwich around Bryan. Bryan continues to squirm, hoping against all odds that he can still escape. A gulp from outside is immediately followed by another jarring bite that feels significantly closer. Bryan, having watched his nephew Zack grow up, knew just how ruthless teenage boys were with their food. They gulped down mounds in mere minutes. Trent it seemed, was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening crunch, followed by muted ones, reminds Bryan just how close his doom is. Every sound of  the giant eating, harmless at normal size, struck Bryan with icy terror. Another gulp. Another quaking bite. More crunching chips and smacks of chewing. Repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation is getting overwhelming and Bryan begins to sink into a horrified stupor. That is, until a wall of white comes crashing down just to his left. It pulls away with a deafening rip as the lips close around the latest catch. Bryan watches frozen as Trent's thick lips shift, the sound of chewing louder but still muted. Occasionally his mouth opens to reveal chunks of food flying around the dark cavern. The lips purse and a gulp sounds ahead of Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realizes too late that he had wasted precious time. \"Augh! no, No, NO!\" he wails, struggling to back away as the sandwich moves towards the mouth. Trent\u2019s tongue springs forward, soggy lumps of bread, chunks of meat, flakes of lettuce and shards of chip are spread across its surface. Strands of saliva stretch from the tongue up to the sharp molars, packed with chewed sandwich remains. For just a second Bryan can see the massive teenager's face staring blankly at the TV. He is unaware of Bryan's struggle, and unconcerned with the fate of his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill scream of anger and fear erupts from Bryan as he moves forward, underneath the wall of perfectly straight white teeth. The air within the mouth is thick with humidity and stench. The surface of the tongue, and the gruesome bits of food collide with the sandwich. As Trent bites into the sandwich, Bryan and the bite of sandwich are blanketed in darkness. Without a moment's reprieve, Trent begins to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rolls and falls with the quick movements. The amplified squishes surround him, reminding him there is no safe direction. He hits teeth and slides across the tongue before colliding into a soggy pile of bread. Trent's lips part briefly a few times, showing Bryan terrible flashes of glinting teeth and soggy mounds of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire cavern is flooded with light as the mouth is wide open. Trent is... laughing. Bryan shudders, seeing the multicolored mess of chewed food piled around him, chunks hanging from above and thick ropes of saliva vibrating with the laughter. Beyond the towering, razor-sharp teeth, stretches Trent's legs ending in his blue and black Nikes, pointed at the TV where the characters stand surprised. It almost looks as though Bryan himself is watching TV, save for the gruesome mess he is trapped in. As the laughter fades, the lips come together once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealed in darkness again, the tongue underneath heaves. \"Nooo! Don't swallow me, you can still save me!\" Bryan pleads as the tongue forces him to join the chewed bite to the back of the mouth. Unable to hear the pleas within his mouth Trent swallows, the squelching gulp echoing around him as he is violently sucked into the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside a mere bob of his Adam's apple signals Bryan's passing into Trent's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wants to sob, but the hulking pressure of the esophagus is preventing him from doing anything. Around him he hears the pounding heart, and gusting lungs hard at work for the living giant Bryan is sinking into. He is squeezed through a sphincter, landing with a splat in a dim chamber. Around him wrinkly wet pink walls gently pulse. He lays atop a mountain of soggy chewed sandwich, mixed with chip mush. Above him he hears a loud crunching. \"Of course Trent would continue to eat,\" Bryan muttered bitterly, \"It's not like anything significant just happened!\" He hears several gulps above, as though Trent is having a difficult time swallowing. Survival instinct kicks in and Bryan attempts to move away from the stomach entrance. He trips and yells as he slides down the disgusting slope. Not a moment too soon as Trent's latest bite drops into the stomach with a smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan racks his mind for a solution. His genius discovery had landed him inside a massive teenager's stomach. Surely, Bryan reasoned deliriously, he could find a way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more comfortable in the overstuffed couch cushions, he continues to absently munch on the chips until the show ends. Trent gives no thought to the specifics of his full stomach. He doesn't imagine the disgusting interior with its sodden mountain of saliva drenched food. He is completely oblivious to the minuscule man trapped in his stomach as more chip mush rains in. Not for one second does he think about the violent fate his meal would meet inside his gut. Trent is only concerned with the world he lives in, and its main event: the TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world inside him that is his digestive tract did not exist for Trent. It only existed for Bryan and would soon eradicate him. As Trent continues to stare blankly at the screen, he has no way to hear the pleas for help and frustrated screams of Bryan. The tiny man struggles to move, unable to come up with an escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent glances at his phone, realizing its time to go meet his friends. He stands, leaving a plate strewn with crumbs and crumpled bag of chips on the coffee table. He walks out the front door, and down the block, his feet crunching against the pavement. In the park a few of his friends have started a game of basketball. He jogs through the grass to them and joins the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trent moves about wildly during the game, each slamming footstep jarring his body, Bryan feels it ten times worse. The food slides and shifts in a thick storm of movement. Bryan yelps and begs for help, struggling to stay afloat. But there is no one who can hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game ends and the group of boys walks to one's house for a round of video games. Bryan cheers as he managed to stay alive, perhaps after all this he could make it out! At that moment, acids begin to flood the stomach. It rises around the mounds of soggy food, as the walls move aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent doesn't notice as his stomach begins to churn violently, nor does he hear his unnoticed passenger's protests of terror. Bryan climbs higher to avoid the acids, but has little hope as the stomach moves wildly. He doesn't last long before he is swept wailing into the acids and dissolving food. Pain becomes his only thought before he finally passes out to perish in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent, unaware of the gruesome happening inside his gut, enjoys the rest of the relaxing and uneventful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later Trent sees that a man who lived nearby had been reported missing. \"Scary shit!\" he muttered as he popped a couple Cheetos into his mouth. Unaware of his role in the man's disappearance; Trent carries deep within his stomach all that is left of the genius, Bryan Smith.</span></div></div>",

He loved this show since he was a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the opening credits came to a close and the episode began, he gawked at then young Jennifer Aniston. \"Damn, she is hot!\" He stated loudly. Without breaking his stare, he reached for his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tingled on his leg. \"The Hell...?\" Trent instead relocated the plate to the couch cushion next to him and sat up to scratch his leg. He grumbled as he spotted the cause, a tiny black ant crawling through the hairs on his calf. He brushed it off to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door suddenly flew open, causing Trent to forget the pesky ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wazzup man!\" Trent's good buddy Paul came bounding in, slamming the door behind him. \"Where the fuck have you been!?\" Paul questioned as he plopped down next to Trent. Paul was a few months younger than Trent, but stood a couple of inches taller than him. He wore a school team T-shirt, jeans, and a pair of tattered Air Jordan Vs. They were both on the high school basketball team, so they often went out to shoot hoops in their free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I texted you like a hundred times!\" Paul scolded. Glancing at the flashing TV, he idly scratched his buzzed blond head. \"Thought we were going to the park today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent sighed in response and explained his day spent mowing the lawn. \"I just finished like 5 minutes ago...\" Trent said as he pulled his cell phone out to confirm the alleged texts. \"Fucking starved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul grinned at his friend's sandwich hungrily. \"It was a long walk here, dude...\" He hinted coyly, and propped his own large feet on the coffee table. The young guy gave his buddy a pat and casually leaned over and snatched the sandwich plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Trent could properly react, Paul took a bite of the hearty snack and then dropped it when Trent lunged to retrieve it. \"Goddammit, man!\" Trent looked at his ruined creation laying in pieces on the floor. He glared back up at his buddy, who stifled a laugh through his full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the two huge teenagers, an incredibly tiny pale speck ended up...</span></div></div>",

However after only a few seconds he sat back up and snapped at Paul \"God, didn't your mother teach you to chew with your fucking mouth closed!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one second Paul was surprised, as he hadn't realized that he had been chewing with his mouth open. Recovering quickly he leaned towards Trent and gnashed his jaws, loudly crushing the food. \"Do you want some? I can share!\" For added effect, Paul stuck out his long tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent, seeing the half chewed food and strands of saliva in his friend's mouth, makes a face. \"Fuck you Paul,\" he grunts, punching him in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small chunk of the chewed sandwich is knocked loose, landing in Paul's hand. Closing his mouth, Paul looks down at it. \"Well that was convenient!\" he says happily, tossing the chunk of food back into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trent returns to picking up the pieces of his sandwich, Paul resumes chewing, once again obliviously with his mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's panicked struggles are accomplishing little, but his mind is drawing blanks for alternatives. He feels the entire sandwich move, and freezes in fear. A moment of calm is followed by a slam, thudding, and thundering voices. However, with everything muted by the bread, Bryan has no clue what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violent lurch, however, elicits a screech of fear and before Bryan knows it, a deafening crunch coupled with extreme pressure surrounds him. \"I'm being eaten,\" Bryan realizes in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lurch to the side and another crunch, the world around him falls apart. In mere seconds he witnesses building sized molars mercilessly crush the sandwich that had just seemed so solid. With every movement light flashes, illuminating sharp teeth, and thick ropes of saliva between the mutilated chunks of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything stops abruptly. Light streams in through, what Bryan recognizes to be, the opening of the mouth. He finds himself rolled into a large ball of semi-chewed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight floods the cavern as the mouth opens wide and the teeth repeatedly come crashing together with loud splats. Bryan is both terrified and mystified by this odd and destructive act, done simply by a teenager's teeth. A roar gusts through before the tongue beneath him slides out into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasps in shock to see Trent's mountainous face closeup, sneering in disgust. \"HELP ME!\" he shrieks, waving his free arm. Around him, the partially chewed food glints in the light, saliva stretching between the slowly shifting chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, who's this?!\" Bryan wonders in surprise. Looking up simply reveals a rounded nose tip above. Ahead of him, Trent dismisses the disgusting mouthful, looking away as he thunders \"FUCK YOU PAUL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan begs before feeling the pull of gravity as his chunk of food falls free. He is still screaming after landing. Around him thick, long fingers stretch outwards. He looks up to see an unfamiliar face staring down, placing him in shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP ME, PLEASE!\" Bryan repeats to this new giant who he can only assume is Paul. The giant's thick lips are stretched into a smile, his blue eyes glinting happily. Bryan imagines he was seen. \"WELL, THAT WAS CONVENIENT!\" Paul thunders, saliva and food pieces showering Bryan. Bryan only has the chance to grunt in confusion, before the enormous mouth widens, and he flies upwards. Bryan's screams louder than ever as he is launched back into the hills of soggy chewed chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul tried to ignore Trent as he ranted while picking up the ruined pieces of his sandwich. \"... and I was so fucking hungry! Then you came along!\" Trent continued.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Bro!\" Paul interrupted. He paused to swallow before continuing \"I just wanted a single bite, it was an accident. I'm sorry, move on!\" Trent glared at him for a second, before grunting and snatching up the slice of cheese from the floor. Paul's stomach growled, clearly unsatisfied with the single bite of sandwich. \"Now I'm hungry,\" Paul states bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a fucking sandwich?\" Trent snaps in return as he stands up. Paul rolls his eyes as he watches Trent stomp into the kitchen before following his friend. Trent dumps the ruined sandwich into the garbage as Paul strolls in. \"Let's go somewhere!\" he suggests, pausing for a moment. \"Like King's! Their cheese fries sound bomb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent sighs, an annoyed expression still on his face. \"Well there's nothing left here, so we might as well...\" he trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! I'll text Jared and Ryan to meet us there!\" Paul says excitedly. Trent grabs his keys and the two boys head out the front door and pound down the steps. As Paul texts, his tongue unconsciously probes his mouth for stray chunks of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Paul continued to chew, Bryan watched the food be mutilated further. In one moment that had lasted forever, he had ended up underneath a row of jagged molars, chunks of bread and meat hanging from them. Against all odds, when the teeth came together, he was pushed sideways and descended downwards, below the gum-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Paul never shut his mouth as, after gulping the bite down, light illuminated his surroundings. Rising above him were soft pink walls and above those, ivory towers that had a few remaining chunks of food stuck to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lay still, next to a small hill of bread mush, detached from his reality. So much had happened in the last minute. He had been eaten by some random teenager like a simple crumb. Although as far as Paul and Trent were concerned, that's all he was. Really he was less than that. The towering teenagers were completely unaware of his very existence. This massive youth had no idea of the tiny scientist trapped in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was shaken from his thoughts with the appearance of a massive monster. The pink tip of Paul\u2019s tongue was pushing down towards him, easily warping the mouth wall to fit lower. Small bits of bread still clung to its slimy surface as it searched for stray bits of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sputtered in terror, attempting to crawl backwards to escape. The gigantic thing lapped at the pile of bread mush and retreated, having retrieved the majority of the pile. Bryan breathed a sigh of relief and lay back down, already drenched to the core in sticky saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled against shock, fear, and hopelessness that threatened to overwhelm and completely shut down his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly decided action would prevent a total breakdown. Bryan figured he ought to head towards the front of the mouth. After all that was the only exit he wanted to take out of the foul cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began following the line of towering teeth, trying not to slip on the disgustingly moist \u201cground\u201d.</span></div></div>",

He had no clue that every sound he made caused more distress to an unnoticed passenger trekking along his gum-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent pulls into a parking lot past a sign in the shape of a crown reading \u201cKing\u2019s\u201d with \u201cRoyally delicious\u201d written underneath. Paul jumps out of the car as soon as it stops, his sneakers crunching against the pavement. Trent kills the engine and rushes after his buddy yelling \u201cCalm the fuck down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks through the front door to find Paul scanning the restaurant for the rest of their friends. Trent and Paul, both towering well over 6 feet tall, have little problem finding the table with their friends near the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated at the table are Ryan and Jared. Ryan, who was half-Mexican and had the tan skin to show for it, is wearing a simple black t-shirt and dark jeans. Though hidden under the table, his shoes are red and black versions of the ones Trent has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Trent, Paul, and Ryan all stand within inches of each other, Jared was noticeably shorter. He made up for this with his bulk, making him invaluable in wrestling and football. His green shirt was stretched tight against his muscles, and his gray shorts and white flip flops showed off his thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of boys were some of the top athletes at their school, and had been friends for a long time already. As Paul and Trent approached the table all four loudly greeted each other, some of their foul language earning them dirty stares from other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress approached the table with menus in one hand and a steaming plate in the other. \u201cFor you!\u201d she chirped, handing Trent and Paul each a menu. \u201cAnd the cheese fries!\u201d she added, placing the plate into the center of the table. With a smile and a nod she rushed off to help other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul\u2019s mouth watered, staring at the heap of fries smothered in cheese, bacon, and some flecks of spices. A bowl of ranch sat like a lake in the middle of the dish. As he reached for the dip, Trent turned to his other two buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got here quick!\u201d Trent exclaimed. Ryan shrugged \u201cI was on my way to pick up Jared from his dad\u2019s and step-mom\u2019s place.\u201d Jared glowered, \u201cYeah, my mom took my car, just cuz of that fucking history test I failed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Cuz you\u2019re a dumbass!\u201d Paul laughed. Jared flipped him off while Trent wiped his arm. \u201cEw! Dude, say it don\u2019t spray it!\u201d he grumbled in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had been walking for awhile, doing his best to tolerate Paul\u2019s earsplitting voice. He had yet to see any form of escape from his trench-like entrapment at the base of Paul\u2019s immense teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rush of saliva sweeps him off his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAugh!! What the hell!\u201d he stammers as he finds himself treading through the thick liquid. That is until he realizes that he is rising with it, as the stuff flows around the teeth. Before long Bryan flows onto the tongue. In the more open area the saliva spreads out, though it\u2019s still as deep as a wading pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looks around, seeing gigantic molars protruding from the pink ceiling. In the jagged surfaces of his teeth, the occasional filling glints. Thick cords of saliva stretch and flow down from above. The long rough tongue, its surface constantly rolling sinks into the darkness of the throat. A long uvula hangs, its color a stark contrast to the blackness it precedes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is amazed at the landscape like structure of this teenager\u2019s mouth. The mountains of food that Bryan had been thrown into are long gone, as if they had never been there. Bryan stares into the deep throat, imagining the single bite that had sunken into its abyss, undoubtedly totally dismissed by the youth. The giant boy would never be able to appreciate how destructive his meals were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turns away to face the front of the mouth, where the tip of the tongue meets the enormous, squareish front teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he takes even a single step, a roar that he had recently become accustomed to erupts from behind. Bryan is sent flying, his screams of terror drowned out by Paul\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Bryan finds himself surrounded by</span></div></div>",

HELP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape suddenly shifted violently, causing the tiny speck of a man to stumble. He gripped one of the thick dark cords, and gazed up. The gigantic teenager, Trent, loomed high above. The giant's face grinned and joked with his buddy sitting across from him. Another disturbance as the enormous arm moved, sent Bryan reeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to find me!\" Bryan gulped. Despite his circumstances, this situation was the best he might get for gaining the attention of this behemoth guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fleshy hair-covered landscape calmed once more, Bryan jumped into action. He grabbed the nearest hair, a strand that was taller than he was, and pulled viciously. The thick cord proved sturdier than he thought. It barely budged. Bryan was once again flung to the warm, soft surface when the arm moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the tanned flesh dumbly. An idea so obvious hit him like a brick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nails, once nicely manicured, began scratching and digging into the living ground beneath him.

Bryan flung himself only to become tangled painfully before a humongous digit slammed into him and sent him flying with tremendous force. \"Noooooooooo!\" He cried out, whipping violently through open airspace like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even prepare himself, Bryan suddenly landed roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight prickle irritated Trent's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout bothering to pause his banter, he idly scratched his arm. Not a single thought was given to the light screech he barely detected as he itched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....it was fucking awesome, you should'a seen it!\" Trent finished his story with a grin while his buddies chortled. He fished his phone out of his pocket and flicked the screen on. \"Crap, it's getting late. We need to get going if we wanna shoot some hoops!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all voiced agreement and prepared to leave.

He then hands the bowl across the table to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys dig into the mountain of fries, while at the same time noisily talking and laughing. They search for the part of the pile with the most cheese and bacon and greedily snatch it up. After dragging through some ranch they lift it to their mouths and happily devour it. Focused on their conversation, they boys don\u2019t think twice about the food sinking down their throats into their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan immediately begins to sweat from the heat. Fanning himself, he stands amid droplets of saliva. The rough and yellow ground is dotted with small black and white cubes. It stretches towards a flow of orange dotted with large red chunks. Steam rises from everywhere, and momentarily clouds his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever looking up reveals a crystal clear sight. Towering around him are four giant teenagers, as if gathered around some mini arena. The shadows make them appear almost evil, as they chuckle thunder to each other. Bryan instantly recognizes Trent and a moment later Paul in their matching t-shirts. However a tan giant in black, and a bulky one in green are new to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh not more teenagers!\u201d Bryan shouts in exasperation. He sees Trent hand the tan one a large white dome. The words \u201cKing\u2019s: Royally delicious\u201d are printed on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hits him like a ton of bricks. He is standing on a mountain of fries, covered in cheese and bacon, surrounded by four massive and hungry high school boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later, the bulky one\u2019s hand reaches forward, easily removing a handful of fries. Bryan whimpers as it disappears from sight, before rising up to the giant\u2019s mouth dripping with ranch. A massive tongue appears and the entire thing disappears behind the boy\u2019s lips. He chews with a smile on his face as he talks to Trent. The other three boys do not waste any time as they snatch away pieces of the mountain and scarf them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tries to flee, but soon realizes he is surrounded by thick cheese. With no other choice Bryan begins waving and screaming, desperately hoping to get someone\u2019s attention before they wolf him down without even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the boys\u2019 booming voices easily drown him out. The occasional bit of conversation is actually understandable to his delicate ears and he learns the tan one is Ryan, and the bulky one is Jared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues screaming as broad hands pluck away more fries. One moment he looks up to see Ryan staring right at him. \u201cYes! Right here!\u201d Bryan shouts ecstatically. The boy\u2019s greasy fingers soar over head, causing a small quake as they remove some fries supporting Bryan\u2019s spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe howls in frustration. These boys would never notice him! They wouldn\u2019t normally pay more than a passing glance to their food as they ate it; how would they ever discern his puny presence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears in his eyes he gazes up at Ryan, whom he thought had noticed him. The boy is chewing the bite he had retrieved, ranch smeared on his cheek, as he grins listening to a story from Paul. Bryan turns to stare at Paul who is enthusiastically informing his friends about a crazy party with his cousin. Half chewed piles of fries are easily visible inside his mouth as he speaks. His friends don\u2019t even react to it, though for Bryan it\u2019s a terrible preview. Ahead of him Trent raises another chunk of fries to his lips. His tongue slides out of his mouth, pieces of food and smears of dip easily visible even to Bryan, before it snags the food and retreats behind the lips. Trent chews, while listening intently to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling yet another quake, Bryan locks his eyes on Jared\u2019s meaty hand as it grasps a load of fries, each piece sticking at random. A strand of cheese connected to the pile thins before finally breaking as he pulls the food free. After dipping it into ranch, he stuffs it into his mouth, allowing half to hang from between his lips as he begins to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA miserable sob rocks Bryan\u2019s body as he gives up. These boys were enjoying a casual snack, as they hung out with each other. They were totally ignorant to his existence just in front of them. Their unwittingly disgusting eating habits were putting on an awful show for Bryan. And he knew, most likely in just a few minutes, he would be devoured in an equally brutal fashion. The only question remained which one it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared didn\u2019t even look down as he grasped a few more fries in his hand. Even if he had, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed the small speck that went tumbling into some cheese still on the plate. As Jared continues stuffing his mouth, Ryan reaches into the pile. His hand lowers directly onto the overlooked speck, lifting a stack of fries to his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dips the pile into a lake of ranch before lifting it to his lips. His eyes are locked onto Trent as he tells a long joke. Had Ryan looked down, the small speck struggling in the ranch would not have been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth widens and Ryan unconsciously slides his tongue out towards the food. The speck is welcomed with glinting white teeth, and a tongue covered with mutilated fry remains and soggy strands of cheese. Its cries for help never reach any of the four boys\u2019 ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan doesn\u2019t think for even a second as he chews the fries up. His teeth easily tear into the mound, sending the speck flying about chaotically, as the food is reduced to mush. He instinctively swallows the pulverized bite and begins to speak. The food descending into his chest doesn\u2019t get a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan and the fry mush land with a splat in the stomach, joining a soggy mountain of previous bites. Bryan continues to sob, merely awaiting the acids that he knows will soon come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continues to eat, Ryan gives no thought to the food building up in his toned gut. He has no clue about the sobbing person trapped deep within his body. After the boys finish the fries and go their separate ways, Ryan never considers the meal inside him, awaiting digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later he is seated on a couch at home, trying to find something to watch on TV. His meal, long forgotten, still rests in his stomach. Bryan lay immobile in a valley of chewed food, driven mad by his delayed fate inside the oblivious teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle from his stomach signals the flow of acids into the stomach. The noise, gentle from Ryan\u2019s perspective, goes beneath his notice. Ryan\u2019s bored expression, illuminated by the TV, is the complete opposite of Bryan\u2019s, whose face contorts into fear as the stomach acid storms around him and the once delicious looking food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighs unhappily. This was the worst part of his day by a long shot; there had been nothing good on TV for over an hour! He is unaware of the tiny genius trapped within his digestive tract, having a much worse time. Bryan\u2019s pained screams echo around Ryan's cavernous stomach, his passing heard by none.</span></div></div>",

Then his edible prison began moving violently. Loud muffled voices and a thunderous crunch followed. Suddenly his world went topsy-turvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing himself, he looked at his new surroundings. He sat on a rolling expanse of pale turkey meat. A huge slice of porous bread loomed ahead with a draping sheet of yellow cheese the size of a football field. 'I could solve world hunger easily!' He thought promisingly. Then he burst back into his reality when an enormous hand dropped from above and snatched up the large slice of bread roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up in alarm. Trent loomed overhead with a plate in-hand, his massive form cast a huge shadow over the floor. Bryan yelped and stumbled furiously down the turkey landscape towards the floor just before the huge fingers returned. Building-sized digits plucked the remaining pieces of food off floor, leaving behind only tiny breads crumbs, cheese bits, and one minuscule man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man was glad to be freed of the massive sandwich, but his current position offered new dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's awe-struck gaze darted to a new titan that suddenly spoke. His large mouth moved slowly, emitting deep powerful notes that followed a few seconds after. As the two gigantic young men spoke, Bryan could only pick up a few words, which were predominately, \"Dude\", \"Bro\", and various obscenities. He could scarcely believe that these gargantuan titans were just regular teenagers, both unaware of how large and dangerous they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to a crumble of cheese that was larger than he was, Bryan continued to listen. Despite his remarkable intelligence, his mind remained blank as he gawked at the oblivious giants. He began to pick up names as they spoke. Trent was a name he already knew. Paul seemed to be this new giant. They both wore shirts embezzled with a familiar high school emblem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy's school!\" Bryan squeaked at the realization. He stifled a jump of joy at the prospect. \"They must know Tommy! If I can get them to take me to him, I will be saved!\" It was his first stroke of luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked the two young men over excitedly. Despite Tommy's physical prowess, these two behemoths appeared noticeably larger than Mr. Smith's helpful neighbor. They also seemed far more boisterous and careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear began to settle in again. If he couldn't get Tommy to recognize him before, how would he get these titans to even notice him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....</span></div></div>",

Paul's gaze followed his friend's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he looked away he noticed an oddly colored speck on the floor. \"Dude, there's a bug on the floor!\" Paul said with disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent didn't even look over, as he continued to poke the pile of dirty food that had been his sandwich. \"Yeah, I knocked the ant off my leg before you showed up,\" he replied dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll take care of this problem...\" Paul trailed off. He stood up to his full height of 6'4\", unaware of how impossibly tall he looked to the minuscule creature before him. He casually lifted his shoe over the pest, that just happened to be a tiny scientist. He never once considered the bug's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul couldn't imagine the fear coursing through the tiny speck in the seconds before his shoe hit the ground. He didn't realize that the shrunken man's last sight was the dirt and grime trapped in the black and white tread of his Air Jordan V's.

Let's walk over to McDonald's and grab something.\" Paul suggests, stepping towards the front door. Trent, past his anger, shrugs and nods. He pushes the plate onto the coffee table and follows Paul outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys chat as they stroll down the sidewalk. They are far removed from their monstrous presence in the world at their feet. Where a simple step can eradicate countless lives, whether it was meant to or not.

Below, a heart-stopping view of the ground far below made him swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take much more of this!\" His tiny legs dangled bonelessly in open space, but his arms tightly gripped the oily insect leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a bone-chilling sound.

His vision blurred as he felt himself slide down the fly's leg.

Bryan decided this verdant jungle was by far more terrifying than his previous locale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Bryan cupped his hands and screeched. \"Tommy! Help me!\" Only airy wind and distant, unknown noises responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone! HELP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapsed once more, ignoring complaints from his bruised thighs and sobbing pitifully. All this was a terrible mistake! By his precise plans, he should be safely tucked away in a shipping crate, en route to his trusty nephew Zack. Yet, everything had gone awry. Tommy's early arrival had set into motion the fiasco that Bryan currently found himself. \"Damn teenagers... I should of asked somebody more responsible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sniffle and grunt, he slapped against the ground in anger. Stupid Tommy and his damn friends... This was all their fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan found his self-pitying interrupted when...</span></div></div>",

Steel-bound, strong-willed, and undiminishable determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get through this! I am going to survive!\" Marching forward, he kept his gaze fixed on a pathway leading through the forest of grass. \"I made a breakthrough formula, and a remarkable story to tell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, he was almost parroting a self-confidence tape he bought years ago. He would listen to it on his way to work, but it never seemed to help much. Just telling him to repeat the same lines - over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now, he never believed those words. Now they felt powered by his near fatal experiences. More substantial due to the things he had seen and been through. He tapped this new found strength, continuing onward into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of traveling later, Bryan splashed into ankle-deep water. It seemed to coat the ground below. He continued through it, pausing only to take a few (grateful) gulps of the clean, sparkling liquid. Bryan came upon the source when he ducked under a clover leaf the size of a plaza. It was an enormous tubular monument of brown metal and rubber. Easily 30 feet in diameter, Bryan realized what it was as he approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hose!\" His exclamation seemed to echo slightly into the gaping tunnel of darkness. Water steadily trickled from it, babbling into the dirt via a stream no larger than himself. It was a completely insignificant amount of liquid, but more than enough to flood the landscape of his tiny world. He just began to peer into the huge tube when he felt the ground shift beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back, he yelped when the waterlogged earth seemed to crack and open before him. The cause of the disturbance revealed itself shortly. Jutting from the ground with tremendous power was a behemoth earthworm. It burst into the air, spraying chunks of dirt and waves of water. Slimy, pink, and squishy, it almost seemed comical. Bryan screamed again, watching the train-sized beast flail around angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pulled himself out of the water and ran for it. He narrowly avoided being smashed when the gigantic worm slammed down again, burrowing fiercely into the wet dirt. It returned to the surface shortly, appearing to his left. The tiny man screamed at it defensively, darting past large stems of grass in an attempt to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted dry land ahead and leaped onto it, never faltering his pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly many leagues later, did he slow down. Violently panting, Bryan rubbed his arms together, trembling. Once more, he survived the impossible: an encounter with a mega earthworm! It nearly made him laugh, despite himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was almost killed... by a freaking worm!\" He could feel his body calming. \"...fucking hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocking it to another experience, he decided to rest briefly before continuing. The less time spent in this fucking jungle, the better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlades of grass towered over him at every turn. Twisting and jutting into the sky, each one varying between 20 to 30 feet in height. It was surprisngly noiseless. Nary a sound, save for the occasional monster bee soaring overhead, and lazy gusts of wind. Other sounds of unknown origin roared in the far distance occasionally, but nothing worrisome. He stumbled up a low, yet slanting boulder that ended in a drop. An errant blade of grass sloped against the large stone, which Bryan was able to gleefully slide down. It sparked a feeling of mirth in his tiny, battered body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather suddenly, the jungle came to an end. Thickness and colour of the huge grass was his only warning before he found himself looking onto different terrain. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan gagged and suppressed the desire to heave his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to swallow a bit of it. The taste was a mix between dirt, something sour, and grease. His body won and he spat a foul mouthful back into the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech...!\" Bryan choked, wiping his tongue and lips in an attempt to remove any traces. \"That is repulsive! Yuck! Dehydration won't make me THAT desperate again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself up and backing away from the off-putting pool, Bryan looked around. He was still hopelessly lost. Tangles of dried, browning grass and leaves created a cluster around the clearing. Many choices existed for him to take, but none seemed palatable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I even looking for? Tommy is probably long gone by now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan grumbled, but knew his complaints would only waste time. He needed to make some progress - no matter which direction he took! Taking the nearest route, he jogged under a crumbling leaf canopy and into the unknown. The disgusting pond had been distasteful, yes, but proved to revitalize him and fill him with a feeling akin to confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig lay in his path, larger than a stretch of road, but buried enough in the dirt for the tiny man to scramble over it. On the other side, Bryan paused and allowed himself to rest. He felt prideful of his progress. After all, his thin (frail) build had next to no muscle, yet so far he had been able to surpass many over sized obstacles. Bryan began to feel a bubble inside him; real confidence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I actually CAN get through this...!\" He allowed himself a pathetic fist-pump. \"Nothing can stop-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, Bryan heard a strange guttural racket. It sounded deep and <i>big</i> - whatever it was. Then it stopped. Bryan stood frozen and listened with tentative ears. A loud slam echoed dully throughout the gigantic wilderness from the same direction. Other sounds, more indiscernible and slight could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun still shone high and just rightly to be bothersome. Bugs continued their buzzing; gliding to and fro through the open space above. Bryan shaded his eyes and tried to scope out the surrounding horizon. He suddenly remembered how small he was; how vulnerable - and importantly, afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan looked towards the road, the direction from which the loud slam had come, but he couldn't see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the jungle of tall grasses and weeds, he could make out the gap in the fence the teenagers had entered and left through, but behind the fence, other noises began to worry him. A metallic clank rang through the air, followed by another. Metal groaned against metal. Repeated bangs increased in frequency and volume and then abruptly ended in a ding and a loud crashing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow of a dragonfly swept across Bryan, causing him to hide beneath a large hairy leaf. At his size, the dragonfly was the size of a small commercial plane. He recalled that dragonflies are predatory insects, with keen eyesight and vicious jaws that rip their prey apart. Hopefully they only catch flying insects, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan nearly tripped over a dead stem of grass that lay in front of him like a log. To steady himself, he reached up to the leaf but cut his hand on one of the hairs. \"Ow!\" That's sharp! Looking up at the plant, he noticed a single tall stem rising from the middle. It reminded him of a palm tree, but instead of green leaves on the top, there were yellow petals. He recognized it as a dandelion. He suddenly noticed a huge, brown, fleshy caterpillar munching on the next leaf. Although it was far bigger than him, he hadn't noticed it. He could hear its munching, but he hadn't noticed it over the din of other sounds. He shivered, wondering what other creatures he hadn't noticed close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother metallic clank assaulted Bryan's ears and to his horror, as he peaked out from under the leaf, he saw a large section of the fence move towards him. The gate was opening towards him. It looked to him like a cliff-face moving on its own. A huge flock of flying insects flew up and overhead as the grassy jungle in front of him was pushed aside by the gate. A butterfly glided by close overhead, the sun shining through its orange and black wings almost like a stained-glass window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned watched the butterfly, awestruck, and wished he had wings so he could get up off the ground where it was dangerous and get back to his house and the potion. Suddenly the butterfly more or less exploded as it was hit from above. Two of its wings came clean off and there was a shower of dust. The dragonfly's wings clattered as they struck together briefly and then it banked sharply as it pulled the rest of the butterfly away to devour. On second thoughts, the air didn't seem to be any safer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian turned around and saw that the head of a man had appeared. Under the black baseball cap, sunglasses and industrial ear protection, he Bryan could really only see this man's long, straight nose and broad, strong jaw covered in stubble. Although at Bryan's current size, everyone looked like an absolute behemoth, he could tell this man was far larger than the four gigantic teenagers who had trashed his house and abandoned him in this terrifying jungle. Brian could only see this man from the chest up, but he could see that he was built like a tank - or rather, a mountain. He was carrying something that Bryan could only see the top of, something orange, and he was he seemed to be pushing something heavy as well. He briefly dropped out of site as he set whatever the orange thing was on the ground and then turned around and pushed the gate closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized the man had just shut himself in the vacant lot with him. Of course, if Brian had been near enough to reach the fence, he surely would have been able to simply walk underneath it, but what was the man going to do here? Would Bryan be able to attract his attention? Probably not - in this place he was just one bug amongst many, and wearing ear protectors, he would certainly not be able to hear Bryan's feeble shouts. Would he even want to attract this giant's attention? He looked about 30, older and more mature than the college boys who were probably trying to tidy up his house right now, but with his grimly set jaw, he didn't exactly look like the kind of guy who'd worry about the welfare of a tiny bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant man pulled hard upwards on something a couple of times and a horrible noise started - a loud, rapid hammering accompanied by a frenzied whistling, whooshing sound. The sound was unbearably loud and Bryan stuffed his fingers in his ears. The sound grew even louder and there were shredding and ripping sounds now. The air began to fill with a spray of green particles and even more panicked insects. Slowly, the giant, with his back towards Bryan, began walking along the line of the cliff-like wooden fence. The ear-splitting noise and they spray of green projectiles followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the back of the man's shirt, Bryan recognized the logo of a landscaping company and put the pieces of the picture together: the man was trimming the edge of the lawn with a weed whacker. As Bryan realized that this meant the giant would probably mow the whole lot, he started shaking with fear. How would he ever survive this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the adrenaline rose in Bryan's body, he realized his only hope was to make it out of the lot before the enormous man mowed over him. Thinking about the horrible monsters lurking all around him in the jungle, he armed himself by snapping one of the glassy hairs off a nearby leaf. The hairs on this leaf were bigger than the hairs on the dandelion leaf and it made a fairly convincing dagger. It was basically the only way he could think to protect himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to run, stumbling over roots and stems of grass, tripping as the stony ground shifted under his feet, dodging hairy leaves and looking around for any threat of insects. He was heading towards the front fence of the empty lot, essentially directly towards the hulking behemoth and the source of the ear-splitting terror. By the time he got anywhere near the fence, he would have moved on from there and he surely wasn't going to trim the same area twice. Although it felt like the wrong direction to run, Bryan knew that, strategically, this was the safest option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bee as large as a van took off from a nearby clover flower, causing Bryan to stop abruptly. He realized that it was odd that he could see the individual wingbeats rather than just a blur. Thinking about it scientifically, he realized that, at his tiny size, the distance from one side of his brain to the other, was much, much smaller. Signals could would pass, relatively speaking, a lot more quickly through his brain meaning that his reflexes should be much faster than they were as a normal sized man. This would also account for his perception of everything as happening a lot more slowly than he was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came into a clearing and suddenly had an uninterrupted view of the enormous man. His huge, hairy calves were planted in enormous work boots, each one more than a football field in length. That meant, with each step, a football field of jungle was being crushed down under his enormous bulk. His massive thighs were mostly bare, covered only at the top by a pair of surprisingly short shorts. As the giant lifted one enormous leg and began to swing it to take the next step, one whole side of his muscular behind tensed and lifted underneath the shorts. Bryan had to stop looking. He was overcome by his own insignificance but knew he had to keep running towards the area that had just been weed-whacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the other side of the clearing, he spotted a line of black ants, each the size of an Alsatian dog but with six legs, antennae, large eyes and two-foot-long mandibles. He gripped his leaf-hair dagger tightly and ran, towards ant line. He stopped just before them and started trying to watch for a break in the line. It was hard because ants were moving in both directions and their movements were much harder to predict than cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the noise of the weed-whacker grew even louder as it hit a large clump of grass and dirt which sprayed up and flew through the air towards Brian. He briefly ran backwards but realized the debris from the melee ahead would overtake him and he'd be safer under the grass. He still had to cross the line of ants though and as he began to consider that again, a strong wind hit him and the pieces began to rain down. There were pieces of grass of all sizes, most of it mangled and barely recognizable, moist on the edges and sticky with sap. Some pieces were as large as sheets of roofing. The smaller ones, when they hit him, stuck to him. As well as that, there were small stones, which he would have called \"dust\" at his normal size; larger stones, which would be sand and the occasional boulder, which would have been pebbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this onslaught of falling debris, the ants suddenly broke out of the line and began running in all directions. Some of them stopped to pull pieces of grass off themselves. When two ants met face to face, they stopped and tapped their antennae against each other, obviously communicating something. The ants didn't seem to notice Bryan and as he ran through the area where they were running around, he managed to dodge them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhack! Suddenly something sticky and hard hit him in the head. He couldn't see as the liquid covered his eyes and frantically pulled whatever it was off and wiped the foul smelling goo from his face. With only one eye open, he realized that he was holding a half-living insect. At his normal size, this would have been a barely noticeable little speck, but to him, it was about the size of a large pigeon. Its abdomen was split open and oozing goo. One of its wings was almost completely gone and it was feebly flapping its stub and the remaining wing. It's antennae were twitching violently and its large, bright red eyes were empty spheres with a mesh-like pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was knocked over by something. An ant had hit him from behind and had clamped his mandibles around his leg. Miraculously, they had only snagged his pants, and hadn't crushed his leg. Thinking quickly, Bryan tried to stab the ant with his dagger. It was no use. The glassy hair of the leaf that he had snapped off couldn't penetrate the ant's armour. Even stabbing its eye seemed to do nothing but annoy the ant, which shook him a bit and sprayed liquid from its abdomen towards him. Bryan thrust the struggling pigeon-fly against the ant's face, just above the jaws and as they opened and shut again on the fly, he got his leg free, rolled to the side and forced himself to his feet and away from the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis left eye, which he had gotten free from the fly's goo, was burning, but the goo had protected his other eye from the ant's acid spray and he simply swapped which eye he had open. He started running and scrambling through the dense vegetation away from the ants and towards the cliff-face of fence palings. He realized he had dropped his dagger in the scuffle with the ant and his his entire body ached. Just then he was hit by a rock in the face. He stumbled backwards and saw stars. He may have briefly been unconscious but he could not tell. His entire body ached and burned and he just wanted to give up. His adrenalin rush turned into an ice cold feeling of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to make it!\" he thought. I'm going to be torn apart by ants or mown over or crushed under a boot. He had never felt so powerless and the surge of pitiful anger that he felt towards the four teenage boys, the ant that had attacked him, and had no outlet. He didn't have the energy left to even get up and he began to sob uncontrollably. At this small size, water was much more viscous and his tears were like large balls that he had to physically pull off his face. He noticed that that helped with the burning of his left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the blades of grass in front of his face parted and something like a crocodile the size of a bus burst through the vegetation in front of him and stopped with its car-sized head only snapping distance in front of him. A skink. Tiny pieces of gooey grass clung to its coppery scales which gleamed in the sun. It blinked its huge eyes at him. The sides of its body heaved in and out as it breathed and Bryan could feel its breath. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan stayed still - partly because he had neither the will nor the energy to move - he had given up - and partly because he decided movement would convince the lizard he was prey. He had watched Jurassic Park only a few weeks before and the line \"their vision is based on movement\" rang through his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge skink suddenly surged forward, its snout bumping Bryan to the side. Its front leg pushed him down against the grass stems he was lying on and its back leg bumped him roughly. Its brilliant blue tail slid past him, coating him in some of the pieces of grass goo that it had picked up. Where it had come from was obviously a lot closer to the terrible action of the weed whacker than he had been. Bryan realized the lizard was probably not interested in food in the least but was scurrying for its life in the jerky stop-start way that skinks have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Brian got to his feet again and started again on his dash towards the fence. It was more of a stumble now than a dash, but he had stopped feeling the pain in his body, his ears or his left eye so keenly. \"The adrenaline must be working again,\" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he reached the next clearing, he realized the enormous man had trimmed more than half way around the edges of the empty lot. He had seen two more lizards and countless other creepy crawlies, including one enormous centipede, heading in the opposite direction away from the fence line. This was natural, he supposed, as that is where the huge man had been ripping up their habitat, but fleeing into the middle of the grass would most likely ensure their deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan remembered, when Tommy first started mowing his lawn as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had initially done the edge trimming last but Bryan had told him to do it first so that the lawnmower would pick up all the trimmings from the edge and leave the lawn cleaner in the end, and to mow from the outside into the middle. This is common practice in the lawn-care business, but Bryan realized now, that also doubtless chased all the little crawling critters in the grass into the center of the lawn where they would not have such a good chance of escaping the lawnmower. He had never cared about such a thing before, but at his current scale, it felt like he was about to be caught up in a massacre of epic proportions. With his human brain, he was probably the only one in the lawn who knew to run towards the edge, not the middle of the lawn. If he thought the lizards and bugs would have understood him, he would have told them \"You're going the wrong way! This whole area is about to be destroyed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he set out through through the clearing, which was littered with grass debris, he was lost in his own thoughts and didn't notice when the ground suddenly dropped away in front of him. The loose stones he was standing on turned into a landslide which swept him down into some kind of crater. \"Am I trapped in the boot print of that giant?\" he thought. Suddenly, from the bottom of the crater, something large flipped up, sending a shower of rocks up towards him. As they crashed into the wall of the crater, they unleashed another landslide which swept him closer towards the bottom. When he again came to rest, he got up and tried to climb towards the top of the crater, but his movements unleashed more little landslides and his net movement was downwards. Again, something large reared up from under the rocks at the bottom and hurled rocks towards him. He was partially buried by the rocks, but at this point, his body was beyond feeling pain. Then he saw the jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising out of the stones at the bottom of the pit came the front of a head with two enormous, jagged, spiky mandibles spreading apart in a wide V shape. An antlion larva. Bryan remembered being fascinated by them as a child, dropping ants into their pits and watching them struggling to get out and either succeeding or slipping into the center and being devoured by the jaws he was now looking at. \"I guess this is karma for what I did to those ants,\" he thought. \"They were just ants ... but now I'm just an ant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck had it, a large piece of shredded grass was right next to Bryan. Being careful not to disturb the loose rocks he was sitting on, which, in reality, were fine grains of sand, he picked up the piece of grass and threw it towards the antlion's head. It landed right next to the head and in one horrifyingly quick movement, the head turned and the jaws snapped shut on the grass. After a few moments of stillness, the head vanished under the rocks again, causing a small landslide which swept Bryan almost to the center of the pit, right above where the jaws had been. He was sitting in the feeding pit of a hungry monster. He was on top of the stones, not buried, and he thought he could probably start moving without disturbing any of the rocks, but any wrong move could send down another cascade of rocks and wake the beast at the bottom of the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any movement made him give up and look elsewhere. The same strategy had made him good at Jenga, but now his life depended on this skill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe going was slow, and when he was half-way to the top, the roaring of the weed whacker suddenly died away to an eerie silence. \"No, no, no, NO, NOOOO! Not yet!\" he screamed out loud as though the giant man could have heard him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw the enormous figure of the man approaching. He was carrying a large stick that must have lying in the long grass. From Bryan's perspective, it was like a mountain carrying a skyscraper towards him. Ordinarily, that would have been a terrifying sight on its own, but considering his precarious position in the death-pit of a horrible monster antlion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mountain got closer, Bryan noticed a name embroidered on his company shirt: Josh. \"JOOOOOOOOSH!\" Bryan yelled, knowing all the while that, even if the volume were loud enough for Mount Josh to hear without ear protectors, let alone with them, his voice would just sound like a tiny high pitched squeak to the enormous man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh marched relentlessly forward, gazing ahead rather than down, Bryan had a view straight up his nostrils. Josh's enormous legs were bulging with muscles and green with pieces of grass caught in the hairs. Where the legs met, there was a bulge in his shorts that could have concealed a block of apartments. In addition to being terrified, Bryan was humiliated to be so small in relation to another man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the huge green columns made contact with the ground, the ground shook violently enough for a small landslide to cascade down the opposite side of the pit. Bryan looked nervously down at the bottom, expecting any moment to see the antlion's huge abdomen send a shower of rocks up towards the source of the landslide. That didn't happen though. Bryan reasoned that antlions probably ignore landslides caused by vibration of the whole ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back towards Mount Josh, Bryan saw that his enormous right boot was swinging exactly in his direction. It swung up over him, its forward motion began to slow and it started coming down. Bryan looked up at the vicious looking tread pattern as the heel struck the ground. In the arch of the sole there was lettering larger than Bryan's whole body saying \"US15\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the clearing, some tall blades of grass were pushed forward under the sole of Josh's boot and as these blades were bending down towards Bryan, he realized the inside edge of the boot was right above him. Just before impact, Josh saw that moving just a few feet uphill would take him out from under the colossal slab of rubber and the unimaginable bulk of giant Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rocks below him on the slope begin tumbling down and as they fall, those uphill begin to fall too. As Josh's size 15 boot makes contact with the top of the antlion pit, Josh is swept helplessly underneath the edge of the rubber sole by the miniature landslide that he started in his haste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh's huge bulk thuds down into what is, to him, fine sand, Bryan's body is trapped between the rubber sole and the fist-sized rocks. The huge pressure jumbles the rocks and grinds them against one another, forcing them to fill any space available to them. For some of the rocks, the only available space is occupied by Bryan's body, which in comparison to the rocks and the rubber sole, is quite soft. Bryan's tiny body is squeezed and pummeled under the enormous pressures - not to the point that he is crushed completely, as the mass of rocks does have some give in it, but to the point where Bryan's limbs are all dislocated, his spine broken and the fingers of his right hand are ground off between two chunks of rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's left boot meets the ground and the huge weight crushing down on Bryan shifts and relents. He begins to bleed and he is briefly stuck to the rubber sole as it lifts. He falls off and lands in sand only inches away in Josh's perspective, crippled and barely alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe antlion, having fared only slightly better, unearths itself from its pile of rocks. Its left mandible has been ripped from its face and its abdomen has ruptured. Bryan and the antlion lie face to face, neither aware of the other but only of their own agony. Bryan closes his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh carries the branch to the fence and hurls it over, completely unaware of and unbothered by the death and destruction he causes with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ant stumbling through the clearing happens across Bryan's mangled body and begins to pull him by his leg towards the nest. Bryan's eyes open again with shock. The ant drags Bryan between tangled grass stems and across a smooth rock. At that very moment, one of Josh's huge boots slams down on the smooth rock. Unlike the mass of smaller rocks, this rock does not give. As the rubber is pressed downwards by Josh's bulk, both the ant and Bryan are flattened into nothing more than a wet smear shared between the rock and the sole of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan goes back to where he left the weed whacker and finishes trimming the edges before mowing the whole vacant lot. As he finishes, he loads his equipment back into the back of his truck, takes a big drink of water and checks his phone. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees an exhausted baby skink scurrying across the sidewalk in front of the vacant lot, fleeing the destruction he has caused. Without thought or hesitation, he puts his boot on the tiny lizard and scuffs it into non-existence as if it were a cigarette butt. A few moments later, a mother spider carrying hundreds of offspring meets the same fate. He puts his phone away, climbs back into his truck, which rocks as his considerable weight pushes down on the suspension, and then drives away to the next job. </span></div></div>",

Insanely muscular tattooed arms were visible beyond the sleeves of his company t-shirt. He filled in the dirty tan work-slacks quite nicely. His work boots had worn away at the toe revealing the steel-toe on the left boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous titan tilted his face toward the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's looking right at me,\" screamed the elated tiny man. He waved his arms over his head. \"Hey! Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bug-sized man gazed up, he heard a harsh, guttural noise. The young cleared his throat and spit on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith saw the approaching spit, but was helpless to get out of the way. The slimy spit crashed into him, knocking him away from the safety of the boulder-sized pebble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get the equipment set up here,\" the older giant said. \"I'll start over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them noticed the ant-sized man struggling in the disgusting mix of sand and saliva. Humiliated, he realized precisely how beyond the giant's notice he had become since shrinking himself to the size of a small ant. Still dealing with the slimy mess, the shrunken scientist watched the older giant trudge across the vacant lot. At one point, his step came down on a discard plastic bottle the size of a building. The stomp crushed the container flat and filled the tiny observer with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older giant was, physically, the more impressive hulk of a man. His towering frame was clothed by a worn work shirt  and heavy denim jeans coated by dust. He wore muddy work boots with a heavy tread. Five years of steady construction work had given him an amazing physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized man's more immediate concern, however, was the younger giant that continued to stomp around in the little man's vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly inches from his lowly position on the ground, one of the young titan's massive boot stomps kicked up a maelstrom of dirt, grit and dust that settled over the tiny man's body still drenched with spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick had been trying to kick the habit, but with a brief break while he waited for his partner to set up equipment on the far end of the lot, he drew a cigarette from a pack in his pocket and lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took in a deep draw of smoke, he kept grinding his boots on the baked clay and gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dust had settled from the near-miss, poor Mr. Smith had gotten back to his feet and tried to dust himself off. His clothes were now in a shabby state. But that was the least of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young titan kept scuffing his boots along the parched ground. Even if the shrunken scientist had wanted to get closer, the constantly shifting boots would have prevented it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally decided that it was simply too risky to try to approach the giant construction worker. He'd always been intimidated by such men even at his normal size. Now, he felt completely powerless and even imperiled by the giant's presence. The ant-sized man scanned the barren lot for some sort of shelter. He saw a rock that looked as big as a mountain and decided to hide in the shadow of that massive structure until the giants departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made good progress toward his goal when something flaming and belching smoke dropped from the heavens, almost landing directly on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acrid smoke stung his eyes. He saw the glowing end of the huge tube as flame continued to consume the paper and tobacco filler inside the cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had simply tossed aside a cigarette butt that had almost landed on top of the tiny, unnoticed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mr. Smith had been a smoker, he might have known what was coming next...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By all rights, Bryan should be safely nestled in the folds of cloth tucked inside a package mailed to his nephew. That was his plan, after all - a flawless one, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" He shrieked. Ducking under another log-sized twig, he stumbled but maintained his pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he found himself running for his life - from a group of freaking ants! It was humiliating, but Bryan refused to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring a harried glance, Bryan realized the ants were gaining on him. The head of the group hissed at him with clashing mandibles, enticing the others to speed up. Six legs to his two, Bryan feared this would be his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo focused on his escape, Bryan was nearly thrown when the ground shuddered suddenly. His body filling with alarm, Bryan felt only confusion as he stumbled. It sounded as if a building had crash landed nearby. Twisting his head back, he took sight of the ants. Their grotesque legs carrying them quickly in pursuit, apparently unfazed by the strange earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his staring was costing him precious seconds, Bryan whipped about running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother earthshaking crash sent Bryan falling to the side. It was more severe than the last, emitting a guttural crunching of dirt and rock that made Bryan shudder.<br>\r\nThis time he looked ahead - and screamed with ghastly vigor. His scream was not directed at the pursuing bugs, or his own situation. It was directed at the colossus that loomed miles ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the Colossus of Rhodes could compare if Bryan had seen it. The calves were massive, draped in a cascade of thick brown denim dusted dirt like the crags of a mountain. Trembling, Bryan felt himself almost falling as he attempted to crane his neck back farther. Barely catching sight of an enormous billowing mass of off-white cotton high above, the terrific sound of grinding, crunching returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting into sight, Bryan belted out a note of sheer terror at the mountainous boot soaring overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan devolved into burbling wails, vainly defending himself with wiry arms as light was blocked out by the sole of the giant work boot that was so vast; so wide, that as it lowered itself it removed any other sight. Clods of dirt and pebbles rained down all around, dislodging from deep lugs packed with much more. Gusting air roared, rudely displaced by the monumental boot. It passed slowly, yet somehow moving at a dizzying pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was still far overhead, Bryan lowered his arms and marveled. Among squashed bits of small foliage, embedded pebbles, and unidentifiable crap, Bryan saw words much taller than himself pressed into the hard rubber, \"<i>OIL RESISTANT</i>\" and \"<i>ANTI-SHOCK</i>\" were situated around the mid sole, all circling a brand completely blocked with dried mud and smashed grime. The heavily worn surface of the descending sole seemed to go on forever. It was like a work of an ancient monument, built and constructed, it was so massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was jolted roughly when the huge stomp crashed thunderously behind him. The hard rubber of the work boot, as well as the worn leather, creaked noisily, groaning, flexing, and readjusting constantly as the behemoth owner towered so far overhead that Bryan even fathom just how huge he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScuttling around, he held his breath. The gargantuan boot loomed high, planted only a few dozen feet away. Frayed cords of mud-coated fibers hung down the length of it, hovering just above the dirt-crusted sole. Distant roaring of air announced the passage of the other boot. Bryan watched it soar past, far off that it vanished from view before contacting the ground with a rumbling crash. Bryan's genius mind was reeling. Realization of his utterly insignificant stature returned, chilling him into a constant shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a mere moment later, all thought was cut off when the ground trembled, filling the tiny man's ears with a cacophony of grinding gravel; groaning leather; and crunching twigs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with not an ounce of grace, the huge thing lifted away. With it, much of the landscape was taken; packed deeply into the treads as a mess of unrecognizable debris. Each thick lug creaked and shifted in response to the giant foot controlling it. Chunks broke free, falling noisily as the tread lifted away, leaving the ground branded with a series of huge indentations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gazed up as the massive man stomped away, each step emitting lesser quakes, while his massive arms dangled from a torso larger than a city. He wore a cap, facing backwards, with the logo of a local college baseball team. It just made the giant seem all the more surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelplessness surged into the shaken scientist. For once, he was made aware of his utter insignificance. complete weakness. The colossal man didn't even know he existed. Bryan, a full-grown adult; a scientist....and a freaking genius! And, he had nearly ended up crushed underfoot, crushed with the dirt and mud by the casual step of construction worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was so big,\" Bryan said, staring blankly at the expanse of land destroyed by the huge boot. \"...no, fucking <i>huge</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered the ants that pursued him so vehemently. Along with many other fauna, they were nowhere to be seen in the aftermath. Bryan wondered just how many tiny creatures - like himself - that were stomped without even the slightest notice on a daily basis. How many bugs had been stuck in those terrifying treads? It made him shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far distance, he could see the giant in question speaking with the other giant. Even from such a great distance, looking more like vast towers outlined against the horizon, they were terrifying. With sluggish stomps, they both lumbered towards the massive truck and began pulling things from the flatbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have even the slightest idea...!\" From their perspective, this lot was nothing but a barren waste; nothing but weeds and rocks. Bryan knew better. Insects, arachnids, reptiles, and small rodents all called the vacant lot home. \"It doesn't even matter to these brutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant workers were just too huge; too massive in every way to care about such small, and frankly, insignificant lifeforms. They were just doing their jobs, unable to appreciate the destruction they wrought in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...there has to be a better way...\" Bryan stood, still shaking but recovering. \"Screw the bugs! I need help, and they are my only option!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please, help me... I don't want to die!\" The humongous worker ignored him. Both uncaring and oblivious to something so small as Bryan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, the three insects made quick passage. Climbing over any obstacle with relative ease, and closing in on the fleeing scientist quickly. Unlike Bryan, they were completely adapted to such terrain: easily passing large boulders and climbing hills that would exhaust any human. Bryan was at a ridiculous disadvantage to these big insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping off the edge of a desiccated leaf, Bryan came upon an enormous nail laying like a fallen tree in the dirt.

All of them larger than automobiles and capable of tearing through much more than just his soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" He motioned fruitlessly at them - waggling his hand, then both arms defensively. \"Away with you bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ants were unmoved by this and moved expertly into position to neutralize the tiny fidgeting man. </span></div></div>",

It dug two sharp pincers into the ground next to him, splintering a twig he had been huddled against not a moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing increased as his mind raced. The idea that he was surrounded by nothing but mere ants was incredulous. They encircled him as a gang of ruffians would trap a would-be victim. Bryan looked from ant to ant, imploring their dark bulging eyes for any mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please</i>... Go away! Leave me alone, I can't die like this! <i>I'm not bug food</i>!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo preoccupied with his vain pleas, he failed to notice one ant approaching from behind. It scuttled across the uneven dirt, underneath a tree-sized twig, and fell upon the unsuspecting scientist with clashing mandibles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed when the cruel appendages closed around his arm. They held tight, allowing him a momentary struggle before clamping hard with a sickening snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain shot through his broken limb, burning him like nothing he had ever experienced before. He cried out, using his other arm to defend, but found it useless as the ant merely dropped him to the dirt. Bryan glared up at the huge insect, misty-eyed with a bloody nose. The creature showed no sympathy as it lashed again. Both long, jagged pincers wrapped around the shrunken man's thin waist and lifted him like a toy doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded by pain, he continued screaming. Bryan felt his voice grow quieter with each cry. He wanted to live. No matter how unhappy, or how difficult his life had been, this was far worse of an end than he could ever have imagined. He had discovered the impossible, for God's sakes! The ability to shrink living matter without a single repercussion. It was worthy of many awards; <i>worthy of a new award, in fact</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he would never benefit from it, Bryan realized. His vision blurred as the ant roughly transported him increasingly limp body over the rough terrain, headed for an impressive hill in the near distance. Looming past in, miles away, but framing the ant hill almost perfectly, stood a gigantic worker. Bryan blinked at the oblivious titan. The gigantic man would never realize that a human life was coming to an end not more than six feet away from him. Moaning, the defeated scientist succumbed to his trauma and fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant scampered up the grainy hill, accompanied by the rest of the hunting party from behind. Other ants paused with curious clicks and bobs, swishing their antennae at the interesting pink creature held between the ant's pincers. Food had been scarce, so any discovery caused excited stirs in the burgeoning colony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant quaking signaled the movement of a humongous human nearby. The ants took note, but ignored the rather common disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the top, the ant brushed antennae with a bulkier soldier ant and quickly descended inside to offer up the strange prey as a boon to the queen ant. </span></div></div>",

There were thousands of bugs in the world. What was one more in the greater scheme of things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANY DAY NOW,\" an exasperated Andy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith listened in horror as the merciless teenaged titan coldly encouraged Tommy to finish him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prepared to run, but he could see no avenue of escape. The shrunken scientist tried one more time, shouting Tommy's name, imploring him to look closer. \"It's me!\" Mr. Smith screamed. \"Just look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a casual motion, with no particular urgency, Tommy raised his foot above the tiny bug trapped on the floor among the shattered segments of Mr. Smith's broken lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The teenaged titan's bug-sized neighbor screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the boy who had always run his errands and helped out with household chores, Tommy had been transformed into a fearsome executioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two teenagers, frankly bored, barely watched as Tommy, finally goaded into action, prepared to stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow swallowed him up, and the tiny man looked upward to see the onrushing rubber sole of the massive shoe.

Mr Smith was never what you would call normal, after all he was a scientist, and they tended to be an odd bunch, but giving a bug a shirt just seemed like some sick joke, and then with start he realized that the shirt was exactly like one Mr. Smith wore, and not only that but the bug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" he said softly, and Joe turned to eye his friend., the others were too intent on the game to really notice the whisper, and so turning back to them, being careful not to spill the shot glass, Tommy pointed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody out, now!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked one of the others, turning from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, I want you guys out. Mr. Smith is probably already pissed enough at me, and I don't need him anymore so,\" he told them, still pointing at the door. The others grumbled a bit, but picking up the plates and drinks they left, leaving Joe, Tommy, and the now discovered miniature Bryan, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, what the heck did you do to yourself?\" he asked, looking at the bug in the shot glass, and trying to think of a way to get him out of it safely.<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n\"Tommy, I love you!\" he shouted at the teen after he told everyone else to get out. He knew he'd been discovered, and he thanked his luck that he had designed the shirt he now wore, based off one of his full sized ones. Still there were many problems now. The first of which was how to get out of the shot glass safely, and communicate with the giants. The second was to see if the antidote was still on his table, and if not to get the two young men to go get more from the flask in his lab. Luckily Tommy, smart boy that he was, solved the first problem right before his eyes.<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n\"Tommy, are you sure about this, wouldn't it be easier just to pick him out of the glass?\" asked Joe, feeling very silly holding the stack of five sheets of looseleaf paper over the table, while Tommy seemed to be looking at it critically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure. If we try to pick him out then we might hurt him, even kill him. We can't just dump the glass for the same reason, cause to someone that small this is gonna be like a flood. This way I tip the glass slowly onto the paper, and it lets the soda through, but keeps Mr. Smith on top. Then I give him a chip of a pencil tip and he can write on the piece of paper that's not wet. Then we read what he writes with the magnifying glass,\" Tommy told Joe, holding the magnifying glass up and then setting it on the table gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Joe held the papers just little off the table, and then watched as Tommy delicately picked up the glass in which he claimed a very small Mr. Smith was treading soda. Joe was really wishing he had just put the bug away and given it to his kid brother, cause this was getting to be a lot of work, and he knew it wasn't going to end any time soon. After they got him able to tell them what to do they had to figure out how to get him back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mr. Smith, hold on to your shorts,\" Tommy told the diminutive little inventor, tipping the shot glass. His plan, though lacking in real grace, worked better than he could have hoped, and within a minute he had Joe set the papers down after wiping the table off. Mr. Smith was then showered with bits of pencil lead Tommy had broken off one of his mechanical pencils, and then he walked to the edge of the paper and began writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Good work Tommy, but I think we have a problem. You just smashed the vial of antidote that was on the table, and the only other source is at my lab. Take my ID Card and my ID Number is 44789, they'll let you into my lab, then get the flask of bright green liquid marked, Experiment 32865, remember those numbers,' he wrote and Tommy read it to Joe after looking at it through the magnifying glass.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe that he could stand up completely straight and walk out the opening, without ducking at all.

Tommy had found a test tube full of a deep purple-tinted liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's that,\" Joe said, pointing toward what he said picked up. Both of them had forgotten  the tiny scientist's precise instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bryan was jumping and screaming, to get their instructions. The purple potion was a failed expiriment. It didn't work when in contact with organic matter; it seemed to go off at random times and shrink with a purple cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch as now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the teenagers gasped when the vial suddenly exploded, engulfing the room in a thin haze.

The idea that this poor kid had been forcibly brought into Bryan's terrifying failure of an experiment was mortifying. Bryan couldn't bear to think of the implications if Tommy should be injured or...he shuddered at the mere idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find him.

This time, Joe reacted and gave Tommy a strong push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith saw Tommy's huge form fall back against the table, generating what felt like an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys\u2026\" The tiny man started to object when he heard the start of a domino effect as the stack of building-sized binders compiling his notes started to tumble toward the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot kids\u2026\" Mr. Smith was able to scream as a huge wall of heavy plastic hurtled toward him. He had been researching on his shrinking formula for several years and had compiled a massive amount of notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy notebook, propelled by all the other notebooks behind it, smacked down with a thunderous impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe and Tommy stopped their fight when they heard the loud smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith?\" Tommy asked. \"Where'd you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dude!\" Joe said, lifting the collapsed notebook off the surface of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's face paled when he saw the pulverized remains of his inch-tall neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You freakin' moron! Look what you did!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this my fault?\" Joe responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy felt horrible, he truly did. But, his thoughts came quickly. No one else knew what had happened. Yes, he felt truly horrible, but it would be best just to never mention this to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a paper towel from a nearby roll, and without looking closely, swiped up the tiny blot and then dropped the paper towel into a trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the hell out of here,\" he whispered to Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind you, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the story ended where it had began, and poor Mr. Smith was indeed a victim of his own research. That, and the inherent clumsy, inattentive nature of two teenagers.</span></div></div>",

As humiliating as it felt to do so, he needed to shrug off his tiny clothes. Growing back to normal might be somewhat uncomfortable, otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was ready, he gestured for Tommy to lower the eye-drop dispenser.

Maybe the formula had just needed some time on the shelf to stabilize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care.

While Tommy removed some slices of pizza from the box, Joe took two bottles of beer from the fridge belonging to Tommy's neighbor. By the time Tommy had arranged pizza slices on two plates that he put on the coffee table, Joe arrived with the mugs filled with ice-cold beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Tommy asked sharply. \"Beer? From Mr. Smith's fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, the old guy isn't going to miss a couple of cans,\" Joe said. He lifted his mug and clinked it against the one he presented to Tommy. \"Besides, he owes us. We saved his shrunken butt, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, although doubtful, enjoyed the cold beer with the hot, delicious pizza. The boys also enjoyed the chicken wings, licking the spicy, flavorful sauce from their fingers. As they ate, they enjoyed a game on Mr. Smith's high-def television, with the volume cranked up to the max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, even when the tiny man flew around their heads, his new wings buzzing in protest at their disrespect for his home and property, they could not hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was simply too small to make himself heard, even when buzzing only inches from the side of Tommy's colossal face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-mee! Pe-lease! Help mee!\" The little gnat-guy screamed as loudly as he could into one of Tommy's cavernous ears. \"It's mee! Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the loud volume of the television, Tommy detected only the faintest of a high-pitched, buzzy whine that prompted him to raise one of his hands with fingertips stained with the sauce from the chicken wings. He waved his hand in an irritated gesture at the side of his face, generating terrific air currents that buffeted his tiny transformed neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mr. Smith, trapped in gnat form, it was like a sudden hurricane. He dived lower, desperate to evade the terrific winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Joe finished off his beer and noticed his buddy swiping a hand at a pale, almost invisible flying insect land on the coffee table between the pizza carton and the container of chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant gesture, he turned the large glass mug upside down and brought it down suddenly atop the tiny bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Got the little pest!\" Joe proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Lemee out!\" The terrified little gnat with Mr. Smith's head yelled. He stared through the thick glass and saw the greasy streaks from Joe's sauce-stained fingers on the other side of the transparent prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't even look away from the television screen. \"Big deal. What you gonna do with it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged and looked through the glass. He had to strain to detect the tiny, pale winged bug. \"It's a little pest! What do you think I'd do with it? I'm gonna crush it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-mee! No! Don't let him crush mee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to a lull in the game, Tommy deigned to turn his head and look down at the trapped gnat. After his experience with his shrunken neighbor, he'd gotten better at paying attention to tiny details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's odd about this bug,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous teenager lifted himself off the couch and walked toward a book shelf at the other end of the room where he had spotted a large magnifying glass with an ornate brass handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should have a better look\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Your neighbor, not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Mr. Smith felt tingling again. He didn't realize that things had changed until Tommy returned. As he looked up, he saw multiple versions of his gigantic teenaged neighbor looming over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formula had worked, but not as they had hoped. Mr. Smith's human head had been replaced. He now stared at Tommy with the multi-faceted compound eyes of a true insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, I am going back to your lab,\" Tommy explained. \"But Joe is going to stay here and make sure you stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's words slammed into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Tommy! Don't leave me here.... Not with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared up, multiple versions of Tommy's huge buddy also came into view. Joe frowned, obviously a reluctant participant in Tommy's latest plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon,\" Tommy promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gnat used its fine-tuned senses to pinpoint the building-sized sandwich on one of Mr. Smith's plates.

Enormous air bubbles in the bread looked more like deep pits to the tiny creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoo! That's my sandwich, Mr. Smith,\" Joe declared irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's hand dislodged the tiny fly, but the insect dodged and flew back toward the sandwich, attracted by all the smells that increased its hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You listening to me, Mr. Smith?\" Joe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gnat again landed on his sandwich, Joe responded. \"Gross, Mr. Smith! You think I want a bug crawling all over my food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, thoughts returned\u2026 For the tiny transformed scientist, it felt like he was finally able to exert control again, pushing the insect mind and its instincts into a remote corner of his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" He buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe discovered he was on an enormous slice of bread, just as Joe took another swipe at him. \"I said get off my sandwich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed man flew into the air, buffeted by the teenager's angry swipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Mr. Smith wondered. \"How long was I a real bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he found himself distrustful of Tommy's huge friend. Worried that he might revert to full insect again, he decided to place some distance between himself and Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis flight took him into his kitchen, where he discovered the back door ajar. He wasn't too worried about that until his insect senses detected something appealing outside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only a second to realize what was happening.

It flew the short distance to the gleaming corrugated tower of metal stuffed with ripped plastic garbage bags that allowed free access to the ripening contents of discarded foods and other organic matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tiny gnat arrived, it found other insects had already swarmed to the location, crawling over the hills of garbage with bodies equipped with six spindly limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gnat that had once been a brilliant scientist landed on a patch of revolting browning garbage turning quite rancid in the bright autumn sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still using his insect tongue to lap up leaking garbage fluids when a colossal creature approached the trash can. The tiny creature followed the rapid progress of the enormous form represented mostly by vast swaths of red and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, dressed in blue jeans and a red T-shirt, walked up the sidewalk toward Mr. Smith's home. He had grabbed a banana he found in a bowl at his neighbor's laboratory. Unfortunately, his trip to the lab hadn't turned up any clues to Mr. Smith's disappearance. No one that the teenager spoke with at the lab had seen the scientist in more than a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he returned to the house, he had finished the banana. He didn't want to just toss the peel on the sidewalk, so he made a slight detour to toss the peel into Mr. Smith's garbage cans waiting by the curb for collection by the city sanitation department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the teenager approached the trash can, he frowned when the breeze carried the stench of rotting garbage to his nostrils. He also felt nauseated when he looked inside the trash can and saw the swarm of crawling and flying insects attracted to the garbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Poor Mr. Smith looks like those disgusting things now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager tossed the banana peel into the writhing mass of insects, not bothering to look where he discarded it.</span></div></div>",

With a squishy thud, the winged insect found itself caught between the descending peel and the rest of the garbage in the enormous can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing weight pressed down on him, hampering his wings and even his spindly six limbs. \"Help!\" He buzzed. \"Tommy, it's squishing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he thought of desperate ways to attract the attention of his enormous would-be savior, he felt the fuzzy stirrings on the outskirts of his brain, as if it was being eaten away by a tiny, unseen voracious horde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his intellect became submerged to the rude instincts of the insect brain, it left behind a panicked gnat as the heavy weight of a banana peel threatened to crush it flat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A disinterested Tommy, seeing how his action caused dozens of the tiny winged creatures to disperse, wore a tight frown as his thoughts turned to his neighbor and the knowledge that Mr. Smith had become one of those repulsive pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had also been unsuccessful in visiting Mr. Smith's lab. He had looked carefully for more antidote, but he hadn't found anything. He had been lucky to sneak into Mr. Smith's office without some grownup noticing and raising a fuss, but he didn't look forward to admitting to Mr. Smith that he had no answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also begun to dawn on him that he was now expected, at least by his transformed neighbor, as being responsible for Mr. Smith's well-being. But, he hadn't asked Mr. Smith to experiment with these wonky formulas. Why should he be saddled with having to take care of a grown man who had been stupid enough to turn himself into a bug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, his mood wasn't very good, and seeing a swarm of winged bugs only reminded him of the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Mr. Smith,\" the teenager muttered uncharitably, not realizing that his transformed neighbor was hearing him. \"The man's such a loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, already feeling rather low, felt crushed.

He saw a couple of male porn mags, as well as a tube of personal lubricant and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He picked up the phallic-shaped rubber item. In a loud, shocked tone, he bellowed, \"Joe! Come quick! You're gonna want to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had been human, the poor scientist would have blushed crimson.

As he flew over the bed, he got another look at Joe's ass. \"Oh, like I ever wanted to see that again,\" the bug-man thought to himself as he tried to get near Tommy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, very much occupied with trying to resist Joe's sudden streak of craziness, was rather amazed when a tiny gnat landed on the bedcovers right in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze must have fallen on the bug, because Joe saw it, too.

As a tiny gnat, the transformed scientist had to forcefully crawl past hairy flies, armored ants and a host of other fearsome bugs.

The heat of the summer day made the contents reek, and also intensely raised the temperature of the metal can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an abundance of scavenging bugs brought out other creatures.

He was a monstrosity, capable of unleashing destruction with a mixture of nonchalant indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he swallowed, Tommy reached for the bottle of lemonade. The tiny insect produced a mental scream of \"No!\" The huge teenager's tree trunk-sized fingers grasped the bottle, lifting it to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy closed his lips around the straw in the bottle and sucked up some of the tart liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" The scientist turned gnat screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suction from Tommy's mouth pulled him upward through a straw filled with the sour lemonade. He swallowed a substantial amount of the liquid, and then opened his mouth for a long, satisfied \"Aaah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gnat had been pulled halfway up the straw before the suction ceased, and the bug and the lemonade plunged back into the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnat feebly struggled to reach the surface of the bottled liquid. If he didn't get out soon, he wouldn't need to worry that his teenaged neighbor might swallow him. He would simply drown, a tiny speck unnoticed in a lake of lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bite of chips and dip, and Tommy was ready for more of the lemonade. A mammoth hand reached once again for the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The drop of lemonade was so insignificant that Tommy didn't even notice the damp spot that formed on the bedspread. He certainly didn't notice the pale form of a tiny, drenched winged insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he bumped the bottle, the teenager paid closer attention and succeeded in grabbing the bottle, taking it toward his mouth for a long, refreshing sip of the tart lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shoved the chips and dip to one side and placed the bottle on his nightstand. He then pulled out his phone and started a very deliberate search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his transformed neighbor watched his every action with a mixture of awe and healthy fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, oh my god,\" the tiny gnat-man buzzed. \"You've got to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little creature, once a respected scientist, noticed a white stain on the teenager's jeans. He remembered Tommy's haphazard snacking method and figured that the teenager had dropped a few more spots of dip on his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy no longer had food or drink on his mind. He had found what he wanted on his phone and was now enjoying one of his favorite porns. Content at first to rub his crotch beneath his jeans, he soon wanted more. He opened his fly and withdrew an already hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his position on the bedcovers, the tiny man watched everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to see this,\" the little gnat-man whined, but yet he didn't turn away from the spectacle. In some distant corner of his mind, he realized that the skinny teenager was quite large in other ways. Of course, everything now looked huge to the tiny gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy continued giving his cock a furious series of energetic strokes. The transformed scientist saw every powerful motion, heard every titanic groan, and he began to realize he might be in a perilous situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he tried to spread his wings and fly, he found that the sugary lemonade had coated his wings with a heavy layer of dried sugar. He tried to shake off the deposits, but it was too difficult. With wings out of commission, he was stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe buzzed again with increasing desperation. \"Tommy! Down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager's attention, however, was far from any tiny, stranded insect. With a loud groan, an explosion gushed from Tommy's cock. The spectacle was volcanic for the tiny onlooker, but in an instant, it was also disastrous. A huge drop of the hot, white substance fell back onto the bedspread. As luck would have it, the drop splashed directly on top of the tiny gnat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready grounded by the dried sugar, the insect now found itself mired in a warm blot of Tommy's cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it got worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His flight took him toward the tabletop and the all-important vial of antidote. As he flew closer, the towering glass structure with its pale green liquid contained within it grew larger. By the time he reached his destination, he could perch his tiny gnat form on the lip of the glass container, directing his insect eyes downward into a massive pool of green liquid. The depths of the fluid looked bottomless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another problem that he noticed immediately. The level of the liquid's surface in the container looked a good twenty feet or more below him. \"How can I reach it?\" The tiny gnat-man pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he realized, he needed to think like and actually be a gnat. With his six tiny legs, he could land on almost any vertical surface and cling to it. If he practice care and patience, he should be able to climb down and access the antidote. He swiveled his head and stared at the distant teenagers. With relief, he noted they hadn't detected him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't figure out why Mr. Smith would hide from us,\" Tommy said. He took out his phone, put it on the table and started to use what he considered a more intelligent approach to the problem. He did a Google search on \"gnat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe tried to look over Tommy's shoulder, but frowned when he saw a page on gnat biology. \"What? Now you're going to study about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smacked Joe's arm. \"No, just trying to find a clue to... Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This says gnats live only a few days!\" Tommy cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr. Smith might have already keeled over from old age?\" Joe couldn't help himself from snickering as he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\" Joe asked. \"Your idiot neighbor turns himself into some tiny, stupid bug with a lifespan of days! Wow, talk about stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else does it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This article's mostly about ways to exterminate gnats,\" Tommy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right to me,\" he said. In fact, he heard a little gnat buzzing around his face. He reached out with his quick reflexes and caught it in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his hand, Tommy asked, \"Is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe frowned when he saw that capturing the tiny insect in his fist had resulted in an accidental squishing. \"Uh, I can't really tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tommy asked irritably. \"Does it have Mr. Smith's head or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe showed his palm to Tommy. \"There's not really enough of it left that I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! That could have been Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Joe protested. \"You're the one saying Mr. Smith is so smart and intelligent. So, if he is such a brainy guy, he would know not to fly near us to avoid getting accidentally crushed.

Look at that!\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned and noticed Joe's gaze was toward the center of the table. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a damn gnat on that jar of antidote from the lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In his excitement, he had lost his footing, which was even more serious when dealing with six legs rather than two. In a sickening instant, he slid into the vial, landing with a wet plop in a sea of antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plunge into the vial coincided with the return of Joe and Tommy, so he immediately began pleading for help with an inaudible yet persistent voice. \"Tommy!\" The gnat-man screamed. \"Look! It's working! You just have to get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy looked for his phone, a bored Joe looked down and saw the vial and rubber stopper on Mr. Smith's table. Without even really stopping to think about it, he picked up the stopper and pushed it deep into the neck of the glass vial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Tommy found his phone. He turned to Joe and asked, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Joe said, the stoppered vial in his hand, which concealed the tiny insect sloshing around with the liquid inside the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you doing with the antidote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just looking at it,\" he said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned. \"Just put it down, and quit picking up things that don't belong to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's eyes flashed, but he dropped the vial into a large bowl on the table that held coupons, a set of keys, a tube of breath mints, and assorted other trivial items from Mr. Smith's daily life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Tommy said. \"I'll stop by tomorrow to see if there's any word from Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the teenager saw the floundering insect struggling to stay afloat inside the glass confines of the vial.</span></div></div>",

He sniffed of the contents and grimaced. \"That stuff smells like your old gym shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you take the damn stopper off?\" Tommy replied distractedly. He had zeroed in on the whiny buzz of another gnat and followed the tiny insect to a landing on a windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe put the vial and the stopper back on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the little bug-man celebrated, realizing that Joe had neglected to place the stopper in the antidote container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stealthy approach, Tommy, in the meantime, got close enough to the windowsill to confirm the gnat was a true insect, not one with Mr. Smith's tiny face on its body. Before the little bug suspected his intent, Tommy crushed it with a casual swat of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down one more,\" he said wearily to Joe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could take forever,\" Joe said. \"Why don't we just grab a can of bug spray and wipe them all out at one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed. \"Because, numb-skull, we don't want to kill Mr. Smith, too! What if he's here somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe scowled. After a moment to think, he retorted, \"Yeah? If your nerdy neighbor's here, why doesn't he just show himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned, whether from Joe's remark or from the fact he heard another gnat buzzing, and answered, \"I've thought about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, again, if you had simply kept track of him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that again!\" Joe complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't helping anyone. Maybe Mr. Smith got hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe scoffed. \"Maybe a bigger bug ate him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that's cold, Joe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's the truth. It's a bug-eat-bug world for someone stupid enough to change himself into a gnat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't do it on purpose,\" Tommy said. \"There was a problem with the antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he shrunk himself to the size of a bug,\" Joe countered. \"Same difference. Strange, if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time, Mr. Smith listened with dismay to the way the teens discussed him. Nevertheless, he tried not to let them distract him from his purpose. He used his tiny wings to transport himself over the kitchen table. He hovered, trying to determine if he could land on the lip of the glass vial and access the antidote, all without getting noticed by one of the dangerous teenaged titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy kept tilting his head. He now heard the distinct buzzy sounds of two different gnats in differing locations in the room. He continued to listen to Joe put down Mr. Smith for his crazy experiments, grunting an occasional \"Uh-huh\" to keep Joe from interrupting him while he tracked down the two tiny insects.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt his hyperactive brain sending out messages...he could even feel a wiry leg twitch or a wing flex in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done his best to avoid Joe, the careless one. He had trusted in the conviction that Tommy would be careful, attentive and less bloodthirsty than his moronic but deadly friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should have worked,\" he wailed in his mind since he lacked the capacity for human speech. He couldn't even tell the teenager of this mistake, that he really wasn't a bug and that Tommy, to the tiny gnat-man's horrified surprise, had just squished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, squishing might have been a nice way of phrasing what the frustrated teenager had done to the unfortunate scientist in one of those teenaged mood swings brought about in a fateful moment of pique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tiny gnat-man had locked his tiny faceted eyes on Tommy's huge face and saw the two dark eyes staring back at him, his heart had soared. \"He has to recognize me!\" Mr. Smith told himself confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Tommy took one glance and saw that this gnat, too, lacked his neighbor's human head, having no way of knowing that the erroneous antidote had fully transformed the ill-served researched fully into a common gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his vertical perch on the wall, a jubilant Mr. Smith launched himself into flight, singing Tommy's praises as he flew toward the massive teenager. \"I knew you'd find me and figure it out,\" he tried to convey through the sibilant buzzing of his wings. \"I knew....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moment of relief had been so unfairly short-lived. In an instant, his relief had turned to horror when a hand bigger than a building lashed out at him, smacking him back against the vertical surface of the white wall and smearing his tiny gnat form into some mangled components.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if he had expected a quick end, Mr. Smith was cheated yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny head continued to observe and, although without success, transmit messages to other parts of his tiny insect form that had been streaked in a gory display of abstract art on his own wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe came into view. \"Is that one more down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tommy said, heaving a deep sigh. \"For just a second, something told me it was the one.

Some other fucking bug probably had Mr. Smith for its dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you tried,\" Joe said. \"Want to go play some video-games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith groaned in horror in a brain that went on functioning although the gnat's head had been physically severed from its smashed gnat's body. The inane workings of Joe's brain, which so quickly lost interest in the situation, felt like the final insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eew! Fuck!\" Joe said and moved his enormous, slack-jawed face close to the twitchy remains of the bug smeared on the wall. \"It's still moving, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny eyes in the head registered the look of utter disgust on Joe's face. Was that going to be the last thing he ever saw?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe saw the tiny mangled wings adhered to the wall a short distance from the head and a section of the body with a few wiry legs still attached. \"You really made a mess of this stupid bug,\" Joe said with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should keep looking,\" Tommy said, but with such an obvious lack of conviction that Joe picked up the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you rather go back to my place and play video-games?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! </i>  It seemed so unfair. Tommy could at least act as if he cared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sigh, Tommy agreed. \"Doesn't seem much point now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed. \"Besides, I was thinking of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith groaned in his head as things started to get cold and foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Smith was already an old guy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was in his thirties, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe that meant the formula turned him into an old gnat,\" Joe theorized. \"You saw on that website they only live about a week. Mr. Smith was probably so old that he had like some kind of insect heart attack and keeled over dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, Tommy didn't understand how Joe's brain worked. But, it seemed a better alternative than poor Mr. Smith getting eaten by a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith groaned. He was going to die and the last words he would hear were the inane thoughts of one of the world's most stupid teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll never know,\" he said, turning away from the smear on the wall that, unknown to Tommy and Joe, showed the true end of the brilliant if unlucky research scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was he only tired or did his feeling weary mean he was getting old for a gnat and that much closer to his death at the pitiful age of seven days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracting him from his own morbid thoughts was the awareness of the fragrant scent of the over-ripe bananas in the bowl. His gnat instincts took over and he buzzed over to the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the only bug with the same idea. Dozens of other gnats swarmed and buzzed around the bowl. Some landed and feasted on the juices of the decaying brown peels. Full of energy and already excited by the intense aroma of the bananas, some of the gnats began to pursue other interests. In no time, the swarm continued to grow and to whirl in a massive, loosely organized ball of insects. Poor Mr. Smith found himself trapped near the center of the chaotic assembly of bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other gnats landed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off,\" Mr. Smith cried and tried to shake free. The clinging bug caused him to tumble into a knot of bugs. The other insects swarmed on top of him. \"Get off me! What are they doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisturbed by the free-for-all, he was even more aghast when his scientific mind put the facts together. The gnats were in a mating swarm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gnat landed on the tiny gnat-scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Mr. Smith buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Mr. Smith realized. \"Oh, please no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chance of fate had caused the formula to transform him. Another quirk of fate had also arisen when the gnat that had fallen into his formula and corrupted it to begin with had been female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mr. Smith tried to fly away, but several excited male gnats clung to him and pulled him back down into a swarm of fellow winged insects.</span></div></div>",

He has a spasm of pain in his guts and was forced to make an emergency landing just as the boys entered the kitchen. No matter how many times he saw them, he could barely accept how huge they had become. Beings of wanton destruction, they could not destroy him on a whim and never realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get to Tommy,\" Mr. Smith realized. \"He's my only chance of getting back to human form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the boys get closer.

The swarm had not quite dispensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These bananas were a great idea,\" Tommy said. \"It's attracted a swarm of these little pests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swiped one into his fist and examined it with his magnifying glass. \"Not Mr. Smith,\" he said before indecorously squishing the insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he eliminated about a dozen other gnats, his interest level waned. He put down the magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Mr. Smith felt the pain in his guts worsen. Was this it? He had heard the boys discuss how gnats lived seven days or less. Was he having the gnat equivalent of a heart attack? He remained worried when he heard a familiar buzzing. One of his fellow gnats had found him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Joe now held the magnifying glass. \"Hey, Tommy. Come look at these two bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy walked over and squinted down. \"I just see one bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're two,\" Joe said. \"They're connected! I think they're having sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith cringed at the thought, but the other insect remained determined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gross,\" Tommy said. \"But at least we can get rid of those two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mr. Smith cried. \"Tommy! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed. \"Dude, this is so weird,\" he said. \"Look, the male is making love to the female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy squinted again. \"Which is the female?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bottom, of course, you moron,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be true!\" Mr. Smith screamed, as the stronger male fruit fly held him in place all the time on the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, please. Get him off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mr. Smith, it was a humiliating discovery. He was female as well as an insect, and the overly zealous male fruit fly kept raping him repeatedly with the two teenagers making fun of him as they watching from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe leaned closer and studied the bugs with the magnifying glass. \"This is really interesting,\" he said. \"I think the female enjoys it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy felt totally grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, just please stop it.

As with the total lifespan of his new form, all physical processes seemed wildly accelerated. Once again, the scent of the over-ripe bananas seized control of his instincts. Mr. Smith flew to the bowl and landed on the soft exterior of some of the enormous browning yellow fruits. His tiny insect form probed for particularly soft spots. He didn't seem particularly hungry and wasn't sure why the banana peel held such fascination until he felt the long tube extend from his abdomen. He felt something both pleasant and unpleasant as his insect guts re-arranged with the extension of the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt pressure all along the tube that was finally relieved as something passed from the open end. The process repeated itself a couple of times before the tiny bug screamed. \"I'm laying eggs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven by his instinct for procreation and the survival of his insect kind, he continued to pump out more of the eggs triggered by the rape from the male gnat.

It was bad enough the tiny bug-man had crawled all over his sandwich. It had \u2014 almost \u2014 made Joe not eat the sandwich. But, he had shrugged it off. Most teenage boys will ignore quite a lot before losing their usually hearty appetites. Joe was no exception. Considering the amount of food he could put away each day, it was good he had a metabolism that kept him as a skinny, lazy, arrogant teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he slammed the back door behind him, Joe noticed a swarm of pesky bugs fly from the open trash can. The stench from the garbage held in the can smacked him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross,\" he said, slapping randomly at some of the buzzing gnats and flies. One of the tiny insects seemed slower than the others, which made it easy for Joe's hand to swat the little creature right out of the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mr. Smith, it was like waking from one nightmare and landing in another bad dream. As his human mind regained control, his first sight to greet him was the image of Joe's enormous hand heading right toward him. The violent blow knocked him out of the air and onto the hard concrete sidewalk running through the yard to the back gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\u2026\" the tiny gnat-man groaned from the brutal crash. But he had no time to deal with any aches or pains as an enormous shadow fell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn panic, the transformed scientist looked skyward in time to see Joe's looming form just as the teenager lifted a foot to take a step along the walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow blocked out the sun, and the tiny gnat-man would have screamed, if possible, as the dirty sole of the shoe crashed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should have been the end, but by some tortured twist of fate, the tiny gnat's body was left mangled and broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way toward the gate, Joe stopped when he saw his friend approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of bug-sitting,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's Mr. Smith?\" Tommy asked, confused. He had been excited to return. He had a vial in his pocket that he hoped would help return Mr. Smith to his true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged. \"Your neighbor's disgusting,\" Joe said. \"He was acting like a real bug, so I've had enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy cursed as Joe pushed past him and walked through the gate. Then, he shrugged off Joe's behavior as typical for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the vial from his pocket and looked at the potential antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, the tiny gnat, wings nearly torn away, buzzed weakly. \"Tommy! It's meeee! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy started toward the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could be excused from failing to notice when one of his dirty sneakers stomped down on an insignificant bug, finishing the job that his friend had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe antidote, as it turned out, would have worked\u2026 if only Mr. Smith had survived long enough to receive it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up, instead, simply crushed flat, stomped not once but twice by one well-meaning teenager and his friend who could not really have given a damn. </span></div></div>",

He placed the magnifying glass that he had kept in his hand down on the table. \"Don't guess I would need this,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also chose to issue one last warning to Joe. \"Don't fuck up,\" Tommy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe rolled his eyes. \"How hard can it be to babysit a bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the door had remained open the entire time, admitting a host of winged insects from the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, keys jangling in his hand, made his exit without bothering to reply to Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, thinking a low profile might be wise, buzzed his wings and flew off the remote. He hovered past Tommy's sullen teenaged friend and headed to the kitchen. Joe wasn't in the least concerned to see him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get into anything that's gonna take me to save your sorry bug-ass,\" he said as the tiny bug-man flew out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteamed by the teenager's insolence, Mr. Smith vowed to have a long talk with Tommy about his choice of friends once this dilemma was solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight from the living room to the kitchen tired him, so he came to rest on the windowsill where a filter sunbeam warmed his tiny insect form. He felt lazy and reasonably secure, even drifting off to sleep. He didn't hear the buzzing of other wings as another gnat, introduced to the home during Tommy's departure, flew around the room and eventually made its way toward the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his focus on the television, Joe didn't bother to pay much attention when he heard a faint buzzing and saw Tommy's bug-man neighbor return. The tiny insect landed on the coffee table near Joe's huge socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better watch out,\" Joe teased. \"Little pest like you wouldn't stand a chance against these.\" The teenager wiggled his toes for emphasis, the movement disturbing the gnat, which flew to the far side of the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" Joe smirked. \"It's not like you're fascinating company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach rumbled loudly like a train rumbling slowly along its tracks, motivating the teenager to get to his feet. \"Don't guess you mind if I grab a snack?\" Joe directed his question at the mindless bug. When he didn't get a response, he shrugged. \"I didn't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Mr. Smith continue to sleep on the warm, sunny windowsill, oblivious to Joe's entry into the kitchen. He would have kept sleeping, dreaming of an idealized Tommy, who unable to restore the tiny man to human form, had agreed to look after him. In his dream, the shirtless teenager let the tiny bug-man rest on his chest against his right nipple. Beneath him, Tommy's skin warmed his body and the powerful strum of the teenager's heart beat reverberated through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, Mr. Smith. You'll always be\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the loud crash had interrupted the dream, alarming the tiny transformed man. He saw Joe across the room. The colossal teenager had kneeled in front of the fridge to clean up a mess he had created by dropping a building-sized container of onion dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the moron he leaves in charge?\" Mr. Smith thought to himself as he buzzed his wings and flew over to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready upset by the mess, Joe heard the buzzing near his ear and snarled, \"I thought I left you in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Mr. Smith flew a few feet and came to rest on a narrow strip of granite in front of the deep, stainless steel basin of his kitchen sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the teenager made a half-hearted attempt to clean up the mess. Standing tall again, Joe grabbed something off the table and stomped toward the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you want?\" Joe growled, raising up the magnifying glass in order to get a better look at the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith felt Joe's stale breath blow over him, causing his wings to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anything!\" The tiny transformed scientist tried to communicate. He saw multiple versions of the enormous teenager through his faceted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Joe proclaimed, getting a revealing look through the thick lens of the magnifying glass. \"You're just some bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith heard the words with a sense of shock. He was still trying to interpret them when Joe grabbed something else \u2014 the morning's newspaper \u2014 from the kitchen table. The teenager rolled the paper into a huge tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering he had left Mr. Smith safe and sound in the living room, Joe declared, \"No way in hell I am going to babysit real bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the newspaper high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooh!\" The transformed scientist cried in anguish as the titanic teenager brought the rolled up paper down on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy found Joe with his socked feet propped on the coffee table when he returned about a half hour later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You been sitting here the whole time I've been gone?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged. \"What if I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where's Mr. Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, eyes still fixed on the TV, just grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, where is it?\" Tommy asked, his voice rising in concern. \"I mean him, dammit. I gotta quit calling him an it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grabbed the rolled up newspaper and handed it to his friend. Tommy glanced at the paper tube and saw a blotch of red. When he looked closer, he felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do? Did you smash Mr. Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I forgot that he turned himself into a fucking bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked pale as snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe broke down into laughter. \"So totally worth it! You should see your face, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, this isn't funny,\" Tommy said. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Joe said. He shoved the magnifying glass at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy used the lens to get a closer look. He saw the smashed remains of a tiny bug but, most important, or so he though, there was no tiny human head. It was a real bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How stupid you think I am?\" Joe asked. \"It was a real bug, not your weird neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he flew away and hid after what I did to his friend,\" Joe joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy continued to stare at the carnage on the newspaper. Some of the wiry, thin insect legs continued to twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith didn't know how much time had elapsed since the huge, powerful teenager had slammed the destructive newspaper on top of his tiny, frail form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only knew that Tommy had returned. He saw his teenaged neighbor's huge form, although the multiple images kept blinking in and out. He tried to buzz his wings, but they no longer worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had Tommy gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he buzzed a question, but it went unheard. He gazed up, and saw Tommy's naturally youthful face twisted into a disgusted grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I yelled at you,\" Tommy told Joe, who just smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, dude. So, any luck at the lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Tommy said. \"That's why I need to talk to Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the fading scientist made a renewed effort. \"Tommy\u2026 I'm here\u2026 I'm\u2026 hurt\u2026 help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy saw at least two of the tiny bug's legs twitch. \"Eew, you didn't do the job right, Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always gotta complain, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his friend, Tommy shouted, \"Mr. Smith! I'm back! Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud words obstructed the tiny scientist's attempt to get back to the pleasant dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fuck this!\" Tommy said, disgusted by the twitching, mashed bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised the newspaper and brought it down with a thunderous slap, finally succeeding in obliterating even the last remains of the pesky insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he called out for his neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, I'm back. Don't worry about stupid Joe. I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thorough search later turned up another gnat, but like the one they had destroyed with the rolled-up newspaper, this one, too, lacked a human head. They never did realize what had happened to Mr. Smith because they failed too realize that the scientist's formula had worked just a little too well. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Consequently, as soon as the teenager lifted the glass, tiny Mr. Smith used his gnat wings to zip across the room. He felt the displaced currents of air as the massive teenager's swipe at him with the huge magazine missed by, relatively speaking, more than a mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe failure brought a loud, disgruntled curse from the teenager. \"Damn freaking bug,\" Joe bellowed. \"You're not getting away that easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Joe tore across the room, moving with shocking speed that chilled Mr. Smith's tiny gnat form to its core. He was extremely grateful for his wings as he attempted to gain altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the somewhat ludicrous scene of Joe swatting the magazine though thin air in repeatedly misguided attempts to deal the irritating pest a quick demise that Tommy returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch what the hell you're doing,\" Tommy cautioned. \"You're going to break something belonging to Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man, now turned gnat, responded in correction. \"He's going to break me!\" The unfortunate, mild-mannered man lamented as he gazed at his teenaged neighbor's colossal form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe on-screen competition has resumed, motivating Tommy to suggest Joe leave off his attempts to squish the bug and return to enjoying their game viewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some reluctance, Joe agreed. He placed the magazine on the coffee table as he returned to the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy poked him in the side with an elbow. \"Why'd you let it go, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna squish it, but it was too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy chuckled in amusement. \"You must feel lame, outsmarted by a freakin' gnat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't outsmart me!\" Joe denied vehemently. \"It was just faster than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, resting on a massive blade of the overhead ceiling fan, felt a little more accomplished when Tommy's words sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did beat the teenaged moron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he also knew that luck had played a small role in his triumph over Tommy's brutal friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis perch gave him an excellent vantage as he watched the two teenagers make rapid work of their pizza and the chicken wings. Seeing them consume such a huge amount of food stirred some hunger pangs in the tiny man-gnat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do gnats eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't get some food soon, he felt almost faint from weakness. He buzzed off the ceiling fan blade to fly to the kitchen. Maybe he could find something edible... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using his tiny tongue, Mr. Smith licked the thick, soft peel.

Tiny Mr. Smith remained convinced that Tommy would be able to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, despite Tommy's sheer enormity, Mr. Smith didn't fear him. Only a short while ago, he had found himself in total agreement when Tommy chided Joe for failing to \"deal with\" an itty-bitty gnat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's statement had given him a huge boost of confidence. \"Stupid Joe,\" Mr. Smith thought to himself. \"Even in this gnat body, I can outsmart him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when Tommy arrived most unexpectedly in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmored with his new trust in Tommy and confidence in his own abilities, Mr. Smith flew out of the enormous glass bowl and zipped toward the massive teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his haste to get back to the game, however, Tommy had grabbed two sodas from Mr. Smith's fridge and then stomped back toward the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hapless little gnat-man could do nothing but trail behind in the colossal teenager's wake.

It's meeee! Help meeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swift, graceful motion, Tommy raised his arms into the air.

He knew he was so small and helpless that potential perils lurked around every corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time the other giant \u2014 Tommy's buddy, Joe \u2014 entered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy snorted. \"Well, there's a first time for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe frowned but ignored the comment. \"No, it's about your neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith forced his wings to remain motionless so the buzz wouldn't hinder his eavesdropping on the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think he's some sort of perv,\" Joe said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed. \"Don't be a jerk. Sure, he's strange, but he's not some perv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Joe challenged. \"He lures you over here to mail a package that he could easily have dropped at the post office himself. Then we find out he is all tiny. Maybe he just wanted to make himself tiny so he could spy on you. Maybe he's one of those\u2026 what do they call them? Voyeurs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith listened and grew more self-righteously angry by the second. At least, there was no way Tommy would take Joe seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that makes more sense, I guess. I mean why would a scientist as smart as Mr. Smith accidentally shrink himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh,\" Tommy said. \"That creeps me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do we know he hasn't done the same thing again?\" Joe speculated. \"The tiny perv could be here watching us right now.\"</span></div></div>",

Tommy's eyes followed the flight of the speck-sized pest. When it landed on one of the large blades on the living room ceiling fan, Tommy jeered at the little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Joe right? You put a tiny shrunken camera on that bug, Mr. Smith?\" Tommy addressed the gnat, thinking the insect might be transmitting the message directly to his pervy neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe came up behind Tommy, which gave the tiny bug-man a surreal moment as he looked down at the two colossal teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna hunt down all your bugs and smash them and their little cameras,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we'll stomp your freaky butt if you've shrunk down again and are watching us,\" Joe added for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony wasn't lost on the tiny transformed man. The teens were looking right at him, but they had no idea that the bug they were addressing was actually Tommy's scientist neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I fly closer, they will have to see there's no camera,\" he thought. \"Whoever heard of putting cameras on bugs?\" He felt a moment of outrage at Joe's ludicrous tale-telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched the tiny bug rise off the fan blade and make a bee-line toward them. \"He must have it on remote control,\" Joe spoke loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a complete moron,\" Mr. Smith decided, and ignored Joe to fly directly toward Tommy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-mee! It's me!\" The tiny gnat-man tried to scream. \"Help mee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe saw the winged bug buzzing around his buddy's face. \"Get him!\" Joe yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me,\" Tommy complained and reached out to swat the tiny bug with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith felt the painful contact with Tommy's enormous hand. His wings began failing, but he managed a relatively soft landing on the living room floor. In the distance, two enormous and looming Airwalks moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the floor quake as Joe walked toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the threat made by Tommy's friend, and he replayed the image of Joe grinding the sole of his sneaker on the floor earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-mee! Help!\" His tiny wing buzzed valiantly, trying to regain the power of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he won't be using this camera to spy on us anymore,\" Joe said as he lifted his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no fucking camera!\" Mr. Smith screamed in outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had been looking closely at the pest, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, man!\" He said. \"I don't see any fucking camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Joe be wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could.

From the tiny transformed scientist's perspective, there was simply a blue of yellow plastic and a sudden, sharp pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world had tilted at a weird angle as Mr. Smith tried to get his bearings. He rested on a smooth, hard surface. A short distance away he saw the body of a tiny gnat, mangled but seemingly intact, wings twitching sporadically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if the boys had brought down a second innocent gnat with their terrifying plastic flyswatters from the dollar store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's wicked,\" Joe remarked, looking down at the table at the little gnat's twitching remains. \"You took its head clean off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith listened with alarm and stared again at the tiny, twitching form.

The teenagers towered over the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can it be alive without a head?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous fingertip poked at the headless gnat's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith panicked. He needed to fly. He sent out commands to his body that went nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No! No!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much of a nightmare to bear. The pathetically twitching body was his own. With one wicked slice, Tommy had severed his head from the gnat's body. Neither of the teenagers had yet noticed the pinpoint-sized head not that far from the crumpled insect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith knew it was now more important than ever that they realize who he was. Maybe they could still save him. Re-attach the head and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a soundless scream, realized it was from his own brain. He was a scientist. Heads could not be re-attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why was he being forced to see all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scientific knowledge knew that answer. The primitive nervous system of insects allowed such a separation. The body might go on living for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really freaky,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting it out of its misery,\" Tommy said, tender feelings reasserting themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the severed head, Mr. Smith watched the teenager's descending finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No! No!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy obliterated the insect's body under the crushing fingertip, wiped away the evidence on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys still didn't see the tiny head. Mr. Smith now wanted them to put a complete end to it. But they were moving away. He heard Joe mutter one last time. \"That was so fucking cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head continued to try to send out messages to a now pulverized body until finally the eyes failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith might have appreciated that his brain, which got him into his mess, was the last thing to go.</span></div></div>",

He needed to put a stop to this nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew directly toward Tommy's face. When the noise of his wings got the teenager's attention, he flew toward the large mosaic tile bowl on the center of the dining room table. Earlier, he had spied something that had given him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, now that his attention had been attracted, followed the flight of the tiny gnat. The insect landed inside the large bowl. He walked closer, keeping his eye on the gnat, which was crawling on the surface of one of Mr. Smith's business cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card identified his neighbor as Mr. Bryan Smith, Professor, Experimental Physics. The card included contact information and a cool logo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bug looked like it was buzzing around Mr. Smith's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he flew, Mr. Smith tried to scream. \"See?

He needed the teenager to figure out the mystery, and the business card was the only clue he had. \"It's me! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Tommy said. \"And if you let these little pests start multiplying, you never get rid of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gnat-man saw the teenager spread his hands apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed scientist had witnessed that maneuver earlier, and he'd also seen the aftermath of that poor crushed bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here before Tommy crushes me,\" he said, zipping away from Tommy. In his panic, he had forgotten to keep track of the teenager's buddy. \"I've got to\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe smacked his hands together the instant the tiny bug had blundered into range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he open them, he grinned and announced, \"Got the tiny shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gross,\" Tommy said as he detected the tiny smear on his buddy's palm. \"You sure did pulverize that little sucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still doesn't help us find out what happened to your weird neighbor,\" Joe said. \"But he will be glad we're helping deal with this pest problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a couple of freakin' gnats,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction,\" Joe said. \"A couple of former freakin' gnats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his hand on the front of his jeans, effectively erasing the last trace of Mr. Bryan Smith, Professor, Experimental Physics.</span></div></div>",

I'm a man! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one is coming up for dinner,\" Tommy noted, indicating a large golden fish with bubble eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith could see the huge form, bigger than a whale, slowly surfacing from the depths of the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is sort of cool!\" Tommy said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joe agreed. \"Bye-bye, bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe lowered his face so he could see better through the transparent pane of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish poked through the surface of the water, but wasn't really close to Mr. Smith. Then the fish sank back into the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid fish!\" Joe said. \"What's wrong with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll add some of these!\" Tommy said, grabbing a small yellow can, opening the lid and sprinkling fish flakes on the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Joe exclaimed as both fish in the tank rose toward the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-mee!

Soggy bits of crust and strands yellow cheese were scattered across his tongue like the debris of a battlefield. Barely visible were Tommy\u2019s jagged teeth that glinted ominously just before Mr. Smith was hit with a gust of Tommy\u2019s warm, foul-smelling breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA millisecond later Mr. Smith\u2019s ears were assaulted by the grotesque sound of Tommy sinking his teeth into the flesh of the chicken wing. \u201cYou already saved me!\u201d he cried as the light thinned before disappearing altogether as Tommy\u2019s jaws came together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you do it again!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith\u2019s gave no more thought to it as Tommy began to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy savored the flavor of the juicy wing as he chewed. With his mouth still full of food, he parted his lips to slurp the remaining meat from the bone. For a split second his chewed food mired in thick saliva glinted in the light. The weak struggles of battered gnat mixed amongst the half-chewed meat went completely unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pulled the bone from between his lips with a pop, licking his lips before resuming chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game went to commercial, Tommy turned to face Joe. He was surprised to friend already staring at him, with a suspicious half-smile plastered across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoht?\u201d Tommy grumbled through a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Joe replied in a tone that clearly meant he was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy furrowed his eyebrows as he forcibly swallowed his mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, what!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Joe insisted \u201cJust there was a gnat on that chicken wing!\u201d he punctuated the end of his sentence with a mischievous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAugh!\u201d Tommy shouted, sticking his tongue out. \u201cIs it there?!\u201d he asked loudly, pointing at his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sneered at the exposed bits of chewed food on Tommy\u2019s tongue. \u201cI\u2019m not looking in your mouth to find some bug! You probably swallowed it!\u201d he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy withdrew his tongue, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole!\u201d he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet over it! You\u2019ll live, you pussy!\u201d Joe shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed, \u201cYeah I guess my stomach\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever, the game\u2019s back!\u201d Joe replied dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys returned their attention to the big screen, any thoughts of the downed bug purged from their minds. Tommy enjoyed the rest of the game with a comfortably full gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe since your weird neighbor never showed up he\u2019ll still treat us to a meal next time he sees us!\u201d Joe said hopefully as they cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tommy shrugged, \u201cHonestly I\u2019m too full to think about eating right now!\u201d he replied.

As Tommy's tiny gnat-man neighbor listened, the teenager spoke into the phone. \"That's great.

He hovered over the sink in his own kitchen, noticed some dirty dishes in the stainless steel basin. One plate showed a residue of congealed spaghetti sauce. Mr. Smith's brilliant mind kicked into gear. If he smeared his feet in the red sauce, perhaps he could write out a message. He was too tiny to write an extensive message. He decided that he should start with the obvious \"Help Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had managed to smear a crude H and E on the white kitchen countertop before he began to weaken. Even writing out a simple two-word plea for help was an exhausting undertaking. But he had to continue... he shuddered to think what Joe would have in store for him if the teenagers continued to mistake him for a real bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe renewed his efforts...</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, flying toward them involved a great deal of nerve, something which was tested as the tiny gnat-man veered off to avoid flying too near Joe. His earlier experiences with Tommy's friend had shown him the dangerous folly of getting anywhere in the vicinity of the huge but almost laughably stupid gigantic jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith tried to take his mind off how much the enormous scale of this new universe unnerved him by playing some inner theme music in his mind as he careened, dived, ascended and swerved around the room that was his own kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had given Joe a healthy wide berth, the tiny, inexperienced flyer had not anticipated the wake the gigantic teenager made by just moving through the room. He had flown past Joe and was on his way toward Tommy when the first of the air currents stirred up by Joe's movements slammed into the tiny transformed scientist. It was like getting ambushed by a hurricane. Mr. Smith's theme music vanished, replaced by panicked if inaudible screams as the tiny flying creature went hurtling through the air in an out-of-control dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith fought to regain control, but he saw a strange surface that looked like a massive red and orange swamp rising up to meet him. \"Fuck!\" The tiny gnat-man screamed in his overtaxed brain. \"It's the pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Tommy had taken a seat a Mr. Smith's table and reached for another pizza slice from the cardboard container. His eyes happened to pick up the erratic trajectory of something pale and tiny moving through the air between him and the pizza. He followed it as the movement became less haphazard. Finally, the tiny shape set down on the tabletop barely a foot in front of Tommy, who narrowed his eyes and recognized it as a tiny gnat. He did nothing, at first, but stare at the delicately tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the exhausted Mr. Smith got the sensation of being watched. As he became more aware of his surroundings, he realized that half of his goal had been accomplished. Tommy had seen him! Tommy was watching him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the true test of his intelligence... getting the enormous but trusted teenager to make the intuitive leaps that would let him recognize \u2014 and help \u2014 Mr. Smith get back into his human form.</span></div></div>",

Albeit, he was a scientist who had somehow managed to accidentally transform himself into a tiny winged bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith tried to land on the plastic walls of the cup, but the strawberry puree wanted to cling to his tiny feet. \"Ugh, this is disgusting,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, let's go,\" Tommy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe suddenly appeared. \"What's the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny transformed man gazed through the pink-coated walls of the plastic cup. Joe looked huge and plenty scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt relief when Tommy elected to keep Joe in the dark. \"I've got to do something at home,\" Tommy muttered, curving his fingers around the plastic cup as he and Joe walked to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith settled in the bottom of the cup and managed to peer out in the narrow space not covered by Tommy's enormous fingers. He felt relieved that he would only have to work with Tommy and not a bumbling, erratic teenager like Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remained confident he could count on Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy walked back to his house and holed up in his room. He sat the plastic cup to the side of his desk and turned on the desktop computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought up a page of hits to his query seeking some basic information on how to best keep Mr. Smith safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't like one of the first things he read and exclaimed, \"Well, damn! That's harsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith buzzed his wings in agitation. \"Tommy! What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy wondered if he should tell his unfortunate neighbor, but the little bug began to batter itself against the walls of the plastic cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Mr. Smith,\" the teenager said. \"It's just that... we need to hurry and figure out how to get you back to normal. This page says that flies and gnats usually only live a few weeks, maybe a month or two at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith felt a chill splash him like a cup of ice water being poured on him. He hadn't bothered to focus on any possible concerns other than avoiding being crushed or swatted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy squinted at him. \"You look young-ish to me,\" he said, intending to reassure. \"I'm sure you have a couple of months, and not just a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith buzzed weakly. He felt suddenly queasy. </span></div></div>",

The journey across the room was anything but gentle for the tiny insect as Tommy's steps caused him to get bounced off the sticky plastic walls. He felt a sharp pain caused by one of the collisions and saw his front left limb had crumpled at a bizarre angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy situated the cup beneath an enormous desk lamp and activated the bulb. The interior of the cup was immediately bathed with intensely bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith squinted and tried to gaze up at the blinding bulb, which was located beneath a heavy dome that focused all of the light down onto the cup.

His other front limb moved to wipe his eyes, but its partner limb remained crumpled and useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith felt nervous knowing how a simple careless action on Tommy's part had left him with only five viable limbs.

Once he was back to his human self, he could think of ways to expand on his research. His formula could shrink and transform people. He wondered what practical applications could be made to his research. He also wondered how much money he could make by selling his research to the highest bidder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years, he had barely managed to stay afloat. He taught his full load of classes at the university, but he hated teaching morons with hardly any more intelligence than Tommy's friend, Joe. \"I can finally retire from teaching once I reveal my formula to the world,\" he predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his excitement, the tiny wings on his back began to twitch, producing that low, irritating buzzing sound, reminding him of his current predicament. He was a long, long way from being able to auction off the fruits of his scientific labors. Everything depended on Tommy helping him to regain his human form. He trusted the teenager, but not enough to completely erase the nagging doubts about Tommy's ability to focus on the challenging obstacles ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, the door to Tommy's room opened and the huge teenager entered. Tommy walked confidently across the room, shoved himself into his chair, and stared through the plastic walls of the huge cup as Mr. Smith's tiny insect feet allowed him to cling to the vertical, slightly curved surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Bug,\" Tommy said in a sing-song voice like one might use with a pet or very young child. \"You don't mind if I call you Mr. Bug, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith buzzed his wings and exploded in fury. \"Yes, I do mind!\" The scientist poured out his frustration and fears. Unfortunately, from Tommy's perspective, the tirade amount to the proverbial tempest in a teapot. He saw the little insect crawling on the interior of the plastic cup while buzzing its wings to make an extremely faint buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd be a sport about it, Mr. Bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy completely disarmed him by seizing the cup in one hand and bringing it closer to his face, which Mr. Smith stared at in horrified dismay. Every sprout of hair from the chin, to every emerging pimple, looked so massively magnified and duplicated by Mr. Smith's faceted, compound eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh, he looks like a monster,\" Mr. Smith thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks so creepy,\" Tommy thought to himself as he stared at the loathsome form of the winged bug that had been his next-door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although exhausted and terrified, his brain continued to work on both pure instinct and calculate intellect, and at the moment he had the unsettling realization of being watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain hearkened back to early origins when great beasts had stalked the naked, defenseless primates across savannas and in jungles. Bryan Smith got the unsettling impression that he was being stalked by some predatory creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he blinked, and Tommy's distant but enormous face came back into focus as his greatest hope. More than that! Finally, the tiny gnat-man had gotten himself noticed. Tommy was watching him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he worried that the teenager's interest might prove mercurial. \"What can I do to get him to connect me to my gnat body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat represented the real test of his intelligence... getting the gigantic, potentially destructive, but ultimately trusted teenager to make the connection between all the dots that would let him recognize \u2014 and help \u2014 Mr. Smith get back into his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took a bite of pizza. The tiny gnat-man saw yards and yards of dough and sauce and greasy meat disappear into the teenager's massive maw. Even as he started chewing, Tommy continued to gaze at the little winged bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith wished that his message for help that he had formed with sauce hadn't been wiped away by a gigantic teenaged hand. He could have flown to the saucy letters and begged Tommy to recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get close enough to him,\" the little gnat-man decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wings sprung into action and he found himself flying over the great bog of pizza sauce and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had reached for another slice. The movement of his hand sent out air currents that made flying difficult. As he pulled his hand back from the cardboard box, he saw the little gnat was flying across the table, getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes continued to track the insect's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Smith celebrated. \"He still sees me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven better, the teenager had made no hostile moves to signal an intent to swat or crush the insignificant bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan Smith flew down onto the table, inches away from his gigantic teenaged neighbor. \"Tommy!\" Bryan Smith buzzed. \"For god's sake, look down! I can't explain it, but I've turned into a bug. Please, you've got to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's face formed a frown. Up close, the gnat looked not only tiny but also rather hideously alien. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Mr. Smith begged. \"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow fell over him. The darkness took him completely by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all his attention devoted to Tommy, he had failed to keep track of Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, in the meantime, had noticed Tommy's distracted gaze and saw the little pest that had landed on the tabletop. It was a simple matter to stretch out his hand and slam the flat of his palm down onto the tiny, frail gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe smirked. \"Well, be sure to tell Mr. Smith that, thanks to me, he has less of a fruit-fly problem now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy chewed his pizza, undisturbed by Joe's act of wanton destruction. \"Whatever, dude. It was just one pathetic bug. I'm sure there's more where that one came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe rubbed his hand onto his shirt. Most, but not all, of the crushed bug remained behind on the tabletop. One wing, although badly mangled, continued to twitch for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So gross,\"Joe muttered and reached for another slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For some reason it was sticking, preventing them from getting back inside.

Again the gnat came rushing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAugh! Stupid, fucking bug\u201d Tommy growled, swatting ineffectively at the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying dude, it doesn\u2019t make sense. No way he shrinks a second time without having his shit together,\u201d Joe insisted from where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy glared at him for a second, but said nothing as he looked into the kitchen sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he likes being tiny. Maybe he likes seeing us big? Maybe\u2026 he thinks it\u2019s funny that he can be so tiny and still control what you do even though you\u2019re waaaay bigger than him?\u201d Joe guessed, as Tommy gingerly lifted dishes out of the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it!\u201d Joe said abruptly, dropping the pizza box onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoe! Careful, that could squish him!\u201d Tommy said, his eyes wide in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already looked there,\u201d Joe replied dismissively. With that he dropped into a barstool next to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Smith would do that,\u201d Tommy said, though his voice betrayed some hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe picked up on it in a heartbeat. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re so sure!\u201d He replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. He leaned over and pulled another slice free of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore the other day did you think he would shrink himself at all? Or that shrinking was even a thing?\u201d Joe asked, giving Tommy a pointed look before lifting the pizza over his mouth and lowering it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense\u2026\u201d Tommy trailed off as he walked away from the sink. The gnat came out of nowhere, assaulting his face. \u201cAugh!\u201d Tommy groaned, swatting at the annoying insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe thaht fly ate him!\u201d Joe said through a full mouth, spewing crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it do that?\u201d Tommy gasped, \u201cYou think he\u2019s dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged and swallowed his food. \u201cI dunno dude.\u201d Looking up, Joe saw his friend\u2019s crest fallen face and felt a twinge of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this? We\u2019ll give him some time to go right here on the counter-\u201c Joe pointed to a spot next to the pizza box \u201c- and we can help him. He\u2019ll have a way easier time finding us than we will finding him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked at Joe, \u201cYeah ok. That makes sense!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plan hammered out, Tommy no longer felt too guilty to grab a slice of pizza.<br>\r\nJoe watched as Tommy made his selection, before letting out a laugh. \u201cYour new friend the gnat landed right where I pointed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy grinned at the puny bug before taking his first bite, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s Mr. Smith!\u201d he joked.

One of mistaken identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had rushed Tommy\u2019s face, but each time was nearly swatted out of the air by a gargantuan palm or Tommy\u2019s gusting breaths. In spite of that, it had been an incredible site to rush at his face. It dwarfed any of the presidents at Rushmore. Every pore on the vast surface of his face was visible, every bump on the slope of his nose, each tiny hair over his luscious lips or lining his glistening eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joe had come up with the solution of the once again tiny man making himself visible at a specific location, Mr. Smith had been elated. The massive buffoon was for once being helpful instead of being an obstacle! Surely they would make the connection when what seemed to be a simple gnat did exactly as they instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Mr. Smith had landed in place as instructed, only to hear the giants immediately dismiss it as coincidence, it didn\u2019t even cross their minds. Why should it? Shrinking had been a foreign concept the day before, transforming into a bug was a whole different realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diminutive gnat-man had been consumed in that realization he realized too late what was happening.

He had already been rescued, how could this be happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was still alive.

Joe's careless deposit of the pizza box on the counter had obliterated the curious two-word message. Had it really been written in spaghetti sauce, or ketchup?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That message,\" he said, putting his confusion into words. \"You know what was odd about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe had just taken a bite of pizza, so he needed time to eat it. He didn't take the necessary time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya mean?\" He said, still chewing as he spoke. He sprayed particles of pizza into the air to rain down on the counter and pizza box. \"Nothing your creepy neighbor does could surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy scowled and Mr. Smith's wings buzzed. <i>\"How dare that ignorant behemoth disparage my name?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, think about it. How did tiny Mr. Smith get that much sauce into position to write out that message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged. His head hurt from too much thinking. \"Why the hell you asking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Mr. Smith flew toward the sink. He needed more sauce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is not making sense...\" Tommy tried to put the few clues together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith soaked up more sauce on his feet and flew toward Tommy. He needed to think of a short message and find a suitable surface for using the sauce to spell it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe heard the drone of tiny wings and lazily scanned the area as he reached for another slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gnat-man flew in a path to avoid Joe's moving hand, but the giant teenager's action of lifting a slice of pizza from the box disturbed the air currents. <i>\"Tommy, please pay attention!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew directly toward his gigantic next-door neighbor, circled wide of Tommy's enormous and intimidating form, before he landed on a bare stretch of counter. His flight had attracted Tommy's attention, but in a merely distracted fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoo! Get out of here!\" Tommy waved a huge hand in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny insect stood its ground as it used its feet to spell out a perfectly serviceable <b>M</b>. Satisfied with that effort, he scrambled to attach an <b>E</b> and finish the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me!\" The hopeful but exhausted scientist buzzed. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith focus on Tommy, he didn't detect the shadow of Joe's descending hand in time. \"There's that damn pest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his hand onto the tiny insect and squished it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Tommy yelled. \"You moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tommy voiced his theory, Joe looked down. The tiny bug's remains now added a gruesome red dot to accompany the smeared letters <b>M</b> and <b>E</b>. \"You're nuts! No way that damn gnat was Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the tiny insect limbs twitched, Tommy allowed himself to be convinced. \"Yea, guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, as he thought about it, Joe smiled. Unspoken, he decided that, if by some chance it had been Mr. Smith, the little sucker got what he deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, with a shudder, looked away from the carnage on the counter. \"Right behind you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing in the opening were two towering silhouettes, like gods emerging from another dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of their quaking steps sent forceful vibrations through the floor, rattling the exhausted gnat on the counter. It wasn\u2019t enough for the titanic teens to ever notice. However at such a small size, with a gnat\u2019s heightened sensitivity to vibration, each step shook Mr. Smith to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe balanced in one hand a city-sized package Mr. Smith could only assume was the pizza they had left to retrieve. With his other hand, he lifted a massive slice of pizza free, long tendrils of cheese stretching as he brought it towards his lips. Even from afar, the shrunken scientist was struck by the violent yet oddly graceful movement as Joe lapped at the pizza with his tongue before clamping his jaws around the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flicked to Tommy as the pizza box crashed into Tommy\u2019s back. What would have been like a train crashing into him at this size, merely bounced off Tommy. But it was still enough to garner a reaction. Though he couldn\u2019t see what happened, Mr. Smith cringed at the squeak of Tommy\u2019s sneaker reverberating through the room. Neither of them indicated they\u2019d even noticed it as there was a deep thud followed up with an angry grunt from Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gaped at their forms from where he lay, awed simply by their hulking presence. Their innocent roughhousing exuded a casual power that could easily turn deadly for a creature of Mr. Smith\u2019s current stature. In spite of having already witnessed the teens at such an impressive size, it was not a sight Mr. Smith felt he would ever find commonplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMR. SMITH?\u201d Tommy bellowed without warning. The shock of hearing Tommy\u2019s voice triggered something instinctive and the tiny gnat-man took flight. He groaned, his tiny bug body still tired from frantically writing the message for Tommy and Joe only a few minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommeeeeeee\u201d he buzzed pathetically as he landed back on the counter. As Tommy seemed to turn towards his location, the man turned gnat was mowed down by a hurricane gust followed by a thundering crash. He shouted as he spun and whipped through the air, though thankfully his wings kicked in instinctively and he immediately began to zip away from the terrifying behemoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d the bugman stopped in mid-air, \u201cWhere am I going? I Need their help!\u201d With that he turned in mid-air to return to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the giants seem fazed by whatever had caused such a violent disturbance. Upon noticing his door shut he realized it had been merely Joe swinging the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was turned away from him now, roaring something that Mr. Smith was too distracted to make out. Joe grunted something at Tommy before swiftly approaching the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Not you!\u201d the gnat man whined as Joe pounded up to the counter, bathing Mr. Smith\u2019s message in the shadow of the pizza box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith gaped at the tensed muscle of Joe\u2019s arm, appearing like sculpted hills dotted with thin, branch-less trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing an explosion of sound from Joe the arm lowered, sending the box crashing down onto Mr. Smith\u2019s message. The box let out an ungodly scraping noise as Joe shoved it onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo!!\u201d he droned furiously. \u201cNo, you blind idiot! You have to move that!\u201d he took flight, quickly rising towards Joe\u2019s distant face as the young titan brought more pizza into his cavernous mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Smith?\u201d Tommy\u2019s voice sounded from the hall just after he disappeared from Joe\u2019s site.

He had worked so hard to write out a message on the kitchen counter that he hoped would lead to the teenagers coming to his rescue for a second time, only to have Joe, through his utter disregard, obliterate it beneath a cardboard pizza box bigger than a sports arena. The tiny, transformed scientist could have curled into a ball and cried himself into a disbelieving stupor. Instead, he reacted with vim and vigor, using his wings to launch himself higher to berate Tommy's titanic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing around Joe's head, the infuriate, exasperated scientist screamed his protest in a shrill, insect-like drone. \"You moron! Look what you have done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe heard the irritating buzz as a gnat, so tiny it could almost go unseen, zipped around his face. \"Get away, you damn pest,\" he growled, flailing out with an enormous hand that stirred violent currents in the air of the room. The winged insect struggled to remain aloft, only for another of Joe's hand to smack at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedwood-sized fingers brushed Mr. Smith's tiny insect form, sending the novice flyer crashing toward a wide expanse of stretches of baked dough, pools of tomato sauce and sticky tar pits of cheese. \"Nooo!\" The tiny gnat screamed as its body landed with a sticky splat in one of the warm cheese swamps littering the landscape of the titanic pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the flurry of activity, Joe lost track of the tiny bug, but his appetite, hardly diminished by one slice, motivated his next move. He grabbed up the entire pizza box, slapped the lid closed and carried it into the living room. He wanted to watch some TV as he enjoyed the pizza. With one hand using the remote control, his other hand opened the box and reached for another slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the slice went aloft, a tiny, entrapped gnat buzzed a terrified scream. \"TOM-MEE!

It struck the side of the coffee table, which flipped the slice, which landed face-down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, man,\" Tommy growled. \"Now you're making a mess in Mr. Smith's house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grinned at Tommy's irritation and reached for the dropped slice. \"Relax.\" He picked up the slice from the floor. \"Five second rule, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned. \"Stop being a moron. You gonna eat that after dropping it on the floor? It could have anything on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor poor Mr. Smith, the last few seconds had made his nightmare spin more out of control. The world went crazy as the landscape tilted suddenly and violently when the pizza slice dropped from Joe's enormous hand. There was a powerful thump as the pizza clipped the coffee table. Mr. Smith screamed as the slice flipped in mid-air, and the floor rushed up to greet the dropped pizza. There was a squishy thud and Mr. Smith found himself pushed deeper into a pool of semi-hot cheese as the lights went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time was afforded the tiny gnat-man as Joe reached for the dropped pizza with a remark, \"Five second rule, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world leveled out again, Mr. Smith screamed in fright. \"No!

The transformed, and still tiny, scientist flew on his brand-new wings, gaining altitude for a more complete survey of Tommy's enormous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he hovered in the air, Tommy advanced into the house and, without warning, bellowed out words that destroyed the silence. \"MR.

His attention re-focused on the titanic teenager, he saw him speaking into his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am here and no sign of Mr. Smith,\" Tommy was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny gnat-man flew closer, trying to think of a plan to contact Tommy and finally deciding to wing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, looks like dinner is off, but I think I will stick around for a while and see if Mr. Smith shows up. Later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy finished his call to Mr. Smith and walked into his neighbor's living room. As he took a seat on the sofa, he placed his phone on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to look for the remote for the TV, but a thin, incessant buzzing sounded in his ears. A thought popped into his head. What if Mr. Smith had shrunk again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became alert, straining to hear any tiny cries or detect any sign of movement. He was distracted, however, by a gnat that buzzed past his face and then settled atop the phone he had left on the surface of the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hand over his phone and said, \"Shoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny insect took to the air, but flew erratically thanks to the air currents stirred by the teenager's huge hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also decided that he had to be wrong. He had seen firsthand the relief Mr. Smith had felt when restored to his normal size. No way he would have gone and shrunk himself again after his harrowing adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it took him to come to this conclusion, the gnat returned. The tiny insect flew over the coffee table and landed once again on his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous touch-pad of colorful apps spread out beneath him as the transformed scientist gazed up at Tommy's immense form. How could a scrawny teenager look so overwhelming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned and marveled at the stupidity of bugs. He waved his hand to shoo the bug away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't want to swat you, bug,\" the teenager said aloud. \"But I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man had flown in panic from the descending hand, which looked capable of smashing him in an instant. Then, hearing Tommy's warning, he felt even more panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's me! I'm Mr Smith, not a bug!\" He tried in vain to protest against Tommy's unfair stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his experiences from last time, however, suggested Tommy was probably bluffing. The teenager probably wouldn't hurt a fly. The only thing that left him uncomfortable was the word \"probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew closer, directly toward Tommy's face. \"I have to get him to associate me with this bug I've become,\" the tiny gnat-man realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy experienced a surge of irritation when the gnat flew toward his face. He disliked bugs enough without one getting in his face. He brushed away the flying insect with another swipe of his hand, vowing next time he wouldn't be so kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith retreated after another close call. Getting close to Tommy always ended in a near miss, and he doubted his luck would continue indefinitely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to formulate a new plan when Tommy arose from the sofa and walked toward the front door. He'd had enough of waiting for his neighbor and being bugged by stupid gnats. He did make a mental note to tell Mr. Smith he might benefit from having an exterminator check out his house for pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mr. Smith tried to cry out. \"He's leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened, he forced his wings into overdrive, determined to overtake the teenager before he departed. The open door, however, permitted a hurricane to sweep into the house, hampering the tiny insect's efforts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't leave me here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced his wings to move more rapidly, shooting in a straight line toward the departing teenaged titan. Most of Tommy's enormous body was already through the door, and one arm that looked like a crane on a major construction project reached back to pull the door closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew faster, skimming over the top of Tommy's enormous head. He escaped his home just as Tommy closed the door, effectively barring any return for the scientist turned winged insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it matter. Mr. Smith had already decided to gamble everything on gaining the teenager's attention. \"Tommy's my only hope,\" he realized with a pang of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world looked big and scary as the tiny bug-man continued to orbit his next-door neighbor like a tiny asteroid making its way around planet-sized Tommy. Getting too close to the unsuspecting, oblivious teenager was foolhardy; letting Tommy get too far away from him also invited another array of perils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he hovered, trying to decide on his next step, a much bigger bug with its own massive wings zipped past the little bug-guy. The wake from its powerful flight buffeted the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Mr. Smith wondered in near panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a mere fly, but it had looked like a flying tank to the tiny, transformed scientist who was not at all certain the horrible monster might not be capable of eating something as small and helpless as his new form left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy left his neighbor's home and walked directly to his bike. He balanced the bike, climbed on and shot onto the street as soon as he got his feet on the pedals. Unknown to him, a tiny gnat had chosen a spot on the sleeve of his T-shirt for the duration of the teenager's journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the tiny gnat-man had no way of knowing where the bike would take Tommy, who had decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The vibration of the wings produced a shrill whine that continued to drive Tommy insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved his fingertip deeper and then withdrew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny bug-man, Tommy's former neighbor, the increasingly frantic efforts by Tommy to remove him only added to the terrifying thought of finding himself trapped in the teenager's ear. He would have screamed had that been possible when Tommy's huge fingertip slammed into the tunnel of the ear canal. The fingertip picked up a thin layer of wax on its journey, so when Tommy withdrew his finger, one tiny, helpless insect came along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright light once the finger exited almost overwhelmed the tiny gnat. Everything had become a monstrous assault on his senses, from nearly being crushed by a digging finger to the rumbling noise produced when Tommy examined the fingertip he lifted toward his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking gross!\" The teenager said as he saw a pale, teeny winged insect adhered to the tip of his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only for a split second. Mr. Smith tried one final time. \"Tom-mee! It's meeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound he succeeded in producing was the faint, shrill buzz from his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy lowered his hand and wiped off the fingertip on the front of his jeans. The rough action destroyed the fragile body of the tiny gnat, but life clung stubbornly as the transformed scientist tumbled onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that Tommy's simple gesture of swiping his fingertip on his denim jeans had almost crushed his tiny body. Three of his wiry legs had been ripped free of his body, and now the wings were so crumpled and mangled that even a buzz from the vibrating was almost impossible to produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to orient himself. He saw the teenager looming over him like an incomprehensible and uncomprehending god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy...\" The scientist struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's no point waiting any longer for Mr. Smith,\" Tommy said aloud and headed toward the back door. His sneaker raised off the floor and then slammed back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe destroyed gnat rested right in the center of the landing zone for the enormous sneaker, which finished the process of completely eradicating any clue of Mr. Smith's existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the body of the tiny gnat had been so tiny and unnoticed that the squishing of the body hadn't even produced so much as a dot of mess to leave behind as evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy left Mr. Smith's house without the slightest inkling of what he had done. In the weeks to come, he did wander about his neighbor's disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had a life and the disappearance of his somewhat strange next-door neighbor didn't cause any lasting disruptions for the oblivious teenager. </span></div></div>",

His teeny insect body was plastered against the huge fabric, kept in check by increasingly intense winds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tooooommmmeeee! It's me!\" He tried to screamed, but found himself immediately silenced by the roaring winds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis still-human head wrinkled in despair - it was no use! Tommy couldn't possibly hear his buzzing voice. He needed to wait for a better opportunity once the giant teenager stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gotta keep myself from being thrown off...\" He realized with a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of what might happen to him if he were to be left alone - a mere bug - in the enormous outdoors was utterly terrifying. Bryan knew his only chance of survival was getting Tommy's attention, no matter what the cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly moments later, the winds subsided and the G-forces pinning him against the thick fabric lessened. Blinking his eyes, Bryan looked out from his fabric haven and saw two arms bigger than skyscrapers clutching a set of huge handlebars. Tommy's massive fingers relaxed, and began to lift away, signaling the teenaged titan's intention to dismount the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan took to the air with a dainty jump from the shifting fabric. His thin wings easily caught the currents, carrying him aloft as he tried to maneuver himself around the moving behemoth that seemed anything but his helpful teenaged neighbour. Tommy's feet thudded heavily on the ground, carrying him a tremendous distance with each step. Bryan fell behind, vainly attempting to keep himself aligned in the titan's wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnat-man fluttered past the teenager's huge hand. It was like banking over the surface of an island, coated with thick tree-sized hairs and sloping terrain. \"Tooommyy!\" Bryan buzzed desperately, his buzzing breath ragged. \"You've got to help meee.\"  Nearing Tommy's moon-sized face, the gnat managed to position his flitting form above the oblivious teenager's nose. It looked like the craggy overhang of a mountain, coated in grease and pores, and emitting explosive blasts of hot air from cavernous nostrils. The tiny transformed man ignored this, focusing his doe-eyed expression upon the eyes of his continental-sized neighbour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me! Mr. Smith!\" The bubbling gnat-man attempted to communicate. \"I've been transformed! Help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a tidal wave of thick flesh, the gargantuan teenager blinked. A sound like a distant crash was audible when each lid connected. Bryan winced at the tremendous scale of his next-door neighbour, but felt overwhelmed with joy when he realized Tommy was looking right at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" His joy was premature and quickly turned sour when a great disturbance approached from his right. \"Oh, no! Tommy, what are yo-...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's enormous hand blasted through the air, crashing through it like an airborne island. The tiny gnat barely avoided it, but was caught in an intense rush of displaced air that thrashed his tiny insect body as if he were caught in a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attempts at regaining control were useless, and he finds himself careening through the air...</span></div></div>",

Even as he tumbled through the air, flung at a dizzying velocity, he figured he would just continue his pursuit for attention after regaining control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem impeded this simple plan, much to his dismay. He couldn't seem to stop his twirling descent, and each time he tried only seemed to make it worse as he was thwarted by strong currents that carried his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered a momentary glance at his destination before impact. Some sort of alien structure that twisted like a gigantic spring amidst gobs of reddish goo. \"What the hell!\" Then he made contact with a wet <i>splat</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnat-man groaned from the impact. Dots of light danced like giddy stars across his vision, making his head feel as though it were still spinning through the open air. He tried to move, but found his body weighed down by a slimy substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy...?\" He muttered, dazed. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very good question. Looking around, Bryan found nothing but more questionable surroundings. Craning high above from a bed of thick goop was the strangest structure he had ever laid eyes upon. Brown with a surface of mottled golden crust and gleaming with grease - it looked like a prop from some 1970s Sci-Fi movie. He also felt overwhelmed by a scent that was remarkably familiar. \"It looks like...\" The entire world tilted suddenly, rocking with terrific force. \"Whatshuh?! Oh, my God!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill aching from the impact, Bryan let out a buzz in surprise as huge towers descended from above. He buzzed louder, realizing they were fingers - huge fingers coated in grease, streaks of ketchup, and salt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan became panicked. The realization of his situation - and his current location - dawning on him. He was in somebodies food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive digits thudded against the curling spire of fried food. A loud crunching, followed by a squishy tear, and the fingers tore away a giant quantity of the structure. It made Bryan think of what steel beams might look and sound like if they could be torn with such ease. Drops of grease large as the tiny gnat-man crashed into the sea of gooey ketchup at random, followed by meteor-sized crumbs that dislodged from the torn chunk as it lifted to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Bryan repeated with dumbstruck awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the digits, each big as a building, carry the rough section of fried food towards a set of lips that looked more like sloped mountains coated with grease and salt. They parted, presenting a city-scape of yellowed teeth that stood before a cavernous interior dripping beads of saliva and expelling a wave of humid air that stank of potato, and condiments. Too much in awe for any type of thought, the transformed man could only watch as a monstrous landmass of pink muscle slid over both towering teeth and lip, revealing a bumpy surface dotted with soggy mounds of food. His attention was so rapt, that he didn't react as huge globules of discoloured saliva fell from the tongue and slammed against the ketchup surrounding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tremendous amount of food is deposited into the huge maw and the moist world inside crashes shut with a dull <i>boom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed loudly, popping back into himself like somebody out of a daydream. He struggled, but focused his efforts on moving his wings to fly free. Flying free had been his intended action, but he found them to be hopelessly mired in the thick ketchup that held him. \"Oh, no! No, no, no!\" The scientist-turned-gnat wriggled, trying vainly to move his legs, but found the same result: he was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe refused to give up. Hearing the booming crash of the giant's chewing high above, Bryan twisted and buzzed ineffectually against the slimy sauce around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely overwhelmed and now tuckered out, Bryan buzzes desperately. \"This is not good!\" He turns his gaze upwards, looking over the huge face that loomed more like an approaching planet than a stranger's face. \"Help me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oblivious behemoth is unaffected by this plea. And, instead, parts his huge lips with a dull smacking squelch, and slides out a huge tongue that rolls over both lips to clean them of any grease and salt. Bryan watches granules of potato and salt fall into a tangle of dark blond hair that grew along the titan's chin like a great cape of jungle draping off a near-vertical cliff. Looking from this gruesome display to the giant's eyes, Bryan sees nothing in their great blueish gaze. In fact, the expression upon this huge guy's face was nearly blank: bored, perhaps somewhat stoic, mixed with stolid indifference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized with a sinking heart, that this monstrous guy was paying utterly no attention to the food he was consuming, and much less to what might be trapped in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers returned again, dropping from above towards another massive section of the fried potato twist. They rived a chunk from the monumental fair food and lowered it towards Bryan's location in the landscape of ketchup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Eeek</i>! No! I'm in here you big fool!\" The tiny gnat buzzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge chunk of food crashed into the sauce. And, guided by the godly fingers, began scraping mass amounts of the red goo onto the park-sized section of potato. Lifting away, the departure was serenaded by the gnat-man's terrified screams. He watched the huge digits raise up, soaring towards the distant lips that parted to accept the massive delivery of fried food. The impassive titan didn't even glance down at the bite as he shoved it into his huge mouth. Bryan screamed up at him, looking from his eyes, to the thick blond brows sporting a dull hunk of metal pierced in one, and then the bill of a gargantuan hat that shaded the entire scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to do something - now! \"Fuck this... I'm gonna be eaten if I don't get the hell out of here!\" The thought of ending up in this strange giant's mouth, mashed into paste, or - god forbid, <i>digested alive</i> - made him shudder. Pressed deeper into the mire of ketchup, Bryan could only buzz in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, the thunderous jaw halted chewing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He demolished the morsel, swallowed, smiled and added, \"AND HUNGRY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN I HAVE ONE?\" Tommy asked, instantly craving the crunchy, savory snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST ONE,\" Joe said, somewhat reluctantly. \"WANT MORE, YOU CAN BUY YOUR OWN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny gnat-man saw Tommy reach into the paper container to draw out one of the spirals of fried potato, he screamed in vain. \"Yes, buy your own,\" the tiny man pleaded. \"I have paid you plenty enough money\u2026.Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy withdrew the potato twist, a drop of ketchup and the mired insect came with it.

He had managed to extract a few of his wiry insect limbs from the sticky ketchup before Tommy remembered he had one last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a little more time,\" the tiny gnat-man pleaded. \"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy tossed the morsel into his open mouth. It landed behind his teeth, so he just used his tongue to move it toward the back of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To-MEEE!\" The tiny man tried to scream. \"Don't swallow me-eeeee\u2026..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy gulped and then tried to wheedle more of his buddy's potato twists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Joe said. \"I told you get your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Tommy walked over to a water fountain and drank heavily, flooding his stomach. He had no idea he was just prolonging the torture for the tiny bug-man he had swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to roam around the park with Joe and, being a ravenous teenager, he eventually shelled out some of the cash he had earned from Mr. Smith to buy some more junk food that he quickly consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had wandered around the park for quite some time when Tommy saw the row of portable restrooms. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I really need one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach had been rumbling for some time. \"Must have been something I ate,\" he said, grinning as he closed the door and made Joe wait for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Following it, judging the intensity of the scent, he found himself hovering over a bowl of fruit on the kitchen counter.

His tired wings managed to permit a landing on the vast yellow surface of a banana skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banana had ripened over the past few days, and upon closer observation, large brown blotches had formed all over the vast peel.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving back at his home, Bryan Smith found himself prone to odd spells of hysterical laughter. He sat down at his kitchen table, thinking back to only a few hours earlier when the table had loomed overhead as a construction of impossible physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed the room and looked down into the sink. He reacted with a jolt of shock when he saw the oddly familiar plate that still contained the remnants of a gnawed chicken wing. He recalled how immense the plate had looked when he ran across it in a desperate attempt to derive some nourishment from the scraps the crowd of Tommy's teenaged friends left behind during their impromptu party in his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw something else that set his heart to pounding and his pulse to racing. He lifted up the tiny shot glass, marveling that the tiny glass had seemed like an immense, inescapable prison when he had been at the mercy of Tommy and his giant friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold chill passed along his spine as the realization dawned on him of how closely he had came to an untimely end at the unaware hands of his enormous teenaged neighbor and his equally colossal friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had he ever convinced himself that shrinking himself down to the size of a bug to mail himself to his nephew was a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter, giddy and nervous, betrayed his nervousness. \"I know what would make me feel better,\" he thought. \"As soon as I can, I will make a trip to see Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the trip would involve a car trip or flight on a plane at normal size. The more he thought about it, the more he convinced himself that he should file away his notes on the shrinking formula and never re-visit the project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything, he decided he needed a good night's rest. First, he stripped off his old work-out clothes and took a long, relaxing hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell asleep soon after going to bed, but his mind remained quite active and haunted by his long, unusual day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slept, he dreamed. In his dream, he found himself back to the insignificant size of a mere quarter-inch tall and trapped again in the shot glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's huge eyes stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, what the heck did you do to yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's booming voice echoed inside the glass chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man fell on his knees, begging the teenager to help him. \"I need this nightmare to end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared at the titan's face, he noticed the smirk that formed on the handsome features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that can be arranged,\" Tommy announced. He tilted his head back and lifted his hand holding the shot glass high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The tiny man cried in apprehension. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, the teenager opened his mouth wide and began to tilt the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he began to slide along the smooth glass surface, the tiny man scrambled to find anything to hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Don't!\" He screamed as he slid toward the lip of the glass. Below, he saw Tommy's open maw, and the teenager's enormous tongue and the dark cavern at the back of the huge throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe produced a strangled scream as he fell, dropping into the open mouth, which then snapped closed, imprisoning him behind rows of teeth, with each tooth much bigger than his entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke in a dark room, quite except for his ragged breathing. \"Oh my god,\" he muttered. \"What a nightmare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lay still, trying to calm himself, the rising morning sun filtered through the enormous windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He snapped to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe windows looked colossal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" He cried, but as the sun began to provide enough illumination for him to see, he realized that he had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis size had dwindled to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stranded on his bed, which now resembled a vast plain of uneven terrain, the tiny scientist felt reality crashing down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the antidote had proved unstable, as he had feared. In many ways, his situation now looked even more dire than originally, when he had at least put some planning into his venture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, totally unprepared, he found himself stripped of all resources, including clothing. With sunshine gradually flooding through a distant window, providing ample illumination, the bug-sized man took a few tentative steps across the bedcovers. Furniture, such as his dresser and a chest of drawers, looked like huge monuments separated by immense gulfs. Closer to the bed, rendered apart by a gulf more than 70 feet wide, stood his nightstand. Even more important, he saw his cellphone resting on the polished surface of the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, the tiny man imagined using the phone to call Tommy to arrange a second rescue. After venturing as close to the edge as possible, however, he had to surrender to reality and let go of the lure of gaining access to his phone. The gap of several inches, translated into more than 70 feet from his current perspective, could not possibly be bridged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gave up one alternative, he remembered the plans to treat Tommy and Joe to dinner as a reward for their assistance. In less than 12 hours, they would arrive as requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to be ready for them,\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat eventuality necessitated getting off the bed and into a more prominent position. As much as he disliked the prospect of having to venture through his colossal home, he realized that the two teenagers would never look for him in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to hope they'll look for me at all,\" he said aloud. He didn't dare put his next thought into words. \"At least they shouldn't mistake me for a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas his optimism justified? Had his earlier encounters with Tommy and Joe rendered them more sensitive and alert to interactions with creatures no bigger than small insects?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe covers of his bed draped over the edge and descended almost to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I got rid of that shag carpet in favor of hardwood floors,\" he said. His former carpet would have swallowed him into a jungle of fibers many times the size of his tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles strained as he began a descent toward the distant floor. In the end, he had to drop the last inch or so, which represented a plunge of almost 25 feet, straight down, to the hardwood floor boards. He landed without incident, although the cold floor sucked the heat from his measly body. He shivered and wished for clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek to the door, which had looked easy from atop his bed, now proved slow going. Between every floor board was a chasm almost 12 feet deep and a body length wide. Leaping from board to board left him exhausted after crossing a span of only three boards. Forced to stop for rest, he stared toward the monolithic and still distant door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repeated the process several times, leaping several boards, resting for a brief time, and then resuming his journey. Finally reaching the door after almost an hour of travel, he found it absurdly easy to exit his room. Although the door was closed, he walked beneath the door with no difficulty at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, the wood floors of the corridor represented the same challenge, but not to the same degree as the bedroom. He reached the end of the corridor in less than half an hour, finding himself on the verge of his gigantic living room where so much of the earlier drama and trauma had taken place after his initial reduction in size to the level of insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee table represented an attractive location for seeking the notice of the giants, but the huge structure, supported on four massive columns, offered no means of ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he remembered he had enjoyed success in reaching the surface of one of the living room end tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end table next to his recliner stood close enough for the plastic leaves of a fake plant to provide a means of getting off the floor and to a higher vantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had managed the feat once, he could do it again. With that in mind, the tiny man began another grueling climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the strenuous climb required a couple of hours. He stopped for several rest breaks, but finally he reached the top. <br>\r\nHe leapt from a massive plastic leaf that didn't even tremble as he walked across its horizontal surface. The leap from the flimsy artificial leaf took him to the surface of the massive end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have, ideally, preferred even closer proximity to the giants. At this location, he would be level with their crotches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for anything he could use to signal to them. Except for a lamp, which looked like some ancient pagoda, the surface of the end table held nothing at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could return to the floor, look for a scrap of paper, and then repeat the climb. That meant another four hours of intensive labor, and he wasn't even certain he would find anything useful. He decided to remain on the round plateau of the tabletop. He entertained the notion that, when they arrived and found him missing, they would be on alert to the possibility that he was once again small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they find me, I'll have to get them to take me to the lab,\" he said. \"Maybe I can still salvage one of my other experimental antidotes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no way to judge time, but he guessed that it was well into the afternoon hours. In four or five hours, his titanic teenaged neighbor and his equally colossal friend would arrive. His body experienced a not unpleasant tingle as he remembered the way they looked as giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't think about that,\" he said. The tiny man resolved to sit quietly and wait...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tiny man resolved to sit quietly and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked slowly away, the tiny little man found himself immensely bored on the barren landscape formed by the surface of the living room end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more bored he got, the more his thoughts strayed to memories of what he had begun to think of as \"Invasion of the Giant Teenagers\" when Tommy and his friends had wandered freely though his home, unaware of the peril their every move represented to a tiny, unseen man only a quarter of an inch tall at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohgod!\" Mr. Smith though as he recalled the immense scale of Tommy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man gave his hard-on a few jerks as he remembered the awe of seeing his giant teenage neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, dismayed at himself, he stopped and tried to cool himself down. His body and mind had thoughts of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself as tiny as a ant on the floor among several pairs of sneakers the size of cruise ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting wildly, he abandoned himself to the rising urgency of his pressing need for release. Laying on his back on the unyielding surface of the table, he kept stroking himself toward release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the trick was the memory of being trapped, helpless and tiny, in a massive shot glass held in Tommy's immense hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exploded with pent-up energy, blowing a load all over his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind blanked out from the climax, he barely registered the sound of his front door opening to admit the giant teenaged form of his next-door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it did dawn on him that he was no longer alone, he was mortified to find himself sticky, messy and naked, with no means of trying to clean himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YO!\" Tommy's loud voice shattered the silence. \"MR. SMITH, ARE YOU HOME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was torn between remaining silent or shouting for the teenager's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, getting no immediate reply, the teenager passed quickly through the living room, entering the kitchen and again bellowing for Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The bug-sized man screamed as loudly as he could. \"Over here! On the table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man threw himself flat on the tabletop as a horrific blast of wind followed in Tommy's hurried wake. Once the storm calmed, he stood again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was bewildered at finding no one home, but then he was about an hour early. He returned to the living room and took his phone out of his pocket. He took a seat in the arm chair next to the end table as he punched in his neighbor's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Tommy and tiny Mr. Smith heard the shrunken man's cell phone ringing from the bedroom. Tommy shrugged, figuring that Mr. Smith had left his phone at home while running an errand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BETTER LEAVE HIM A MESSAGE,\" Tommy said aloud. He waited for Mr. Smith's phone to pick up and for the pre-recorded message to run its course. At the beep, he left a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI, MR. SMITH. IT'S TOMMY. JOE AND I NEED TO TAKE A RAIN CHECK ON THE DINNER INVITATION,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, on the tabletop, the intended recipient of the message, listened to every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DO APPRECIATE IT, BUT YOU DON'T OWE US ANYTHING,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The tiny man screamed. He ran dangerously close to the edge of the table, hoping to make himself heard. \"I've shrunk again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left the message, Tommy ended the call and slid his phone back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, please,\" the tiny man screamed. \"Don't leave! I am here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy got out of the chair, but as he got to his feet, he jostled the edge of the table. He barely nudged the table, but the resulting movement was more than enough to pitch the shrunken scientist over the edge of the precipice. Screaming, the tiny man plunged to the floor in much quicker time than he had needed to reach the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please!\" He screamed. \"Be careful. I've shrunk again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, far from hearing his tiny neighbor's pitiful pleas, dialed up his friend, Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over at Mr. Smith's,\" he explained as he paced in a tight circle. \"No sign of Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Joe said. \"I didn't want to have dinner with some old guy, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sounded critical. \"Don't be like that, dude,\" he said. \"Mr. Smith's an OK guy, and he's not that old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man kept screaming as the massive sneakers dropped all around him. Once, the shoe landed a mere fraction from him. The explosive force as the huge shoe smacked into the titles blew the bug-sized scientist roughly off his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" The little man grunted when he landed on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smelled something horrible and saw that with each step on the clean kitchen tiles, Tommy was tracking something thoroughly unwelcome into the otherwise immaculate kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, what the hell did you step in?\" Mr. Smith yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy seemed to notice his messy footprints at about the same time. \"Oh, hell. I must have stepped in something, and now I've tracked it all over Mr. Smith's floor. He'll kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better clean it up,\" Joe suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding,\" Tommy said. \"Gotta go. See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved the phone into his pocket. \"Wonder if Mr. Smith has a mop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man saw his chance. He started running toward Tommy, crossing into one of the foul-smelling impressions of his gigantic neighbor's sneaker sole. It was the worst possible place to make himself seen. Surrounded by deposits of the stinking dog waste that Tommy had collected on his right shoe, the speck of a man wasn't even visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran through the dirty footprint impressed on the light-colored tile. \"Tommy! Please! Help\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was engulfed in a dark shadow and saw the dirty underside of the enormous shoe headed right toward him. \"Oh sh..\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe smashed down, flattening the bug-sized man in an instant. By then, Tommy had found Mr. Smith's mop. Ten minutes later, the kitchen look spic-and-span again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, carrying the shoes he had now slipped off his feet, reflected that Mr. Smith would appreciate his efforts to keep the kitchen clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where he got to?\" The teenager said idly as he left by the back door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The impact, when it came, rattled him but did no real damage. He scrambled to his feet and looked skyward, trying to track his teenaged neighbor's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy hadn't moved far from the table. In fact, he had taken only a couple of steps, placing him halfway out of the living room via the door providing entry into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the message for Mr. Smith, he had meant to leave. The buzz from his phone vibrating in his pocket stopped him in his tracks. He fished the phone back out of his pocket and flipped it open. He saw that he'd received a text message from his girlfriend, Jessica. Smiling, he prepared to enter a reply to text back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with the sneakers that looked the size of naval destroyers, the frightened little man gazed up at the teenaged titan's towering form. Massive amounts of denim fabric wrapped around Tommy's legs and continued upward toward his waist and butt. From there, a red-and-white striped pullover covered his immense torso. The tight shirt accented quite precisely Tommy's admirable pecs and abs. With his face bent over his phone, the titan provided the unseen shrunken scientist with a good view of his mighty visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had taken off more than a week from work to fully enjoy what he had intended to be a long visit with his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to a string of unfortunate events, his madcap scheme to mail himself to Zack's campus had gone wildly awry. Once Tommy departed, no one was likely to come looking for the tiny man any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than risk being left behind in his home while stuck the size of an ant, the tiny man pushed himself into immediate action. He knew that if he could just gain Tommy's notice, he could salvage the situation that seemed to once again be spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a puny bug, he sprinted with surprising speed across the floor. Against his instincts, he ran in a straight path toward the massive sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, down here!\" He screamed. \"It's me! I'm on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy finished his text message and hit \"send\" to reply to Jessica's earlier one. He kept the phone in his hand and once again made ready to depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom far below on the floor, the shrunken scientist screamed when Tommy's massive body lurched into motion again. An enormous sneaker rose hundreds of feet into the air and stretched forward for hundreds of additional feet as the titan took a single step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneaker landed with a deafening impact that shook the floor and tossed the bug-sized man off his feet. Taking another step, the titan lowered his sneaker only a few mere yards from his tiny neighbor's spot on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second footfall hit just as the little man had been getting back onto his feet. The earth-shaking impact knocked him onto his back. Tommy's other massive leg swung into action, moving forward and propelling Tommy's immense form closer to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the huge sneaker had been almost close enough for him to touch. Then, in a cruel blow, the shoe lifted and continued its thunderous progress across the room, leaving the little man far behind in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized scientist wanted to cry at the way his potential salvation had been ripped from him. By the time he got safely on his feet again, his titanic neighbor had left the room and entered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to surrender, he started running again, even shouting his futile pleas for rescue to a giant who could not possibly discern his feeble squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a long way from the threshold into the kitchen when he heard the kitchen door open and, only second later, slam shut to announce that the quarter-inch-tall scientist was now quite alone in his huge home. </span></div></div>",

His stomach grumbled and his throat felt parched. He had eaten, and he had found a source of water, but neither supply of these necessary items looked dependable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrounging on the kitchen floor, first beneath the massive table supported by four monolithic wooden columns, and then in the dark, dank space beneath the fridge, the bug-sized man found food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the fridge he recovered a peanut, dropped who knows how long ago, and more or less intact. He tried to move the massive legume, but since the peanut was twice his size, he wasn't able to budge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit small chunks from the peanut, which tasted foul and rancid. \"It's probably rotten with filth,\" he told himself, but he told himself it was probably more nutritious than the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, reduced to a speck, he easily located every crumb and dry morsel that had fallen and accumulated beneath his table. Some of the crumbs he could hold in one of his own tiny hands. Others, much like the peanut, were larger than his teeny body and he had to break dry, tough manageable chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater wasn't as easy to locate. He dreamed of climbing the kitchen counter and reaching the distant sink, but knew that even if he could succeed at such an undertaking (no guarantee considering his tiny size) he still faced the impossibility of manipulating faucets as big as buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCondensation of water beneath the fridge had mixed with black gunk and mildew, making the water unpalatable and probably unhealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trek down the long hallway to the bathroom solved his immediate need for water. Drops of cool, if unappetizing, water condensed along the porcelain base of the toilet. He sucked at a droplet of water adhered to the size of the monumental porcelain structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointing aspect of his dilemma rested in the fact the sources of food and water were located distantly apart. The bathroom tiles offered no food, no crumbs, no dropped peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen offered no hope of water for someone the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could eat his fill in the kitchen, but then had to make a trek back to the bathroom that took hours to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his depression, he wondered why it mattered. It wasn't like he had anything better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a few hours of sleep, usually content to curl up and rest wherever he was when his body felt too tired to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed cold, and so far he hadn't managed to find anything that could protect him from the chill and cover his nakedness. The few scraps of paper he found defeated his efforts to even fashion anything similar to a crude toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis life became a grueling routine. He scavenged for food when he awoke and when he filled his belly, he burned all the energy he had just consumed in the long trek to obtain water. Thirst temporarily at bay, he was hungry by the time he returned to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third morning, with a warming sun shining through the window and chasing off the chill as he basked in the glow, he made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life's not worth living like this,\" the former scientist said aloud. \"I've got to take a risk and travel to Tommy's home. He's my last chance of regaining my normal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't feel optimistic. Tommy's mountain-sized home, although located next door to his own, represented a journey of miles through the enormous wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to visit the peanut beneath his fridge again. Even if rancid, the giant legume offered much-needed protein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he faced another challenge. How could he best escape his own house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had already tried the front door. Even for someone reduced to the size of an ant, the door was sealed tight at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back door offered a better prospect, but that door exited into the wild territory of the wide lawn located between the two houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had meant to replace the backdoor to his home, and had even placed the project on a \"to-do\" list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn winter, the crack under the door admitted a cold draft into the home. In summer, insects and other creepy-crawlies used the wide space between the floor and the underside of the door to gain entry into his otherwise immaculate home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing himself on a few more dry crumbs he located on the kitchen floor, the tiny man walked to the back door. The crevice between floor and the bottom of the door loomed larger than closer he approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he walked easily beneath his own door, directly onto the cracked concrete sidewalk that led through the yard to the gate at the fence that curtailed his home away from passersby walking along the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bug-sized man didn't follow the sidewalk. His destination lay in the other direction, on the other side of an immense jungle of grass, weeds and shrubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood on the sidewalk, he saw Tommy's home looming like a distant plateau fixed against the distant horizon. Even from that distance, the home looked immense and made the journey he was about to undertake look even more daunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had meant to get an early start, but by the time he had managed to scavenge enough crumbs for a decent meal the sun had already been rising in the sky for a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was outside in the vast expanse of his own backyard, he felt smaller than ever. He considered reversing course, and running back into the security of his own home. He shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did he have? He could seek out Tommy or face living the rest of his life the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had carried a crumb in one fist, and he nibbled on the stale food as he made his trek into the jungle. The thick canopy of grass blades made him uneasy, so he decided to make his crossing through the barren, brown stretches of the yard in spots where the poor soil managed to nourish only a few scattered weeds that looked as tall as redwoods to a man no more than a quarter-inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPebbles looked the size of boulders, and meant inconvenient detours when he was forced to walk around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had traveled for about an hour when the hot sun beating down on his pale, naked form caused his thirst to return with a vengeance. He swallowed hard with a dry throat and tried to ignore the desire for clear, refreshing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had entered a wide stretch of cracked, baked clay (the remnants of a lake-sized mud puddle that had evaporated in the sun) when a large shadow engulfed him and much of the surrounding terrain in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up in sudden fright and saw...</span></div></div>",

His face was mostly exposed, but his body was tightly bound, the powerful silken webbing held tightly around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man screamed out at the sight of the huge spider's form poised overhead. The grotesque creature looked ravenous, saliva dripping from it's threatening mandibles, and an animalistic glare in the bulging red eyes. His terrified squealing only seemed to excite the creature like the sound of a dinner bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not like this!\" He choked. Bryan couldn't believe he had been saved by Tommy, only to shrink again, and now he was going to be devoured by a garden spider! His body shook uncontrollably, despite the spider's bindings, and his blood seemed to turn to ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's eyes shut tightly as the spider seemed to prepare to dig in. He opened his mouth to let out another yelp, when the spider suddenly retracted. It's entire body seemed to turn to stone, as it appeared to be listening. This onset of inaction by the spider left the tiny scientist motionless despite his terrified predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe web seemed to tremble slightly, as if something else was moving on the sticky surface. What could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost overwhelmed with hunger, and in a fit of hysteria induced by it's prey's fearful squeaks, the spider was just about to devour the helpless creature when something unfamiliar disturbed the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing itself in order to concentrate on the vibrating strands of web, the spider waited. Something large was traversing the complex webbing of the spider's home. This something was quite rude, interrupting a long-awaited meal, the spider noted angrily. The prey seemed to fall still, giving the spider a pinpoint of the invader's point of entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA threatening hiss emitted from the direction before a large form rushed forward. The spider reared itself up as the larger arachnid attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith watched with horrified amazement as the spider that kidnapped him was assaulted by an even larger spider. This invader appeared even more ferocious if possible to Bryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arachnids lunged at each other in an attempt to sink their poison-filled fangs into the opponent. It was like some gladiatorial match between two mythic beasts, which might have interested him, except that he was in the ring with the two monsters. As the two spiders lurched viciously, the webbing tore and began falling apart, causing tiny Bryan great alarm. He tried to concentrate on escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling violently, he began to feel his sticky bindings loosen slightly. He finally caught a frightening break when the larger spider crashed one of it's legs into him, breaking through the webbing  and freeing Bryan's left arm. This sudden luck turned sour as moments later the webbing that precariously supported him gave way, sending him into a free fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan Smith screamed as his half-freed form plummeted and was battered by the leaves below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Branches thicker than trains and streets whipped past him, while leaves both dried and green offered to catch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire experience was akin to a theme park ride. More than once Bryan feared he would splat against one of the huge leaves, or be dashed upon a massive branch, but every time he missed and continued falling. All the while, his tiny body whipped around in violent spins and rotations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just screamed as the rushing winds forced him around once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he met with an abrupt splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accckkk!\" Watered coated him, running over his dirt-stricken face. He spat some out. \"Goddd! Fucking God! Oh, my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggling around, he cursed and splashed in the ankle-high puddle with feverish panic. He still felt as if he was plummeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit... shit, shit, shitting fuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he stopped and released his breath in a deep sigh. It was over. He had landed - alive - and it was over. He had survived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElation washed over the tiny scientist. It was like he had discovered the cure for cancer, or plucked the largest pearl from the ocean floor. He had escaped certain doom at the mandibles of an over-sized spider and lived! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping to his feet, Bryan rubbed his face. The moisture felt delightful and even soothed his numerous cuts and scrapes. Giddily splashing like a child, he sashayed from the puddle to dry ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Where the frilly fuck am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around confirmed his initial fear. He had only fallen seemingly so far to land upon a leaf! To top it off, the \"puddle\" that had broken his descent was nothing more than a collection of morning dew! The green, veiny surface spanned around him for over a dozen feet. It was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more than a damn leaf on that freaking bush in my yard...\" He spoke with disappointed variations in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScampering to the edge, Bryan only confirmed his fears. His current position was still many hundreds of feet above ground. He was effectively trapped unless he could manage to climb down. \"...Or grow a pair of wings! That would be a great addition to my damnable formula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Bryan considered his options.</span></div></div>",

He never liked heights to begin with, but this was just ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be a few hundred feet above the ground\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up into the tangle of dark leaves and branches, he wondered how far he had fallen to get to this point. The thought only made him shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding the firm, yet rubbery surface, he squinted at the tower of hard bark that supported both his leaf and many others. One branch twisted by, careening to the ground like Jack's beanstalk from fairytale. A scurrying highway of black ants went to and fro, climbing and descending the branch busily. Some carried bits of leaf or small insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked back to his own branch. He would need to teeter across the thick stem and hopefully latch upon the rough bark to climb down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this; I <i>can</i> do this...\" He shivered. \"Just remember who you are and what you accomplished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeled, Bryan stepped from the rubbery leaf and unto the hard stem. He nearly lost his balance, barely recovering with a gasp, and hurriedly crossing the span with a leap onto the branches slanted surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down I go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown he went with careful consideration for each placement of hand and foot. He surprised himself how agile he was. Climbing the massive pillar of plant with nary a problem. That was until he placed his foot down upon a dark lump that protruded most conveniently. Without warning, the odd lump hissed at him and shifted. Bryan screeched in response, his foothold moving from under him, forcing him to scrape desperately for another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his hold, he glanced down, wide-eyed and clammy. \"What the hell!\" Below, the rude perpetrator scuttled lazily, nestling itself into a gap of bark. \"Damn bugs - I better watch my step...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsect life existed all around him, all previously beneath his notice before reducing himself, but now buzzing and clicking loudly from every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dared a glance down, desperate to check his progress. Expecting to look down and feel vertigo, he nearly pealed with excitement to see that ground a mere thirty or so feet below. Higher than any normal person would like, but a huge improvement to before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan quickly finished the remaining climb. His confidence nearly bursting with such an impressive display of bravery and athleticism. \"I can't believe I just did that!\" He said, gazing up the looming length he just scaled. The leaves were so thick, it was impossible to determine where he began. Smiling, he turned and looked upon his new surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he released all confidence like a deflating bagpipe. \"Shit... Not out of danger yet,\" Bryan looked around, unsure. \"Where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a rather idyllic scene. Sun trickled in through the many hundreds of leaves, adding a sort of fairy-tale look to Bryan's magnified world. The leaf he stood upon was a vibrant green when lit by the ray of sunlight, and the moisture glittered like crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, of course, had never been much for nature. He rarely ventured outdoors; always refusing to partake in family camping trips with his dad and younger brother. In fact, he vehemently <i>disliked</i> nature and all it offered. Bugs and other creepy crawlies topping the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms, Bryan frowned and looked around. His options were slim: climb or jump down. The latter only happening if he slipped while climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I survive the impossible only to end up here! How can this get any worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCliches always rise to the challenge, and just as the words left his sour lips, he found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst came a gale of turbulent wind. Then, roaring and buzzing loud enough to make a jet engine envious. Bryan screeched in terror at the sight of such a huge insect. It swept through the labyrinth of leaves and headed directly for his leaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill screaming, Bryan curled himself up, hoping the earthquake position worked against giant bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive creature landed. Each hair-coated leg landing with surprising grace upon the rubbery surface. Ignoring the balled-up scientist, the common fly skittered towards the pool of dew water and extended a long, greasy tube into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan poked his head out from under his arms and watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge fly was nothing short of hideous. Bulging, glassy, crystalline eyes. Hardened opalescent body armour coated with dark hairs and shining with grease. Bryan couldn't help but pinch his face in disgust. He hated bugs, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bug in particular could care less about him. It merely slurped away at the collection of dew, twitching and adjusting a pair of translucent wings that looked larger than a six lane road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second... <i>Wings</i>!\" Bryan whispered excitedly. \"It works in the movies; why not for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the idea was more than crazy, but it seemed viable in comparison to climbing hundreds of feet down the branches of a bush. Commandeering this mindless insect, he could just <i>fly</i> down - Brilliant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot allowing himself to over think, Bryan jumped up and sped towards the drinking fly. It didn't even react as he approached. Something as tiny as Bryan was no threat to the garage-sized bug. Pausing next to a dark, segmented leg, Bryan stared with widened eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe propelled himself an impressive distance and latched onto the upper section of the prickly leg. Immediately, he felt the sharp hairs lock onto his clothing like Velcro. He let out a wild yip, feeling the humongous creature begin to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gigantic fly trundled backwards, wings stretching, and took to the air. </span></div></div>",

Miraculously, Bryan's face was spared, giving the minute man a heart-stopping view of the spider's menacing mandibles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits of what Bryan thought to be saliva dripped from the hungry spider's mouth. His pathetic struggles seemed to only excite the fearsome creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to die like this!\" He yelped as a disgusting hairy leg pulled him closer to the large, gnawing mandibles. The tiny mans arms seemed to loosen a bit, but he was unable to break the thick silk that was swaddled around him. Closing his eyes tightly, he prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was clear and a pleasant breeze made this Saturday afternoon an almost perfect day. Michael Duggan adjusted his baseball cap slightly as he surveyed his progress. The large Alpine Currant hedge that separated Mike's yard from his neighbor Bryan's was a beast of intruding branches. His wife had been hinting that he needed to trim the overgrown plant, and to avoid any bothersome conflict, Mike pulled out a pair of shears from the shed that morning and set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidered a very nice, likable guy, Michael moved in to the neighborhood only a year before with his family. A Navy man, the 26 year old and his wife decided to re-locate out of their apartment when their son was born. Tall, and well-built, he quickly became known around the neighborhood as the go-to guy when something stopped working, or needed moving. Bryan often made use of Mike's help whenever Tommy was unavailable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen off-duty, Mike dressed casually. He wore a light grey t-shirt his brother had bought him a year ago, on the front it said, \"New Dad 2012\". Denim jeans, and a pair of Vans high-top sneakers made up the rest of his attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting through the tangling branches of the bush, Mike was utterly unaware of the havoc he was causing to the small occupants of the bush. He paused for a moment when he heard a tiny shriek after felling a large branch. Shrugging, he lifted the tool again to cut the next branch, when he noticed a small spider on his forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight grin, he brushed the spider off and didn't give it a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sound, followed by a distant crash caused the tiny man and his arachnid captor to jump with surprise. Another was heard, and sounded closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider had rotated itself towards the ruckus in preparation for a battle with this unknown entity, while tiny Bryan lay swaddled in the same position. The shrunken scientist didn't have long to lay still as a huge rusted blade burst through the surrounding leaves with a crash. From his position, he was able to watch in horror as a second blade made itself known, and the two came together crushing the supporting branch with unfathomable strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute man felt the web breaking apart beneath him as his entire world went topsy-turvy. His little voice rang out with a screech as he fell, catching a glimpse of the large spider lunging in an unknown direction. Bryan collided with a pool-sized leaf, and roughly slid down, sharp sticks cutting him from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it's home fell, the angry spider reacted quickly and propelled itself off a leaf towards the destroyer of it's home. Landing on an alien landscape cluttered with rope-like hairs, the spider attempted to attack this threatening being, until a huge shadow came overhead, and a massive force threw the spider down to the grassy forest below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruises and cuts all over, the tiny genius pulled himself loose from the torn silken bindings. Rubbing his tear-stricken eyes, Bryan tried to get his bearings after his most recent ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" He thought out loud. Surrounded by tall blades of grass, and huge broken branches, the shrunken man felt a sigh of relief that he didn't endd up as spider chow. His entire body shuddered at the memory of the Hellish mandibles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy explosive force thudded behind him, the concussion knocking him flat on his face. The tiny scientist craned his head back as he took in the awe-inspiring sight of an enormous sneaker. Its thick, white sole was stained with dirt and grass from stomping around on the lawn. Bryan whimpered and covered his head as the huge footwear lifted again and soared overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground lurched once more throwing the tiny man off kilter. The gigantic sneaker had stepped further away, sparing the frightened scientist. Bryan craned his head and took in the awesome sight, following the titan's colossal form. A spark of recognition brightened in the little man's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike!\" Cried the puny voice. His gargantuan neighbor's form loomed massively in the distance, causing everything else to seem small. Bryan looked watery-eyed, knowing that he could trust the helpful Mike to rescue him, forgetting his close call with the giant's sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sprinted hopefully toward the huge titan, his only plan that Mike would surely notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need help!\" Bryan's shrill voice whined. \"I can't possibly keep up...\" He mumbled, looking sadly at the looming figure in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding forest of grass resembled a prehistoric jungle to the bug-sized man. This comparison wasn't too far off, since the inhabitants of this jungle would easily challenge any dinosaur in size and power. All this without mention of the enormous Michael stomping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge branches and leaves cut from the bush littered the landscape, and hindered the little man's progress even further. He saw a menagerie of insects recovering from the disaster caused by the shears. As he pulled himself over a particularly large log, Bryan felt as if he was being watched. A feeling he had felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above a large shape descended, landing with a heavy plop before him. It was the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset over the destruction of it's home, and injured from the fall from the giant man's arm, the spider was determined to gain some satisfaction by eating it's escaped prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not again!\" He screamed, and fled at full-speed away from the fearsome monster. A quick glance behind him showed the spider in furious pursuit. It's injured leg causing it to move in an irregular fashion. The tiny scientist was able to keep a slight lead running from the injured spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline coarsing through his little veins, Bryan ran for what seemed like hours. He saw what looked to be a clearing up ahead, and closed his eyes as he burst through the clustered foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling forward, he barely stopped himself from falling on his face. The clearing was about the size of a football field, and to his despair, cluttered with ants. A heavy noise brought his attention back to the pursuing spider which had just arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping the ants would protect him, the little genius ran towards the center of the clearing. Bryan looked back to see the spider reluctantly not pursuing. With a rush of  triumphant relief Bryan shouted back to the spider, \"Giving up? Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's smirk faded as a huge shadow encompassed the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nearby, his father Michael continued trimming the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stumbled through the grass, Austin discovered to his delight a busy ant hill. The invasive ants had killed off a small circle of grass in order to build their empire. The toddler giggled as he poked at the crawling insects, his little mind curious if they would react in any particular way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith big eyes he held his pudgy hand up, three angry ants crawling on it. Before the child could emit another excited giggle, the ants reacted in a way Austin did not expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing up, Bryan swallowed hard with surprise. Austin, the bundle of joy that he had playfully tickled, and \"talked\" to during one of Mike's barbecues, was now the size of a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge toddler no longer seemed cute, or even annoying, but now appeared downright dangerous. Austin dug his building-sized hand into the ground, apparently trying to \"play\" with the ants. The tiny man was sure getting this monster child's attention would not end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin crashed his fat hand nearby, causing tiny Bryan to fall over. He watched as the toddler raised his hand, carrying three furious-looking ants. The child didn't seem to understand, Bryan thought, before the inevitable happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud shriek rang out causing the pre-occupied Michael to turn around. Dropping his shears, the tall man rushed to the bawling toddler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Buddy. What happened?\" He said, patting the kid's head. He planted his huge foot right on the edge of the ant hill, crushing some ants underneath without noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disturbed child thrust his injured hand up, and pointed at the helpless ants indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist covered his ears in desparation as the giant toddler screeched. He glared up at the dangerous, yet revoltingly annoying child as the ear-splitting cry ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant heavy boom accompanied by tremors caught Bryan's attention suddenly. Followed by another, and another. An impossibly large shadow covered the area, and Bryan was roughly knocked to the ground as a mountian-sized sneaker crashed down on the other end of the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, BUDDY. WHAT HAPPENED?\" Thundered Mike's deep voice from above. Mike's massive Vans skate shoe crushed part of the now tiny looking ant hill, and numerous ants with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning his tiny head back, the little man looked in awe at the huge form looming directly over him. The dusty jean-clad legs seemed to stretched endlessly until met by the huge bulky torso. Bryan couldn't believe that he was able to interact with this titan normally before. Mike seemed less friendly, and more like a huge, un-forgiving titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, indignant grunt signaled Austin informing his huge father of the guilty ants. Bryan watched Mike's face look toward the ground, raising his thick eyebrows inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANTS? CRAP, I JUST SPRAYED A WEEK AGO\" Mike's huge voice thundered to the tiny man's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lept from his fallen position, and desperately waved his arms in vain. \"Mike! It's me Bryan Smith! Help!\" His voice felt shrill and small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man noticed a small form scaling the heel of the colossal shoe. The displaced spider crawled up the dirty white sole, and was making it's way to the hem of the huge denim jeans when Mike suddenly shifted his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back to the ground at the heel of the gigantic sneaker, the spider had barely a second before the footwear lifted slightly, and crushed the spider under it's immeasurable weight. Mike took no notice of the insignificant creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this, Bryan couldn't help feeling a pang of sympathy for the determined arachnid. Bryan knew that just as easy, he could end up the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen in fear, the little man braced himself for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike leans down and scoops up Austin. Looking at the ant hill he frowns and mutters \"I guess I'll spray again!\". He turns toward the house, brushing Austin's hand and trying to comfort the unhappy boy. He enters the garage and pushes through a door leading to the kitchen. From there he walks through and places Austin into his playpen in front of the TV. \"Just stay here buddy, while I get the mean ants!\" Mike coos to Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks back through the kitchen he notices the footsteps of dirt he had tracked inside. \"Shit, I'll get that in a sec.\" he promises to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the garage he approaches a shelf and picks up the can he had used before. He puts it down when he sees a can of maximum strength stuff his neighbor Bryan had given him as a thanks for fixing something Mike couldn't remember. Mike had saved it just in case, and now was the perfect time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds the can in his hand and heads back to the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had already been amazed by the mountainous toddler. Mike completely dwarfed him. Mike had already easily been a head taller than Bryan at 6'2\", but now his height was beyond compare. He watches as the man bends down to his son. He easily scoops the large child into his arms, lifting him above the ground. He looks down with a grunt and mutters \"I GUESS I'LL SPRAY AGAIN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot lifts away raining dust, blades of grass, and smashed ants onto the hill. His foot flies directly above Bryan, his filthy sole crammed with dirt and unfortunate bugs who had crossed his path as he worked, crushed into oblivion without being noticed. Bryan watches as his view of Mike slowly disappears, the loud stomps fading as he walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around at the ants who will soon be writhing in pain from the spray. Bryan slowly retreats back to the grass trying to get as much distance from the anthill as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike walks swiftly through the grass. He stops about 3 feet from the ant hill and looks at the can in his hand. The stuff supposedly trickles into the dirt to get to the ants underground. Mike smiles, it sounds perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps forward, shakes the can, and starts spraying. The stuff douses the ground at his feet and he sees the ants struggle in the thick spray. When the smell starts to get to him he stops and admires his handy work. He decides to destroy any progress they had and lifts his foot over the anthill. He stomps onto it and it collapses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike turns around and takes a couple steps before stopping and realizing ants rarely have one entrance. He slowly scans his yard for anymore bare spots or protruding hills. Not seeing any after a minute, returns to his house satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan doesn't get far before Mike returns. The giant stomps past, not too far from the tiny man. Bryan stares at his titanic neighbor as he contemplates the can in his hand. From this raised part of the lawn, the shrunken scientist can see the clearing and ant hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hears a loud clicking as Mike shakes the can in his hand and begins to spray. A thick cloud of deadly chemicals descends onto the clearing and Bryan watches the ants that had seemed so large to him begin to die. He walks away slowly, unable to tear his eyes away. Mere minutes ago he had been right there! He is chilled by the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spray stops but Mike doesn't step away. His foot suddenly rises and crashes down onto the ant hill. What had appeared to be an immovable part of the landscape to Bryan crumbles easily under Mike's weight. His shoe lifts away and Mike turns away from the carnage, his mission successful. In a single step Mike halves the distance between himself and Tiny Bryan. His second step flattens the tree-like grass blades just in front of Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cries out, falling over in shock. He whimpers and looks up, believing he has been mistaken for a bug. However Mike is staring into the distance, slowly turning his head. The gigantic man hadn't even noticed Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stares at the wall of rubber in front of him. Grass stains and dirt cake the sides of the sole that easily crushed through the forest of grass Bryan was currently trapped in. If he wants Mike's help he realizes he must take advantage of the standstill and start climbing. On the other hand Mike is a terrifying giant who could just as easily be Bryan's doom rather than his salvation.</span></div></div>",

He sees his wife there clearly unhappy. \"What the hell Mike?\" she says pointing at his footprints across the kitchen. \"It's even in the living room, aren't you paying attention?\" Mike starts to step towards her when she lets out a noise of irritation. He looks down at his filthy sneakers and quickly kicks them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks to her and holds her in his arms. \"Sorry baby, I got into a rush. I'll clean it up, I promise.\" His wife, Ella, softens at his touch. She knows when Mike makes a promise he will follow through. \"Okay\" she murmurs. \"I'm sorry for yelling\" she adds guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shrugs \"You gotta get after a big, messy oaf like me!\" he says smiling. Ella kisses him briefly. \"I have to go right now, I'm taking Austin to Mary's so he can play with David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay have fun!\" Mike follows Ella into the living room where she picks up a now giggling Austin. \"Bye big boy!\" Mike says, letting Austin grab and shake his finger. He waves at his wife and son as they depart through the front door.He heads back to the kitchen and looks out the window over looking the yard. He sees the shears he had dropped still waiting on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had forgotten them because of the ants. Out of coincidence he had pretty much finished trimming just as Austin had cried out. He walks over to his shoes, slips them back on and heads out to retrieve the shears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan climbs up the shoe and manages to sink his arms into the thick thread of a hanging shoelace. Mike begins walking, his shoelace whipping back. Bryan screams as the world goes by in a blur before becoming visible again with a thundering stomp. Then everything is a blur again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape slowly changes but Bryan quickly becomes nauseous from the violent, jarring movement. Finally he is granted a reprieve as the giant man halts. Bryan looks around and sees Mike has (thankfully) gone inside. A towering woman stands a few feet from Mike, although her height is no competition for his. She yells something that Bryan's jumbled mind fails to process. Before he knows it the shoes he is on are kicked away and he hits the floor and is knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wakes a minute later to see the giant couple strolling out of the kitchen. As the sound of their footsteps fade he scans the kitchen for some kind of advantage but stops when he sees what is in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's sneaker is on its side giving Bryan a full view of what had nearly ended his life. Dirt is packed between the lines of tread, bits of grass protruding from it. Mangled ant bodies hang loosely without the pressure of the ground pushing them into the shoe. The spider that Mike had failed to notice is at the heel, shaped into the tread of the shoe. That thing mere minutes ago had been alive, dangerous, and pursuing Bryan. But Mike's careless step had ended its life and he hadn't even noticed. Bryan can only hope he doesn't end p the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hears a slam in the distance and stomps nearing. He rushes away from the terrifying footwear as Mike reenters the room. His eyes are anywhere but on the floor and Bryan knows it won't be an easy feat to get Mike's attention. The gigantic man stomps up to his shoes, rights them and slips his long feet into them. In a second the massive man is out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tries to hatch a plan in the giant's absence. He looks around the room. Counters line the opposite wall, towering high above. Closer is the dining table that looks to have a pattern on its legs. Perhaps he could scale it. Mike would definitely never see him on the floor. On the other hand better opportunities may lie in the living room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike walks swiftly through the grass towards the shears. Unnoticed below, his long feet flatten the grass and end the lives of hapless pill bugs and ants exploring his yard. Mike snatches up the shears but hears a snap as he turns to leave. A branch had broken in half where he had stepped on it. Mike decides he ought to pick them up before he does anything inside. He returns to the garage and places the shears on a shelf high off the ground, safely out of Austin's reach. Mike then grabs a pair of gloves and a garbage bag. Without wasting another moment he returns to the line of hedges and begins picking up the largest pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decides he wants this nightmare to end as soon as possible. The table is his nearest source of sure salvation. The living room is a far off mystery, and nothing else seems like a viable option. Besides he has no idea how much time he has before Mike returns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan crosses the kitchen staring in awe around the bright room. The white linoleum floor stretches ahead of him, its patterns and occasional dents like ditches and valleys to the minuscule man. The dining table and chairs are unnatural plateaus that tower high above. In the distance the kitchen counters and refrigerator are a backdrop like perfectly square mountains. However Bryan has little appreciation for the scenery and decorating skills of Ella Duggan. No, he is very focused on getting straight to the table as he has equated it with rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity (but was more like 10 minutes) Bryan reaches the nearest leg of the towering dark wood table. Up close he can see that a combination of carved pattern and normally unnoticeable nicks in the wood make a very climbable cliff. Along with the leg connecting to the tabletop in a tapering slope, it would be relatively easy to mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his early days as a scientist Bryan had been interested in geology and had spent some time rock climbing and the such. So he drew on his knowledge and very out of practice body to climb the table as quickly and easily as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike dropped the bulging bag next to the garbage can. Looking back at the hedges, only the smallest of branches remain. Mike smiles deciding it to be a job well done. His footsteps echo slightly around the garage and Mike stops at the step leading inside. He kicks the filthy sneakers off, not noticing the dirt caked to the soles and the bug remains trapped in the tread. Pushing through the door into the kitchen his gaze falls onto the footprints Ella had been so unhappy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really didn't feel like getting to them, but he knew that if he put it off, he wouldn't get it finished before Ella came back. He leans backwards through the door into the garage and grabs the broom. He quickly sweeps around the kitchen, unaware of how much dirt he is missing. Mike was never much good at cleaning, he's more of a handy man. Ella however would be happy enough with the effort and would be able to touch it up later. He returns to the broom to the garage and moves to the living room where he vacuums up the last traces of his careless steps inside. He sighs as he returns the vacuum to its normal place under the stairs, happy to have finished his chores for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the clock he sees he still has some time before the college football game will air. And he has to watch that. Not only because he is an avid fan, but because his younger brother plays on the team and while Mike couldn't be there in person to cheer, the absolute least he could was tune in on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan drags himself up the slope leading to the table and collapses on to the flat surface. He breathes heavily, so thankful to finally be horizontal again. He knows that a combination of determination and adrenaline is what barely got him up the table. He is exhausted and knows he will feel it in the morning. Hopefully in that morning he will be back to normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks back to Mike as he rests. The giant man had returned when Bryan had been about three quarters of the way up. He watched his incredibly tall neighbor sweep the kitchen swiftly. His socked feet had roamed the floor at random, making Bryan all the more thankful to be safely off the floor. He left the kitchen and as Bryan finished up his climb the whine of a vacuum cleaner drifted in from the living room. Bryan was unable to stifle the nervous shiver the sound brought to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better Bryan sits up and scans the table top. The flat surface stretches away from him, the towering forms of the salt and pepper shakers as well as a napkin holder visible on the other side of the table. A few errant crumbs are scattered about, unseen leftovers from previous meals. Here and there, small cracks have opened up in the wood, posing a danger that the tiny scientist will have to watch for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan hears Mike before he sees him. The giant stomps through the archway from the living room and approaches the mountainous fridge. Bryan gasps lightly when he realizes that Mike stands higher than the fridge, his clean cut blond hair just above the top of the fridge. The man swings the door open easily and holds a can of beer in his hands. Mike raises the can to his lips and the sound of slurping liquid is heard briefly. His blue eyes scan the kitchen while his massive hand scratches his chin. Bryan half-heartedly waves his arms with a shout, knowing that Mike will not see him from his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike returns to the kitchen to grab a beer. He slams the fridge shut, pops the can open, and sips in the cool liquid. While refreshing, it reminds him how hungry he is. After getting Austin up and ready, trimming the bushes, and cleaning Mike's simple egg and toast breakfast is long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the stubble on his chin Mike stares at the wall absently. On one hand he'd like to order some pizza and wings for tradition's sake. On the other hand, money wasn't growing on trees lately and every purchase was heavily scrutinized. It might be better to just make something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike sighs. As good as pizza and wings sounded he knew the right thing to do would be to just make something. He digs through the cabinets and sees two bags of nacho chips. \"Perfect\" he thinks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs one bag and dumps some chips onto a plate. Before continuing he remembers how much more fun watching a game is with someone else. He had already called his buddies Eric and Jake, neither of whom were likely to come. Mike decides he could try calling his neighbor Bryan. The guy was a little weird and Mike didn't know him too well. But he was friendly enough; maybe he would make good company for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike walks away from the plate of nachos and grabs the phone. He dials the number from the paper where Ella has all the neighbors listed. After a few rings he gets an answering machine. \"Hello this is Bryan Smith. Sorry I didn't answer, leave a message if you need to!\" A beep gives Mike's cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bryan, it's Mike next door. Just wanted to see if you were interested in watching a game over some nachos and beer. You can head over if you get this later. Just thought I'd offer, see ya around.\" he says casually. With a click the phone returns to its holder and Mike crosses the kitchen to the nachos. He sprinkles shredded cheese and scatters leftover ground beef over the pile of nachos. Popping the plate into the microwave to warm it up he turns to search the fridge for some salsa and sour cream to add to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locates the jars just as the microwave beeps from behind him. Mike places the jars on the table and retrieves the warm plate from the microwave. After dumping a generous amount of salsa onto the nachos while going easy on the sour cream, Mike puts everything away and admires the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth watering, Mike grabs a mostly bare chip and tries to use it to scoop up the mix of toppings. Instead he pushes a lump of stringy cheese and meat off the plate. Unwilling to waste a bite, Mike pinches the chunk and drops it near the center of the plate. He picks up the plate, grabs his beer, and moves to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stands up as Mike turns his back to the table, digging through the cabinets. He uses his incredibly long arms to grab something from the top shelf. Bryan admires with slight jealousy the rippling muscles in Mike's arms, all the more noticeable at this diminished size. The giant places a bag on the table, down a ways from Bryan. Bryan continues to watch as the titan moves about the kitchen with ease. Mike returns with a stadium sized plate that crashes onto the counter with a thud, shaking the surface under Bryan's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quake knocks Bryan over as he watches Mike easily tear open the massive bag and dump some of its contents onto the plate. All the activity and movement of his mountainous neighbor is unnerving for tiny Bryan and he is relieved when Mike seems to think again, his movement halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe abruptly walks away from the counter and makes a call on the phone. Bryan uses this break to approach the plate, since he is more likely to be seen where Mike actually is. Mike's voice suddenly erupts across the kitchen, HEY BRYAN, IT'S MIKE NEXT DOOR. JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN WATCHING A GAME OVER SOME NACHOS AND BEER.YOU CAN HEAD OVER IF YOU GET THIS LATER. JUST THOUGHT I'D OFFER, SEE YA AROUND.\" his deep voice boomed across the room. Bryan smiled in spite of himself. How nice of Mike to invite him. In normal circumstances he would have been interested. However at the moment it was terribly ironic since Bryan was already in Mike's home and so far hadn't been treated like a welcome guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bryan was lost in his thoughts, Mike had pulled cheese and beef out of the fridge and was spreading them over the nachos. Bryan stared awestruck as Mike's hand easily scooped up the plate with its mountain of nachos. It soared upwards without any effort from Mike. A slam and beeping indicated the use of a microwave and he could see Mike bend over to search the fridge. Bryan sighed and watched Mike, waiting for an opportunity to present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screeching beep echoed across the room, hurting tiny Bryan's ears. His hands to his head, Bryan observed the arrival of two towers and then the return of the plate, now steaming. He watched as the giant dumped thousands of gallons worth of salsa and less so of the sour cream onto the mound. This mountain of food seemed so excessive to Bryan and yet was merely a single serving for the titanic Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike stared at the plate for a moment, a glint in his blue eyes. Hoping this was his chance Bryan jumped up and down waving his arms and shouting \"Help me Mike! Right here! Help!\" Mike's arm extended forwarded and Bryan cheered. However his fingers grasped something on the plate above Bryan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Right here!\" Bryan shouted indignantly, disappointment flooding his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a massive and warm weight crashed into him. Struggling against it proved useless. He felt the weight shift rapidly and spin. Bryan was stuck fast and moved with it. With a sudden drop his movement halted and Bryan now felt like he was laying on his side. As the world seemed to rock and shift, Bryan realized with dread where he was.The strong smell of salsa, beef and cheese was assailing his nostrils. He now lay sideways, stuck in Mike's nachos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thud his world stopped as Mike set the plate on the coffee table.</span></div></div>",

Looking up he can see Mike towering far above, a remote in hand, staring straight ahead. He collapses backwards, undoubtedly into a comfortable chair. The walls and ceiling become a blur as Bryan feels the plate move again. It settles in Mike's lap, his torso towering above. Bryan continues to struggle as the sounds of the game fill the room and light flickers across Mike's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, rough fingers appear from the side and pull a nacho away. Bryan shouts in panic as the cheese stretches and finally breaks. Mike lifts the nacho to his mouth above. Bryan cringes as a loud crunch sounds from above followed by a groan of satisfaction and then the muted crunching of chewing. Bryan struggles harder and manages to free his arm and upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares up at Mike's face. \"HELP ME!\" he begs, waving his arms. Sound booms from the TV drowning out any shouts Bryan makes, and it doesn't sound like it will let up anytime soon. He can't help but feel like he's in a nightmare. The dangerous situation is made worse by the painfully loud sound, and surreal light flashing from the TV. Bryan is struggling to keep himself from completely losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter switching to the right channel, Mike flops into his recliner. He moves the plate to his lap and stares at the TV. Cheers of fans and music from the band fill the room as the camera pans around the stadium. \"Wow, that stadium is huge.\" Mike thinks to himself, unaware of gigantic he seems to his shrunken neighbor. Without looking down he snatches a nacho and brings it to his mouth. As he closes his mouth around the chip and the flavors mix together, Mike closes his eyes. \"Mmmmmmmm!\" he moans happily. This was the start of a good game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intro goes by and Mike absently picks at the chips mostly around the edge of the plate. He wants to save the best chips for when he gets really into the game, eating those chips while he stresses about his brother's team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan soon discovers that though he had freed his upper body, his legs had sunken deep into the cheese which had cooled and thickened. All his struggles had no effect. Mike pulls chips away from the edges of the plate as if to torture Bryan with the sound of crunching and swallowing as he watches more and more nachos get devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan however has not given up. He knows that his main hope lies with getting Mike's attention and he will not give up. There is no way a genius like him would leave the world in a plate of nachos over a football game. The sentence sounded so ridiculous that Bryan let out a manic laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up at Mike's face again while continuing to struggle. Occasionally he waved his arms and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's expression changed from blank to more intense as the actual game started. When Mike leaned forward, Bryan was slightly mystified by how focused Mike was on the game. This was bad for Bryan since he was less likely to notice other things. But of course Bryan would get Mike's attention. Certainly, no one could eat another person without noticing, no matter how small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike however remained focused on the game, his hand now reaching dangerously into the middle of the plate. Bryan eventually tired and, realizing his movement was doing nothing, decided to preserve his energy. Mike lifted chip after chip, some stuck together in groups, to his open mouth clearly enjoying every bite of the cheesy, meaty nachos and salsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shrieked in terror when the inevitable happened: Mike's long fingers, bits of meat and cheese clinging to the tips, grasped his chip. The chip next to his rose as well, connected by a string of cheese.\"NOOOOO!!!\" Bryan wailed in terror as Mike lifted the nachos upwards. He struggles to move, but as before is stuck in place. The nacho stops even with Mike's lips, framed by well-trimmed stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIKE! PLEASE DON'T EAT ME\" Bryan pleads. His gargantuan neighbor takes no notice of the shrunken scientist trapped in the nachos. Mike senses the nacho hanging by a strand of cheese and he lifts the nachos over his mouth and leans his head back. His lips part and his tongue stretches forward, emerging like a monster from a cave. Bryan can see crumbs of chewed nachos, strings of cheese, and mounds of beef scattered across the long tongue. A strand of saliva stretches from his upper molars to his tongue and snaps as the tongue extends forward. Bryan tears his eyes from the terrible scene and stares past Mike's defined nose towards his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike through all this never moves his eyes off the screen, utterly unaware of the drama unfolding in his meal. His mind is barely on the nachos; he is much more focused on his brother's team since they currently have the ball. Oblivious to the terror of his tiny neighbor trapped in his food, Mike lowers the hanging chip into his mouth. His jaw shuts quickly and severs through the cheese. Loud crunching drowns out the sound of the TV as Mike chews the nacho just in front of Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few crunches Mike's mouth opens again. Behind his perfectly straight white teeth lies a scene of destruction. Half chewed nacho chips lay in mounds between the molars, surrounded by soggy salsa and beef. Strands of cheese stretch between the sets of large molars, and the light from the TV illuminates Mike's uvula as well as a couple soggy bits of food stuck around his throat. Mike unconsciously moves his tongue slightly forward in anticipation of the incoming bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobbing uncontrollably, Bryan realizes that he is utterly out of options. A wall of stench and humidity hits him as he enters the mouth with the chip. From the roof of the mouth a chunk of chewed nacho falls and abruptly knocks him out just before the teeth shut around the chip in an ear-shattering crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike absently pushes the chip into his mouth. Ignorant of the tiny addition on this last nacho Mike chews his food without a thought. When his brother's team scores he cheers happily, light flooding the interior of his mouth. But Mike is the only one there and no one sees the soggy, chewed piles of nachos spread across his mouth, framed by strands of thick saliva. Satisfied with the game Mike moves the food to the back of his mouth and swallows. Bryan's unconscious body however stays stuck to his tongue, no different from the other unnoticed crumbs of food stuck to Mike's tongue. As Mike lifts another nacho to his mouth, his tongue extends, Bryan's tiny body in the light one last time, nestled in a small pile of soggy corn chip. None the wiser, Mike bites down and swiftly chews the nacho. In the chaos Bryan's body is further beaten, but he doesn't awaken. Mike swallows, his bobbing Adam's apple signaling the passing of food, as well as the shrunken Bryan Smith, into his esophagus. Mike however gives no thought to his digestion system or the mounds of food he is sending into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splat, Bryan's body lands roughly on a soggy mountain of chewed nachos. Mike reaches for his drink and lifts it to his lips. A rush of beer clears the remaining bits of food from his mouth and it all goes cascading down his throat. The incoming liquid levels the mountain of food in a violent wave, but Mike is completely oblivious to the storm in his gut. He smiles as he puts his beer back down, enjoying the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike easily devours the entire plate of nachos, a fairly small portion for him. Bryan's body is quickly buried in layers of chewed nachos, saturated by beer. He never awakes as Mike eats and cheers on his brother's team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere hours later Mike sits with an empty plate and a full stomach, happy to see his brother win. The door opens and Mike turns his head. Ella walks inside holding a smiling Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little man!\" Mike calls out as he stands up and walks over to his wife and son. He doesn't feel the food shift inside his stomach as he moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at him and says \"He had fun with David! And momma had fun with Mary\" while bouncing her toddler son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he missed Luke's game! They won little man! It was a really good game!\" Mike says, leaning towards a giggling Austin. Ella looked towards the TV. \"Well I see you won't be needing dinner\" she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a couple hours and my gut will clear some space!\" Mike declares, patting his stomach. Coincidentally, Mike's stomach begins to secrete acid at that moment. He doesn't realize it's happening but inside his toned body Mike begins to digest the nachos, and digest tiny Bryan Smith, to make that promise true.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stomping through the grass, Mike leaned down and snatched the errant shears up with his large hand. A quick surveying glance confirms that the bush is properly tamed, its invasive branches no longer protruding into his yard. Looking at the ground, Mike noted that he needed to pick up the cut branches and leaves that surrounded the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike prepared to return to his garage, unaware of the danger he posed by just walking through his lawn. The short inch-tall grass was easily flattened under his large sneakers, along with many unlucky insects. Forgetting that he closed the garage door when he let Austin out, he bounded up the porch to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed at the idea of having to take his shoes off, preferring to keep them on since he was always on the move, he roughly wiped his shoes on the welcome mat, the stiff fibers scraping the dirt, torn grass, and the remains of a tiny spider from his heavy treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few scrapes later, Mike smiled, determining his feet clean enough to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of his trusted neighbor Mike killing an entire community of ants without a second thought caused the tiny man to shudder. He knew that had he lingered, he would of been included in the deadly toxic spray. Never before had he felt sympathy for insects, but now, being the size of one, the tiny man could appreciate their plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure Mike would help if he knew of his tiny neighbor's situation, the only issue was getting the gigantic guy to not mistake him for a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made some decent progress, he was now in the otherworldly living room. On more than a few occasions, Bryan had been in this room invited by the friendly Mike for a BBQ. Everything appeared vastly different now in the room, the walls stretched up for miles and the ceiling light resembled a make-shift sun in its size and intensity. The floor went on seemingly forever and it was hard to believe he would of taken only 10 steps to cross the room, and would now it would take hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy thudding sound followed by the sound of a door opening thrust tiny Bryan from his idle thoughts. \"He's back already!\" Bryan yelped with a start, as he heard distant booming stomps heading his way. He hadn't even gone to a safer location before his colossal neighbor's return, having only managed to put himself in a more dangerous position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the room where the front door entered, Bryan saw the gargantuan Mike lumber in. A painful gulp sounded as the tiny man took in the impressive sight of his titanic neighbor again, before the gigantic man began stomping in Bryan's direction with terrifying speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike didn't look where he stepped as he continued to the kitchen and into the garage. The shrunken scientist was thrown backwards as a battleship-sized sneaker crashed before him. With big eyes, Bryan watched the huge footwear lift away as Mike continued his threatening passage through his house. The violent tremors subsided as the giant went out of sight, leaving tiny Bryan on the ground, his heart racing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so huge! How can I get him to notice me?\" The tiny man thought, trying to figure a plan before the dangerous titan returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away a low, modern-styled coffee table caught his eye. Climbing that would hopefully be simple enough and give him a much safer vantage point. With a fearful look back where Mike was, tiny Bryan Smith hurried to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging the shears in their respective place on the wall, Mike turned to leave. His garage served as a work shop, with an entire wall holding an impressive variety of tools, a work bench, and his collection of sports equipment taking up another corner. Pounding up the cement steps, he meandered back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the floor was covered in dirty tread-prints from before, Mike frowned. His previously dirty sneakers had left over a dozen almost perfect prints on the white kitchen floor, the Vans logo clearly legible on the heel section of the large prints. Mike liked to work on things, fix them and do other types of work, but he was never a fan of cleaning, which bored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big guy followed the mess scoping out how much he would have to clean, following it back into the living room. As he was about to turn back to grab a broom, he spied a tiny pale speck maneuvering away from his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I don't need an infestation in here.\" He sighed. Lifting his left sneaker, he brought it down heavily on the tiny pale speck. Last thing he needed was Ella screaming over a single tiny ant, she was terrified of insects. Ella was always having Mike eradicate a bug on her behalf, as she would refuse to stop screaming until it was dead. Mike didn't care either way, as long as she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the kitchen, he went to the pantry to grab a broom so he could clean up the dirty footprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Given this momentary reprieve, the tiny man set out at a swift pace in his bid to reach his destination without worries of an ill-timed step on the part of his gargantuan neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man felt a surge of pride as he made better progress than he expected. He had almost gotten midway across the floor toward the table when he heard the seismic pounding as Mike scaled the cement steps from the garage and stormed back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing at the sudden reversal in his fortune, the little man took one quick look at his towering neighbor and increased his efforts to reach the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, much to his increasing irritation, noticed his muddy footprint stamped across the immaculate kitchen floor. He meandered back toward the living room, unaware of the drama happening on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan, almost breathless, his muscles aching, paused for a brief rest. \"Please, please, don't come in the living room,\" the little man pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to fling his plea back in his face, Mike stomped heavily across the threshold separating the two rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith screamed and fled toward the table. The big man paused, looking down to see how much cleaning the living room would require.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes locked onto the sprinting form of a pale speck running away from his feet and toward the living room coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN! I DON'T NEED AN INFESTATION IN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleeing bug-sized scientist heard the thunderous remark and felt his blood go cold. He stopped, turned and, frozen in place, watched Mike lift his right sneaker off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Mr. Smith screamed as the colossal shoe plunged him into shadow. \"Please, don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neighbor's sneaker slammed down with a heavy thud, cutting off any last words from the terrified scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the kitchen, Mike grabbed a broom from the pantry to quickly erase the dirty footprints from the kitchen floor before his wife complained, never knowing that he had just exterminated his next-door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh caused by the boredom of household chores, Mike made a mental note to look up Bryan Smith later. Maybe they could stand around in the front yard, have a couple of beers, and just shoot the breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neighbor was a strange little man, but that probably came from being some sort of genius/scientist. As neighbors went, Mike didn't mind living next door to him. After all, Bryan Smith usually minded his own business and didn't get underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Mike could have realized the irony of his own thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thunderous pounding announced the giant's arrival, sending tiny Bryan Smith stumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh-grrrrggah!\" Bryan pealed, falling onto his rear. \"No, not yet! I'm not ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's huge Vans sneakers landed heavily. The huge man remained unaware of his shrunken neighbour's dilemma, as he stood looming. More than experienced with such encounters, Bryan pulled himself upright and bolted for the very distant table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollections of dirt slowed his flight. It was piled in mounds, spreading over the normally clean floor in odd shapes. The bug-sized scientist tried his best to maneuver around them, ignoring powerful shudders and noises from behind. That was, until he heard Mike declare in his thunderous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN,\" The curse was uttered with such force that it caused him to halt and turn around. \"I DON'T NEED AN INFESTATION IN HERE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt his blood run cold hearing the friendly Mike's voice boom from high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frightened eyes peered upwards, squinting to discern Mike's unfathomably huge and distant visage. The mega-sized man's face showed anything but recognition. Indifference, perhaps with a hint of annoyance lingered in Mike's light coloured eyes. Bryan couldn't help but gape, unable to accept that this gargantuan titan was a friendly, generous, and all-around nice guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden movement diverted his stare to the gigantic sneakers planted like mountains of worn, dust-covered rubber and rough canvas with frayed off-white laces. Bryan had seen Mike wear the sneakers often. Yardwork, walking, or just casual wear, his neighbour wore the high top skate shoes whenever he wasn't working--and the footwear showed it. Dust coated the worn canvas, fraying cords as large as building supports stuck out at random from the stitching. The once white soles were now stained with dirt and grass, previously unnoticeable scrapes and pits now visible to his tiny eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had never payed much attention to Mike's well-used sneakers before, preferring to glance at the tall, bulky man himself. Now larger than any battleship, they were impossible to miss. He recalled the sight of them pounding carelessly outside, flattening anything in their path, all without the gigantic owner's realization. Just like the helpless ants, Bryan would get his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leftmost shoe began lifting, as if in slow-motion. Bryan whimpered, stumbling backwards. \"Oh, no! Mike, it's me, Bryan Smith! Your friend! Not a bug, I am NOT A BUG!\" His wails were immediately lost upon the enormous man, who thought nothing of the tiny ants perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge chunks of dirt broke free from the worn waffle tread, crashing to the ground. It all seemed to happen slowly. The sole encompassed the tiny man's view of the sky. It drenched seemingly miles of floor in shadow, as if to tell Bryan escape was futile. He stumbled back clumsily, gaping wordlessly and taking in every detail of the massive hovering sole high above. Packed into the thick tread was a variety of specimens from Mike's front yard: mud, crushed grass, leaf shreds, and tiny unnoticed insect life-forms, including those from the anthill. Bryan noticed a few still moving among the compact debris, half their bodies smashed into the thick waffled tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen time resumed, the sneaker slammed down with a deafening crash. Darkness enveloped Bryan's world when the tremendous force fell upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, Bryan felt alive still. His body was compacted into something moist and earthy. All his limbs were bent painfully, one complaining so much that he thought it broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm not dead...?\" Bryan thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if it was a bad dream and he was about to wake from it. This thought was shattered by loud, heavy creaking that emanated from around him. Mike was preparing to move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beneath his tread you could only brace yourself as again and again huge, shuddering impacts threatened to dislodge or crush you. Then there was the danger that he would step on something else that could jamb into his tread, ending you just as effectively. Mike whistled jauntily as he opened his front door and headed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after he was several yards into the house did his wife's warning's about shoes in the house come to mind. He rolled his eyes before turning around and stomping back over to the front door. He sat down on a bench just inside the door for a moment as he unlaced his shoes and casually pulled them off. He didn't want to leave them next to the front door for his wife to find, she got so upset about muddy shoes. He carefully picked them up and carried them toward the kitchen where he could clean them and possibly get himself a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it into the house alive! Was your thought as Mike peeled off his sneakers. Now all that was left was to work your way out of the tread of the shoe, and get Mike's attention. When Mike crossed one of his legs over the other to pull his shoe off, you pushed with all of your might and popped free, landing on the surface of his jeans. You grab ahold of the fabric as he repeats the exercise with the other, and then watch as he casually carries the shoes that are many thousands of times your size off into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel his thigh muscle tense beneath you as he walks. The jeans are particularly tight on him, and if you were much larger you wouldn't be able to keep ahold of the fabric. As it is, you can keep your grip but only just. Mere inches away from you is Mike's crotch, and suddenly all that you can think about is the fact that even his cock is dozens if not hundreds of times bigger than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike stops off in the kitchen and scrapes the dirt from the tread down into the sink disposal. Your face goes white when you realize what he's doing, and the fact that the dirt washing away into the whirring blades could just as easily have been you. Mike sits the shoes down in the other half of the sink to dry and peels off his sweat soaked shirt. You admire the sight that you had previously only seen at a distance, as Mike heads toward the living room, and then up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike walks, barefoot and shirtless, into his bedroom and shuts the door behind him. He lays down on his bed and you whoop at your good luck! All that you have to do is walk along the surface of his body and get his attention. You walk around his crotch and notice the intense heat coming off of it. You feel the odd sensation of his skin beneath you and begin to make your way through the hair that you had seen only from a distance before, and then his calloused palm impacts you from above. </span></div></div>",

The once tangled and invasive bush now presented itself with a clean-cut look; rounded edges with near flat surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks nice! Ella is gonna be happy to see this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hefty breeze gusted through his front yard, stirring up loose cutting bits from the bush. His neighbour's yard was on the other side, the two yards separated by the hedge. Mike was able to spare some glances into the neighbouring yard, his brow creasing in response to what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she won't be completely happy,\" Mike said with a sheepish smirk. \"Bryan is gonna have to clean his own yard up for that to happen. I should probably offer to give him a hand with it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the front door open and his wife's voice ring out. \"Miiiike! Honey? Are you keeping an eye on Austin?\" The question broke him from his idle musings and brought a grin to his face as he turned to face her. Ella approached, dressed brightly in a summer dress and heeled slip-ons that never seemed to become dirty like his own shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Austin? What is this Austin, I know of no such thing!\" He flashed a face to show he was kidding. \"...and, don't call me Honey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from her one year old child to her immature husband, Ella returned the sarcasm with a playful slap on the arm. \"Come on, who here is supposed to be the kid again?\" The garnered a chuckle from Mike, who stepped forward to retrieve the wiggling toddler from the grass. Austin greeted him with a fistful of torn lawn and by reaching for the bill of his cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your own, little bud!\" Cooed the young father to his son. Mike turned the tattered hat backwards and proceeded to hand the giggling child to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla received a small bundle of purloined grass to the face as well. She sputtered and turned her gaze to Mike. More than a head taller than the younger woman, she always managed to cut the tall guy down to size with only a glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, you need to mow the lawn as well!\" She readjusted her hold of Austin and surveyed the healthy grass. \"I don't like Austin playing in such long grass. Dangerous insects thrive in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave a passive laugh to her worries, but knew he was beat. \"Stop worrying! I'll get on it right now. You take Austin back inside and leave me to finish this yard up.\" He followed them to the driveway - her feet barely disturbing the grass while Mike's sneakers left sizable impressions. Mike paused to grab the shears he left behind, and proceeded for the garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla waved Austin's tiny hand to him and returned to the house knowing full well that her husband's promise was better than gold. Good as he was, Mike put away the shears; glancing over the wall of tools he had erected on one wall, to a cabinet of rakes and shovels with a collection of sports equipment stacked both on top and to the side. His light eyes settled on the lawn mower settled near his mountain bike, already draped with cobwebs and dust since he last fired it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine had been purchased by him from the local thrift store last December. It was a bulky, well-used gas guzzler from over two decades ago, but ran well (if not loudly) thanks to Mike's tinkering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed the webs from it, dislodging a daddy long legs to the floor and freeing a recently stuck gnat from the silky trap. Mike had no inkling of his actions as he prepared to wheel it outside. The tiny buzzer decided to thank Mike by whizzing towards his face and into his eyes. Mike grunted passively and lazily swatted at it. When it returned for round two, Mike released his grip on the handles and brought his large hands together with a resounding clap. Years with the Navy in barracks and battleships made such a gesture like second nature to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mower wheeled out with a smooth, heavy grace as it crunched over the drive way and then the lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave the lawn one cursory scan, seeing everything but the tiny lives that inhabited it. He was so far withdrawn from bugs and other small creatures, that the thought of callously destroying their homes and existence never crossed his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to begin, he gripped the plastic handled rope and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan hunkered low, feeling almost safe due to the mass of ants around him. They seemed disinterested in him; as if he were nothing but a trifle or a waste of time. He looked over and realized the situation was different for his captor. Half a dozen and more ants poked, prodded, and even attempted to climb the large spider who thrashed angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider backed off, but remained inside the clearing. Bryan shuddered, feeling the eight black eyes staring at him with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\" He barked over the crowd of ants to the impatiently shifting spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed only interested in finding a way past the ants in order to access the shrunken man. Bryan pressed himself lower to the grainy earth, incredulous at the simple-minded creature's doggedness. Any one of the scampering ants would provide a far more hearty meal than the thin and frail scientist; yet the large spider seemed adamant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatience of his own threatened to overtake him. He refused to stay hunkered in the dirt among a crowd of busy, rude ants! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell away!\" Bryan screamed. \"You stupid, fucking spider; GO AWAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider of course did not respond, but something else did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar in the distance, Bryan heard a loud, cantankerous roar. He even felt it - rumbling a steady pulse through the very earth, shaking everything in sight. What was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the waves of heavy grinding clamour clicked some recognition in the tiny genius's memory. Specifically, one he had heard on many occasions from his next door neighbour's yard. \"The fucking lawnmower! Fuck!\" Normally, Bryan would emit an initial sigh of annoyance whenever the calamity would begin. He would then compensate himself for it by leering from his window to spy upon Mike's hulking form as he muscled the big mower around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the sound summoned a feeling of pure, unadulterated fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike is mowing his lawn! With me in it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had seen a movie once, long ago, in which a group of shrunken people were nearly obliterated by the hurricane blades of an equally enormous device. Now it seems, Bryan would get to test the validity of those Hollywood scenes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ants seemed to react accordingly, racing to and fro instead of their previous meandering scuttles. Such pandimonium in both the noisy atmosphere and skittering bugs made Bryan's blood pressure rise. He wanted to flee; nothing more than to just run aimlessly in search of some shelter. Yet, that remained impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the clear - now abuzz with alarmed ants - stood the spider: staring, watching, and waiting. Bryan nearly shrieked when making contact with those horrible eyes. The wretched spider was already bent on acquiring him for a meal, and seemed willing to give up life for the chance as well. He felt his weary heart sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to die! What the hell can I do!?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a roar they took off towards the lab where the antidote awaited them.<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\nBryan was feeling much better about himself. After all even though his string of bad luck had forced him to watch as Tommy knocked the vial of antidote off the table, he had also been noticed, and Tommy was bringing back enough to make him grow hundred times over. He would have gone with them, but he had said that the outside world was no place for someone his size, asking them to hurry back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone now in his giant house he really wanted to explore, but he knew the dangers inherent in such a course, namely the getting step on ones, and decided that for the moment it was probably safe to wait on the table. When the boys got back he would send them away, possibly do a bit of exploration, and then grow back using the antidote after stripping off the clothes he now wore. Luckily he had more than one set of small clothes, and so the set he now wore were dry, and soda free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant he heard a sound he did not expect. A car pulling up, and a door slamming shut. Looking at the clock Bryan realized the boys had only been gone a few minutes, and they would take at least an hour in getting to the lab, getting through security, which was easier for Tommy because the guard knew the boy, Bryan had, had him deliver things to his office before, and then find the antidote and bring it back. No way they were back yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped it was just a bit of noise carry over, that the car had pulled up to someone else's house and he just thought it was coming from his, but a minute later he heard the doorknob turning, and realized that Tommy, in the excitement must have forgotten to lock the door. Someone was coming into his house, with him at this size, and Tommy wouldn't be back for a while with the antidote. Slowly the door opened and revealed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door, while not easily visible from the table, was still not that far away, and Bryan heard an obviously feminine voice begin to complain about Tommy even as she was walking in the door. Her complaints however, were still whispered ones, and at his normal size Bryan wouldn't even have heard them. All he knew was that her tone was an obviously annoyed one, and that meant she might lash out at a small bug that happened to be sitting on the dining table. Taking this knowledge to heart the miniature scientist hid underneath the sheet of paper, and hoped that Jessica wouldn't touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Jessica because Tommy had brought her over once. Why Tommy did this he still had little or no idea, after all though he felt like an uncle to the kid, the two were little more than neighbors. Still Jess, as she liked to be called, was a nice enough girl, if a little bit of a nudist considering the clothes she wore barely covered a tenth of her body, and her favorite \u2018shirt' consisted of a three inch band of cloth that rapped around her like a bra, causing her to jiggle slightly as she walked. Bryan had found that attire distasteful in the extreme, but was able to put up with it for the brief period of their meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow staring at her from under a sheet of paper that was several times his size he watched as she surveyed the aftermath of the short lived party Tommy had attempted to throw. Obviously she found it not at all to her liking and scoffed at the mess left behind. Bryan hadn't been too upset yet by the wreckage in his living room, and had intended on cleaning it up himself later, now though Jess was doing it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON HE CALLED ME OVER,\" she said to herself, or at least she thought she was saying it only to herself, Bryan however could hear every word, and was of a mind to tell the girl off, mostly because he knew Tommy wasn't that kind of person. Considering his stature though the scientist remained quiet, still hoping that the girl would leave. Obviously she had already concluded that no one was home, probably from the lack of noise, and the lack of cars in the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had in fact known the house would be empty before she ever saw it for the simple reason that she had seen Tommy and one of his friends, Joe she thought, careening down the highway like madmen, going well over the speed limit. She wondered if they had even slowed as they got to the billboard a little farther down the road, the one behind which the cops always waited. If he hadn't then she was going to be alone tonight as the boy was going to be arrested for sure going at that speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself Jessica dumped the plates, and the few cups that had been left behind, into the trash can in the kitchen and then looked around. She was sure she would be alone for the rest of the afternoon at least, which was not at all what she had planned. Tommy had told her they would be spending the night together, away from his house. Subtlety never being Tommy's strong point Jess had easily concluded he had meant for them to spend the night at Mr. Smith's. Supposedly they were house sitting for him, though in reality she knew they would be having an interesting time most of the night, if not well into the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, it looked like she might well be spending the night alone, more because she knew Tommy had a key, and possibly one of his buddies, and she didn't trust them not to trash the place so bad they couldn't hope to fix it before Mr. Smith returned. Of course it was well into the afternoon by this point, and Jessica realized that thanks to her little detour she had not eaten all day. Well disregarding a muffin that had been quite stale, and a pop tart that had been slightly, but not too badly, burned by her little sister Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she was glad to see that Mr. Smith kept a clean house, which she knew was unusual for a single, either guy or girl. Sh caulked this up to his being a scientist, who, thanks to both her grandfathers having been one, she knew to be neat freaks in most cases. Looking around she couldn't see mess that was more than an hour old, and obviously a result of the party. Still it didn't look like he kept much food in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PROBABLY LIVES AT THE LAB,\" she said under her breath. Bryan, still cowering under the piece of paper, guessed her thoughts, and realized with a start that she was mostly correct. In the last few months he had spent over sixty percent of his time at his lab or office, coming home only when his body threatened complete systems failure. As a result his food supply mostly consisted of easily prepared sandwiches at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course for Jessica this meant her food options were limited to the bread and grain verity. Having already had those for a morning meal she found herself wishing she had stopped at a fast food joint on the way over. At least then she could grab something that was actually filling, if obscenely overpriced, overcooked, and probably dropped at least once. Still her options being as limited as they were she decided that she would use what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out two slices of bread she then proceeded to discover that the bottom drawer of Bryan's refrigerator was one of those easily removed kind, and so she pulled it out, but finding not room on the counter on which too put it she instead took it into the dining room and set it gently on the table. Of course, as with all things, gently was a relative term, and with that gentle breeze brought on by Jessica's movements, Bryan and his sheet of paper were sent reeling through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!!!\" screamed Bryan as he grabbed one end of the paper, hoping that it would in some way cushion his eventual impact on he hardwood floor below. It didn't, though only because Bryan never hit the floor. Instead as Jessica was walking back to the table with the plate that held her two slices of bread and a jar of mayo her movement kicked up more wind, that caused the piece of paper to do a loop-de-loop in the air, with Bryan at the far end, meaning that as the paper leveled out he went flying into the air. It was at this point that Bryan realized that most beings his current size possessed wings, or some ability to float. Now of course he knew why, still he was shocked back to reality as he fell onto...</span></div></div>",

He was not sure whether this was bad luck or good luck on his part, as getting seen was something he wanted, though he was pretty sure Jessica would swat him without a second thought. Unlike Tommy and his friends, Jessica didn't seem the type to make bets regarding bugs, and so was less likely to take a close look at him before killing him. On the other hand he was just as dead if she ate him, and that seemed to be a very good possibility at this point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened was that his minuscule stature allowed Bryan to drop into one of the holes in the bread that give it the light and fluffy texture. After falling into it he was forced to decide if going up and getting noticed was the correct course of action, or going down and getting out was. His decision took little time as he considered the thoughts on what Jessica was likely to do to him if she saw him, and so with little idea as to which way to go in the honey comb of fluffy white tunnels he was now it, Bryan set his sights down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course down was easy to achieve, as all he really had to do was let go and slide, and with the sounds of crinkling lettuce, the squish of mayo, and what he assumed was the slap of bologna and cheese being struck against each other coming from only a few hundred yards away, or six inches depending on you point of view, he made a new speed record in his slide, pushing himself down the white tunnel as fast as he could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his luck being what it was the instant he hit the bottom of the bread he found that it was now several miles above the hard surface below. Well really it was only a foot or two, but to him it was a few miles. Looking down he realized she was holding the bread in one hand, and he suspected she was spreading mayo with the other. Of course now his choice is a more dire one, as jumping would probably lead to a quick death, while holding on might lead to a slower and much more painful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs has happened many times since this entire misadventure began Bryan suddenly found the choice of letting go taken out of his tiny hands as the bread quite suddenly flipped over, and he watched as she pressed down on it. Climbing up what had moments ago been a downward facing white tunnel Bryan now stood atop a vast porous plain, staring at Jessica's massive form in the distance, a distance which he knew would soon be much less as she shoved the white plain and the stuff underneath it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to him that she might well see him as more than a bug if he were that close to her face, but then again at his size she might not see him at all and just devour him without realizing it. Of course this left him two, similarly unwanted options. The first was to run to the edge of the sandwich and try to get off, and then hopefully get Tommy's attention when he returned later. The other was to stay on the sandwich and try to get Jessica's attention now. After a moment of thought he chooses to...</span></div></div>",

At his insignificant size, the spongy surface proved difficult for him to travel, especially when Tommy's giant girlfriend picked up the entire plate and began to walk from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface, no longer level, tilted wildly with each step she took. Bryan, more frightened than ever, tried to reach the edge of the bread slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step by Jessica jolted the bug-sized man into the air. He landed roughly on a smooth surface and immediately began to slide. He realized he had fallen on the plate holding the huge girl's substantial sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan scrambled uselessly to grab hold of anything to break his slide toward the edge of the plate.

The ceramic plate hit with a rattling noise when she lowered it to the coffee table, far from the tiny scientist's current location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling too exposed, the shrunken scientist dropped off the edge of the magazine and ran across the table to hide in the shadow of his television remote. The oblong plastic device looked as big as a Navy destroyer to the bug-sized man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, he peered from his hiding place to watch Tommy's girlfriend tear into the sandwich. He shuddered, glad to have made his escape from her meal before she began to devour it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his immediate plan of action, he had none. He didn't trust Jessica enough to risk contacting her. Besides, he worried that she might panic if she saw something tiny and lash out with unfortunate results for a little man no bigger than an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for at least a quarter of an hour, he remained still and quiet in the shadow of the enormous remote. The impasse was broken when Jessica, now finished, rose to her feet and carried her plate back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the teenager's absence, the tiny scientist dared to venture away from the remote to have a quick survey of the coffee table. In addition to a couple of magazines and a remote, the only other item on the vast wooden plain was a stadium-sized ceramic bowl that he used for his wallet and keys when returning home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill coming to terms with the immensity of his surrounding, he ventured over toward the sheer drop at the edge of the coffee table. The floor looked hundreds of feet below him. Nervous, he backed away from the edge, just as he felt the floor vibrate from immense footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jessica was no longer alone. Tommy had returned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the imposing giant filled the little man with both hope and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the argument began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard such a ridiculous story in my life,\" Jessica said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth,\" Tommy replied defensively. \"Joe, get in here and tell her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raised voices physically hurt the tiny man's ears. He tried to cover them with his hands and watched as Tommy's equally titanic friend lumbered into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sighed. \"It's the truth,\" he said as Jessica glared at him. \"The little man looked like a freakin' ant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we left him on the kitchen table,\" Tommy said. \"Now, he's not there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know why you're blaming me,\" she said. \"I haven't seen any tiny men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about bugs?\" Tommy asked. \"He looked a lot like a bug. We almost mistook him for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rolled her eyes. \"No bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, as the two argued, made his way over to the sofa. He dropped down on the cushions and then raised his feet off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see the tiny form that raced across the coffee table toward the safety of the remote as he dropped his sneaker-clad feet onto the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith's heart pounded as he made it back to the shadow of the gigantic remote control just as Joe's huge sneakers crashed down onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" The tiny man screamed in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had never been in any real danger, he could not help but stare at the two massive sneakers with the realization that he could easily have been squished beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get Tommy's attention, the sooner the better. With some effort, he climbed atop the remote. He ran through the rows of buttons, hoping to find a spot where he could attract Tommy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, not even the spot he has chosen for a hiding place remained safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you two hold it down?\" Joe said. \"I'm going to find something to watch on TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror, the tiny scientist saw the huge teenager's enormous hand reaching for the remote.</span></div></div>",

He gave chase, but was slowed down by having to watch his every step, fearful his tiny neighbor might be down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenaged couple had a brief argument in Mr. Smith's front yard, but she remained unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, Tommy returned and plopped down on the sofa next to Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand girls,\" he said in a dejected manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even try to understand them,\" Joe cracked a joke. \"Why bother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stared at the screen, trying to get his mind off Jessica's dismissal of his problem. He was also pondering how his tiny neighbor had simply vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the current channel, Joe placed the remote on the cushions between them.

The tiny man decided to use the opportunity to contact his enormous neighbor.

He failed to detect the tiny speck that plummeted off his sleeve and landed amid the gigantic boulders of green, red, yellow and blue in a stadium-sized bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game resumed, and the titans focused on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, they reached into the bowl to scoop up a handful of M&amp;Ms to drop into their open mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith found himself stranded on a green M&amp;M that was the size of a huge boulder. He screamed in frustration. He had been making good progress, climbing from Tommy's jeans to his shirt. Then Joe had returned with something from the kitchen, and Tommy had leaned forward at just the wrong moment. Now, with the smooth sloping walls of the bowl surrounding him, the tiny man found himself trapped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, he watched as Tommy and Joe plunged their enormous fingers into the bowl and scooped up handfuls of the candy, letting the pieces fall into their open mouths before they crunched down, chewing and pulverizing them before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck\u2026 Tommy!\" The tiny man balanced as he stood on the boulder-sized candy. \"In here!

Complicating matters, Tommy had spoken aloud the fear that Jessica might have caused some terrible mishap to befall the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith had shivered when the teenager speculated that his girlfriend, without being aware of her actions, could have stomped or crushed the bug-sized man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in one horrifying moment, the little man had been spilled into a bowl of M&amp;Ms removed from Mr. Smith's kitchen by Joe to relieve some hunger pangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few minutes, the speck of a man had screamed until his throat had felt raw. Still, he could not make himself heard over the commotion of the loud game on the distant television screen. Louder and more terrifying than any of the sounds, however, was the gruesome crunching as the two teenager chomped on the soft chocolate treats in hard candy shells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had evaded the first couple of hands plunged into the bowl to collect the colorful morsels. But, he knew his luck might not hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs indeed it did not. Tommy, his fingers spread wide, plowed through the candies until he had gathered an enormous amount of them in his fingers. He lifted them out of the bowl, taking no notice of the teeny man that came with them\u2265<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Please, stop!\" Mr. Smith begged. \"Just look! Here!\" Please, look for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager plucked a few individual candies from his palm, flipping them into his open mouth. A terrified Mr. Smith watched his teenage neighbor close his massive jaws and pulverize them with massive, loudly crunching teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" He cried as he watched how much destruction the mere teenager could do without even a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he needed to get Tommy's attention\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.</span></div></div>",

His cries made no difference as the large hand covered him, here to claim another handful of candies. Bryan grimaced as the fingers closed around him, the rattling of the boulder-sized candies deafened him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed in terror as he felt himself rising with the M&amp;Ms. He made a sudden decision to attempt to slip downwards in the hopes of escaping at the bottom where Joe\u2019s palm wouldn\u2019t block his way out. He had only hopped down two of the colorful candies, and could already see light between Joe\u2019s clenched fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he prepared to hope down one final time, the entire world turned upside-down. Bryan\u2019s yelp of shock was cut-off abruptly when he hit an M&amp;M, landing squarely on his back. Squinting through the pain, he could see he was facing upwards. Joe had turned his palm upwards, his hand cupped to protect the candy he was about to pulverize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the calloused fingers that stretched overhead, Bryan could see the underside of Joe\u2019s jaw, a line of faint stubble lining the youth\u2019s strong jawbone. Beneath that was the sheer cliff that was Joe\u2019s chest, covered by a billowing t-shirt. It heaved with every gusting breath the massive teenager took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed as he stared at the screen. With his left hand, he plucked a single M&amp;M from the pile resting in his right. He brought it to his mouth and pushed it between his lips. He sucked on it for a second, remembering a game had had played with Joe when they were younger. For reasons Tommy no longer remembered, they would avoid certain M&amp;M colors, usually yellow since that was their least favorite. \u201cWhat color was this one?\u201d Tommy wondered silently. Realizing he hadn\u2019t looked, Tommy decided it didn\u2019t matter. He moved the M&amp;M between his teeth and with a loud crunch began chewing it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another commercial break turned to face Joe, who was scooping up another handful of M&amp;Ms. \u201cHey Joe, I feel really bad just watching TV instead of looking for Mr. Smith\u2026\u201d Tommy said as he pushed another M&amp;M into his mouth. \u201cWhoops didn\u2019t check the color of that one either\u201d Tommy thought to himself as he cracked it between his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe tried really hard not to sound annoyed as he turned to Tommy to respond. \u201cDude we have no idea where he\u2019s at! We don\u2019t even know where to start. We haven\u2019t been back that long, give him some time to get somewhere we can find him!\u201d Joe paused for a second, \u201cI mean, what if he\u2019s going across the floor and you stepped on him while looking?\u201d Tommy\u2019s eyes widened, and his jaw went slack giving Joe a view of the half-chewed chocolate dotted with color in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked back at the TV. \u201cWe\u2019re doing him a favor by watching TV! He can get somewhere so we can see him and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about us messing anything up for him!\u201d Joe leaned back with a smile, as he realized he was helping out the guy without even trying. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy swallowed the candy in his mouth as Joe started to dump his handful of M&amp;Ms into his mouth. \u201cYeah\u2026 I guess that makes sense, thanks Joe!\u201d Joe pulled his hand away from his lips, half the candies in his palm waiting to be eaten.<br>\r\n\u201cNo prob dude! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here!\u201d Joe replied happily, his voice distorted as he chewed the candies. He and Tommy refocused on the TV ads that were playing. As Joe gulped down his mouthful of candy he brought his hand to his lips, dumping in the rest of the handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s shouts for help were easily overpowered by Joe\u2019s thundering voice. Bryan struggled to move through the pain, but stopped when he picked up on the conversation\u2019s topic. They were discussing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Down here!\u201d Bryan wailed, waving his arms frantically. Joe, turned to face Tommy, never once glanced down at his handful of candy and one unnoticed passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWE\u2019RE DOING HIM A FAVOR BY WATCHING TV! HE CAN GET SOMEWHERE SO WE CAN SEE HIM AND HE DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT US MESSING ANYTHING UP FOR HIM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shuddered in response to the giant\u2019s words. They weren\u2019t looking for him, and in spite of what Joe had just said, the towering teens had already made things much worse since they had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed in terror as the hand supporting him rose rapidly. It halted even with Joe\u2019s impossibly huge lips. As the mouth yawned open, Bryan took in every detail, grossly magnified at such a close range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick lips parted to reveal two rows of gleaming, jagged teeth. The cavern that was Joe\u2019s mouth stretched far into the distance, ending where the slope of the tongue disappeared down into the throat, the uvula hanging ominously over the blackness. The twitching tongue lay flat, smears of chocolate and specks of color dotting its surface. Rows of molars lined the sides of the tongue, the soggy pulverized remains of previous handfuls of candy mashed into every crevice of the teeth. Light reflected off thick strands of saliva stretching between the quivering tongue and the pointed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand tilted forward, releasing M&amp;Ms into the terrifying chamber. Bryan flinched at the loud clicks as the candies bounced off Joe\u2019s teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO PLEASE!\u201d Bryan begged, looking up desperately. All he could see was Joe\u2019s dark nostrils. Undoubtedly the teen was staring at the screen, barely aware of the candy he was dumping into his mouth, unconcerned with the destruction it would meet inside of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bryan began to slide forward, the hand tilted back. The teeth came together with a booming crunch as the teeth came together. Bryan was buffeted by the gust of Joe\u2019s voice, the words indiscernible to the tiny man who covered his ears ineffectually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sobbed in shock, unable to tear his eyes from Joe\u2019s mouth as the titanic teen chewed the candy. Every crunch sent a fresh wave of goosebumps down his still throbbing spine. Joe\u2019s lips parted as he chewed, the smacking sound of the soggy candy nauseating his overlooked audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more crunches later, Joe\u2019s lips smacked together as he gulped down the candy. Bryan had barely managed to sit up before he was sent screaming into the open mouth amidst other falling M&amp;Ms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe began to chew the candy in his mouth without a second thought. The light from the TV flashed across his expressionless face as he chewed with his mouth open. The crunches and smacks sounding from his mouth went unnoticed by the two teens. As Joe prepared to swallow the candy he felt a sharp pain in his gums. Wincing Joe swallowed the candy, and poked his tongue against the affected area. After a few seconds of unsuccessful prodding, Joe stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tommy demanded. \u201cI need the mirror, there\u2019s something stuck in my teeth,\u201d Joe replied simply. \u201cDon\u2019t go! Remember, give Mr. Smith time to be safe from us!\u201d Tommy said forcefully. Joe shrugged \u201cI\u2019ll watch my step!\u201d he insisted as he turned towards the hall where the bathroom was. Tommy made a sound as if he would continue to argue, but Joe was already pounding out of the room, his eyes apathetically scanning the floor moments before his shoes slammed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe entered the bathroom and leaned towards the mirror over the counter. He opened his mouth, allowing the room\u2019s bright lights to flood its interior. Joe could see his tongue, coated with chewed chocolate stretching to the back of his mouth. Unconcerned with the image of destruction inside his mouth, Joe pulled his on the corner of his mouth, stretching his lips back to reveal his gums at the base of his molars.</span></div></div>",

Glints of light from the ropes of saliva that had formed when his mouth opened, distracted his searching gaze. He finally noticed a small pale speck that had been causing the minor irritation. Now able to see how it was positioned, Joe\u2019s tongue slithered over the teeth like a monster. The brown smears and specks of color that lined the side of the tongue went were seen by Joe but never registered in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe never noticed the feeble movement of the pale speck, having instantly dismissed it as a candy shell washed of its color. Mr. Smith had against all odds sunk down the side of one of Joe\u2019s teeth, instead of being crushed as expected. Now his screams of terror never reached Joe\u2019s ears as his massive tongue lapped at the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Joe felt relief as the tongue freed the irritant. Joe\u2019s eyes followed the movement of his tongue in the mirror as it returned to its regular position. Staring into his mouth, Joe moved the speck to swallow and out of curiosity tried for a few seconds to swallow with his mouth open. Discovery he couldn\u2019t, Joe shrugged and snapped his jaws shut. He turned away from the mirror and without thinking about it gulped down the speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s pleas for help and screams of terror were lost within the confines of Joe\u2019s body as he returned to the living room. Joe was unable to appreciate the enormity of his existence to someone as small as Bryan. The destructive potential of his every bite to Mr. Smith was lost on Joe, who never once considered that the man may end up in his food. Joe would never appreciate the consequences of his simple snack. There was no indication to the young man that the shrunken scientist he half-heartedly intended on saving was trapped in his stomach amongst melting sludge of pulverized M&amp;M\u2019s. He would continue snacking on M&amp;Ms while waiting for the tiny man to get somewhere safe. Joe was looking forward to rescuing the tiny man so Tommy would feel better and quit being so irritating so they could finally get on with their day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fate is just being mean today, were the thoughts that passed through Bryan's stressed out mind as his world became encased in a saliva filled cavern that was Jessica's mouth. After landing softly, or at least softer than he would have otherwise, on the sofa cushion, Bryan was just about ready to believe himself safe when a huge black shadow passed overhead, and he nearly got an up close and personal experience with the seat of Jessica's jeans. Not one to take getting sat on sitting down Bryan ran as fast as he could over the cushion, which proved a better running surface than the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short run gave him a moment of safety as he had already been near the edge of where Jessica was sitting down, and now he stood at the absolute edge of his sofa, staring at a long drop that had a hard stop on the end, namely he was staring at the hard wood floor far below. Normally the problem of exactly how to get down from the height of the sofa would have been the center of his thoughts for the next few minutes, but thanks to a bit of salsa on the floor in front of his couch, Jessica slipped at the last minute and slammed into the couch, causing the cushion to crumple, and the ends to fly upwards, sending Bryan flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that weren't enough, instead of landing somewhere soft, like back on the couch he instead hit his fan high near the ceiling, a fan which he'd never turned off and was still spinning. He would never be completely sure how, but he avoided the fan blades as he went over them, and then, thanks to his matching velocity, landed on the top part of one of the blades safely, though he felt like his whole body had just been through a blender set to obliterate. After such a hard landing you would expect the universe to give him a break, but unfortunately for Bryan the universe was in no mood to give him a break, well unless that break happened to be in one of his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nothing to hold on to on the smooth fan blade top, Mr, Smith felt himself slide thanks to the force of the fan's spin, and was soon staring at an even longer drop, though this one would probably end with him splattered against a wall. Again his life would be spared, though it this case it was done in an unusual way. Losing his grip on the edge of the fan Bryan was flung hard towards the wall, but soon found himself falling again, this time to a spot just behind his sofa, a spot that quite luckily contained a paper plate that one of the boys had dropped back there rather than walk the ten feet into the kitchen to throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a plate like this would still be so hard as to turn Bryan into paste when he hit it, but once again the universe worked to his favor, and instead of staying firm when he hit it, the plate bent under his weight thanks to the fact that the salsa had seeped into the plate, making it spongier. However, not only did it bend under his weight, Bryan found that it also broke, and he, plus a piece of the plate soon fell the remaining inches to the floor, a drop that would more than likely kill him even from this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found that the drop lasted a bit more than it should though, and looked around to find that he and the bit of paper plate that had fallen with him were in fact floating in mid air, sitting just inside a vent behind his sofa. Thinking about how exactly it was happening led his mind to distract itself with thoughts of air current equations and mass to surface ratios that allowed him to ignore the fact that he was a very small man in a very large world for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose moments came to an end when a sudden roar echoed from somewhere below and he knew the vent was about to increase the air flow. It didn't take long for him to be proven correct and to be blown into the air again, holding tightly to the piece of paper plate that had given him enough surface to allow the air currents to carry him weights for as long as they had. That same piece also cause this new burst of air to take him within reach of his roof before coming down again, right back through the path of the fan blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time his impact on the fan was softened by the paper plate, so it barely hurt him. Now the rolling bounce after his impact on the blade, that nearly broke his neck, and sent him hurtling over the side of the blade towards the floor below. After all this his final destination became the very same spot on the sandwich where he had been before, and this time he had no choices as Jessica shoved the sandwich into her mouth, taking a huge bite and him with it. For a moment everything was still as Jessica leaned forward looking at the TV and then she leaned back again, with an old Bugs Bunny cartoon on, she laughed a little as she began to chew, and Bryan knew that unless something spectacularly unusual happened, he was soon going to be part of a snack for Jessica.</span></div></div>",

Note that the Prime Wave and various other elements in this ending pertain to a series of short stories published in a local SciFan mag under the pen name Simon Sez.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunate Bryan was just beginning to comprehend the true horror of his situation, namely that he had just been shoved inside a young girls mouth and was about to be either chewed into a mushy paste or about to be swallowed and then digested, both situations ending in his rather painful death. Facing the certainty of his demise like a man, Bryan decided if he was gonna die he was gonna die spectacularly, and throwing all caution to the wind he ran over the sandwich, which Jessica still hadn't started chewing, and then took a dive down the back of her throat. If he didn't cause her to choke in surprise, at least he will have gone out with a splash, were the thoughts that went through his stressed out mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a dimension 3 further along the Tau Axis of Time(There are three axises of time just as there are three dimensions of space) another scientist was about to take a diving leap of his own, though this one had a far more spectacular purpose, namely turning the experimenter into a living god. He would do this by harnessing a bit of Ancient Science, which said that if you had five particular elements together within a set amount of space you could create a powerful force known as the Prime Wave, a representation of the Multiverse that could be used to change reality based on the whim of the wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parts of the weapon included Infinite Depth, the power to contain the cosmos, basically by becoming a living black hole. The Ancients created this part by nulling the souls of some of their own, creating a new race called the DeadBorn, those born without souls. Exactly how they did this is still a subject of debate, but what matters is that they did it, and so it proves it can be done, nulling a soul, yet somehow along the body to continue living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second piece was Infinite Understanding, the power to comprehend the cosmos. With this power one could predict the movements of certain objects, be they planets of atoms, and thus know what will happen sometimes days in advance. Using this ability one could always place oneself into advantageous positions in either battle or life, basically winning every fight before it even began. The Ancients created this piece by allowing their children a glimpse at the Origin Stone, a stone that showed the beginning, nd through it one could see all that came after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final biological piece of the puzzle is Infinite Potential, for only with it could one match the Prime Wave's energies, and thus harness them for use. Infinite Potential for Growth and Change allowed the wielder to grow stronger simply by setting themself against an opponent this caused their body to automatically respond, and thus grow to a power only a little greater using the power of the opponent as a balance to allow this new found strength to exist. The Process which creates such a being is unknown to most people, though some have found it and used it to create living weapons that eventually choose to either self-destruct, or refuse to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two parts were not biological, but instead were representations of time and space. The Ancient versions of these two artifacts are called the Heart of Ages, a physical representation of Time's Flow which appears to be a glowing yellow stone, and the Heart of Stars, a temporal representation of the physical universe which appears to be a small gray stone that shines with a thousand tiny points of light from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this particular scientist had already found and applied the three processes that gave him Infinite Depth, Understanding, and Potential, and with the aid of a supercomputer he was able to construct his own Heart of Ages, which he called the Time Hub, which allowed him to view all of time. However through no fault of his own he had no idea how to create a Heart of Stars, and had studied for centuries to solve the problem, finding it in a little read tome called the Apocalypse Journals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy ripping open small wormholes in the fabric of space and time he was able to observe the Multiverse in the same way his computer had been able to observe time after being connected to a Time Matrix Generator. With these wormholes he would do the same thing, and allow his computer to construct a Heart of Stars based off the data they collected. There was only one flaw in his plans, though he couldn't have known it then. That flaw just happened to be Bryan Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought I forgot about him didn't you? Well I didn't. Bryan had just chosen to take a screaming dive into Jessica's throat when a great funnel like distortion in space opened before him. Normally one would try and avoid such things, but considering Bryan's other option was to plunge head first into a vat of acid that's sole purpose was to turn little bits of meat like him into protein for this giant girl's body to absorb. Well considering all that he aimed his fall right for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he emerged on the other side he was one with the cosmos. Everything in it flowed around him, and he could see it all, with his sight focused on the man before him, who was eagerly awaiting a stone which would complete his ultimate weapon and allow him to control the cosmos. Bryan, a small(Very Small) man from a small world on the edge of a small galaxy, at the edge of a universe that didn't even matter was now in a position to save all creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so, though he knew the only way to do it would cost him his life. With a surge of effort he reached out his hand and disrupted the incoming wormholes feeding information into the computer. By doing this he disrupted flow to the Heart of Stars that the madman was making, causing it to explode outward with the force of over two-hundred suns, vaporizing the mad man and his work in a fiery inferno. His last thought as he vanished into the maelstrom was that he, being no more than a few micrometers tall, had inadvertently been able to save the universe. Thinking this he also began to wonder if maybe lady luck had been with him all this time, just not in the way he wanted. Whatever the case this was, at least for him...</span></div></div>",

You see that part about \u2018considering the situation'? Good, well let's list what the situation is. Bryan is an at least halfway respected researcher who invented a shrinking potion, and tests it on himself. Being an undisclosed macrophile he purposefully gets into a situation where he's small around people, and they have no idea he's there. At his particular juncture he is about to become part of a sandwich of a girl who actually thinks she's doing him a favor by helping keep his house clean. Alright now back to the story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was dead. Well at least he would be in few minutes. The girl's mouth behind him began to close, and he watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as those white skyscrapers tore into the white plane behind him, slashing through something so many times thicker than him like it wasn't even there. Seeing a sight like this is enough to make a grown man cry Mommy!, Bryan however cried out some things that don't bare repeating, usually at the universe and lady luck that had scorned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would probably have interested Bryan to note that at that precise moment as Jessica took him with her first bite of sandwich a combined force of Vl'hurgs and G'Gugvuntt war vessels hyperspaced into his living room. Their purpose? Why to destroy humanity and its progenitor the Earth of course. Unfortunately even when set tail to nose the one-thousand Crithack class Destroyers measure only about an inch and a half, though that inch and a half was more than enough to take out something the size of oh say, Bryan's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still charging their Giga Ion Cannons though when another fleet hyperspaced on top of them, and an epic struggle for survival was fought in the air over Jessica's head, with her not even looking up. This new fleet consisted of the Red(That's the human word for their species, what they called themselves was unknown) and was a little bigger than the combined fleets f the Vl's and G's, though this is odd considering that the average Red stands over twelve feet tall and has spikes over most of his scaly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were as small as the other fleet though, because in an attempt to circumvent Earth's defenses the High Red Commander decided to miniaturize a portion of his fleet and send it in undetected, Earth Defense Command got wind of this plan however and came up with two counters to it. The first consisted of shrinking a EDC Carrier and then sending out its forces against the Reds, however after ninety-three percent of the fighters were lost due to the actions of the normal sized populace and other various happenings the EDC instead armed their people with flyswatters, and that worked just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular Red ship was the Attack Carrier Por'tash'nah and had accidentally gotten an extra dose of the shrink ray, causing it to shift between dimensions as well, and wind up in Bryan's living room right on top of the combined fleet of the other aliens, who, though from our dimension, happened to be from another galaxy, the Earth they were mad at and wanted to destroy was in another dimension however, but they didn't care. One Earth was as good as another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the two fleets were about to engage in pitched battle the Red's discovered one of the oddities of interdimensional travel, namely that the laws of physics change between dimension, and that though their drive system, weapons, and generators still worked, their force fields didn't, and thus their ships began to explode with the force of small(Very Small) suns, which created a spectacular show for anyone looking at it, which considering Jessica was watching Bugs Bunny, and Bryan was watching teeth fall trying to chew him up, neither was so they missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one ship escaped complete destruction, and that was actually because the pilot was also an inventor and had been trying out a new force field on his fighter's core, one that worked in our universe. Unfortunately for him the force of the explosion still shattered his windshield, and since the Red's breath a methane based atmosphere he died instantly, his ship liquefying his remains to prevent enemies from studying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis now out of control ship then spiraled down, and through one of those twists of fate that have been a part of this story since it began, it flew right into Jessica's mouth as she was laughing at Elmer Fudd staring into the end of his rifle as bugs pulled the trigger. This Red ship then crashed into the bread, which was still unchewed at all, and slid to a stop right next to Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a scientist like Bryan would take a moment to think before he entered what appeared to be an alien spacecraft with no pilot, but considering he was about to be eaten by a young woman in his own home as part of light snack, he decided to skip straight to the random pushing on the hull for an entrance. Not finding one right away he instead climbed into the windshield and then sat in the pilot's seat, which was perfectly sized for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother lucky break occurred here in the fact that the pilot/inventor had also installed a Neural Sonic Linker in his ship, meaning it read the pilot's thoughts instead of dealing with any of that usual manual control sticks or button pushing. He did this because of a sore he had developed on his finger during one of the weeks of flight training, which caused him pain whenever he touched something with the NSL he would never have to worry about that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Bryan knew nothing about the NSL or that it wouldn't activate until he pressed a particular button on the console. All Bryan knew was that right in front of him was an alien ship's control board, and two of the buttons were blinking. Like the rest of the ship the buttons were Red(Hence the name humans gave the race that made them) though the top left looked a little darker than the bottom right. Now he was faced with a choice, which one does he press?</span></div></div>",

The button refused to go down easily, and he realized that if he couldn't get it down soon Jessica would remember that she had something in her mouth and would begin to chew. Panic overtaking him Bryan slammed his fist into the button, and was rewarded with a high pitched wail that tore through the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not sure of the wail was a good or bad sound, but by this point he had ceased to care. His mind had finally registered the fact that he was breathing in pure methane, a poisonous substance to humans, and he felt like his lungs were dissolving. Unable to move, breathe, or even think straight, Bryan was relieved when a white hot fire seemed to come from all around him, and the pain, for a moment, ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew he was dead. There was no other logical explanation for the pain in his lungs suddenly ceasing as it did. Admittedly the pain was caused by the atmosphere aboard an alien starfighter he had only found because he had been at a very small size, which was probably one of the most illogical things that had ever happened to him. Still he was glad it was over. Now he could rest. Slowly, he found that he wasn't going to sleep, and in fact seemed to be more awake with each passing moment.

He was in his room, his bigger than the grand canyon room, and surprisingly it was getting smaller as he watched. He was growing again. Somehow Tommy and Joe had done it. They'd rescued him from getting eaten and digested by Jessica, and now he was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he found that there was a person sitting in the chair by his bed, and he turned to face him directly, and when he got a good look at the man, he swore in at least a dozen languages, and would have continued swearing if he'd known any more swear words, but since he didn't he decided to wait until he was full size, and then figure out where the man had come from, and more importantly what he was doing in Bryan's room when two weeks earlier Bryan had kicked him out of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man Bryan cursed was in fact his cousin. An inventor like himself, though with much more grandiose designs. He had, ten years ago, started a company called Star Technologies, and it was now the leader in the cutting edge. From computers, to nanobots, to travel ad domestic, they developed tomorrow in those labs, and then sold it to the world at wholesale prices. He'd never gotten along with his cousin though because unlike Bryan, Aaron's morals were not what they could be, a fact made obvious by the fact that some of his technology eventually turned deadly. After a few minutes his size was what it had been before this entire fiasco began, and he was staring Aaron in his bright and smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Cousin,\" he said cheerily, and Bryan jumped out from under his covers ready to beat on him, when he realized he was wearing his usual night clothes, which consisted of a pair of underwear and a t-shirt. Pulling the covers off his bed for some addition clothing Bryan stared meanly at Aaron, who continued to smile that annoying smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Aaron? I told you two weeks ago I'm not interested in joining Star Tech,\" he shouted at Aaron, pointing angrily at the door to his bedroom. Aaron, for his part, seemed shocked by this pronouncement, and pulled out a calculator from his pocket. Typing in some numbers he began mumbling to himself as he got up and walked out the door. Bryan, now alone in his room, checked his body for the scrapes and bruises he had acquired on his little adventure, and was surprised to find that they were all gone, and he was pretty sure Aaron had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed slowly, he was surprised to find his stuff was not put away anymore, as it had been in preparation for his leaving. Instead his closet was full of clothes like it usually was, and he pulled off a pair of jeans and shoved them on as fast as he could so that he could catch Aaron before he left. His rapid pace was shown to be unnecessary, as he found Aaron sitting at his table, calmly reading his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, what did you do!?\" Bryan demanded, and Aaron slowly set the paper down in front of himself, and motioned for Bryan to take a seat opposite him. Doing so with only partially held back rage Bryan stared at his cousin, barely able to keep himself from leaping across the table and dragging the answers out of that still smiling face. The paper, today's paper, was slid across the table by his cousin, and Aaron pointed at it as if it explained everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan, would you please read the date on that paper?\" he asked his cousin politely, and Bryan did so. At first he couldn't believe his eyes, and thought it was some kind of a trick, but when he looked back at his cousin, and then back over his house he realized that his cousin didn't care enough about him to pull a joke like this on him, and that the house was exactly like it was, two weeks ago. He wondered for a moment if everything he had experienced was a dream, but looking back at his cousin he saw that he was tossing a small device that looked like an ampule for medicine, though it had lights and readouts all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I did Bryan, was safe your life. You know you really need to be more careful about where you shrink cousin,\" he said an off hand kind of way. So off hand that Bryan almost missed what he said and was about to yell at him some more before it clicked in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean shrink?\" he asked, hoping that his cousin was grasping at straws, but then from out of his other hand Aaron pulled a bottle of the shrinking potion Bryan had developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean this stuff. I figured out your plan as soon as I heard about your upcoming vacation, and decided that you might need a little insurance. I'm surprised you take such dangerous risks Bryan. You never struck me as that kind of man, but then again I guess it is a fetish, and you made up some good reason in your mind about why you were doing it,\" Aaron told him, looking at the vial in his hand with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Bryan, this time in an interested way. He really had no idea where Aaron was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan, you're a macrophile. I don't know way but you get a kick out of being small especially around people. I really shouldn't talk considering I'm a voraephile myself, and that's almost the same, if a little more specific. Still I wonder if you even knew you were that, or that there are hundreds of thousands of people who are just like you out there. People who would pay money for the experience you just had,\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about them but the experience I just had was one of the most frightening in my life, and I don't think I'll ever do it again,\" he told his cousin straight to his face, though he knew it was a lie. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to do it again, and he also wanted to know what that device his cousin held was, and how it had brought him back two weeks into the past. Aaron followed Bryan's eyes, and smiled that annoying smile of his again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like this Bryan?\" he asked, holding out the ampule to his cousin. Bryan took the device and found that everything about it was dead, probably wasted saving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked Aaron as he handed the currently useless device back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it a Second Chance Tag. Basically it uses a form of quantum waveform manipulation to alter the structure of the temporal, making it so that when the wave form reaches the end, and your life with it, represented by a twisting in the wave, it sends the final pattern back to the moment in which the SCT is used, giving you a second chance at life,\" said Aaron as he put the ampule back into his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it you want Aaron, and don't tell me you don't want anything, you get that look in your eyes every time you have business deal forming in that twisted little brain of your's,\" said Bryan as he stared across the table at Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I do have a business deal forming, one I think you'll like. I want to open a small side business. Macrophiles Anonymous. A business combining your little shrinking potion, with my SCTs and no dying involved in fulfilling a fantasy that sick twisted minds have, for reasons which are not discussed in good company,\" he told Bryan, holding the vial of shrinking formula, and his SCT crossed like a coat of arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you talked to your shrink lately?\" asked Bryan, though his own mind was already wheeling with the possibilities that this new business presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't as a matter of fact, but I won't either. Bryan I'm offering you chairmanship of the board of this new Star Tech affiliate. You won't have to do anything but give me permission to use your formula, and I can promise you an eight to nine figure salary yearly, and benefits such as free uses of the facility, and our companions that we've already signed up for this little venture,\" said Aaron, pulling a large notebook out of his bag and placing it on the table in front of them. Inside the notebook were pictures of various people all with inserts saying things about what they'd do with small people, most of which would probably have gotten them arrested if anyone thought this was actually possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious about this, aren't you?\" asked Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always serious Bryan. Now if you want my opinion I like Anna the best,\" he told Bryan, flipping the book to a page containing a beautiful Caucasian girl with red hair and green eyes. Her picture showed her eating a sandwich and the insert said something about wanting the reader to be in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people are all freaks,\" commented Bryan as he continued to flip through the book, which had the logo of Star Tech already on the cover, with a bigger logo for MA above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they are. Some of them are probably certifiable, but then again so are a lot of people who will actually want their services. Now Bryan, will you deny these people the chance to live a dream, and yourself the same chance, or will you sign on with me?\" asked Aaron as he watched Bryan continue to flip through the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on something very important,\" said Bryan as he stopped flipping through the book and looked Aaron in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" asked Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Tiffany free this evening?\" he said, holding open the book and showing a picture of one of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can make arrangements,\" responded Aaron, looking at the girl and complementing his cousin's choice. Together the two stared at each other in silence for a moment before breaking out in laughter. They stayed up half the night going over the details, and in the morning the two left, each knowing that they had struck the deal of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please look for Macrophiles Anonymous, an interactive story coming soon to my portfolio here on Writing.com)</span></div></div>",

A thought filtered through his stressed out mind that the alien fighter and the getting eaten by Jessica incident had been just a strange dream of some sort, and that he was actually still safe in his own home, which looked to be in titanic proportions to him, though he was hoping that it was just because he was imagining things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't, and Bryan would figure this out as he looked around, and discovered that his vast plain of white was full of holes, some big enough for him to hide in. He saw nothing in the distance save his own home and was wondering what exactly had just happened, but his wondering would never be finished as that moment was soon punctuated by a series of massive earthquakes. Darting his eyes over the area in panic he at last found the source of the vibrations. It was Jessica, returning to the living room after going to the kitchen for a soda, which she was now happily chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was able to finally figure out his situation after rubbing his head and finding a sore spot. On his little impromptu flight around his house he must have knocked himself on the head, probably on the fan, and then he'd dreamed the rest, including the getting eaten by Jessica and the spaceship, as he lay knocked out on her sandwich. Stress did strange things to a person's mind after all, and Bryan had been under a lot of stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long to realize that he was still in a stressful situation though, as the ground under him quaked as Jessica picked it up and brought her sandwich to her mouth. Bryan didn't scream, as he knew it to be a useless gesture, after all he had been screaming at everyone today, and no one had heard him yet. Luckily he was no where near the edge of the sandwich, and watched as Jessica's molars tore into the white plain. Slowly her mouth pulled away and he watched crumbs twice his size fall unnoticed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at Jessica Bryan was considering something that was probably completely irrational, yet he knew it might work. Every time he'd done something, anything, to try and make his situation better, he had inadvertently made it worse through a series of unfortunate events, and just plain bad luck, and now here he was standing on a sandwich about to be eaten by his neighbor's girlfriend. Since trying to get out of things like this had landed him in the situation, Bryan decided it might be best to just sit and wait, maybe accepting his fate would somehow get him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above Jessica was chewing on her first bite of sandwich, and deciding some things herself. One was that Mr. Smith kept fresh ingredients in his house at all times. After all he was going to be gone for weeks, and yet he'd obviously only bought the lettuce and stuff she'd used for her sandwich a day or so ago. The other thing she decided was that she would give that idiot boy of her's a piece of her mind when he got back from wherever he'd gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the third time in a month he'd forgotten about her and she wasn't going to stand for it. Swallowing loudly she licked her lips, getting any stray pieces of sandwich off them and then raised the meal to her mouth, intending to shove as much into her maw as she could in frustration at her boyfriend's lack of attention. Bryan was not privy to what was going through Jessica's mind, but he knew he had to decide now, jump off the sandwich, or stay on and hope for the best.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the sandwich chose the moment to tip backwards, towards Jessica, and so his getting up caused his grip to loosen on the bread, and he fell right towards that gaping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was too wrapped up in her own thoughts to wonder at the strange morsel that hit her tongue, or its odd taste of cotton, rubber, and meat. Instead she focused only on her anger, and shoved the sandwich into her mouth. She felt good as the bread crinkled a little under her push, and then she chomped down as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her, Bryan was pushed back by the sandwich, and instead of being inside Jessica's mouth as she chomped down on her huge bit, he was already on the precipice of her throat, looking down a long dark abyss when all light suddenly went out. He had no chance to grab for a handhold when Jessica's mouth moved again, chewing her latest conquest, and throwing him against the back wall of her mouth, causing the throat muscles to contract automatically around the tiny morsel, and send it on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tiny morsel was in no way in agreement with Jessica's bodily reflexes, but found that his consent counted for little as Jessica's esophagus closed in around him like some fleshy water flume ride, sending him into a dark hole, that was surprisingly getting brighter the farther down he went. Fighting against the muscles as hard as he could did Bryan little good, and soon he felt as if his shoulder would snap under the pressure, before he quite suddenly was thrown from the tube into a larger chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noted was the smell, which was something like a cross between gas, and moldy cheese, but he didn't have long to consider the smell before he hit the bottom of the sac in which he found himself. Surprisingly the bottom was soft, a fact that made sense when he began wading his way through the mush that was Jessica's previous bite of her sandwich. From the grinding and crunching sounds overhead he knew the mush would soon have company, and scrambled as fast as he could to get out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis luck allowed him to do so, and he was just jumping onto the soft, yet firm floor of Jessica's stomach when a loud gulp punctuated the thumping of her heart, and a moment later masticated ooze began to fall from the sky, right on top of the mush that it had been attached to not three minutes before hand. Staring at the odd meeting of mush and mush Bryan realized with a clarity that hit him like a ton of bricks, he was in Jessica's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan for one did not care for the circumstances, and so ran for his life right up against the wall of Jessica's stomach and began to pound on it for all he was worth. He was gratified when the flesh he struck gave under his attacks, and then rippled like it was laughing. He thought for a moment that he had some effect that Jessica might feel, but instead he found a pore in the wall beside him that was almost bigger than him began to gush out a foul smelling liquid that flowed over the stomach's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched in both fascination and horror as the liquid slowly worked its way over the ground towards the mush, and then was down right hysteric when it touched the mush and began to bubble and smoke. He had apparently caused her stomach to begin its work, and he was forced to move away as a pore overhead began to spew acid as well. Finding a clear spot on the wall Bryan began to renew his attack on the fleshy prison, surprised that it gave so easily under his assault, and that it was always able to return to its original shape despite how far it stretched to get out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove and around him Jessica was just starting to feel better about her situation when she got the oddest feeling in her stomach. It was like a slight tickle below her left breast, and though it was very light, it seemed quite insistent on having her attention. A moment later it ended, and yet was soon back with even more force than before. Jessica came to the quick conclusion that she'd eaten too fast, and so decided to wash down her meal and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the last of her sandwich into her mouth she almost swallowed it whole, and then picked up the can of RC cola which she'd found stashed in one of Mr. Smith's cabinets. Lifting the can to her lips she tipped it back and began to take as long a pull as she could manage from it. She was not really a fan of the cola, and was just as happy not to taste it as it washed over her tongue, but was still of the opinion that it was better than beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsider her stomach Bryan was of a far different opinion about Jessica's beverage choice. If she'd been drinking beer he would not be in a severe amount of trouble, but the instant that piece of sandwich landed in the fast filling lake behind him, he knew what was coming and braced himself. The stream of brown liquid began to fall a moment later from the hatch in the ceiling, one he had contemplated climbing too, but knew it wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the liquid touched the stomach floor the walls began to move on their own, and Bryan was hit by the same surface he had been pounding on for a few minutes now. Jessica's stomach, in reaction to the sugar that had just entered, was working double time, and acid began to pour even more furiously from the walls. Seeing this Bryan was unable to do anything but stare, and then, with catlike grace he leaped over the undulating floor, and back to a still unmoving portion of the wall, trying on last time to get Jessica's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in here Jessica! JESSICA!!!\" he shouted as loud as he could, pounding and kicking at the wall with all his might. Jessica did not hear the shouts, which were being drowned out by the sound of her own stomach working if nothing else. She did however feel the tickling return with even more renewed force. Did she assume that she might have eaten a miniaturized human being with her sandwich and that he was trying to get her attention from within her stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a chance. Like any sane person she had assumed that the tickle was just some gas build up, and so was leaning forward slightly now, pressing slightly on her abdomen. With an earth shattering force she let the air out of her stomach, unleashing a terrific belch which would have made Tommy or one of his friends very proud. Jessica was just as happy that no one was around to see her do it though, and then leaned back. The tickle had seemed to slide down for a moment, before vanishing altogether. Her stomach contended Jessica then went about cleaning Mr. Smith's home for his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later the boys would return to the house and frantically search it while the cops waited outside. They had been in lock up for a week because of excessively speeding, 127 miles in a 35 zone. They had told some bull story about a shrunken man and an antidote at his lab. Their search found no little man, or of Jessica for that matter. She had left for a month to visit her aunt up north who was in the hospital with some disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, Tommy, Joe, the police, and Zack would never figure out exactly what happened to Bryan, as Jess never told Tommy about her little visit to Bryan's house, deeming it unimportant. Neither Joe nor Tommy told anyone about the little professor either, thinking that maybe the police who'd let them go after the search of the house were right, maybe there'd been something weird in Mr. Smith's house that caused them to hallucinate.</span></div></div>",

Bryan had shouted and waved his thread-thin arms, all to no avail. The tiny man scrambled backward, but in panic-induced clumsy haste he failed to see the deep pit in the spongy bread. His unexpected plunge back into the bread left him with no sense of direction. He knew that the sandwich continued to shift as he tried to find his way in the surprisingly large honeycomb-like tunnel in the fluffy white bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's first bite of sandwich, well-chewed and swallowed, reminded her that she had forgotten to pour herself a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her plate on Mr. Smith's living room coffee table and went to the kitchen to look in the fridge for something to drink with her sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked inside the refrigerator and sighed. \"Typical bachelor guy,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a bottle of wine and some cans of beer. Then, she saw what she wanted. Grabbing the carton of milk, she walked to the counter. She sniffed at the carton's opening. \"Smells all right,\" she said, although she double-checked by taking a quick peek at the expiration date. She had to squint to read the small letters. Jessica had always been a little near-sighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica poured herself a tall glass of milk, tiny Bryan found himself mired, quite literally, in more difficulty. He followed the winding tunnel, formed during the bread's baking process, looking for a way back to the surface of the bread. Without warning, however, the tunnel sloped steeply, and he tumbled into a pool of mayonnaise that had collected in the tunnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man tried to pull himself out of the oily mayo, but the thick substance held him fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man, as he struggled vainly, thought wryly that if only Jessica was a little more health-conscious, she would have avoided mayo on her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jessica returned from the kitchen, still hungry, and with a glass of milk to wash down her meal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He regretted his foolish plan to shrink himself and, with a neighbor kid's unknowing help, mail himself as a surprise to his nephew in California.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time came, however, for Tommy to mail the all-important package, the entire universe seemed to turn against the brilliant scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had survived numerous close calls until, in what he thought at first might be a lucky break, Tommy and his friend, Joe, had detected and, thankfully, correctly identified the tiny scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenagers had rushed to Bryan's lab to recover the antidote. The bug-sized man had remained in his home, presumably safe, to await their return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had met Tommy's girlfriend on previous occasions, but now, knowing how close he had come to being mistaken as a pesky insect by Tommy and his friends, he had done his best to avoid detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had succeeded, for all the good that did him, and now, unknown to the giant girl, was stuck inside the bread of her sandwich, held fast by a blot of mayo. He continued to struggle, knowing that if he didn't escape soon, Jessica would continue eating her sandwich and, consequently, consume him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica returned to the living room and had placed her glass of milk on the table  when Tommy and Joe burst into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, clearly surprised, asked, \"Jessica! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"You asked me to meet you here,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Tommy recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stood next to his friend, sneaking covert glances at Jessica. He'd always thought his buddy lucky for having such an attractive girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy overcame his surprise at Jessica's presence. \"We need to talk to Mr. Smith. They wouldn't let us in his lab!\" Tommy blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, there isn't anyone home,\" Jessica said. She took a seat on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We left him on the kitchen table,\" Tommy said, leaving the living room. \"Mr. Smith! We're back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe trailed his friend, who stopped and scanned the tabletop. \"I don't see him!\" Tommy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very irritated Jessica caught up with the boys. \"Tommy, I told you that Mr. Smith's not here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned and faced Jessica. \"You don't understand! He shrunk himself, and I accidentally demolished his antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went to the lab but they wouldn't let us in,\" Joe chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared at Tommy and then Joe. She didn't detect any signs in their eyes or mannerism. But a shrunken man on a kitchen table. \"Are you both high on something?\" Jessica demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth!\" Tommy protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joe said. \"You should have seen Mr. Smith. He's made himself the size of a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not possible!\" Jessica snapped. \"Thomas, if this is some prank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no prank,\" Tommy assured her. \"Haven't you seen him? We left him there on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see any little man,\" Jessica said, beginning to waver. \"I did fix myself a sandwich, but not at the kitchen table. If you really left him there, where has he gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Joe exchanged a glance. \"That does make sense, Tommy,\" Joe said. \"It's not like someone his size would get far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked angry now. \"Yeah, where is he? Oh, Mr. Smith! Come out, wherever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked down expectantly at the table.  \"But, we both saw him!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both ridiculous!\" Jessica pronounced. She turned and headed back to the living room to continue her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan, despite his sticky situation, managed to overhear most of the conversation. He screamed valiantly, hoping Tommy might be more alert to teeny sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis additional incentive helped give him the strength to pull himself free from the mayonnaise. He climbed back to the surface of the bread just in time to see Jessica reaching for the plate that held her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan screamed as Jessica lifted her sandwich. \"Tommy!

Oh great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had fallen into the glass of milk Jessica had poured herself to enjoy with the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paddled to the edge of the glass, but an oval ring of glass three times his height proved a barrier between the top of the glass and the level of the milk. He tried to scramble up the slick walls, but splashed back into the white liquid with each attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately knew this was even worse than finding himself on her sandwich. He could jump free of the sandwich. Escape from the giant glass looked impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy continued to wear a bewildered look on his face. He didn't want to continue looking foolish in front of his girlfriend, but he knew he should try to find Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat down on the sofa in the living room to enjoy her sandwich. She glared at Tommy and Joe as she took a bite from the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she realized she had forgotten her glass of milk. She swallowed and spoke in a less angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, could you bring me my glass of milk?\" Jessica asked. \"I left it on the kitchen table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Tommy said, eager to regain her good graces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, treading water, or rather milk, noticed the ripples spread across the surface of the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the ripples increased as Tommy stomped across the kitchen floor toward the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around the almost bare table, looking one last time for his shrunken part-time employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing any sign of a tiny man, Tommy stretched his hand for the glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, once again left in utter awe of the giant youth, splashed and screamed. \"In here!\" Bryan screamed. \"Tommy, please. I'm in the glass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave submerged the tiny man as Tommy lifted the glass from the table and returned to the living room to deliver the milk to his girlfriend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, he found himself trapped in his teenaged neighbor's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he sits down again, I'm doomed,\" Bryan said as he squirmed and tried to find a path around the huge wallet that blocked his exit from the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy kissed his girlfriend again and reminded her he had bought them some time by sending Joe off on a pizza run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, revealing second thoughts. \"I don't like fooling around in someone else's home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith will never know,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven inside the cramped pocket, the shrunken scientist heard Jessica and Tommy. Based on what he heard, he was just as glad he was inside the pocket and unable to witness the spectacle of two teenagers running amuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt the denim chamber plunge to the floor. He could not see anything outside the pocket, but he was fairly sure that Tommy was no longer wearing the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering something about \"teenagers and hormones,\" the little man chose to look at the development as a positive one. The wallet had shifted, opening a corridor of space toward a glint of light at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before he charged into the light, he had second thoughts. If he left the pocket, he was sure to find himself on the floor again. Based on his experience so far, stranded on the floor around giant feet was the last place he wanted to find himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith hatched an alternative idea. What if he crawled inside the wallet? Eventually, when Tommy opened his wallet, he was bound to see him. The tiny man liked the merits of the plan...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Climbing into Tommy's wallet seemed the one option that had the potential to get him noticed, again, by his titanic teenaged neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into the wallet wasn't as easy as he imagined. He had to cross a field of cracked leather in the folds of the entrance to the wallet. The entry into the enormous wallet was blocked by the bills and other items Tommy kept stashed in the over-stuffed object. He pushed in as far as he could manage, telling himself it would be better not to burrow too deep inside the leather container. After all, his goal was to get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the encounter between Tommy and Jessica didn't go as anticipated. Tommy, despite the distraction, found his mind kept spinning back to his tiny neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, even Jessica commented on his lack of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it,\" Tommy admitted with some embarrassment. \"I'm worried about Mr. Smith. He's so tiny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not going to try that again,\" Jessica snapped. \"I am not going to stand here and listen to you try to pull a prank on me about your itty-bitty shrunken neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, you don't get it,\" Tommy said. \"He's so tiny, he must be so scared. Maybe we should look for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica straightened her clothes. \"Look for him all you want,\" she announced. \"I'm going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she flounced from the living room, leaving Tommy standing in his boxer shorts and T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still hadn't put on his jeans when Joe returned a few moments later, finding Tommy kneeling under the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, where's Jessica?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Tommy banged his head beneath the table. \"She left,\" he said. \"She still thinks I made it up about Mr. Smith shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" Joe said. \"Can we eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy got to his feet, scratching at the front of his boxers. \"Sure, I guess we can look for him later,\" he said. \"I still don't get why he would hide from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, they've gone up on the price of pizza,\" he said. \"You owe me another five bucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned. \"Well, I'll grab my wallet, you get us some drinks from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucked away inside Tommy's wallet, Mr. Smith still felt the vibrations from the titan's approaching footsteps. He grew excited, hoping discovery might not be so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tommy returned to the kitchen, Joe had already opened the pizza box and took a seat at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got extra-extra cheese!\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Tommy said.

He had been unprepared when Tommy opened the wallet wide. That, coupled with the pull of gravity, caused the shrunken scientist's unfortunate plunge. It could have been worse. He didn't fall hundreds of feet to a hard, unforgiving floor but instead landed with a plop in the midst of a blob of gooey cheese atop the pizza. The soft landing not withstanding, Mr. Smith felt a surge of fright when he saw Joe and Tommy greedily snatch slices of pizza from the open box. Neither of the teenaged titans took the piece holding his tiny body, which gave him time to struggle out of the sticky bog of congealed cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pushed through the greasy sludge, the bug-sized man gave thanks that the trip from the pizza place to his home had required a 20-minute drive, giving the pizza time to cool slightly. Falling into a swamp of scalding hot cheese would have been a most unpleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a little nervous at how hard he had to strain to get any traction in the cheesy pit. His plunge had buried him past his waist in the greasy cheese, which now tried to hold him in place. He glanced skyward and watched as his titanic neighbor and the teen's gigantic friend shoved the enormous pizza slices into their gaping mouths. They made short work of the slices, which gave the tiny unseen man extra motivation to escape the cheesy trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each setback, the little scientist began to appreciate that, despite all his intelligence, his utter lack of size had begun to dictate his fate.The novelty of finding himself ant-sized in a world of titans had worn off, replaced by the knowledge that his new world had transformed into an extremely cruel universe where even the casual actions of a titan could mean instant destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis actions so far had been motivated by his need to regain contact with Tommy, forgetting with what scant regard a teenager would normally consider the life of a mere bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human wouldn't be defeated by a greasy blot of cheese, but for a man reduced to the size of a bug, falling onto a sticky slice of cheese pizza presented a huge obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe reached for another slice of pizza. The tiny man saw the huge hand descending and screamed. \"Tommy! Help! I'm here. I'm stuck on the pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a violent grace, Joe ripped the slice from the neighboring slice where the unnoticed little bug of a man screamed unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat close call made the shrunken scientist realize the importance of getting one of the titans to notice him if he wanted to avoid taking a one-way trip through a titanic teen's digestive tract. He thrashed his body around in the gooey cheese, attempting to break free of its sticky clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance skyward again saw Tommy's hand reaching for the pizza in its cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Please! See me!\" The mammoth teen's tiny neighbor pleaded as loudly as he could manage.</span></div></div>",

He then leaned across the table and glanced hungrily down into the box. The first slice of pizza had merely whetted his appetite for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand reached in and grabbed a slice of the pizza. A string of cheese, connected to the neighboring slice, extended and stretched as he lifted his slice out of the box. The teenager used a finger to roll up the cheese, and then stuck the finger into his mouth, sucking off the cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, this is good,\" he said. He had no idea of the awesome show he was producing for a speck-sized man trapped in the gooey cheese on the slice he had just removed from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend, Joe, pulled up a chair as well, already holding a half-eaten second slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we finished eating, you are going to have to help me find Mr. Smith,\" Tommy said. \"We'll have to look over every inch of the house until we find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if there's nothing to find?\" Joe asked. \"Maybe he shrank away to nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's expression turned to one of shock. \"You really think that could have happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell would I know?\" Joe said, stuffing more pizza into his mouth. \"But, I tell you, I've got better things to do than look for your puny-ass neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith felt the slice of pizza being lifted after Tommy reached his gigantic hand into the box. So far, nothing he had done had helped extricate him from the bog of sticky cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza flew forward toward an opening mouth, showing the tiny man an unwanted scene consisting of two rows of huge teeth, a massive tongue and, deeper into the shadows, a deep tunnel of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, no!\" The shrunken scientist screamed. \"Tommy, help! Help me! Don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive jaws snapped shut, tearing off about a third of the slice of pizza. Mr. Smith began to cry as he realized how close the teenager's simple bite had come to engulfing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please,\" he begged now to whoever might listen. \"I'm a man. Please, don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, put yourself in his shoes,\" Tommy responded irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sort of hard to do,\" Joe joked. \"Being he's such a teeny bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got to be here somewhere,\" Tommy remained positive. He raised his voice, speaking to the room. \"Mr. Smith, if you can hear me, try to let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe rolled his eyes and reached for another slice of pizza. \"I think you're wasting your time,\" he said. \"If he was still here, why would he be hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same thought had occurred to Tommy. \"He could be scared, or hurt,\" Tommy speculated. \"I just hope he knows we did our best. It's not our fault they wouldn't let us into his lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could have told them why we needed into the lab,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we don't find him soon, we might have to do that,\" Tommy said, moving the pizza slice toward his mouth as his thoughts continued to focus on the mystery of his tiny neighbor's disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe Jessica stomped on him or something,\" Joe said. \"She was here before we got back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked sickened by the thought. \"Way to ruin my appetite, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man tried to slog through the cheese. He surged forward only to fall flat on his face, sinking into the greasy, disgusting swamp of cheese. When he raised his face, he saw the pizza moving toward Tommy's colossal open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the two giant teens discussing him. \"I'm here,\" he cried again. \"Please, you've got to hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy still felt unsettled by Joe's theory that something bad could have happened to Mr. Smith.

He put the pizza down on a napkin spread over the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe she sat on him,\" Joe shrugged. \"She said she cleaned up. Maybe she tossed him out with the garbage. Isn't that what happened in that movie about those shrunken kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy remembered the old movie. He got up from the table and walked over to Mr. Smith's kitchen garbage can. The bin had a fresh plastic bag lining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's not there now,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the discussion, neither of the enormous youths paid the slightest attention to the bug-sized scientist slogging his way through a swamp of cheese and tomato sauce in which floated islands of pepperoni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to the table. \"How did that movie end?\" Tommy asked Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that nerdy scientist guy found the kids floating in his cereal,\" Joe said, punctuating his statement with a laugh. \"That was a funny movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those kids got stranded outside the house!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"I never even thought of that!

He opened the fridge and looked at the contents. \"There's a carton of yogurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...what's the expiration date?\" Tommy asked, grasping at any straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe read the date. \"Damn, it's still good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is in there?\" Tommy pushed Joe aside and began to rummage through the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found what he needed when he discovered a plastic container of fresh mushrooms that were well past their freshness date. The mushrooms looked ghastly white and had acquired a coat of slime. He felt sick just looking at them, and he had always hated mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those might do it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better move over to the sink,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just throw up in the sink.\" Tommy thought out his plan. \"What if tiny Mr. Smith falls down the drain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged and looked beneath the sink, finding a plastic bucket. \"Will this do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned. \"Yeah, I think it will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked one of the slimy mushrooms from the carton. \"Oh god, that looks awful,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaves of acid tossed the tiny pizza raft back and forth within Tommy's cavernous stomach.

Just as the surge gained velocity, he fell off the pizza crust raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower esophageal sphincter closed off after emptying a significant amount of Tommy's recent meal from the stomach chamber. However, when the tight muscle of the sphincter closed again, an even more desperate Mr. Smith found himself on the wrong side, still trapped within his gigantic teenaged neighbor's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tommy finally stopped retching, he made a careful examination, but he didn't see any sign of his tiny neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, did you find him?\" Joe asked without offering to get too close to his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Tommy admitted in a defeated voice. \"I guess I really did imagine it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the stomach, the teenager's shrunken neighbor discovered that Tommy's stomach was still producing a full load of powerful digestive acids, only now much of the food had been evacuated from the cavernous chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man now faced the full fury of a teenager's stomach in full digestive mode.

Mr Smith screamed in terror at the quickly advancing wave of cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy tried to guzzle his soda so that he could start looking for his tiny neighbor. However trying to gulp down the whole bite of pizza as well as a stream of soda proved to be too much. He gagged on the overload and coughed out the contents of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh! What the hell?!\" Joe cried out jumping from his seat. Tommy was doubled over, facing the floor, coughing and trying to regain his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith lay on the ground feeling extremely dizzy. One moment he had been swirling down Tommy's throat with pizza and cola and the next he was practically in free-fall, violently ejected outwards into the blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he regained focus he could see Tommy above him coughing and gasping, his mouth wide open. Mr. Smith stared at Tommy's mouth, the teeth visible behind the lips. He had barely survived his young neighbor's appetite and nearly went on a one way trip through the teenager's digestion system! It was terrifying and oddly humbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt his senses return to normal and doing a quick mental check decided he was for the most part physically fine he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to move away from the soggy pile of chewed food he had landed near, so as to be more noticeable to his massive neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe recovered from his initial shock and started patting Tommy on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Tommy wheezed, his breathing returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked at the pile of soggy chewed pizza, surrounded by a puddle of brown cola, on the linoleum floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, you gotta clean that up\" he said making a face. Just before he looked away, Joe noticed a speck slowly moving away from the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe tracked it with his eyes for a second. \"Hey...\" he murmured, \"... Tommy you choked on a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Joe takes a step forward.  Tommy's eyes locate it on the floor. \"Huh?\" he grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe casually lifts his foot over the speck to crush it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, WAIT!\" Tommy shouts just before a loud smack echoes across the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Just lift up your foot a little bit... and... and I'll... um... look I guess\" he stammers, his heart thudding in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy leans down  behind Joe's foot. \"Okay be careful and lift it\" he orders. Joe lifts the heel of his foot slowly. Tommy concentrates on the opening space. A strand of chewed pizza hangs from the shoe sole swinging. For a second it is the only thing moving. Then a speck begins rapidly moving out of the shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move a muscle!\" Tommy commands excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had screamed in terror as the scene from his dream had become reality. Joe had lifted his filthy Airwalk over him, and without a moment's hesitation, the giant slammed his shoe down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had slowed down as all at once Mr. Smith thought how the titanic teen was supposed to be looking for him, while also noticing the grime in his treads, while also remembering his nephew Zack whom he would never see again, for whom this entire ordeal had been orchestrated and Zack would never know. Just before the shoe made contact Mr. Smith thought \"I'm a genius. This isn't fair.\" and then abruptly \"My own fucking fault.\" Then the shoe crushed him into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly he was still alive. Mr. Smith's ears rung and his body hurt from the deafening and jarring impact. But he was alive and in one piece. He laughed nervously as his mind rejoiced his survival. He was still trapped in darkness as Joe did not move his massive foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith realized a simple shift of the foot could abruptly end his celebration and he dared not move. Finally light appeared in the distance and the shoe sole slowly lifted upwards. Mr. Smith squinted in the flood of light. Ahead he could see Joe's shoe sole tilted upwards, strings of chewed pizza from Tommy's mouth hanging from the grimy tread. In the light he could see Tommy's face, full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith let out a whoop of joy and ran full speed towards the teenager's handsome face. As he ran recognition and joy glinted in Tommy's eyes and he shouted something that Mr. Smith failed to process. He did not slow down until he was clear of the shadow of Joe's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy held out his finger to the speck of a man. Mr. Smith scaled it and Tommy brought his finger to his face. When his eyes focused on his tiny neighbor he could see that the man lay down flat, clinging to the fingertip. \"Oh! Oops, sorry.\" he apologized, not realizing how jarring his movements were for the tiny man. His apologies however caused the tiny man to clasp his ears. Tommy lowered his voice and apologized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we found you...\" Tommy said just above a whisper. He stared at the tiny man in wonder. It was incredible. Mr. Smith had survived nearly being squished by Joe... and almost being eaten by Tommy. For a moment Tommy tried to comprehend just how careless he and Joe had been with what seemed to be normal actions but had at the same time been life threatening for the tiny Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stared at the man on Tommy's finger unable to say anything; wave after wave of guilt assaulting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy realized they were doing nothing. And clearly they had to do something.</span></div></div>",

It came from your food! You did NOT just almost eat your neighbor... how would he have even gotten there? It's not him.\" Joe finished his quick jumble of sentences sounding determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't reply immediately. He continues to look at Joe and his dirty Airwalk. Finally he replies, barely above a whisper \"Then move your shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looks at his shoe, which he had been straining to keep in place. Jerking his left leg backwards, he keeps his balance by stepping on the tiptoes of his left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

His face contorts and then, to Tommy's surprise, morphs into anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was his fault! I didn't know! It was an accident! Why was he so tiny anyway?!\" Joe paused before glaring at Tommy. \"Besides, you almost ate him! So you're no Saint either\" As Joe continued his voice was slowly rising and he was practically yelling at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned and then felt himself become angry. \"How the hell was I supposed to know?! You should have remembered we were about to start looking for a BUG-SIZED MAN!!!!\" Tommy screamed at Joe, placing full blame on his friend for his neighbor's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe sputters, not forming any words. \"BUG!!! SIZED!!! MAN!!!\" Tommy repeats loudly, anger and sadness mixing together and being aimed at Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stares at Tommy, shock on his face. He then spins around. \"Fuck you! FUCK YOU!!\" he shouts running out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy starts to follow, but upon hearing Joe's heavy footsteps he cannot bring himself to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stares at the floor, trying to stifle tears, guilt, anger, and sadness threatening to overwhelm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he cleans up and goes home. He knows he cannot tell anyone, the story is too outrageous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the police come knocking about the missing Bryan Smith, Tommy can only tell them that the man had left him in charge of the house. His mother tells him that the man was something of a father figure for Tommy, so the police take what he says and do not come back. Naturally they have no leads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joe tries to talk to Tommy at school a few days later, asking if he told anyone, Tommy glares at him and replies harshly \"Of course not\" before glancing at Joe's feet. The feet with the same Airwalks that had ended Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still wearing those?!\" he asks incredulously, unable to keep calm. Joe stutters, \"T..they're my only p...pair of sh...shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stares at him in disbelief. \"Fuck off\" he says quietly and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looks down at his shoes. He hadn't even looked at the sole since Tommy had. He wouldn't. He couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It wasn't my fault' Joe began chanting in his head. It was the same chant he'd had since the other day at Mr. Smith's house. He walked down the hallway, trying to ignore the smack if his shoes hitting the floor.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re my only chance!\u201d But his pleas roused no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a loud gulp behind him which sent a shiver down his spine. Mr. Smith turned in time to see a massive hand fly at him and snatch up the slice. Mr. Smith felt nauseous as the world went by in a blur. He stopped in front of Joe\u2019s lips. The giant\u2019s tongue appeared and caught some stray crumbs. Before Mr. Smith could react the mouth yawned open, the tongue shot forward and Joe took a bite of the slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith yelped in fear and winced but opened his eyes when he felt himself move backwards. He was still outside the mouth, still on the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoe!\u201d he screamed, in yet a millionth attempt to get a titan\u2019s attention.  But Mr. Smith suddenly refocused on Joe\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man lacked refined manners and often chewed with his mouth open. Mr. Smith was mesmerized and horrified by the sight. The lips parted and blurs of yellow shoved by the tongue could be seen just behind the teeth. When the jaws came together a  sickening squish was heard. Mr. Smith watched unable to look away as Joe thoughtlessly obliterated his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the jaw, up and down. Listened to the sounds as they became soggier. Watched the pizza become a disgusting blob. And suddenly the lips pursed and the familiar sound of swallowing was heard. Joe\u2019s mouth gaped open and he stopped breathing. Mr. Smith realized what was happening too late. A deafening gale ripped from his throat. Mr. Smith coughed as the wall of stench hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he chewed Joe imagined what he could be doing this afternoon. He could be shooting hoops or seeing a movie with a cute girl. But no. Instead he was helping Tommy search for his teeny neighbor. Joe didn\u2019t even know the guy, why should he give up his afternoon for him. But he was willing to help his friend, at least for a few hours. If they didn\u2019t find anything by then, he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he swallowed he felt some pressure in his chest. He let out a loud burp that made him proud. He was disappointed no one was around to hear it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind moved on and Joe took another bite from the slice of pizza, savoring the rich flavor of cheese, pepperoni, and grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith screamed again as Joe\u2019s mouth opened again. Chewed chunks of pizza were spread across the tongue and jammed into his jagged teeth. The pizza shot forward as the tongue extended to catch it\u2019s next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooooo!\u201d Mr. Smith wailed as Joe\u2019s teeth came together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world erupted into chaos. He felt himself thrown about and prayed he wouldn\u2019t end up between the teeth. Light flashed through the cavern and he saw blurry glimpses of his kitchen. He could see flashes of teeth coming together and bits of pizza raining everywhere. The sight was like being in a horrible nightmare. He felt jealous of Joe. For the giant it was a simple snack. For him, it was a disgusting, chaotic, and deadly ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movement finally stopped Mr. Smith sighed in relief. He was still in one piece, and had managed not to puke. But his celebration was short lived. In less than a second Joe moved the slice to the back of his mouth. Mr. Smith managed to barely cry out as he was shoved down the throat and disappeared into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat in disbelief as he was massaged down the esophagus with the pizza. He had been swallowed alive by a teenage boy. He gasped as, along with the food, he was dumped into the stomach. With a splat he joined the pile of chewed pizza in Joe\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno\u2026 No\u2026 NO\u2026 NO!!!\u201d he wailed. \u201cI can\u2019t die in some teenager\u2019s stomach like a piece of food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he screamed in anger, Mr. Smith failed to notice the grinding sounds above him. As his shouts of fury quickly turned to sobs of despair he still didn\u2019t notice the sound of a gulp. Only when the food reached the entrance to the stomach did he look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as the food slammed into him from above. It buried him and all the weight at the top of the mountain of chewed food caused an avalanche within the stomach. Mr. Smith was knocked out as the food settled with him near the bottom. He never awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this reached Joe after he chewed and swallowed the last piece. He didn\u2019t feel the shifting mountain in his stomach. He didn\u2019t even think about the food sitting inside him awaiting digestion as he half-heartedly searched Mr. Smith\u2019s house. By the time he left to go home, his stomach had started digestion. But as usual Joe ignored it. He didn\u2019t notice the gurgles emitting from his belly. He was completely unconscious of the food being churned and torn apart in his gut. He had all but forgotten the meal as he stared at the television that night, his stomach moving the final remains to the next step in digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the horrible occurrence that had happened deep within his body, Joe didn\u2019t give that pizza another thought. For him it had been just another uneventful meal, just another slice of pizza, just another piece of food, and nothing would ever make him realize otherwise.</span></div></div>",

Tommy, look down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stared at the slice, still frowning at the thought of Jessica crushing poor Mr. Smith. However his eyes didn't really see as his mind considered and tried to deny that possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the only way to find out if you're right or not is to look,\" Tommy finally said decisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked up, a string of cheese hanging from his lips. He took a moment to swallow before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I can look for an hour or two. But they're having a 'That 70's Show' marathon at 4,\" he replied seriously. With that he popped the rest of the slice into his mouth. He stood up, but stopped and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey when you're done, can I have this for the marathon?\" Joe asked pointing at the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy rolled his eyes. \"Sure, whatever. You pretty much ruined my appetite with the crushing comment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\" replied Joe with a grin. He closed the box and stored it in the fridge for safekeeping until he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll look in the living room while you finish,\" said Joe with a shrug. He disappeared through the door to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy brought the slice to his mouth. As he took a bite, his eyes scanned the kitchen, looking for some sign of his minuscule neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Help me! I'm right here!\" Mr. Smith screamed. But Tommy's eyes while seeming to look right at him, showed no sign of recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Joe stood and spoke with Tommy, Mr. Smith continued to try to slog through the cheese. His throat stung from the constant screaming, and his legs were sore from fighting through the thick cheese and sauce with so little progress. He stopped and looked up at Tommy\u2019s face. He knew his predicament was near hopeless. Here he was a mere speck on a teenaged boy\u2019s food, covered in sauce and indiscernible from the rest of the slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the slice move under his feet. The giant\u2019s eyes focused elsewhere as Mr. Smith and the pizza floated upwards, specifically towards the giant\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, no! Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d Mr. Smith pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plea went unnoticed, as had all the others before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy\u2019s mouth widened and his tongue seemed to quiver in anticipation of the food. Mr. Smith could see the chewed remains of his previous bite still littered across the tongue and jammed into his straight, white teeth. The uvula hung over the entrance to a black hole in the back: the throat. The point of no return\u2026 his unwilling destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy! Please hear me! I\u2019m on your pizza! DON\u2019T EAT ME!!\u201d screeched the tiny man. He struggled to move, to do something to prevent his obvious fate. His panicked mind struggled to find a solution. But as he passed between the lips and the wave of stench and humidity hit him, he knew there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had gone from a beacon of salvation to a monster of destruction. Before Mr. Smith could let out another plea for help, Tommy\u2019s teeth came together and with a rip sealed Mr. Smith and the slice of pizza inside his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nTommy stood as he started to chew. He scanned the counters for any sort if movement. He sincerely wanted to help out his tiny neighbor who had been so kind to him over the years. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what the world would seem like at that size. How hard it would be to get around. How easily someone it would be to be overlooked or mistaken for a bug and be crushed\u2026 Tommy grimaced at the thought, and continued searching while trying to remain positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nMr. Smith screamed uncontrollably. Not for attention but from pure terror. He was being thrown about in pitch blackness. All around him was the sloshing and crushing sounds of pizza being annihilated. He knew he had to avoid the monstrous teeth, but he couldn\u2019t see or much less control where he went. He felt a sharp pain in his back and for a moment panicked that he was about to be crushed. But he had bounced of the side of a molar and smacked face down into a slimy and wet surface. He took it to be Tommy\u2019s tongue and grasped as tightly as he could, while more food rained down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it all stopped. Mr. Smith looked around in the sudden calm, but he was still unable to see. He felt the tongue move again and heard the squelch as Tommy swallowed the bulk of the pizza in his mouth. Mr. Smith sighed in relief, overjoyed to not have gone with it. He decided to yell out again and inhaled sharply. However he coughed on the stale air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded the cavern again. Mr. Smith squinted as his eyes adjusted. He looked straight up to see a molar towering above him, a bit of cheese hanging off the side. To his right was the opening to the mouth. He could see still more chinks of food across the tongue. But beyond the lips he saw the world he once knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough simply his kitchen counters he felt a sharp pang of regret. He wished he could undo all of this, and be safe and normal sized. A yellow plain dotted with red circles obscured his view. The pizza moved closer as Tommy prepared to finish the slice. Mr. Smith felt defeated. A tear rolled down his cheek as the pizza was shoved in. He gave no effort to scream as the light waned and the lips came together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hands free of the pizza, Tommy began to gingerly lift up appliances to see if Mr. Smith had taken refuge beneath them. As he swallowed the bite he had just taken, Tommy felt more energized. He wouldn\u2019t stop searching until he found Mr. Smith. With a renewed determination, Tommy smiled and continued to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith hadn\u2019t screamed when he was again surrounded by the sounds of chewing. He didn\u2019t make a sound as he was swept to the middle of the mouth. When he was roughly forced into the titan\u2019s throat he didn\u2019t even grunt. As he sank deeper into the giant\u2019s body he sat, frozen and in shock at his predicament. His only thought was that of regret and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, along with the pizza, were squeezed into the stomach. With a splat Mr. Smith\u2019s island connected with the rest of the pizza Tommy had already swallowed. As he fell Mr. Smith snapped out of his inaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of soggy chewed pizza sitting in the stomach and his fall had made him furious. Even more than that. He was a human being, an extremely smart one at that. He didn\u2019t deserve to die unnoticed in some teenager\u2019s gut with a pizza snack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn animal like cry sounded from him. \u201cNO! I DON\u2019T DESERVE THIS! WHY ME?! I\u2019VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!!\u201d He ran around alternately stomping and beating at the stomach wall. Its gentle pulsing that didn\u2019t respond to him seemed to mock him. This only made Mr. Smith more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMMIT TOMMY, HEAR ME!! I\u2019M IN YOUR DAMNED STOMACH!!\u201d he bellowed. He suddenly tripped over a bit of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to sob uncontrollably. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!!\u201d he wailed. He heard a squelch and stomach acid began to pool around the hill of chewed pizza. Mr. Smith scrambled up the slope to avoid it. But he slipped on the soggy pizza and landed head first on a \u201cledge\u201d of pizza. The blunt-force trauma knocked tiny Mr. Smith out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy searched the kitchen and moved to the master bedroom. He walked carefully and reminded Joe to watch his step. Even after Joe left he continued to search. He was so focused on his search he didn\u2019t notice how loud his stomach was as it churned and broke down the food from earlier. Finally late into the night Tommy\u2019s mother came over and demanded he come home, unable to understand why he had stayed at the empty house so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy\u2019s shoulders sagged, but he didn\u2019t try to explain to his mother. He knew she wouldn\u2019t believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably starving! Have you eaten anything? I\u2019ll whip something up when we get home,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy nodded. He was hungry again, not having eaten anything since the pizza. He decided he would return the next morning after a good night\u2019s sleep and breakfast. He would keep looking. He wouldn\u2019t give up until he found Mr. Smith.</span></div></div>",

They were effortlessly downing their slices, which to Mr. Smith were the size of a couple baseball fields. Between their chatter about a new video game, the chomping and greedy gulps struck Mr. Smith with ice fear. He was unable to tear his eyes as he watched each boy lift a slice to their wide open mouth and outstretched tongue. Piece by piece more of the pizza would disappear into their gaping maws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, horrified by this display, only fought harder against the thick cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude the graphics--\" Joe paused to swallow \"--are freaking epic!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took another bite of his slice and nodded his head, \"I know, Since Mr. Smith payed me I can afford it, I just need to go to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go now...\" Joe trailed off before popping the last piece of his pizza into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy gave him an annoyed look \"No, we're gonna look for Mr. Smith when we're done!\" he replied forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's another hour for him?\" Joe asked as he picked up another slice. \"We could stop at my house and I could give you the cheats an--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy cut him off \"It's just a game, I can wait...\" however his voice betrayed his hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith's legs were quickly giving out, unable to be under such strain for so long. He could hear the giants discussing leaving for a game. Though hurt that a game could take priority over finding him, he hoped if they left he would be able to escape the pizza unharmed. He felt a jarring tremor and turned his head in fear. At the crust he could see a set of long, rough fingers grasping at the slice he was trapped on. Joe pulled the slice out of the box turning Mr. Smith's world into dizzying chaos. He cried out, tears streaming down his face, \"Joe! Help me, please don't eat me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe paused with his slice in front of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just head off now, then we can get back sooner to look for him. Maybe it would give him time to get into a good spot to be found faster!\" Joe suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy swallowed as he weighed his options.</span></div></div>",

The massive teenager had nearly taken him in with the first bite. He chewed with his mouth open, the obnoxious squishes and flashes of soggy food only served to deepen Mr. Smith's terror. While he admired Tommy's loyalty, he couldn't help but wonder what it would have meant for his fate had they left. He wasn't left with time to think as a loud gulp sounded in front of him. He had been so shocked by the bite and lost in thought, he hadn't moved at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! JOE WAIT!!\" he screamed as the island of pizza moved beneath him. The giant however paid no attention to the screaming speck on his food. As his mouth widened, his tongue shot forward. Mr. Smith shuddered in disgust at the bits of cheese, bread, and pepperoni that clung to the tongue. Though mere remnants of the bite that had existed seconds ago, most were at least equal in size to the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's all I am' Mr. Smith thought sadly. 'No bigger than a chewed crumb on some teenager's tongue'. Joe's breath was a wall of humidity that reeked of cheesy pizza. Mr. Smith gagged as he struggled to grasp his situation. Here he was a world leading scientist being eaten by his neighbor's buddy, unnoticed on a slice of pizza. All his intellect was worthless at the appetite of a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in thought he entered the mouth in silence. Joe's teeth came together sealing Mr. Smith in darkness for a moment. But as Joe began to chew his lips parted and Mr. Smith finally screamed as he was flung about randomly with the food being chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe thought about the game he had just bought and how much he wanted to play right now as he chewed. But Tommy was right they should try to find the scientist guy. But he wasn't gonna try too long, if the guy wanted to be found he better make it easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stood up. \"I'm gonna start in the living room okay?\" He walked towards the doorway out of the kitchen. He spun around \"And watch your step,\" he warned before staring intently at the floor as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe wondered if the tiny man would be fast enough to dodge one of their feet. He felt something chewy between his molars and bit down harder, feeling a bit of juice trickle down his teeth. 'Good pepperoni' he thought briefly before swallowing and popping the last piece into his mouth. He stood up as he chewed and began scanning the kitchen wondering where he should look first.</span></div></div>",

However he mismeasured his throw and the pizza landed upside down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit\" Joe grunted as he walked over to pick it up. \"Good job!\" Tommy growled as Joe leaned down to pick it up. The cheese fell off the slice as he lifted it up.

The three teenagers loomed overhead as they conversed with each other in rumbling voices. The angles of the enormous room veered off in sharp directions, making the tiny man dizzy.

Putting his hand to it, Joe's gaze fell to the coffee table which still had the dip and chips from earlier. Everything else, it seemed, had been tossed out by Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't fucking finished, stupid bitch!\" Joe grumbled out loud.  Left with no other options, Joe leans down and grabs the chips in one hand and the bowl of dip in the other. Sighing, he drops onto the couch with a plop and woosh as the air flowed out of the overstuffed cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns the TV back on and is unsurprised to find the game they had been watching was over. \"All this shit that just happened felt like it took years! All I wanted to do today was relax!\" Joe grunted, still surly that his afternoon had become so stressful and downright weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he settles on a channel playing a rerun of the show Weeds. He loves the lead lady, she was a total MILF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile watching, he begins absently munching on chips and dip. Unfortunately after only a minute, the show goes to commercial. With an annoyed grunt Joe drops his feet to the ground a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Tommy's warning, Joe lifts his shoes and checks underneath them. Seeing some dirt that's clearly not a tiny man, Joe puts his foot back down and stares at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. uh... Mr. Smith! You better make it easy to find you! We're trying to help, but you gotta try too, so get somewhere I can see you like a table and we'll be set!\" Joe shouts, his voice echoing around the room. He doesn't realize the ridiculousness of demanding the minuscule man to scale a mountainous table for Joe's own convenience. Satisfied he had given the necessary effort Joe returns to his snack and TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing yet another chip, Joe remembers the movie \"Honey we Shrunk Ourselves\" where the tiny men end up in a chip dip bowl. He guiltily glances at the dip, but only sees the black dots that are always in the ranch. Scooping a generous amount of dip onto the chip, Joe lifts it to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Please don't eat me!\" Joe whispers at the chip, pretending it to be the voice of the shrunken man. He opens his mouth wide and holds the chip in place trying to imagine how his mouth would look at such a scale. \"It would be bigger than this house!\" he thinks to himself. He feels saliva building up on his tongue. \"And slimy!\" he remembers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the chip into his mouth Joe crushes it between his teeth and through his full mouth says \"Nooooooo!!\" before giggling to himself. As he returns to chewing normally he thinks \"They always get away in the movies. Well not this time! You've been eaten!\" With that last thought Joe gulps down his mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished that little mental exercise, Joe once more refocuses on the television, his little fantasy as quickly forgotten as the chewed food that collected in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Joe had been doing all this Mr. Smith had been...</span></div></div>",

Tommy had left him with his significantly more careless friend, Joe. All to go spend more time with his girlfriend!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Stupid fucking prick! Totally controlled by his damned hormones!\" Bryan rages. He loses his train of thought as he is cast into shadow. Looking up he sees the fabric of jeans before he is suddenly launched into the air.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nScreaming as he soars through the air, Joe's face is in the center of his vision. Oblivious to the tiny scientist, his expression appears slightly irritated, as he stares at the distant TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan braces himself as he plummets towards the floor. He grunts on contact, seeing stars. More pain than ever shoots through his entire body and he wails in agony. Breathing heavily, Bryan imagines he had probably broken a couple more ribs at best. He slowly rolls onto his back, wincing from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so insanely lucky to be alive\" he imagines, for the moment able to forget the extreme misfortune that had brought him to this point. He decides to rest, as he literally cannot bring himself to move. Above him, Joe's thick legs span the distance from the couch to his coffee table like bridges. Bryan still couldn't believe how enormous the teenagers were to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the blaring television, he can also hear Joe munching on some chips. \"I thought I was landing in the dip!\" Bryan thought in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething crashed down from above, rattling Bryan violently. Ahead of him Joe's building sized Airwalks rested on the ground.  He watched them lift up slightly, revealing the filthy sole, before once more resting flat. Fearing the titan's violent movements, Bryan scoots backwards to get away from the huge shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MR. UH...\" Bryan stops moving upon hearing the giant yelling loudly above. \"MR. SMITH! YOU BETTER MAKE IT EASY TO FIND YOU! WE'RE TRYING TO HELP, BUT YOU GOTTA TRY TOO! SO GET SOMEWHERE I CAN SEE YOU, LIKE A TABLE, AND WE'LL BE SET!\" The crunch of a chip follows a few seconds later but Bryan isn't paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get somewhere I can see you?!\" he shouts incredulously at the oblivious giant. \"How about you use your fucking eyes! How the hell do you expect me to get onto a <i>table or something</i> like this!\" His ribcage continue to throb painfully. \"You dumbass teenagers have only made things worse, you've literally <i>broken my bones</i>, because you're so damned inept and careless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rant however makes no difference. Bryan glares at the giant as he leans forward, staring into the bowl of dip. \"I'm not in there idiot!\" Bryan shouts, waving his arm. He watches the looming giant bring a dip filled chip to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Please don't eat me!\" Joe whispers. Confusion ripples through Bryan's mind. Had he heard right? As he watches the giant boy opens his mouth wide, but holds the chip in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he pretending that he's eating me?\" Bryan wonders in disgust. After another moment Joe shoves the chip into his mouth with a loud crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooo!\" he whispers before giggling to himself. Bryan however is not entertained by the little display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is wrong with this kid? How can I trust him with my safety?\" Bryan wonders worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the pain subsiding he stands up and decides to...</span></div></div>",

Oblivious to the tiny scientist, his expression appears slightly irritated, as he stares at the distant TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT! Mr. Smith lands face down in a thick substance that he instantly recognizes but refuses to believe. Pulling his face free, he gasps for air. \"No! It can't be!\" he gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough he had landed in the bowl of dip. He can see shards of chips and scraps of chicken wings dotting the smooth white surface of the ranch. Turning upwards reveals an awful sight. In Joe's massive hand is a chip. And it is rapidly descending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squelch the colossus lifts a hill of dip onto the chip and quickly brings it to his mouth. Without the sounds of the blaring game and other boys, Bryan clearly hears the thundering crunch of Joe's bite followed by the more subtle sounds of his chewing. When a loud gulp sends shivers down Bryan's spine, he decides its time to start swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain from being sat on shoots through his body, making his progress slow. His shouts and grunts of pain are unsuccessful in drowning out the smacks and crunches of Joe's snack above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MR. UH...\" Bryan stops moving upon hearing the giant yelling loudly above. \"MR. SMITH! YOU BETTER MAKE IT EASY TO FIND YOU! WE'RE TRYING TO HELP, BUT YOU GOTTA TRY TOO! SO GET SOMEWHERE I CAN SEE YOU, LIKE A TABLE, AND WE'LL BE SET!\" Moments a later another chip plunges into the lake of dip across the bowl from Bryan. Bryan however is lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cannot believe the callousness of Joe's statement. What did the idiot expect from a minuscule man? \"These inept and careless teenagers will doom me!\" Bryan shouts angrily. He is amazed how quickly everything had gone wrong, thus landing him in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels a violent movement beneath him and grunts in confusion. Struggling to turn around he sees a ridged, yellow plain sloped upwards where a dirty thumbnail grasps it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What are you doing!\" Bryan shouts in panic. Joe, who isn't even looking at the dip, has no idea what he is scooping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip flies upwards, G-forces causing Bryan to sink lower into the dip. The entire thing stops even with Joe's thick lips, which seem to be stretched into a vague smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO! PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!\" Though a mere whisper to Joe, Bryan is buffeted by a gust of the teenager's sour breath. \"What...\" Bryan sputters in confusion. What is the young man talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips ahead of him part, revealing rows of towering teeth that glint in the light. \"Oh god,\" Bryan whimpers as he takes in the sight. Thick ropes of saliva stretch from the roof of the mouth to the fidgeting tongue. A field of chewed chip mush, smeared with ranch dip, coats Joe's tongue all the way to where it sinks into the blackness of the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip remains motionless for a few seconds, though it feels like an eternity as Mr. Smith stares ahead in fear. Finally the chip abruptly moves forward. \"No! WAIT! YOU ALREADY FOUND ME!\" Bryan screams in despair as the chip falls to the tongue. The lips seal out any light and a deafening crunch shatters the chip supporting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\" the giant's nearly unrecognizable whispers sound more like the winds of a tornado from inside the mouth. \"What are you doing!\" Bryan sobs in confusion as the crunches of chewing surround him. Was this an extremely cruel joke? Was the massive boy pretending to eat him, and at the same time just happened to be actually eating him? Bryan didn't know, but these possibilities only made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!\" he screams in terror, unintentionally echoing Joe's words from moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, deaf to the screams of terror within his mouth, quickly gulps the food down. Staring blankly at the screen he raises another dip smothered chip to his lips and a crunch echoes around the room. He is oblivious to the food's descent through his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the credits for the show roll Joe looks down to his flat stomach. Remembering his fantasy he tries to imagine the tiny man inside his gut. However he had not done too well in biology and nothing comes to mind. \"Doesn't matter anyway, there's nothing there.\" Joe thinks and instead focuses on trying to find something else to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Joe knows his there is something in his stomach: his food. But it might as well be nothing to the teenager, because as far as he was concerned it was long gone. It was still very much there however. Bryan was witness to the mountains of soggy chips and chicken wings surrounded by a moat of Pepsi from earlier. His screams for aid and struggles for attention go completely unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, in his ignorance of his own digestive system, doesn't know the violent fate his food would soon meet in his stomach. When it begins to gurgle, the gentle sound doesn't even enter his consciousness. He has no way to imagine the rising acid surrounding his eaten meal, as a tiny man struggles fruitlessly to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Joe does a quick scan of the room for the tiny man. \"I don't know where you are Mr. Smith! Tommy'll be back tomorrow!\" he shouts dismissively before heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy does return the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. He never finds his shrunken neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day during lunch at school, he guiltily asks Joe if he should have stayed and kept looking for Mr. Smith that day. Joe swallows his mouthful of pizza before attempting to soothe his friend's conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, even though you weren't there, I was! I looked, and I didn't see him! Whatever happened wasn't either of our fault!\" Joe insisted as he popped the last bite of food into his mouth.</span></div></div>",

Bryan could clearly see dirt trapped beneath the thick fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came up to the hand, which itself was taller than him, he sighed and began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe at first didn't notice the movement on his hand.

For a moment he stares motionless at his hands, guilt washing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy can't know!\" Joe says suddenly. Without giving it much more thought he jumps up from the couch and rushes into the kitchen. Marching right up to the sink, he turns the faucet on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little man.\" Joe whispers regretfully as he rinses his fingers off and watches the speck flow down the drain.

His world erupted into a maelstrom of motion and sound, brought to a bone-snapping halt when he made a soft impact inside a large yellow plastic laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled like a dropped rag-doll on a vast surface of white cotton, the little man tried to inhale air into his lungs as he stared up at Tommy\u2019s huge form as the teenager loomed large over the basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith heard Tommy\u2019s mother thank her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man tried to command his muscles to move, but the ordeal had left him momentarily stunned. He started to cry out Tommy\u2019s name when the teenager\u2019s mother dropped her son\u2019s jeans into the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate smiled then on the tiny man. Looking at the time on the clock on the laundry room wall, she decided to leave the laundry until after she prepared dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned off the light and pulled the door closed as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had endured so much, but he seemed destined for an even greater ordeal. The room had gone silent and still. Some light filtered through a small window, casting everything in a gray gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist groaned and sat up. \u201cWhere the hell am I now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smelled an intense, rank odor and felt a dank moistness beneath him. Processing the available clues, he realized with some disgust that he had landed atop one of Tommy\u2019s sweat-drenched socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling as best as he could, the tiny man tried to remove himself from the immediate vicinity of the stinking sock. A heavy canopy of denim covered the basket, the result of Tommy\u2019s mother adding the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved across an uneven surface, he left the damp sock fabric. His head still ached, and his only immediate goal was to escape the reeking sock. His efforts soon left him exhausted. He eased onto his stomach and noticed he had come to rest facing a large square with numbers almost as big as his body. He read the words \u201c100% Cotton, Size Medium.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had left the socks only to meander across a pair of Tommy\u2019s worn briefs. Staring at the label, the scientist felt the jarring recognition of his current insignificance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization took a lower priority than another concern. He needed to get himself free of the basket of a teenager\u2019s laundry and try again to communicate with Tommy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a slope of dirty white material took over, looking like an avalanche of snow over the red fabric of the briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan scuttled up the white mound, only to find it slightly moist and rather rank. He realized with a grumble that this was one of Tommy's socks. Bigger than a few city blocks, it was the last obstacle of laundry till the end of the basket. With a gasp, Bryan tried to hold his breath, not wanting to inhale the dingy scent of the huge teenagers sock. It still seemed to penetrate, and just as Bryan reached the end, he began gagging from the odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man looked before him. Like a cascading waterfall of epic proportions, the sock slumped over the edge of the massive basket. It was a long way to the ground, and just thinking about it gave Bryan vertigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for a better way down than the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara sighed as she took off her oven mitts and untied her apron. It had been a long day of work, which included preparing breakfast, sweeping out the kitchen,, watering the indoor plants, preparing dinner, and... Laundry. \"I almost forgot the laundry!\" She thought tepidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift whack, she swept off the remaining flour on her sleeves and hurried to the laundry room. Tommy always seemed to accumulate lots of laundry, and coupled with her older son, it meant a lot of work for her. Entering the small tiled room, she reached for the sizable basket, when she noticed a sock that had slipped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even reach for it, Barbara nearly dropped the basket in shock. A tiny scurrying creature revealed itself from under the dingy sock. \"A bug!\" Her vain voice wailed. Barbara was terrified of insects, and she knew that where there was one, there were more in the shadows. The thought made her skin crawl, and the continued sight of the horrific invader was sickening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the laundry, she rushed from the room frantically, bent on having this dealt with before it became a problem.</span></div></div>",

The basket of dirty laundry he had just escaped from was cradled in her arms. It was obvious her overreaction from spotting the tiny man was far less than what he felt upon seeing her. The screech of terror and the declaration of \"a bug\" made the shrunken man more frightened than she could ever be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop...!\" He faltered, unable to remember the woman's name. \"...Just hold on! I'm not a bug!\" Bryan loped towards the gigantic woman, trying vainly to make himself known as something other than an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never gave him that chance. Instead, she let out another shriek and tossed the laundry basket upon a nearby table. Bryan's ears rang painfully as the foolish woman fled the room with thunderous result. He bolted for her desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'm not a bug, I'm a man! Help meee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt swished around the doorway and she was gone, easily outpacing the insect-sized man. The tiny man stood there dumbfounded, incredulous at his own misfortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly on the select few occasions had Bryan visited his teenaged neighbour's home. One of those visits he encountered Tommy's mother. She seemed very flustered, and busy. Her hair reminiscent of an out-dated beehive over a lined but kindly face. A typical single mother, overall. This seemed rather moot at the moment, since the woman not only failed to recognize him but had mistaken him for a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe most likely wasn't going to hide under her bed covers either, Bryan figured. He needed to relocate himself before she returned to purge him. Voices and rumbling activity outside the room only exemplified this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body sore and bruised, he forced himself into cover underneath the washing machine and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Barbara cupped her hands to yell from the base of the stairs. No reply answered her repeated cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoose pimples began creeping over her arms. She dared a nervous glance back to the hallway leading from the living room, searching for any skittering shapes upon the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh!\" She moaned. \"Toooommmy! Come down here right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time heavy footsteps sounded in response to her pleas and her son came pounding down the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's eldest son Nathan quickly descended the staircase, finishing the last step with a casual leap. He was fully dressed, looking as if he was going out. \"What's all the shouting about, huh? Thought the freaking house was on fire or somthin'.\" Nathan attempted to passed her, but halted when she grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis typical sass was reminiscent of her husband. She bit her lip. \"Worse, oh my, much worse!\" Pausing for dramatic effect. \"There is a disgusting bug in the laundry room, crawling around and breeding!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan sighed and tried to lean away, his face clearly showing his opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, be a sweet and get rid of it, won't you?\" Lightly prodding her son, she stood slightly taller than his shoulder yet managed to direct his attention to the darkened laundry room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy appeared at the railing atop the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is going on? What're you all yelling for?\" He questioned with a hint of impatience. He looked his two family members over, his mind still tormenting over the loss of Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara repeated the harrowing tale, her voice cracking when recounting her narrow escape. \"It was in the laundry!\" She finished, glancing between both of her visibly annoyed sons. Tommy looking oddly overwhelmed, while Nathan rolled his eyes still in his mother's hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all live here, the least you two could do is get rid of a single pest!\" This was almost a weekly occurrence. Anything from an ant to a tiny moth sent their mother into a flurry of terrified shrieks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the laundry room! It nearly knocked me over when it attacked!\" Barbara pointed with a trembling finger, sniffling indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy remained motionless above. His expression was blank and his eyes glazed like marbles. Nathan glanced up and grunted. \"Yeah, no problem little bro! I'll get the big bad bug for you and mom!\" The sarcasm seemed to jolt his younger brother back to earth, which made Nathan grin until Tommy left without saying a word. \"<i>Weird fucker</i>...\" Nathan muttered under his breath, careful of his mother's hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear! It is probably crawling about and breeding in my laundry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her first-born a nudge and cautiously followed behind his large form towards the laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bryan had huddled himself under the safety offered by the washing machine. Underneath it was spacious enough for Bryan the comfortably stand with more than 10 feet to spare. Bryan felt especially insecure. His only company being some large dust bunnies, crumbs, and a long forgotten sock stuffed farther back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, he though he heard some skittering noises in the inky depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... Please... Let Tommy come and find me! I'm begging of you...\" The trembling bug-man prayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never been particularly religious, but felt it was his last resort at this point. Peering out from under his cover, Bryan was offered a perfect view of the humongous floor. It seemed to stretch on for miles until ending in a lofty closet. To his left, the doorway that Barbara had fled through led out into the rest of the family's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dull voices from outside seemed to subside slightly, causing his ears to prick up like a cat. There had clearly been Barbara's shrill vocals, followed by two male voices - one Bryan had been certain belonged to his beloved Tommy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan opened his mouth to once more vocalize his thoughts when he was interrupted. The dim room suddenly burst brightly with a loud <i>click!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy?\" He squeaked. \"Tommy! Is that you? Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning into the open, Bryan froze at the stranger looming in the doorway. He gawked up at the strange giant's face, his face gaping like a confused gazelle. \"Who the hell!\" This giant was not Tommy; and not somebody tiny Mr. Smith wanted to interact with! Bigger, with a distinctly angry look - this behemoth could only be one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The older brother...\" His brain regurgitated memories of Tommy's older sibling. \"...Nathan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resembled Tommy: similar but shaggy and messier hair, and the same brows and nose. It all ended there. Nathan was anything but the nice and cordial boy that Tommy was. Impatient, rude, and dishonest as well - Bryan found him to be a big bully to his younger brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.\" Nathan thundered, scanning the room with bored eyes. \"WHERE IS IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly went cold again. This was terrible! Nathan was here to stomp him like a fucking insect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, no! I'm a man; your neighbour! Bry-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pleas were cut off as the giant took a step into the room. Nathan's immense girth made the previously lofty space seem the cramped utility room it really was. Bryan wasted not a second more, scrambling back towards the washing machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor trembled with each monumental step the titan took into the room. Bryan felt like the bug he was accused of being, hiding in the shadows of the gigantic appliance. He truly was nothing but a tiny invader in their home - regardless of his wanting to be here. Nathan thundered again, his voice too low and muttled for Bryan to make out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of his shelter, the bug-sized man could see Nathan's colossal sneakers crashing down at random. The trashed black and grey DCs were fraying and caked with dirt. Bryan watched one nearest him lift off the floor, emitting a sticky squelch, and slam down heavily. The tan rubber tread was so worn, that little tread remained around the toe and heel region of the sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized with a gulp, that anything underneath would most certainly be reduced to paste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shifted back and forth in the room, glancing around the floor for any small shapes. \"Just give me the spray and I will coat the place real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his neck impatiently, listening to his mother clatter to the kitchen. Working all morning long, and he was being forced into bug duty. Again. His cell phone rattled, signaling yet another text from his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He watched from under this mountainous appliance, sharply gasping with every jolting quake as Tommy's older brother moved around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this happening? <i>How</i> could it have happened? Bryan had been so careful in his planning! He would be having a much-needed cry right now if he wasn't so damn scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doin-...\" Bryan's body lurched, bones and teeth clacking. One tattered sneaker slammed against the ground, grimy and gritty against the flooring to a nearly deafening degree. Tones of powerful speech could he heard from high above as Nathan angrily complained the bug was nowhere to be seen. Bryan goaded his doubts on with squeaky fervor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM, I CAN'T WASTE MY TIME AGAIN WITH THIS...\" <i>Again?</i> Bryan thought. It was ludicrous to imagine that this terrifying experience was literally nothing but normal for them. How many tiny creatures had been through this? <i>Hiding in this very spot?</i> Mindless insects that they were - but, Bryan was considered no better at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan stood stationary, his back facing the two machines, and thundered again at his mother. Underneath the appliance, Bryan was afforded only a view of the lower-half of the massive skate shoes planted in the distance. The steely two-toned suede worn and marked like long forgotten battleships left to rust. Stretched across the frayed surface was a DC logo in high contrast of neon green turned brownish with use. Right now, it was easily the most harrowing thing Bryan could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPattering out for a closer look at the goings-on, Bryan gazed up the looming column that was Nathan's right leg. Just this one appendage was so big. Tiny Bryan had no chance against the entire monstrous being that was his beloved neighbour's older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could...\" Imagining himself flying away, the bug-sized man looked airy when he spotted movement upon the massive skyscraper-sized leg. \"What the fuck?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed movement. Barely visible against the faded black denim mountain, was a brave mountain climber of a spider. It tittered along looming folds, vanishing and appearing again as it descended - all while the oblivious behemoth grumbled high above. A professional couldn't have done it better, as the eight-legged creature slid, dropped, and descended the towering length of pant-leg. George Mallory would be rolling in his grave right now if he knew Bryan's admiration for the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the hem - a terribly worn, jagged, mess of frayed denim barely covering the equally worn shoe - the intrepid spider quickly dropped down past the large logo and past the discoloured sole nearly thrice the creature's height. Now on the massive plane of flooring, the spider planned to finish the adventure by escaping to safety. But, Bryan knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted a vain warning at the foolhardy creature. It was terrifying. Eight legs and all, but he had developed an admiration for it, and didn't want it to fall after stowing away so bravely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?\" Bryan attempted to gape upwards, but realized his own safety might be in jeopardy and scampered back to cover. Without warning, the giant moved, his huge DC suddenly shifting, nearly crashing upon the spider as it did. \"THERE IT IS... GOT IT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe callous tone of the distant statement struck Bryan like a brick wall. He looked to the fleeing arachnid. Running, fighting, moving forward at seemingly break-neck speed, all in order to survive. Nathan - so powerful; so huge; so far *above* this simple spider. He never thought twice about obliterating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain of suede and rubber creaked, groaned, and stretched. Nathan's unfathomably huge foot moving inside as it always did, but this time with a purpose. It lifted off the floor, revealing a tan coloured tread that spanned enough space for a residential development. It was nearly worn flat at the toe. Bare hints of the capsule-shaped grooves were visible, some clogged with dark gunk, dirt, pebbles, among other things he couldn't identify. Bryan squeaked fruitlessly as Nathan's sneaker loomed over the doomed spider. Landing with a powerful thud, the spider vanished from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed, and the huge grimy footwear began dragging backwards. Deafening squeaks and grinds blasted tiny Bryan as he steadied himself. He was awe-struck by such casual power and cruelty. In disbelief, he just stared at the sneaker as it lifted once more, exposing the terrifying tread to the minuscule world once more, rotated, and crashed down. Pulverized bits of the spider were pasted to the worn sole, while the carapace was left behind in a grisly mound of guts. The other followed suit, slamming down heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with his task, Nathan turned and pounded towards the door. Unknowingly leaving behind the real \"pest\" and not the one he himself carried inside from his own disorderly room. A loud *CLICK!* and the room went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny speck under the washing machine watched Nathan leave. Bryan was lost for words, and more importantly, devoid of any hope. \"That could have been me!\" He felt a twinge of sorrow for the unlucky spider, but preferred the current outcome. It could have been him! A moment was needed to calm his tiny heartbeat. That spider had been far larger than himself, and it stood less than zero chance. How the hell was he going to do any better? \"This... This is a disaster. I need to just hide and get out of here!\" Liking that idea, he still remained hidden until all noise and activity went quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he padded out in to the open...</span></div></div>",

Bryan didn't even have a chance to fully register who it was, when his entire world upturned violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a terrifying fall broken by the very rank sock he detested, Bryan found himself utterly surrounded by it. It canopied overhead spaciously like a stadium, a grotesque humidity beginning to form. Bryan quickly exited via fold reduced to crawling as he sucked in the fresh air. It was then that he heard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A BUG!\" Screeched an earsplitting high voice that seemed to echo from far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked up in desperation, knowing the consequences of such a term. He saw towering on the other side of the room, clutching the huge basket of clothes with her slender arms, Tommy's mother, Barbara. Her eyes looked right at him, wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I'm not a bug! Look closer!\" He gasped, shambling towards her. With a ground lurching jump, the cowardly Barbara fled the room, basket and all. Bryan shivered, knowing that his luck was about to turn much worse. Pulling himself up, the shrunken man hurried towards the towering door, not wanting to wait for his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was reeling from her close encounter with the fierce insect. Her nerves were rattled and only worsened when after collecting Tommy, the two of them found the hideous insect missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It escaped! To breed, and spread its spawn all over my house!\" She shrieked at Tommy, who looked  un-amused, and annoyed. \"I am calling an exterminator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy gave her an exasperated look, and sighed as he returned to the upstairs. It was just a bug to him, he didn't care what his mother did about it. Barbara planned plenty, especially after finding what appeared to be the entry point of the bugs. A small crack in the kitchen baseboard that spawned some curious ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara made quick work in dialing up Eric, a local exterminator she often phoned to deal with \"infestations\". He nicely agreed to come over to the house the next day to deal with the bugs, and preform a full sweep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara bustled about, jumping at every shadow, and swearing she felt insects crawling on her. Much to Tommy's despair, she hurried him out of the house, planning of staying over at her sister's house till the bugs were dealt with. Nathan shrugged off her warnings and decided to visit the local bar in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all this dangerous commotion, Bryan made it from the laundry room, which was fortunately near the living room, in search of Tommy. He stayed along the moulding, hoping to avoid attention from Tommy's frantic mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan dashed to the side when Tommy's humongous sneaker crashed down as the gigantic teen grabbed his coat. \"Tommy! Don't leave, please! No!\" The tiny scientist yelled. He wanted to chase him, but the titanic teenager's massive steps easily outpaced the bug-sized man. Despair washed over him as he watched Tommy, his only hope, leave the house with his frantic parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shuddered again. Bryan found himself stumbling back to the massive wall as Nathan stomped nearby, his dirty socked feet sending shockwaves with each step. With a superficial gag, Bryan recognized the sock as the one he was climbing over. The oblivious giant lumbered over to a pair of ratty DC skate shoes, slipped them on and left the house too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of what was to come, Bryan decided to rest in a slight crevice in the moulding. He fell right asleep on the rough, hard surface from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eric shrugged, dropping his toolbox to the ground heavily. Exterminating bugs was an easy job, and Eric never had any problems doing it. His clients were usually scared housewives like Barbara who called him to deal with a minor ant infestation, which he was only glad to take care of. Popping in some earbuds, he prepared to being spraying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, his powerful presence woke a particularly tiny creature on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud thumping noises woke Bryan with a start.

Another loud noise accompanied by tremors shook him out of his sleepy state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy...?\" Bryan muttered as he looked out over the vast living room terrain. A huge man stood on the other end of the room, he looked unfamiliar to Bryan. A short buzzed haircut, and a strong masculine face gave the massive stranger a very intimidating look. He wore thick denim jeans, a grey t-shirt, and work boots. When the giant moved, powerful vibrations rattled the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the mysterious titan turned to reveal a gargantuan canister strapped to his muscled back. \"An exterminator!\" Bryan exclaimed with dread.

Loud thundering footsteps rumbled through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy?\" The tiny man questioned to himself. His arms felt weak as he pulled himself up in order to get a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffectively blocking what he desired to see was an armchair. Rather ugly with a pea green floral pattern held up by dated oak legs. Bryan ventured out of his tiny haven in order to get a better view when suddenly he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous stranger appeared across the vast living room. His long legs were clad in light coloured baggy work jeans. A grey T-shirt emblazoned with a logo, and pair of heavy work boots on his feet. The humongous man carried a heavy toolbox, which he set upon the ground with thunderous result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gulped timidly as he squinted in an attempt to discover the identity of this huge stranger.The giant lifted the lid of his toolbox and began rummaging around, Bryan noted many objects he pulled out; A pair of gloves, flashlight, and a few unidentifiable boxes. His eyes then drifted to a sizable container set near where the man stood. The sight of it sent a shiver down his spine, a sticker that stated \"TOXIC\" with a skull was stamped on the visible side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Bryan said with a curious leer. \"Is that-... Insect spray!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread immediately filled his tiny form when he realized what he was looking at. This man was an exterminator! \"An gigantic one at that!\" He cried, stating the obvious aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow his situation had gotten worse. Much worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am smaller than most bugs!\" The introduction of this new, terrifying giant meant certain doom for the shrunken scientist. \"I have to get his attention!\" He wondered if the offending insects realized their certain doom. The sheer enormity of this behemoth made him a danger, but equipped with toxins, he was as good as any apocalypse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan was coming to his realizations and stating them aloud to himself, something was approaching from behind. Crawling on six strong legs, an ant the size of an automobile, just as dangerous as the huge exterminator in it's own right, crept steadily towards the unaware scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed set for the little man. He had just been finalizing his meager, and rather foolhardy plan when he detected disturbing noises from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant fell upon him swiftly, giving the shrunken man no more than a second to squeal in protest. Bryan blacked out from terror at the mere sight of the ant's terrifying mandibles clashing together. Lifting the minuscule form easily for transport, the thoughtless insect quickly skittered away, ignoring the towering giant that had already begun his work far across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's unconscious mind convinced itself that he had been killed. He had always been frightened by insects to an embarrassing extent. This minor fear was now transformed into a reality as he was carted away by the monster-sized ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntent on returning to the hive with its prey, the ant raced along the baseboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was held firmly, yet not enough to cause any injury which surprised him. What did this monstrous insect have planned? Bryan attempted to wriggle some more, even going so far as to antagonize the beast by beating his fists upon the creature's head. He finally resigned himself to wait for an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was able to examine his environment. Craning his neck, from his awkward position, he tried to determine where he was being taken. He had only been in Tommy's home a few select times. The frighteningly large space around him was anything but what he recalled of the family's small suburban house<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor had changed from the pale blue tangle of carpet in the living room to a flat spread of hardwood flooring. Recognition clicked, the ant was carrying Bryan towards the kitchen! Terrible thoughts of what awaited him stirred his mind. Was he being taken to the nest? Would he be torn limb from limb by a mob of the giant ants? Or perhaps he would be given to the queen ant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face showed a ghastly image of terror at these thoughts, despite their ridiculous nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man had been frightened by the behemoth of an exterminator, and what might befall him should he be mistaken for a bug again. Now he was unsure which fate seemed preferable. Being torn apart and eaten, or poisoned and crushed? All these thoughts spurred feelings of panic. Bryan had never once thought of any repercussions that shrinking may cause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet here he was, captured by a common ant, while a gigantic exterminator stomped oblivious to his presence. Not to mention the fact he was hopelessly separated from the antidote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thoughts, the lighting suddenly changed as the ant continued under a gargantuan cabinet. His thoughtless captor suddenly came to a violent halt. The ant began struggling fiercely, its long antennae whipping around threatening to whack Bryan in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" He asked with a shrill yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant had inadvertently become stuck fast in a sticky substance that coated the ground. Bryan realized it was none other than a simple sheet of glue paper. It had likely been lain down a few weeks earlier, as there were numerous other creatures and dust trapped in it. The simple and cheap pest trap now looked like a lagoon of sticky liquid a few hundred feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt the cruel mandibles begin to loosen. The frightened insect seemed to forget about the tiny man as it tried desperately to escape from its own captivity. Bryan's elation at this opportunity for escape turned sour as he felt himself slipping from the ant's grasp. Directly below lay the sticky surface, waiting for another victim. Gripping one of the thrashing antennae, his other hand searched for a hold on the bug's greasy exoskeleton. He was determined not to become stuck like a common insect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeding from his adrenaline, he attempted to scramble up the gigantic ant's head. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt like he finally struck some good luck for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant seemed to disagree. Bulging black eyes glared at tiny Bryan while gnawing mandibles seemed to beg for help. Bryan looked at the large insect warily. He cringed, eyeing the sticky ropes of glue that clung to the ant's thrashing legs. He couldn't bear to think what might have become of him should he have fallen into the glue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy, you're on your own!\" He quickly distanced himself from the treacherous glue trap and the stuck ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis situation had yet to improve, but Bryan felt a pleasant surge of enthusiasm. He survived. It made him feel no less than hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he determined his location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him towered the underside of a humongous cabinet. Bryan vaguely recalled such a piece of furniture in Tommy's kitchen when he last visited. Stretching outside the cabinet's cover, spanned many, many, miles of linoleum flooring. The tiny man made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" He sniffed. \"Linoleum manages to look worse from this angle, if possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the expanse of sticky glue paper, the bug-sized man saw nothing else of interest under the cabinet. Dark shadows hid whatever may be lying further in, leaving large clumps of dust, and arrays of dirt visible. A few ants--clever enough not to become trapped in the glue--skittered around. Bryan heard some commotion from far away. Clanging and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...footsteps.\" Heavy ones, at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the enormous exterminator who had just begun work in the living room before Bryan was taken. The gigantic tradesman was a terrifying problem for the tiny man. Smaller than an ant, Bryan would be easy prey to the dangerously oblivious man. He wished Tommy was here.

He noticed many ants doing the same: crawling along in sparse lines towards any cover, some carrying tiny, glistening white eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized he might be better off following them and hide from the terrifyingly gigantic tradesman until Tommy returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hiding</i>. Such a thought was repugnant to him; a genius such a he, hiding like some common insect that invaded somebody's home. Yet, he didn't see any other choice. How could he ever hope to get the gigantic man's attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I have done this to myself?\" He moaned in desolation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides his diminished pride, Bryan thought about other possible outcomes. What if the exterminator proved thorough and ended up spraying into his hideaway? Bryan shuddered to think of the grisly, painful demise resulting from inhaling the toxic chemicals. He wracked his face and looked upwards at the distant ceiling light. It emitted a low hum and attracted barely discernible gnats that buzzed lazily, blissfully carefree. Then a second outcome struck him. What if he happened upon a hiding insect? A spider, or even an ant? A second encounter wasn't likely to go in his favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaling the enormous counters began to seem a feasible route to the tiny man. The mega-sized hutch he was currently under had tall, smooth legs that stood like monuments of smooth wood. It would be nigh impossible to climb them. Over a sizable distance of open tile floor stood the mighty countertops, stretching up an impressive height like cliffs. Bryan took in the sight, swallowing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trashcan sat against the edge of the counter, looming like an otherworldly tower of reflective metal. This object alone was not interesting, but what hung alongside it caught Bryan's attention. A towel, supported by an inset rack, hung almost the entire height of the cabinet to the counter with one end barely brushing the floor. Bryan felt sure he would be able to climb his way through the thick fibers to the top.  He was sure to be seen and rescued there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoise from the next room disrupted his thoughtful musings. The distinct sound of spraying chemicals sounded disturbingly close.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His feet scrambled over the insect's smooth greasy head. The thrashing mandibles could be heard clicking and crunching just below. Bryan felt his hand slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cawed out in terror, fearing he would slip into the ant's ravaging mandibles. Instead, the ant gave a particularly violent thrash in a desperate attempt to free itself and flung tiny Bryan. The squealing scientist toppled rear-first into the sticky glue with a wet thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan reacted. He attempted to pull himself up and only managed to get his hand stuck as well. \"No, no, NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs and hand were hopelessly stuck. Only his torso and other arm were spared the cruel glue that clung to his body like slimy gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud wailing clicks and grunts came from the ant who still struggled nearby. The stupid creature paid him no mind as it shook and thrashed, causing a sickly <i>crack</i> when one of its six legs tore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared at the pitiful insect with horror. The giant ant was more than willing to dismember itself to escape. Bryan felt nauseous from the mere thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammitt!\" He returned his attention to his own plight. How the hell would he escape this? The glue felt like nothing short of cement, holding him firmly. He had never given a thought to the fate of insects caught by these merciless traps. In fact, he had lain out a few in his own home weeks before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant seemed to fall still, as if at attention. Bryan halted his own struggles in turn, wondering at the large insect. Then he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy thuds. No, heavy thunderous <i>booms</i>. Turning his head, Bryan was afforded a nice view of the kitchen from under the cabinet. He felt his spine chill, watching a mountainous pair of work boots lumber into the kitchen. Each heaving step sent powerful vibrations through the floor, rattling the tiny prisoner of the glue trap. From his lowly perspective, Bryan could only see the boots and some of the thick, frayed denim of the huge exterminator's jeans. The enormous boots stopped their thunderous procession just before the tall cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClacking madly, the ant had begun struggling again. Bryan ignored it, having eyes only for the colossal footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" The bug-sized man felt weak as he tried to comprehend the sheer size of the mammoth work boots. They were mountainous towers of creased brown leather, the heavy lugged sole covered in flecks of mud and dust. He gulped at the thought of what might be pressed into the thick treads. As if to prove their enormous size, another ant scuttled by the nearest boot, looking positively minuscule as it fled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan grimaced as he watched the ant vanish behind the thick cabinet leg, wishing he could do the same. He felt like an animal caught in a trap, waiting for the hunter to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just stare,\" He bristled. \"I need to make myself known!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stationary boots suddenly rose into action, shifting seemingly at random. Bryan went weak again, feeling all his courage leave him as he wondered what the huge man was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the living room finished, he was prepared to start in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the room a cursory scan. Spider webs in the upper corner, and a sizable gap under the refrigerator seemed likely hot spots. Marking down more notes, he shifted his gaze to the hutch. The cabinet contained an assortment of decorative kitchen items. As an exterminator, Eric was more interested in the gap created by the legs of the hutch, allowing yet another haven for pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a look\" Muttered the gruff exterminator. Gravel from outside crunched lightly under his boots when he crouched down to look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grunted when the bill of his cap bumped against the cabinet. He pulled the hat backwards, and proceeded to investigate. His small flashlight illuminated the musty under-space, revealing dust bunnies, a pencil, and a sheet of glue paper that glinted slightly. The homeowner, Barbara, had mentioned something about glue traps he recalled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting position, he reached for the glue trap, patting his hand for a moment till he felt it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at what was the \"catch-of-the-day.\" Almost a dozen tiny black ants lay entombed in the sticky glue, as well as a small wolf spider. Fewer still continued to move, their diminutive struggles almost invisible to the tall man. The large exterminator squinted at the hopelessly trapped ants, unable to appreciate their fear of him. He carefully plucked one of the ants from the trap, and brought the writhing bug close for identification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at a small pocket book of insect species, Eric determined this was a classic infestation of Carpenter Ants. He rubbed the tiny creature out between his fingers and reached for his clipboard to take note. As he did, he chanced to notice other movement from the glue paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaller than the already minutely sized ants, he had taken this pale speck to be a crumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered it briefly, wondering if it too was worth identifying.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Gloved in thick suede, the hand crashed into the floor heavily. Lifting, it shifted position, and slammed down again, this time flattening a terrified ant. It seemed to be crashing down at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" He yelled when the chaotic hand raised seemingly over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole world lurched violently. The gigantic gloved hand effortlessly brought the park-sized glue trap out into the open. Bryan felt his arm crack painfully from the harsh jolting. The enormous exterminator set the sheet down before him, his monolithic form crouching over it. Ignoring the pain in his arm, the shrunken man began shouting and struggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! I'm right here! Look!\" He gazed up at the masculine face high above. It showed no signs of recognition or even sympathy. Bryan looked on incredulously as the behemoth of a man peered seemingly right at him. \"Please! I don't want to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gigantic hand appeared once more. Fingers longer than office buildings dropped from above, making the terrified scientist recoil as they snatched the very ant that was responsible for Bryan's dilemma. He watched in horror as the helpless insect was roughly pressed between the massive gloved digits and torn from the sticky glue. The ant's twitching legs remained behind as the titan raised the tiny bug to his face and consulted a book in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched mortified. \"Shit, what the...-\" With a smooth motion, the massive fingers rubbed the tiny ant from existence. Bryan belted out another scream. He wasn't sure if he wanted to be noticed anymore, at least by this callous titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ever, Fate was unkind to the tiny man's wishes. High above, the giant exterminator's piercing gaze suddenly locked onto him. Bryan felt a rush as he stared back. Was he noticed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his fears, he decided to go for it. \"Yes! Yes! I'm a human! Help! I need <i>heeeeeeeelppp</i>!\" His pleas bled into screams of terror when the enormous hand suddenly loomed overhead, the giant fingers surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! NO! Stop!!!\" Suddenly he was pressed into by both index and thumb, his teeny form engulfed. Without warning an unbelievable force wretched him from the glue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his muffled shape, Bryan Smith screamed louder than he ever thought possible when his legs and arm were torn off in the cement-like glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric squinted his already keen eyes to see the tiny insect between his large fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\" The exterminator muttered. His brow furrowed as he came to an identification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed bits of red around the minuscule bug. \"Blood,\" Eric grunted. \"A fucking flea.\" The guide book wasn't needed to tell him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, he rubbed the stupid flea out with his fingers--glad he always wore thick work gloves. Wiping his hand on his jeans, he stood and grabbed his clipboard. He scrawled confirmation about the ants, and a note about a possible flea infestation. Over 7 years of exterminating taught him to always think, \"Where there is smoke, there is fire\", and this flea sure as hell wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied that he checked, Eric continued his investigation of the kitchen space. He didn't give any thought to the suffering he brought. It was no more than a job to him. As he continued his work, stomping from room to room, tiny ants scuttled away at the vibrations his huge boots caused. Thorough and methodical, the exterminator coated the kitchen and each room in turn with strong toxins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with a job well done, he left. Never knowing that the barely visible spot of red wiped onto his jeans was anything but a \"flea.\"</span></div></div>",

He covered his ears as Tommy hollered back up to his mother, \"ALRIGHT MOM, I'M DOING IT, GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to the tiny scientist's dismay, he watched as Tommy started up the washing machine. He knew he needed to act fast, for standing just under the tag of the teen's briefs was not the place to be when they were headed for the wash! Suddenly though, the briefs were lifted from the basket, carrying the miniature man with them! But, instead of being placed into the waters of the washing machine, they were set atop a hard surface. Bryan saw Tommy continue to load the machine. He also realized, that in the commotion, his arm had become stuck in the fibers of the briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- -- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy started up the machine, frustrated that he had to do chores. He was hungry and just wanted to chill in front of the TV with a bag of chips until dinner was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust prior to loading the clothes into the machine, Tommy noticed a hole in the loose boxer shorts he was currently sporting. Deciding he'd better not go back upstairs with a gaping hole in his only layer of clothing, he shed them off and tossed them into a garbage can across the room. He noticed a pair of briefs just under his jeans, and set them aside on the dryer to wear after. Even though they'd be worn once, he figured he'd just wear them until bed and then put them in the laundry to be washed next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- -- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had no clue why the briefs he was in weren't being washed, but he was feeling extremely lucky. He heard the clang of the washing machine door closing. Then his luck ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy grabbed the briefs again, and Mr. Smith felt like he was on a theme park ride as he was swiftly brought downward. His arm ached as it supported him, the briefs going vertical. Bryan grabbed with his other hand some loose fibers to hold himself up so all of his weight wasn't hanging from the one arm which was stuck. That was when he looked up, and saw Tommy stark naked, and he put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an enormous bare foot passed by into the leg hole to his right, then to the left. Before he knew it, Mr. Smith was on another ride, this time ascending up quickly. He had only a second to realize that moments ago he was staring at the tag in the back of the underwear, and was still in the same spot, before he was slammed straight into a giant bare butt cheek. The tiny man was pressed completely flat against the cheek by the elasticity of the underwear. All of this was nothing in comparison to when Tommy began to walk about. It was like Mr. Smith's entire world was moving. One moment the cheek would be taught and firm, then the next it would be soft and jiggle a little. This happened repeatedly with each step, Bryan forced up against the butt the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what would happen next...</span></div></div>",

He was closer than ever to his goal of getting Tommy to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to wait until things calm down, and then I can get his attention,\" the tiny man said aloud as he reasoned through things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squirmed again\u2026 \"If I can get my arm free of these stupid fibers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan stopped moving, to his tiny passenger's relief. He had succeeded in unwrapping some of the restraining fibers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy picked out a video game, bending over to retrieve it from a pile of games on the floor. As he did, the form-fitting briefs stretched out tight over his taut cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden increase in pressure as the briefs stretched out to accommodate the teenager's butt pushed air from the tiny man's lungs. He gave up trying to untangle himself and struggled instead for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pressure ended, and the butt cheek jiggled a little. Mr. Smith rejoiced. \"I can't believe it. I could have been pulverized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis elation was fleeting, however, when Tommy plopped down on the floor and prepared for a marathon session with his favorite video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dense carpet rushed up to meet the thin cotton briefs, and once again, the shrunken scientist was trapped between. Once again, he felt the enormous pressure magnified this time as so much of the titan's full weight pressed down on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it had been hardwood floors, the tiny man would already have been smushed. As it was, a gradual smothering seemed more likely.

Without time to do little more than scream, he watched helplessly as the titan's right shoe sailed overhead and landed a few hundred feet ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could rejoice, the other shoe dropped, much closer to the speck-sized man position on the floor. Having just regained his footing, the thunderous impact once again knocked the tiny man onto his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as suddenly as the giant had intruded, his footsteps receded as Tommy left the house, making his exit through the front door. Dismayed at having his only hope walk out the front door, the shrunken scientist got to his feet and raced after the teenaged giant, screaming Tommy's name as loudly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only answer came with the slamming of the monolithic door. Almost at once, an eerie silence descended on the vast house as the little man slowed his advance toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nerves felt on edge as adrenaline continued to surge through his body. Everything had happened so quickly, and ended so abruptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought to calm himself, slowly getting his ragged breathing back under control. He spoke aloud to reassure himself and help his brain formulate his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only hope just walked out the front door,\" he said with bitter frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frustration was made worse by the knowledge that he had already managed to make contact with Tommy only for a series of bad decisions and fateful accidents to again separate him from the only person who could save him from his foolish decision to shrink himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was Tommy's home, so he knew the titan would return. Impatient with his dilemma, however, the little man didn't want to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf nothing else, his series of misadventures ... falling into the cuff in the leg of a teenager's denim jeans, almost being stomped by that same oblivious teenager, nearly being swallowed in a shot glass of soda, almost slapped by Andy's enormous hand ... had emphasized that his actions in shrinking himself had placed him into a perilous world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to be ready next time,\" tiny Bryan said. \"I need a plan to get him to notice me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off as he thought back to how close Tommy's sneakers the size of cruise ships had come to stomping him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a plan that includes a way to make sure he doesn't mistake me for a bug,\" he added wryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense surroundings of Tommy's home sapped his courage as he stared at furniture the size of office buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, he will be looking for me,\" he said, before adding the caveat, \"I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought more on the sequence of events that had brought him to his current dilemma, the little man worried that Tommy might think that Andy's attempt to slap a \"bug\" had been successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he thinks I was that bug, he won't be looking for me!\" The tiny man gulped. \"He will think I'm...that I'm dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat put a new urgency on the matter. \"I've got to get Tommy's attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think about everything he knew of the teenager. The house was enormous. He could increase his chances by making his way to a place where he was more likely to encounter his enormous teenaged neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that Tommy was proud of a small gym equipped with exercise equipment and a weight bench that he had constructed in an empty storage room in the family garage. Of course, that would mean getting out of the main house and entering the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more attractive as a place to wait for Tommy, if he could make his way to the upper floor, would be inside the teenager's room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tiny man's trek across the vast floor would have looked much like, if someone had happened to glance down and see him, much like an ant or other small bug scurrying in a rapid motion over the polished floor boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis progress came to a screeching halt, however, at the lowest step on the staircase that led to the second floor of Tommy's home. The cliff-like step rose from the floor an equivalent of 200 feet from the bug-sized man's perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he could have managed to scale that first step, the shrunken scientist realized that another dozen or so 200-foot steps would remain for him to scale, one after the another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to find another way of getting Tommy's attention,\" he admitted to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left one other likely alternative, which put the tiny man on a journey to exit his neighbor's home in order to make his way into the garage that housed Tommy's gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, still worried about the disappearance of his neighbor, had gone to lift some weights. A long, hard workout usually helped him work off stress, and he was certainly feeling extreme stress after witnessing one of his friend's slapping poor Mr. Smith like a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing heavily on his mind was that he could not bring himself to admit to anyone what had happened to his tiny neighbor. He just kept thinking to himself how he had failed tiny Mr. Smith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through his workout, he raised up and removed his T-shirt. By the time a tiny, unseen man entered the gym at the back of his neighbor's garage, Tommy had worked up quite a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the house hadn't been terribly difficult. A wide space between the floor and the base of the back door had allowed him to merely walk beneath the door. He had been extremely nervous about crossing the exposed concrete walk between the house and the garage. The distance of a couple of yards looked like miles for the speck of a man. Knowing the importance of reaching Tommy, however, kept him motivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the shadowy garage, he heard loud groans and grunts that grew to a mammoth volume the closer he got to the makeshift gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that his instinct had been right, he felt elated. \"Tommy's in there!\" The tiny man exclaimed aloud, convinced that his rescue was much closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got close enough to see the gigantic teenager, the tiny man gasped in surprise. As an immense set of weights rose and fell with loud clanking noises, he saw the muscles of the titan's body as they rippled and flowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he stood on the cold, concrete floor in the same room with the massive giant, Mr. Smith felt almost unworthy of sharing the same universe with his enormous teenaged neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn acrid smell of adolescent sweat and testosterone felt cloying, almost as if the scent wanted to cling physically to his tiny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopped in his tracks by the impressive sight, sounds and smells, the tiny man...</span></div></div>",

This was stark reality, up close and overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud groans produced by the titanic teenager rumbled through the concrete floor and through the tiny scientist's body as he stared from the cold floor at the rippling of muscles as Tommy continued working out with the clanking weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager had removed his shirt, and his taut skin glistened with a healthy sheen of sweat. On other occasions, like after mowing the yard or coming home from games with his friends, Tommy had been shirtless in Mr. Smith's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith liked to think he wasn't so oblivious that he didn't notice important details. However, when he had been of normal size for a human being, he had never quite looked at his neighbor in quite the same way. Sure, Tommy had that \"boy next door\" look that was pleasant enough to enjoy at a glance, but now the bug-sized man found himself helpless to tear away his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt an upwelling of fantasies that muddled his more pressing need to gain Tommy's help. As he stared at the titan's chest, the tiny man imagined himself traveling the deep crevice between Tommy's impressive pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man moaned softly and shook his head. He was not thinking clearly, which was a good way to get himself injured...or worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head again, he forced himself to stop gazing in worshipful awe and think of a plan of action. His thoughts remained sluggish, affected by the almost hypnotic aroma of masculine sweat and testosterone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he compared himself to the titan, and came up lacking. He felt physically unworthy of sharing the same space with the colossal teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that self-defeating thought aside, the little man decided that his best chance of gaining Tommy's help would be to make a closer approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, he walked across the concrete floor, only to scream in shock when Tommy suddenly let a set of barbells drop to the floor with a sudden thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, satisfied with his workout, straddled the bench as he got to his feet. He reached for the shirt he had removed earlier and mopped his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, breathing deeply, and let his gaze wander down to the floor. The workout had done some good at helping ease his conscience about what had happened to poor Mr. Smith. He felt bad, but he hadn't crushed the little man. That had been entirely Andy's fault. Of course, Andy had thought he was only disposing of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in thought, he happened to gaze down at the floor and saw something tiny dart toward his right sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt bad that Andy had crushed Mr. Smith, but it hadn't been his fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, despite his recent experiences with a tiny man, one he now considered dead, Tommy's mind didn't register the tiny form darting away from the barbell as a human.

He felt bad enough about poor, tiny Mr. Smith without having to be reminded of his shrunken neighbor's fate by every bug that wandered across his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mr. Smith, the last seconds of his life stretched out longer... and longer. The monstrous rubber sole showed a gridwork of deep crevices as it rushed down upon him. When the descending sneaker didn't smash him to pulp, he tried to figure out what had spared him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in an instant, light flooded into the darkness as the shoe lifted off the floor. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith wasn't left behind on the floor. The speck-sized scientist discovered that his insignificant form was stuck in some sort of oozing crap that had become entrapped in the tread of Tommy's sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man went crazy from his panic, screaming his head off, as the shoe lifted and pounded, lifted and pounded, over and over again, as Tommy made his way back into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was tracking across the kitchen when he realized his shoes were leaving grimy prints on his mother's clean tile floor. \"Oh damn,\" he muttered as he reached down and slipped off one of his sneakers. He then repeated the process, and ended up carrying the sneakers through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world went topsy-turvy for tiny Mr. Smith who, still stuck in the tread, was now facing Tommy as the giant teenager carried his sneakers with him. \"Tommy!\" The little man screamed. \"God, Tommy! Here! Stuck in the tread! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy barged into his room and instantly tossed the sneakers on the floor near the foot of his bed.

It's me!\" He shouted up at the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirtless Tommy, clad only in a pair of shorts and his sneakers, kneeled on the concrete floor and stretched out his hand to fetch his shrunken neighbor to safety. He could not believe how close he had come to stomping on him! When he had seen something tiny scurry toward his shoe, his first instinct had told him the tiny form was a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hand got closer, he used two fingertips to deftly pinch the bug-sized man between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little man watched the enormous digits close on him, he reacted with belated panic. He found himself pinched between the massive fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The startled little man tried to protest. \"Careful! Don't crush me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, after only an instant of being forced to endure the crushing pressure between Tommy's fingertips, he felt himself released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell a short distance, landing in Tommy's open palm. Now Tommy's huge face, complete with droplets of sweat, stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND YOU!\" The teenager said, rather too loudly. \"I WAS SURE ANDY CRUSHED YOU BENEATH HIS HAND.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he missed,\" the little man shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Tommy's features twist into a puzzled frown. \"I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU,\" he explained. \"BETTER GET YOU INSIDE WHERE IT IS SAFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager began to form a twist around the alarmed little man. Before he could utter a word in protest, he found himself trapped inside Tommy's cavernous fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could barely move in the closed fist, but his confinement ended quickly. Once again, he dropped a short distance, this time onto an even more vast surface. Re-orienting himself, he realized that his gigantic teenaged neighbor was now stretched out on his back in his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked at the little man on his abs where he had dropped him. Seeing the tiny man's confusion, he laughed, which caused the \"landscape\" beneath the shrunken scientist's feet to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UP HERE, LITTLE GUY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man turned, realizing that he had to survey the vast terrain of the teenager's vast body in order to look toward the distant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager's skin still felt damp from the sweat generated by his weight-lifting workout. To his dismay, the little man also felt himself grow hard as he found himself standing among the teenager's distinctive abdominal ridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, I hope he can't tell,\" the little man worried. He tried to discreetly adjust the crotch of the pants he had shrunk to tiny size in preparation for his insane plan that had gone so awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and looked over his shoulder. Looking south toward the titan's shorts, all he could think of was the monster that must lay concealed beneath those form-fitting shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked ahead, but that showed him the teenager's sculpted pecs and the valley that rested between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt almost close to tears. \"Tommy! This...this isn't right. Please, you have to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tommy laughed again, the \"quake\" dropped the little man to his knees. He could not believe he was standing on his muscular neighbor's bare flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY,\" Tommy said. \"YOU SOUND LIKE A SQUEAKY BUG, MR. SMITH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement humiliated the little man. \"Tommy, what happened at my lab?\" He asked. \"Do you have the antidote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, trying his best to discern the feeble squeaks, shook his head.  Before he could repeat to the tiny man his inability to make out his words, the door to his bedroom burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn surprise, Tommy sat up in bed, sending the unprepared little man into a freefall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his brother, and feeling strangely guilty, Tommy erupted. \"What the hell, man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan, his older brother, grinned. \"You jerking off, little bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Tommy shouted, trying to locate his tiny neighbor. \"Don't be a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? You're the one in here jerking off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that I wasn't! Now, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan grinned. \"Could I borrow some cash? I know you were supposed to get paid by the professor next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't. Now, get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nathan left, Tommy finally got to look for Mr. Smith.</span></div></div>",

One moment he had been standing awkwardly on Tommy's stomach, gazing at the teenager's monolithic face beyond the double hills of the youth's impressive pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next, with the intrusion of Tommy's older brother into the room, the teeny scientist went spinning through the air before coming to a soft landing on a tan-colored landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from his shock, the little man eavesdropped on the conversation between the two titanic siblings as he tried to determine his new location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tan-colored terrain rose featured a rising bulge that provided a resting place for the winded little man. The color of the surface looked familiar, and then it clicked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in Tommy's lap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that, the insignificant speck of a man had landed atop the teenager's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gargantuan brothers argued, the tiny man dared not move. Even if he had dared, he would have remained frozen in awe as he realized that the bulge beneath the tan surface continued to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implication of the expanding khaki fabric wasn't lost on the tiny man. His awe turned to humiliation when he realized his current size of a quarter-inch tall would make Tommy's... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" He realized that the bulge concealed beneath Tommy's tight shorts would look 150 feet tall to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed with a dry mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe bigger,\" he muttered as he tried in vain to comprehend the size and power of what lay hidden beneath the layer of fabric spread beneath tiny Mr. Smith's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raised volume from the two giants alerted him that their argument had grown more heated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, GET OUT!\" Tommy ordered his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man watched Tommy's older, taller brother leave the room. In truth, the tiny scientist felt relief that he no longer had to share the immediate space of Tommy's room with Nathan. He trusted Tommy, but he had never thought highly of the older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nathan slammed the door, Tommy edged forward and, in what he probably considered a whisper, called out for Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The little man yelled. \"Down here on your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off. \"Down here!\" He repeated instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy cracked a huge grin when he saw the itty-bitty man leaping on his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE YOU ARE!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"SORRY ABOUT THAT. NATHAN CAN BE A DICK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized little man felt his face flush red at the teenager's description, considering his current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cupped his hands to his mouth in an attempt to magnify his voice. \"Tommy, I still need some help,\" he reminded the teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, as he shifted his position in the bed, discovered somewhat awkwardly, that he had grown hard during the encounter with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it because a tiny man... his next-door-neighbor ... now looked like nothing more than a puny bug atop his massive bulge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the little man's squeaky appeal for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO, MR. SMITH,\" Tommy finally admitted. \"THEY WON'T LET ME INTO YOUR LAB.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in the tiny man's ears, effectively dashing his hopes of a quick restoration to his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T WORRY,\" Tommy said. \"I WILL KEEP YOU SAFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he tried to think of something to distract him, the teenager could not help but focus on the amazing discrepancy in size that now existed between himself and his adult neighbor, now totally helpless and utterly dependent on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, and meant to joke with the tiny man, but his words only added to the shrunken man's distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I MUST LOOK LIKE A GOD TO YOU,\" Tommy said and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Doing math in his head without aid of a calculator had never been something at which he excelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared up at his teenaged neighbor's massive face, the frustrated scientist noticed the glazed look to the titan's eyes. He stamped his tiny feet in outrage \"Tommy! Are you even listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy hadn't been trying to listen for the actual words in Mr. Smith's squeaky tirade.

He needed to keep a positive outlook. He needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed again. \"DOWN ON YOUR KNEES LIKE THAT, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE WORSHIPING ME.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhmygod! The bug-sized scientist bolted to his feet. \"Are you serious?\" He squeaked. \"Can you not focus for more than two minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Tommy's focus had narrowed, but his tiny neighbor would have been horrified by the teenager's thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WANT TO SEE MORE?\" The teenager asked, pointedly looking at the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith could not believe his ears. \"No!\" He exclaimed in a squeaky protest that was quite audible to the huge teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with the unequivocal rebuff, the teenager actually reddened. \"JUST KIDDING, MAN,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he was not telling the truth. He wanted nothing more than to unzip his shorts and then pull back his underwear for the purpose of dropping the tiny man inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he considered it. He didn't much care whether the bug-sized man was willing or unwilling. In fact, an unwilling tiny Mr. Smith played into the teenager's growing sense of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, once Mr. Smith grew back, he'd still be Tommy's neighbor. Perhaps he could find a way to make the little man willing to \"play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, what if Mr. Smith simply didn't grow back? No one else knew what had happened to the tiny man.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tiny man screamed as he was tossed carelessly inside the drawer. Although the drop was a mere couple of inches to a normal person, it seemed more like fifty feet to the miniaturized scientist. Fortunately, as on previous occasions, his reduced scale also served to protect him from injury; he landed with a plop on an object vaguely akin to an immense gym mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019LL BE SAFER IN THERE!\u201d Tommy\u2019s voice came floating down from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Bryan had a chance to climb to his feet and yell up in protest the drawer was abruptly slammed shut, casting him into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stood in the middle of his room with a broad grin on his face. He was only peripherally aware that his pulse rate had increased dramatically and he was breathing more heavily than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He\u2019s just so... teeny</i>, Tommy\u2019s mind kept repeating. He couldn\u2019t get out of his head the vision of Mr. Smith trapped in his lap, squeaking with alarm. His mind replayed the details of the scene over and over again: the sight of the tiny man standing actually on his bulge, dwarfed by its scale; the minuscule figure being slowly lifted as the tight fabric of Tommy\u2019s pants expanded beneath him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager swallowed nervously. It had been different when he\u2019d first discovered what had happened to his neighbour. He had been too shocked by the revelation that a human could be reduced to such a minute size, and his priority had been to prevent the tiny man from being mistaken for a bug and crushed, so there hadn\u2019t been time to reflect on the more... <i>personal</i> implications of the scientist\u2019s condition. Now, however, the danger was past and he had Mr. Smith tucked away safe inside his drawer, giving him time to consider matters properly. From what he could tell, nobody else in the world knew where Mr. Smith was or what had happened to him. No one at the lab was aware; otherwise the little man wouldn\u2019t have needed Tommy\u2019s help in the first place. Even Joe, who\u2019d anyway regarded the teeny scientist\u2019s predicament more as an annoying distraction, thought that he\u2019d been squashed by Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant Tommy had the tiny man all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the teenager dared to admit to himself that he enjoyed Mr. Smith being so utterly tiny, helpless\u2014and completely reliant upon him. More than enjoyed: there was something about being able to hold an <i>actual living man</i> in the palm of his hand\u2014a guy he had previously looked up to and respected\u2014that gave Tommy a sensation that he\u2019d never experienced before: an intoxicating feeling of almost godlike power. But it was seeing that same tiny man directly compared to what was growing inside his shorts that finally raised the already-horny teenager\u2019s barely-suppressed sexual frustration to fever pitch. All he knew was that he desperately wanted to do <i>something</i> to this tiny little man he now had in his possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis possession? Tommy rather liked the thought that Mr. Smith now belonged to him and was his to command or do with as he pleased. However, it wasn\u2019t enough. Tommy was well aware that he could simply pick up the tiny man and drop him inside his briefs without a second thought, but in his mind that represented a failure. The teenager\u2019s growing ego insisted that somebody as tiny as Mr. Smith should be only too eager to worship and explore the body of the handsome young giant who had effectively saved his life. What Tommy was less keen to admit to himself was that he had been embarrassed and confused by the little man\u2019s earlier rebuff, and it only made him more determined to persuade Mr. Smith to change his mind and play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough basically a good-natured and friendly young man, the reasons for the teenager\u2019s growing obsession were not hard to fathom. Naturally optimistic and self-confident, Tommy\u2019s pride had been further boosted since taking up lifting. At first he had simply found exhilarating the feeling of his muscles developing and his body becoming more powerful. But then he had noticed that he was starting to attract attention from others, both male <i>and</i> female, and had quickly come to enjoy every minute of it. Mowing people\u2019s lawns shirtless frequently won him admiring glances from passers-by\u2014as well as the occasional tip or raise from his employers. Tommy had been fascinated to discover that even shy Mr. Smith was no exception in that regard, noting with amusement how his neighbour occasionally become flustered or distracted if Tommy removed his shirt around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with the casual arrogance of a teenager, Tommy quickly convinced himself that his tiny neighbour\u2019s apparent rebuff could not have been sincere. How could it, after finding himself actually ON that same bare torso, let alone in Tommy\u2019s bulging crotch? <i>He was probably just scared by how big I am</i>, he reasoned, blushing slightly at the double meaning despite being alone in the privacy of his room. <i>Maybe if I give him a bit of time alone to calm down and realise that he\u2019s safe he\u2019ll be more interested in playing. After all, it\u2019s just the two of us fooling around. Nobody else will find out. And if that\u2019s still not enough I\u2019ll just have to remind him that he still needs my help!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something else occurred to him. <i>Maybe he <u>wants</u> me to order him about?</i> Tommy wondered. It was as though a light bulb had suddenly <i>pinged</i> into existence above his head. <i>That must be it! He\u2019s really shy so he prefers other people to take charge. No wonder he wanted to shrink himself! This must be his fantasy!</i> The teenager was delighted with his reasoning and felt certain that he had uncovered Mr. Smith\u2019s secret desires. Now he could proceed with his own fun, secure in the knowledge that any protests from his neighbour were simply part of the fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely enthralled by this hormonally-fuelled daydream Tommy was oblivious to any possible consequences and how they might affect his relationship with his neighbour should Mr. Smith ever return to normal size. In fact, the teenager was no longer sure he even wanted that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, his more pressing concern was that he was still sweaty from his workout, and the almost painful throbbing and straining of his erection reminded him that he really DID need to \u201ctake care\u201d of something\u2014and urgently. Tommy stripped off his shorts and sweaty underwear and kicked them carelessly onto the floor. Naked and horny beyond belief he dashed to the shower, too distracted even to remember to close the bedroom door securely behind him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the confines of the drawer Mr. Smith was frustrated and dismayed by Tommy\u2019s unexpectedly cavalier treatment of him, but he reminded himself that at least he was safe for now. For the first time since recklessly shrinking himself and embarking on this ill-fated expedition he did not have to worry about being eaten or swatted like a bug. Now if he could only snap Tommy out of his daydream and get the teenager to take him to the lab... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could hear thuds and rustling noises from outside that he supposed were Tommy moving around or getting changed. After a few moments these faded away and Mr. Smith was left to contemplate his situation in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small gap at the top of the drawer allowed in a faint strip of light, and once the miniature scientist\u2019s eyes had adjusted to the gloom he was able to take stock of his position. The drawer itself seemed huge: larger than an aircraft hanger to the little man. He was currently standing on the top of a broad expanse of material raised high above the bottom. Bryan squatted down and ran his hand across the surface, noting how rough it felt against his palm. It wasn\u2019t as solid and unyielding as wood or plastic, reminding him instead of thick canvas: a sail perhaps, or\u2014nearer in scale\u2014a collapsed circus tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim light he could just about discern some kind of pattern or texture on the surface and guessed this must indeed be an item of clothing; more likely a whole pile of clothes folded neatly and laid out inside the drawer by Tommy\u2019s mom. The tiny man wandered slowly across the garment, looking for the edge and a way to climb down. He instead found a broad ridge and followed it, eventually reaching what appeared suspiciously like a waistband. Bryan was too small to read exactly what the line of huge letters etched across its surface spelled out, but their significance was all too obvious and the tiny man realised with a shock what he was standing on. <i>It\u2019s a giant pair of briefs! I\u2019m standing on a pile of Tommy\u2019s underwear!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Bryan\u2019s sense of utter physical helplessness, insignificance and unworthiness compared to Tommy all but consumed him. The sheer scale of this simple undergarment took his breath away and instantly brought back the memory of where he had been scant minutes before. Unbidden, the recollection of the warmth, contour, and above all <i>size</i> of the body part that would occupy a garment like this once more filled his thoughts. Although he didn\u2019t necessarily want to admit it to Tommy, he suddenly realised that maybe he <i>did</i> want to see that part of his body: to comprehend its full scale and compare it to his own minuscule form. The fact that Tommy was apparently willing and even eager to oblige...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gulped and tried to suppress such inappropriate thoughts, but they were simply too powerful and once again he found himself becoming hard despite himself. The irony of him falling victim to those same urges for which he had berated Tommy was not lost on the miniaturized scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was, his young neighbour was extremely good-looking even under the most normal of circumstances. Magnified to the size of a skyscraper and half-naked, with his bare chest and powerful muscles gleaming with sweat, the sense of scale and sheer masculine power was overwhelming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven within the confines of the drawer the air seemed humid with perspiration and testosterone and a wave of fuzziness once more clouded Bryan\u2019s mind. The vision of a giant Tommy, towering above him and wearing very little, warred with Mr Smith\u2019s more prudent desire to return to normal size and safety\u2014and won. Scorning his earlier reservations, the scientist\u2019s keen analytical mind began constructing arguments to justify getting closer to the colossal young man. After all, he reminded himself, the whole point of his adventure had been to encounter and interact with a normal-sized person at his minute scale. He might have failed in his original plan to mail himself to Zack, but perhaps he could still achieve his objective with Tommy instead? True, he had never imagined a situation quite like this occurring, but if Tommy was genuinely willing then maybe he should simply let the handsome teenager have his way. It wasn\u2019t as though he was indifferent to what the young man was keeping inside his pants, so if Tommy didn\u2019t mind then why should he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore to the point, he didn\u2019t want to do anything that might risk offending his neighbour. He didn\u2019t believe Tommy would ever intentionally harm him, but if the teenager chose not to help him Mr. Smith feared he might never regain his proper size. Despite his fascination with being so small Bryan wasn\u2019t quite ready to spend the rest of his life no bigger than an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was no time to indulge in further introspection. The tiny man heard the sound of footsteps outside the drawer and guessed that Tommy must have returned. Taking a deep breath he decided that if the teenager still wanted to play at being a \u201cgod\u201d, then this time he would allow himself to be persuaded to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a creak and a jolt, and then the drawer was whisked open in sudden blaze of light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tommy seemed to be breathing slightly heavily and his hair was wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about submitting to Tommy and actually doing it were totally different things when the giant was right there. Bryan's quick idea of what it would be like was nothing compared to the stark reality of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bryan reminded himself that he would probably have no choice. Despite where he was, his rational and scientific mind took over and told him this was his best option - and it could also be enjoyable in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he called up. A grin appeared on Tommy's fave and the hand quickly reached into the drawer, trapping Bryan between two fingers with ease. Bryan gasped in pain but the noise was lost as Tommy exhaled loudly. Bryan could even feel the fingers shaking, and this only served to prove what Bryan already knew - Tommy was going to try something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you out of there,\" rumbled Tommy. Bryan nearly threw up as he was carried across the room towards the bed and, after more confusing tumbling and strange movements, he found himself on a familiar surface - Tommy's stomach, surrounded by a 6-pack and near the belly button. Bryan looked behind him and saw Tommy was wearing only a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped. He just hoped the teenager was careful, whatever he had planned.

He dropped his towel, saw you looking at his nicely-sized package, winked, and then quickly pulled on a pair of board shorts, his normal attire. \"Goin' commando for easy access just in case you change your mind.

He went back to his own room, left the door slightly ajar and watched through the crack until he saw Tommy dash across the landing. He waited a moment, then crept out and listened at the bathroom door until he heard the water pounding. Nathan smiled, knowing that he would have a good ten or fifteen minutes to snoop around Tommy\u2019s room and look for cash\u2014or perhaps something embarrassing enough to make his brother pay for his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked first underneath Tommy\u2019s bed, but found nothing of interest\u2014not that he really expected to in such an obvious location. Stepping gingerly around the dirty clothes on the floor he noticed Tommy\u2019s phone on his desk, carelessly left unlocked, and quickly scrolled through the most recent messages and photos. They were all pretty banal; the pictures of his girlfriend were disappointingly tame, and Nathan sucked his teeth in frustration. Then his eye fell upon the drawer where Tommy\u2019s underwear and socks were kept. He himself would never choose such a place, but his brother lacked his imagination so Nathan figured there was no harm in checking. He walked across the room and pulled open the drawer to look inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlat on his back, looking up, tiny Mr. Smith was petrified with fear as he saw Nathan\u2019s colossal form loomed unexpectedly over the drawer. Whereas Tommy was a personable young man, his older brother was certainly <u>not</u> an individual who could be considered either good-natured or reliable. The last time Bryan had encountered him Mr. Smith had been up late, trying to finish an important research paper. Tommy and his mom had gone away for the weekend, leaving Nathan in charge\u2014and the older teenager had promptly arranged a party next door. When Bryan had knocked on the door to ask them to turn down the music, Nathan had answered, clearly drunk, listened to his neighbour\u2019s polite request with a condescending smirk, then laughed contemptuously and slammed the door in Mr. Smith\u2019s face. Bryan had been too shocked and intimidated even to tell Nathan\u2019s mom when she returned. After seeing how even Tommy had apparently begun to regard him more as a tiny pet or toy than as a person he hardly dared imagine how somebody as opportunistic and unsympathetic as Nathan might view him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s eyes began to dart back and forth, taking in the contents of the drawer.

And no one, not even Joe, knew that his tiny next-door neighbor was currently trapped in his underwear and sock drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one knows,\" he kept thinking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed back to the image of the tiny man's form crawling on his bulge. His heart began to beat faster, and he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been an intense feeling, all mixed up with power, control and confusing signals about sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man must get some sort of thrill being tiny and helpless. What if Mr. Smith wanted to have more fun? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, if he decided it, who would ever know? Mr. Smith wasn't in a position to tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy worked himself into quite then state, then began to worry. What if he tried something and Mr. Smith said no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he laughed at his stupidity. How could a bug refuse a giant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mr. Smith was less than willing, there would be ways to \"persuade\" him. As he recalled, the timid little scientist was certainly more than a little afraid of being stomped underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA veiled threat, even if not sincere, might do wonders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith sat in the ominous silence that closed around him after Tommy shut the drawer. He was slowly coming to terms with some of the stark and unpleasant facts about his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teenaged neighbor, Tommy, had gotten the impression that he was in charge. He sighed, as the truth dawned on him. It was easy for even an impressionable teenager like Tommy to take charge of a man that had intentionally reduced himself to a size smaller than most bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had even felt like a bug earlier, when he had been crawling over the teenager's bulge beneath his underwear. That had been\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been a wake-up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also awaken some strange feelings in the normally mature, level-headed scientist. After all, he had gotten into his tiny state because he wanted to experience life from a whole new perspective. He hadn't planned on renouncing citizenship in the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt tense and frustrated as he thought back to the immense size of Tommy's bulge. Hell, it had been like climbing over a large hillside. In the dark, he flashed back to the scene, and recalled the fascinated look in the immense teenager's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a hold of yourself,\" Mr. Smith chided himself. \"He's still a teenager, and I will just have to get him to respect my authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said than done when you're the size of an ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, what have I done? No one even knows what's happened to me!\" He shouted into the darkness of Tommy's drawer of socks and underwear. These enormous garments were the same as the form-fitting one that had stretched over Tommy's\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, stop it, stop it,\" the tiny man chided himself. \"I have to stop thinking of him as a giant, and focus on making him remember he is still just a high school student and my next-door neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the drawer was pulled open, and the tiny man found his teenaged neighbor, looking huge and determined, staring down at him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tommy was the very definition of godly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis huge fingers reached down to grab the little man. As they pinched his quarter-inch form, Mr. Smith let out a shout. \"Tommy!

Kiss it Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith was stunned by Tommy's sudden turn. The ground he stood on was the teenager's sculpted muscles. The air he breathed was filled with his sweaty musk. He got down on his knees and kissed the ground, tasting the salty sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'm your god. I could squish you beneath one toe. I could blow you away with one fart.

Now, reduced to the size of a bug, Mr. Smith found the modest suburban home looked quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's mother was a typical single mother, raising two sons in the suburbs. She didn't have much to give her youngest son in the way of an allowance, which was how he became acquainted with his next-door neighbor in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith needed a dependable young man to do certain chores around his home, such as mow the lawn, occasionally wash his car or run other errands. The research scientist's life at the lab meant he kept irregular hours, and he would have let many household chores slide if not for Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he took a liking to the young man, who was unfailingly polite and respectful with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tommy's friends and girlfriend might leave a lot to be desired, Mr. Smith did think highly of his teenaged neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had watched him grow up over the years, and sometimes he even felt like a favorite \"adopted\" uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man still felt confident that Tommy could get him out of the nightmare that he had voluntarily entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had come so close when the titanic teen had found him and agreed to go to the lab for a supply of antidote. Something had gone wrong, and Tommy and his pal had returned to Mr. Smith's home empty-handed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith hadn't been given time to figure out what had detoured his plan. Tommy's other friend, Andy, had almost crushed the tiny man into oblivion with a mere slap of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he managed to leap from his kitchen table, preferring to take his chances with gravity rather than Andy's enormous hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray air current had prolonged his ordeal, however, by blowing the tiny speck of a man into the cuff of Tommy's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when his teenaged neighbor arrived home, and Tommy's mother demanded he surrender the jeans for the laundry, Mr. Smith's dilemma intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been knocked onto the tile floor of the laundry room, but unharmed (more or less) he had escaped into the rest of the huge house without Tommy's mother seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could well imagine how she might have reacted seeing something tiny and bug-like scurrying across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just got to find Tommy,\" he told himself. \"He's my only hope for getting out of this nightmare and back to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist had just encountered a sizable obstacle, the first step on the stairs to the upper floor (and Tommy's room), when he felt the shaking and heard the stomps that signaled a giant on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hopes for a quick rescue, however, were dashed when he recognized the giant as Tommy's older brother, Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith's only encounters with Nathan had been thoroughly unpleasant. The young man coupled arrogance with a dependably irresponsible attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had finished high school two years ago, he hadn't continued to college and seemed unwilling to seek any meaningful employment. Mr. Smith felt that Nathan set a bad example for his younger brother, not that the two siblings ever seemed that close in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the floor near the base of the staircase, the tiny man gazed up as the huge god descended the steps two at a time. He was so mesmerized he almost didn't realize his danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan, bare foot and dressed only in a rumpled pair of boxers, had emerged from his room to see if he could finagle  a lunch from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man, as his peril gradually dawn on him, ran for the nearest cover by the time one of Nathan's huge bare feet hovered overhead as he prepared to step down onto the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, he had an idea. He had seen plenty of food in his neighbor's fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" he told Nathan. \"I'll get something next door at Mr. Smith's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he know you raid his fridge?\" Nathan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What he doesn't know won't hurt him,\" Tommy said. \"Besides, for all the things I do for that nerd, he owes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, the tiny man listened, hurt by the teenager's callous indifference.  But, he needed to swallow his pride. Tommy still represented his only hope of regaining his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan belched. \"Hold on,\" he said. \"Maybe I'll walk next door with you. I haven't been inside that science geek's house in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants were going back to Mr. Smith's home.

He jerked his hand back and wiped it on his T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOT IT!\" Andy boasted as Tommy ran to the sink and began retching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?\" Andy asked. \"IT WAS JUST A STUPID BUG.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trapped like an insignificant insect. \"What are they doing. I'm not a bug,\" he shouted and run toward his jail. As he reached the glassy wall he started to drum against it. But of course no one could hear him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT. I'LL SWALLOW IT FOR FIVE BUCKS\", Andy accepted the deal. \"BUT I WILL NEED SOMETHING TO WASH IT DOWN.

Suddenly the ambiance was shocking. \"What the...\", Bryan was falling and in a few seconds the glass was turned around and he was now lying on the empty ground of it. \"Hey! Do you want to break me or what?\", Bryan rubbed his butt. For  a moment he lost his fear for the two giant figures which were looming high up in the sky above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as fast as the glass was turned around, as fast Steve was filling it with cold coke out of the bottle he was holding. \"Nooo!\", Bryan screamed, as the frosty liquid poured into the glass. \"THAT'S ENOUGH.\", Andy said. The glass was just filled with that volume, Andy could easily empty it with one gulp. He reached for the glass and looked at the helpless insect in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps there was still a little chance, Andy and Steve could recognize him. But now, as only Bryan's head and his arms were visible, the tiny hectically struggling crumb was nothing more than a worthless ant size creature.

He had to try to communicate with the two giants above him. But he could not see anything up there, because of the distance and he didn't know if they were near enough to hear him, so Bryan started to scream a last time with all the power he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds he tried, \"Hey, down here! Please look closer, I'm down here! Pleaase...\", but suddenly the distance became clearer and Bryan could see that the liquid he was swimming in was moving to the side, slowly but it did. \"Hooray!!\", Bryan shouted, \"They saw me!\", Bryan began to swim with the liquid toward the top of the tilting glass. But after a few seconds of swimming and hoping, he stopped instantly, as he recognized something in front of the glass which was looking like giant lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\", he thought as Andy opened his mouth and Bryan could see why the glass was tilting, and what fatal mistake he was thinking. \"No!!\", Bryan screamed. In the same moment, foul smelling breath blew against the helpless insect and Bryan gazed in shock, into the disgusting structure in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy's oral hygiene was not the best and between all his yellow colored teeth were rests of chips and other mud stuck. Saliva was collecting in his palate and ran in slimy threads from the corners of his mouth over the sticky tongue, to the front of his mouth. \"Oh my god!! No...\", Bryan screamed and started to turn around. But as fast as he swam as faster the liquid was entering Andy's gasping foul smelling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock Bryan looked one last time back and saw that he had already entered Andy's mouth and that he was poured away toward a giant black hole, the point of no return. \"Noo!! Tommy! Help me out of here, heelp me...\", Andy gulped and put the empty glass onto the table. \"AND YOU'RE SURE THAT LITTLE PEST IS'NT UNHEALTHY FOR ME?\", \"HEHE OF COURSE NOT, IN TEN MINUTES OR SO IT WILL BE COMPLETELY DIGESTED AND THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT AS HOT GAS.\", the two boys began to laugh out loudly and Andy rubbed his belly, \"WE WISH YOU A NICE TRIP IN THERE, AND I'M SURE, I WILL MEET YOU AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS, ANYWAY, WHAT IS LEFT FROM YOU.\", Andy convulsed with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY I THINK WE SHOULD GO ON FOR THE TV NOW, THE GAME HAS ALREADY STARTED NEARLY SIXTEEN MINUTES AGO.\", Steve looked on his watch. \"TAKE THAT BAG OF CHIP AND GO FOR THE TV, I WILL CARRY THE COKE BOTTLE AND THE GLASSES.\". And the two teenagers started to watch the remaining minutes of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirteen minutes; the game was over and their team have won; the chips bag and the bottle were empty, the boys sat full and satisfied on Bryan's sofa, Steve zapped through the channels and Andy tried to remove the remains of the chips out of his teeth with a fork. \"THAT SUCKS, WE SHOULD GO NOW, BEFORE TOMMY CAMES BACK OR WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT WE CAN DOW NOW?\", Steve asked his too bored friend. In the same moment the front door opened and Tommy stormed into the kitchen, \"MR. SMITH, MR. SMITH, I FOUND IT!! I... HEY WHERE ARE YOU?\", Tommy looked confused over the empty kitchen table. As he searched around and holding the saltshaker up Andy and Steve entered the kitchen. \"HEY DUDE. WE...\", Tommy turned back in shock and dropped the shaker. It broke open and all of the salt spilled onto the floor. \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO GUYS DOING HERE, HAVE'NT I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE? LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.\", Andy got down upon his knees to clean up. \"HOW SHOULD WE NOW YOU'RE A SO JUMPY COWARD\", Andy said stroppy.<br>\r\n\"WE JUST HAVE WATCHED THE GAME, TOMMY, ARE YOU OK?\", Steve pinched Andy's bottom. \"HEY...\", Steve looked angrily to Andy, \"EHM, YES..., CAN WE HELP YOU? YOU SEARCHED SOMETHING, RIGHT?\", Andy asked rubbing his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO YOU WERE IN THE KITCHEN?\", Tommy asked as he stood up. \"IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.\", \"WE DID'NT PUT SOMETHING AWAY IF YOU MEAN THAT, AND WE DID'NT SEE SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN HERE, ANDY?\", \"YES THAT'S RIGHT, WE JUST WATCHED THE GAME TOMMY.\", Andy agreed. \"O.K., I BELIEVE IN YOU, BUT...\", \"BUT WHAT? SO WHAT DO YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, PERHAPS WE CAN HELP YOUR FINDING IT?\". Tommy thought about telling his friends what happend, but, could he trust them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS, BUT..., O.K., YOU'RE LISTING TO ME?\", \"SURE, GO AHEAD\", Andy said. \"IT'S ABOUT MR. SMITH, HE..., O.K., PLEASE LISTEN TO ME NOW..., HE INVENTED A SHRINKING SERUM, AND..., HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY SHRUNK HIMSELF TO AN EIGHT OF AN INCH. HE WAS HERE ON THE KITCHEN TABLE AS I LEFT THE HOUSE, BECAUSE I SHOULD BRING HIM THE ANTIDOTE, SO HE CAN GROWTH BACK TO NORMAL SIZE. BUT NOW, I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYMORE. HE HAS LOST.\". Andy looked to Steve, he did the same, and than the two boys started to laugh. \"THAT'S NOT FUNNY.\", Tommy said frantically. \"STOP LAUGHING!\", \"SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T.\", Andy and Steve roared with laughter. \"YOU'RE REALLY A MANIAC, TOMMY, HOLY SHIT!\", Andy said. \"THAT'S THE WORST  FAIRY STORY I HAVE EVER HEARD!\", Steve soothed. \"DAMN! THAT'S NOT A JOKE! HERE, LOOK AT THAT FLASK OF ANTIDOTE.\" \"KEEP CALM TOMMY, IT'S O.K., BUT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY, WAS'NT IT ANDY?\", \"HEHE, YEAH, NICE JOKE TOMMY!\". Tommy looked at the flask, looked around, saw a potted plant on the window sill and put it onto the kitchen table. \"MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\", Andy's restrained laughter, looked to Steve and he shook his head only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Tommy opened the flask and dribbled something about the plant. The three boys looked at it, Tommy with strain, the two other teens rather tired. \"AND NOW? WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?\", \"WE DID'NT SEE ANYTHING TOMMY...\", Andy and Steve said after a few seconds of waiting. But suddenly the plant began to grow. First slowly, but than rapidly till it reached under the room, than stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE?\", \"WOW!!\". \"THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! A GROWING FLUID!\", \"COOOOL\", Andy and Steve said dumbfounded. \"YOU SEE? BUT THAT'S MR. SMITH ANTIDOTE! YOU KNOW NOW WHAT I MEAN?\", the three boys looked back to the kitchen table. \"SHIT, HE'S REALLY SHRUNK YOU SAY?\", Steve answered quietly. \"DAMN, WE HAVE TO FIND HIM!\", Andy said. \"YES, HE MUST BE SOMEWHERE HERE. HE TOLD ME TO WAIT HERE FOR ME.\". \"ANDY, YOU LOOK ON THAT SIDE, STEVE ON THE OTHER. I WILL START HERE IN THE MIDDLE.\". So the three boys did, but as much as the searched and looked around, of course they can't find Mr. Smith. \"BURPPP\", Andy belched accidentally. \"UPS, SORRY.\", he said abashed. \"MUST BE SOMETHING I HAVE EATEN!\", \"MAN, BRUSH YOUR MOUTH ANDY, YOU SMELL LIKE HELL!\", Steve jumped to the side holding his nose. \"FOCUS ON YOUR JOB, OK? YOU CAN BE CHILDISH WHEN WE HAVE FOUND MR. SMITH.\", \"AND IF HE HAD FALLEN FROM THE TABLE ONTO THE KITCHEN FLOOR?\", Steve asked. \"SHIT, YOU ARE RIGHT! THAT'S BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND HIM HERE.\", \"BUT COULD WE JUST HAD STOMPED ON HIM AT HIS SIZE? HE'S ONLY ANT SIZE YOU SAID, RIGHT?\", Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy felt queasy in the pit of his stomach. \"ALL STOP, NOW! AND SIT ONTO THE KITCHEN TABLE, FAST!\", the three boys did what Tommy said. \"NOW EVERYONE CHECK THE BOTTOM OF HIS SHOOS IF THERE ARE SOME RED GUTS UNDER IT!\", but again they could'nt find anything what looked like a scrunched bug. And they began to scan the entire floor, slowly,  moving on their knees, their faces near to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO NOT AIM WITH THAT FOR ME.\", Steve said\u00b4, as he saw Andy's ass in front of him. \"WHAT YOU SAY?\", Andy giggled and farted Steve in his face. \"DAMN!!\", Steve jumped up holding his nose. \"I REALLY HATE YOU DO YOU KNOW?\", Steve looked down to the chuckling Andy. \"WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?? STEVE, ANDY! MOVE ON! AND SHUT UP, O.K.?\", Tommy  looked at Andy still giggling and Steve, still shaking away the rotten-egg smelling air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we already know it, they could not find what they were looking for. And if it were the frayed nerves of Andy and Steve, or only their asininity, that they just not only had a second the idea, what really happened to Mr. Smith. \"MR. SMITH?!\", Tommy shouted, \"DAMN, WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU?? PLEASE, WE'RE HERE, PLEASE COME OUT WHERE EVER YOU  ARE!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Bryan, of course he would answer them, but ... does a skeleton located in the small intestine of a stupid giggling boy can answer? And the rest of Bryan's body, perhaps his spirit, his soul, already had left Andy's digestive system, as belch and as smelly fart, now hovering above the three boys, and watching a last time his executor.</span></div></div>",

He ran in a panic, realizing that Tommy had indeed mistaken him for a pathetic, helpless insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He screamed a plea for Tommy to spare him, but knew words would be useless with the monstrous teeanger.

Fortunately, the shoe missed him by a few inches, but the thunderous impact knocked the bug-sized teen off his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later, other gigantic shoes dropped to the floor, this time even closer, but still missing him by mere inches as Tommy followed Joe down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his relatively safe position close to the wall, tiny Mr. Smith saw the giants quickly overtake the shrunken teen. He saw the colossal shoes crash down and then continue their journey. A second later, he saw Andy, curled into a ball and cowering on the floor, obviously in shock at the near misses he had just suffered because of the unknowing actions of his two giant friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the scientist caught up to him, Andy was muttering. \"Oh god! They almost stomped me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my world,\" Mr. Smith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caused this!\" Andy screamed at him. \"You and your stupid formula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if we work together, we may be able to find a way out of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Andy said. \"This is all your fault. Why would I work with you?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the distance, Mr. Smith could see Tommy's gigantic sneakers stomping heavily towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, down here!\" Andy cried out. His arms flapped wildly over his head like an octopus, his mind irrationally set on gaining the attention of his now gargantuan buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Help me! Look down!\" Andy kept his foolhardy pace, with a panting Bryan Smith desperately in pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Tommy showed no sign of hearing tiny Andy's pleas. Each lumbering step sent powerful vibrations that caused the two bug-sized men to stumble as they ran. Tommy seemed to move in slow motion, his mountainous limbs maneuvering as if in water due to their great size. Despite this supposedly sluggish movement, the huge teen still walked at a normal pace, his steps easily covering miles of ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run away you stupid fool! Run!\" The frightened scientist screamed, trying vainly to rescue the confused Andy. Andy suddenly slowed, stopped, and gawked at Tommy's massive sneakers. His huge form dominated the sky, two towering legs, thick with muscle, rose up like hair-covered beanstalks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge footwear landed thunderously, causing tiny Andy to stumble and fall. Only a couple hundred feet away stood Tommy's left sneaker, the scuffed, grass-stained rubber sole looming over two stories high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy barely had a chance to react further when Tommy's deep voice declared, \"DAMN ANTS ARE EVERYWHERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive sneaker lifted into the air suddenly. Andy fell back, covering his head with his arms, sobbing. Bryan looked up, Tommy's face looked down at them indifferently, his face seemingly as distant as the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was blocked by the huge sneaker sole, the treads crammed with mud and grime. The sneaker brand logo was barely recognizable from the dirt covering it. Bryan's mind was blank as the impossible mass of rubber descended rapidly, frozen with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, there is a freaking infestation.\" Tommy groaned as he stamped his sneaker on the two ants that stupidly ran right up to him. \"Mr. Smith is going to blame me if he finds a bunch of them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his shoe lifted away, one tiny ant was left behind, a tiny speck on the vast wood floor. Tommy didn't even consider that the tiny pathetic ant would survive his callous attempt to stomp them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens entered the kitchen, chatting. \"Where the hell did Andy go?\" Joe wondered. Andy's brother was coming to deliver a new television, and Andy obviously needed to be here to receive it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ass is always messing around. He probably wants us to deal with his brother.\" Tommy remarked as he walked around the kitchen island, unaware that each stomping footfall was endangering a shrunken Andy. Tommy had already forgotten about the two insignificant ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what'dya want to do, dude?\" Joe swatted at a buzzing fly as he pulled a chair and sat down, feeling bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the enormous sneaker slammed down, Bryan was more than certain he was dead. \"After all of my work... This is how I die.\" He barely finished that thought when a heavy creaking was heard, and light blinded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's booming voice was audible, his ringing ears unable to discern it. The familiar crashing footsteps were felt and heard, and he heard thrust himself upright when he heard Andy's screeching for a split second before being cut off. His head throbbed and his entire body was trembling as Bryan watched Tommy stomping away, every time the giant's left sneaker lifted, he could hear the faint cries before it slammed down again. The heavy stomps diminished as the two behemoths disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" The tiny man muttered gravely as he watched, awe struck. Andy was alive for now, precariously stuck in the dangerous tread of his best friend's sneaker. Bryan could hear the two thunderous voices echoing from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear, guilt, and hopelessness washed over the shrunken scientist as he stood there. He needed to do something!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He dashed away from the wall, determined to save the senseless teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his momentum, Mr. Smith gave Andy a rude shove that send the tiny teen careening toward the nearby base of the hallway wall.

He ran as fast as he could until a titanic sneaker smashed down only a few body lengths from his position on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"Missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized man ran again, but he saw no cover or hiding places in the barren corridor.

Once again, Tommy raised a foot and prepared to bring it down atop the bug before it could make good its escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he fled the long length of the corridor, the little man felt the darkness of a shadow building over him. He pushed himself harder, aiming for the line of light at the edge of the falling shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe dropped with a concussive blast of strength, barely missing the tiny form, which was propelled through the air to land crumpled on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man felt sick from the dizziness.

As much as he struggled, he didn't have time to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, stop!\" The shrunken scientist pleaded in vain. \"I am not a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bang put an end to the nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned. \"SO?

A thumb-sized roach was skittering an arms length up the wall, obviously frightened by the teenager's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A roach? Seriously?\" He thought aloud. \"Mr. Smith is going to blame me if he finds his house infested!\" Forgetting the smaller, less intrusive bug, Tommy swept the fleeing roach from the wall, grumbling with disgust when his hand came into contact with the filthy insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to be blamed for a possible infestation by his neighbor, especially a cockroach problem. The squirming creature landed on it's back with a light thud near his right foot, desperately struggling to regain it's footing and escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself up, the little man almost fell backwards as his head spun. Tiny Bryan felt major shell shock after having been almost stomped by a sneaker that rivaled any cruise ship he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get away... Andy...\" He thought, still trying to pull himself up, and squinting over where he shoved the reckless teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ROACH?\" Came Tommy's thunderous voice from above. His vision wavered as Bryan looked up, the enormous form of his helpful teen-aged neighbor looming directly above. The young titan was no longer glowering downwards, but now focused in a different direction. With an impressive motion, Tommy's massive arm swept a wiggling black shape from its perch high on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hard thump sounded as a building-sized creature landed a few dozen feet away. Unsteadily pulling himself upright, the tiny scientist gasped in surprise at the monstrous cockroach. Laying on it's back, and violently struggling to right itself, the horrendous creature hissed and thrashed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized his sudden fortune. Tommy was more interested in this threatening roach, which gave him a chance to flee. A quick glance upwards confirmed his hopes, seeing the disgusted expression on the gigantic youth's face. The little man burst into a sprint towards the nearby baseboard where the stunned Andy watched. A sizable crack was visible to Andy's left, a crack that looked large enough to shelter both their minuscule forms. He ran right past the scuffed rubber sole of Tommy's left sneaker, easily three stories in height alone to the bug-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earth shattering crash from behind caused Bryan to stumble just as he reached the baseboard, falling into Andy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, Mr. Smith! We need to get out of here!\" Andy stated the obvious, his voice cracking with fear. The almost unnoticeable crack in the decorative wood was a comfortable 6 feet tall, and many feet wide. Stuffing the terrified Andy in first, Bryan shuffled safely inside, and they both watched Tommy's huge sneaker lift, revealing the cockroaches smashed remains, partly stuck to the teen's shoe sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all unbelievable to Andy, who never thought he would be in the position of an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN, WHERE DID THE OTHER BUG GO?\" An annoyed Tommy roared from above. The massive footwear landed heavily as the giant teen shifted around, searching for the tiny \"bug\". Bryan held his breath despite himself when a gigantic sneaker landed with a crash just outside his refuge, Andy just gaped in awe from behind. He felt an inherent desire to try and gain Tommy's attention, but held himself, knowing all too well the likely outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing his foot down on the gross cockroach with a satisfying crunch, Tommy suddenly remembered the original insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Where did the other bug go?\" He frowned, shifting his large feet around in search of it. No sign of the smaller, more insignificant pest was to be seen as he gazed around the hall, unaware of the small opening in the moulding near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Tommy decided to...</span></div></div>",

He should of never invited his friends to Mr. Smith's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white delivery truck was parked in the driveway, one that Tommy recognized. Two guys exited, both in their twenties and clothed in dark blue slacks and work shirts with name tags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tommy, what's up?\" Dan greeted casually. His smile faded slightly as he looked around for his younger brother. \"Where is Andy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy skipped out, we can't find him.\" Joe stated with an air of annoyance. Tommy grunted in agreement, crossing his arms. \"I hope the TV is the same type.\" Tommy said looking over as Dan's co-worker opened the back of the truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan frowned now. \"I grabbed the closest thing we had. I need to talk to Andy first before I just drop it off.\" He glanced around again as if Andy would burst forth from one of the bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The asshole just up and left after helping to break the TV, I can't be responsible for buying a new one myself.\" Tommy almost pleaded. He couldn't believe that the one time Mr. Smith entrusted the care of his home to him that something like this would happen. He couldn't explain this blatant lack of responsibility to Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older guy sighed, and scratched his short hair thoughtfully. \"Alright, dude. Andy owes me big for this... Where do you want the TV?\" He followed Tommy inside, leaving Joe to inspect the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on, the tiny duo crept from their cramped hiding place. Bryan decided they needed to get somewhere other than the hall, and the living room was closest. He lef the frightened Andy, having to urge the kid on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had only barely entered the living room when huge footsteps began rattling the floor. Tommy entered with a strange giant dressed in dark slacks and scuffed work boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Bryan yelled a warning as Tommy's mammoth sneaker landed nearby. Andy dove out of the way just in time as the second sneaker landed thunderously, separating the two bug-sized men. Bryan pulled himself up quickly, becoming quite used to these close encounters. \"Andy! Where are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me! DAN!

As he talked to Dan, he had almost forgotten about the bug problem that had eluded him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, this TV is different than the one Andy told me about.\" Dan muttered, shifting his large boots around. \"This guy is gonna noticed it is different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed loudly, how could he explain this to Mr. Smith? A bug infestation, then this? He would never get another job from Mr. Smith again at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just bring it in...\" Tommy stated flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dan stepped away from the fallen TV, he lifted a boot over an unseen speck on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry about it - Me and Larry will haul it out for you. No problem... I'll let that smartass pay it back later\" He finished with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't hesitate throwing his errant friend under the bus and nodded thankfully in response. Andy's older sibling had always been a bit of douchebag, as well as a shady individual in the past. When Tommy was younger, he was afraid of him; taller and more aggressive than Andy - which is saying something. Dan had an entire arm coated in a tattoo of skulls and flames, so Tommy and his friends assumed Dan was some kind of criminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that aside, Tommy figured this act of awesome kindness abdicated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping towards the front door, Dan flashed a slight smirk. \"Plus, we can get some decent scrap value for it at the dump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was a gifted athlete at school. Partaking in both junior high basketball and the track team with decent results. Yet, for all his physical prowess, this test pushed his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dumb shit-for-brains! Dan!!!\" His normally confident voice cracked with strain and fear. \"Down here! Look fucking down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis older brother, nearly 5 years his senior, towered high and completely dominated his shrunken brother's entire vista. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT, THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE ANDY TOLD ME ABOUT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowing his pace dramatically, Andy reacted to the now deeper and explosive voice that belonged to his gigantic brother. His thunderous words seemed out of sync, slowed down to resemble the speech of a clumsy giant from some cartoon. Yet there was no mistake - this was his older brother and his only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy spouted another volley of frustrated pleas. His brother had been a menace his entire life; teasing and bullying him, never willing to admit out-loud that they had each other's backs. Deep down, Andy knew Dan cared for him. More than once, his big brother had beaten up kids that bullied Andy in school. Only after to declare that he was the only one allowed to beat the crap out of him - which he then demonstrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaaaaaaaaaan! Heelp meee you fucking idiot!\" Andy cried at his oblivious brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shuddered violently, sending Andy to his knees. He looked up to see Dan's humongous work boots shifting with monumentous result. They were beaten to hell: the black leather scuffed with mud and dirt. The toe of the right boot had worn away slightly, showing off a dull layer of steel. This mountain of worn leather raised suddenly, rotated and slammed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You giant prick! Fuck you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan merely continued his seemingly cosmic conversation, unfazed and unconcerned with the world at his feet. He never even glanced down. Andy stared at his colossal form, realizing just how humongous Dan had become. Only then did he finally began to feel something else towards his older - now mega-sized - brother. This feeling was fear. Not from his predicament or past encounters with his best friend, but now from the sheer size and oblivious power displayed by his impossibly gigantic brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was both terrified and incredulous. His brother was completely in another plane of existence; too fucking huge to care about something as small as Andy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he looked like he always did. Dressed in the dark blue uniform his work dictated: T-shirt embezzled with the company logo. Loose fitting, dark blue cargo slacks displayed a variety of tools stuffed into the various pockets; pens, a wrench, some papers, an open pack of cigarettes, and other paraphernalia he used on a daily basis. The slacks seemed to drape endlessly before ending with Dan's black work boots. He bought them a year ago, Andy remembered because the jackass had been leaving them in the hall outside his room more often that not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...THIS GUY IS GONNA NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming statement shook Andy from his paralyzed state; but too late. Dan finished with his inspection of the broken television and prepared to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting position, Dan's enormous work boots lifted and crashed down - one crunching a piece of the trashed TV. Then the nearest boot raised from the ground and soared over many hundreds of feet with ease to loom over Andy's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy pissed himself and began a scattered aria of screams. The tiny frightened teenager stood a mere speck in the shadow cast by the titanic boot, hopeless to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaaaaaaan! NOOO!!! IT'S MEEEE! YOUR BROTHER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cries were instantly lost against the hard, heavy-lugged sole. Andy had glimpsed it before, never caring much to take any notes. A boot is a boot, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it had taken on a completely different light. The sole was worn heavily, yet still retained enough tread to wedge pebbles and clumps of dirt. The yellow logo \"CAT\" was visible through huge deposits of crusted mud and paint, while the words \"OIL RESISTANT\" were almost completely covered by a dried gum wrapper. Blades of grass and the smeared remains of a mushroom were picked up from crossing Mr. Smith's front yard. All from a day's work for Dan, who would impatiently scrape the tread on the welcome mat when he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy just wailed. His teenaged mind had handled far beyond capacity, leaving him in a state of petrified shock. He only found enough to shout one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHYYYY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a mere second after Dan proceeded to step, he brought his boot down with a dull, hefty *boom* before continuing his tremendous passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo! Nooooooo! You have to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan fell over a minute cleft in the hardwood, hitting his chin painfully against the floor. He wasted not a moment. Andy had been shrunken by Bryan's own negligence, and he would be damned if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bryan had even righted himself, the humongous boot landed and rattled the surrounding area with slight vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minuscule scientist stared with an expression of utter horror at the behemoth work boot that belonged to Andy's older brother. It sat like a battleship of black leather, planted firmly where hysterical Andy had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... shit...\" Was all the shocked man could produce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Oh God, fucking no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boot lifted and slammed down as Dan shifted his tremendous form to face the broken TV. Bryan gazed up at him, trying to view his face. The titan complied, turning it slightly to reveal a bored, tired, and annoyed expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...NEED HELP GETTING THIS MESS OUT?\" The dangerously clueless guy thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust business as usual, Bryan thought incredulously. This oblivious behemoth just stomped his little brother from existence and he was none the wiser. Dan raised his thick arms over his head, brushing his short brown hair in the process. Vehicle sized globes of sweat were shaken into free-fall by the action, plummeting to the floor with dramatic splashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Tommy were so far removed from the teeny man's macro world. Andy merely shared the fate that many other minuscule lifeforms met on a daily basis. Even if Andy's giant brother had noticed his tiny attempts, they would have been perceived as nothing more than the skittering movements of some insignificant bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed hopeless, more so than ever, to contact these gargantuan titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan jolted when he heard Tommy respond, his teenaged voice slightly less impressive than the older brother's but powerful nonetheless. The tiny man failed to pick up more than a few words from their impressive speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feeling of disgust and pity seemed to eat away at his resolve. He shook his head and clenched his fists before shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get help!\" He *would* be rescued. Despite his guilt, Bryan refused to share Andy's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, if Bryan could be rescued, he could find tiny Andy alive! It wouldn't be the first time a step proved non-lethal. If not... Bryan would be forced to keep the secret in order to protect Dan from the knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the behemoth in question spoke once more. \"...NO PROBLEM.... I'LL LET THAT SMARTASS PAY IT BACK LATER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBug-sized Mr. Smith trembled at the words. He gazed up at the titanic worker, thinking right now he needed protection *from* Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any inkling of his actions or the irony of his words, Dan happened to spare a glance at the floor. His gaze was brief and failed to spot the tiny home owner. Bryan had no chance to take advantage of this rare look before the huge man followed Tommy out with heavy, lumbering steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan slunk to the ground. This had started as a nightmare for him: almost ending up stomped by his helpful neighbour and his careless friends. Now, an innocent teenager had joined his nightmare and more than likely gotten himself killed. Bryan felt traumatized. Why did this have to happen to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, he was safe for now. Andy's terrifying mega-sized brother had left, taking his huge boots with him, and Tommy and Joe would hopefully give him a chance to plan for rescue. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. Smith is gonna think I let them infest his house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his hair thoughtfully, Tommy debated what to do. He had planned to enjoy using his neighbour's home, inviting friends over, watching some television on his flat-screen, and ordering pizza. So far all his plans had resulted in disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe came sauntering in from the kitchen, hearing Tommy's distressed groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just spray some Raid around or something,\" Joe offered. \"It was only a couple bugs, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers tromped back into the kitchen. Joe idly opened the upper cabinets, obviously bored. Tommy hastily thrust open the cabinet doors under the sink. It held next to nothing, save for a couple bottles of air freshener and dish soap. Slamming the doors, he sighed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I gonna do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stifled a yawn, leaning against the kitchen island. He shrugged in response and glanced around the pristine kitchen. Mr. Smith's telephone was mounted against the wall, along with a board pinned with dozens of phone numbers. One of these numbers stood out to the annoyed teenager. He shifted over to it, squinting at the homeowners swooping writing. \"Dude! Right here, Mr. Whats-his-name has an exterminator's number here.\" Joe said, tapping the number in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's ears pricked up, almost stumbling over a stool as he approached Joe. \"Oh, shit! Thank God!\" He snatched the posted number from the wall. It was nothing short of gold in the teenager's hand: an answer to his unsaid prayers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice answered when Tommy dialed the number, offering the extermination company's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, yes, yes. I'm calling about an infestation of bugs here at my house.\" Tommy figured he should pretend ownership to the home, not wanting to explain his situation. It only then struck Tommy about paying for the service. As luck would have it, the secretary quelled his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan Smith? Yes, we have you scheduled for next week. The usual date.\" She continued.\"Do you need us to make an emergency visit? We just had a cancellation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feigning to be his neighbour, Tommy grinned at Joe with a knowing smile. \"There is a serious infestation brewing, please send somebody over immediately!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed, hung the phone up and slumped into a stool next to Joe. His worries melted away. Mr. Smith's home would be rid of pests before anything serious began, and at not cost or effort on Tommy's part. All the effort Tommy put into keeping Mr. Smith's home free of pests, Tommy felt quite satisfied. Shifting on his stool, Joe didn't share the satisfaction. He yawned and grumbled about being bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here before they get here, man. I don't think they'll buy you being your neighbour in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe wasn't wrong about that possibility. \"Yeah, let's go grab something to eat and check back in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grabbed their stuff and left the house, unlocked. Joe wondered aloud about Andy's whereabouts while Tommy glanced back at the house, unaware that both Andy and Mr. Smith remained inside.</span></div></div>",

His eyes still shone wide with fear, yet now that the immediate danger had passed, Bryan noted some of the teenager's cocky demeanor returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it best to calm the kid, Bryan prepared to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell were those two lug-heads thinking!\" Andy angrily interrupted. \"How could they not see it was me!\" Hitting his fist against the rough wall, he turned to Bryan with a scowl. \"Or, for that matter, <i>you</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan frowned at the hopelessly hot-headed youth. When they first met, he had explained the facts of shrunken life to Andy. Who had himself keenly declared Bryan Smith as a \"bug\" and spurred his giant friends on a wild witch-hunt to stomp him. He wanted nothing more than to feel sorry for the kid, but his chiding attitude made that difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...\" The weary scientist began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just fucking run out and expect them to see you. To them, you are nothing more than a tiny speck now - <i>like me</i>.\" Andy tensed at that, but remained silent as Bryan continued. \"If we want to get rescued, we need an intelligent plan. No running out or screaming like an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan returned the glare Andy was giving him. The only sound was Andy's teeth grinding together and Bryan's exhausted breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" He questioned with as little annoyance as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy grunted, crossed him arms, but relented. \"Dammit... Okay! You happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a curt nod, Bryan exited the safety of their hide-away, glanced both ways, and beckoned Andy to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego shifted his truck into gear and pulled the old vehicle to a stop. He had been heading over to another client's home when a call from the company's secretary stopped him. They had cancelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emergency visit, huh?\" Diego said as he stepped out and went to grab his tools. The secretary's call didn't give him much else to go on, not even what \"emergency\" he should expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween himself and the other guys he worked with, they all agreed that this client, Bryan Smith, was a bit... <i>odd</i>. Diego was always used to the homeowner being there to greet him and give him some basic info. Mr. Smith was never home whenever Diego, or his co-workers arrived. Except for one time, when Diego nearly knocked the guy over as he opened the kitchen door like he always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe apologized to the guy - but only received a meek response before the flustered man rushed past him and drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably just anti-social or something</i>, Diego figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCap covering his head, chemical tank on his back, Diego whistled as he strode towards the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shrunken males only just reached the towering portal that led into the kitchen. Crossing the hallway was nothing short of an Olympian feat - made all the more difficult by Andy's complaints and Bryan's exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then what? Once we catch up to them, what do we do then?\" Andy persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out, I am sure. With the two of us combined, we can't fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy opened his mouth, shut it with a frown, then opened it again. \"I don't even hear them. Shouldn't the ground be shaking or something from their clumsy feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to keep himself moving was already enough. Now to listen to this idle twaddle was proving too much. Bryan prepared to verbally tear the teenager's head off when the thought struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Bryan agreed with an air of caution. \"We should be hearing some sort of disturbance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, as if to reassure the two bug-sized men that they weren't alone, a thunderous knocking boomed from the kitchen. They transition from hardwood to kitchen tile, both alarmed and confused. The tremendous pounding repeated once again, this time followed with a loud barrage of noise. Both of them felt the previously still air change suddenly. Moments later, a gusting wall of wind blasted them with unforgiving force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the hell was that?\" Bryan squeaked. He had been blown backwards, weaker and more frail than Andy who had withstood the gale. \"Oh no, did they leave!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy didn't respond. He only stood there, seemingly frozen as he stared off into the distant vista of the kitchen. Afraid that the sound was Tommy and Joe leaving, Bryan joined him, gasping at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back door closed with a tumultuous boom, sending light vibrations through the tiled floor. Standing before it was a huge man in grey uniform, wearing a baseball cap that cast a foreboding shadow over his face. He stood like a looming monument, his dark form stark against the white door and walls and his large dusty boots planted firmly on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard Andy question the identity of the titan. His voice was scared once more, imploring for guidance but sounding muffled to the tiny man who only had eyes for the looming intruder. Gruffly snorting, the giant raised an impressive arm to his face and idly wiped the sleeve of his uniform against his nostrils. Such a mundane, impolite gesture took on an air of other worldly wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Mr. Smith, snap out of it! Who the hell is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know. This huge stranger wasn't anyone Bryan was acquainted with. For all he could surmise, this man was some kind of criminal. Bryan squinted at the distant, shaded face. The giant seemed to be idly scanning the room, his features were young; friendly even - yet strong and swarthy. His appearance sent a tingle through Bryan's body. Then it clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an exterminator!\" The memory of the brief encounter rushed back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!? Why the hell is he here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the obvious had not yet dawned, the huge man interjected and dispensed all doubts by rolling his thick shoulders to set down a hefty metal tank on the floor. It collided against the tiles with a dull crash, sending another quake to rattle the shrunken onlookers. Standing out against the chrome tank was a sticker. Red with a yellow font, \"TOXIC CHEMICALS\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young titan crouched his mountainous bulk over the tremendous container, gripping a shiny turnstile with large gloved hands and turning it many times. He then produced a long, snaking tube that ended with a nozzle and connected it to the side of the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gonna freaking spray us like bugs! We need to stop him! He has to see us!\" Andy screamed and began running towards the colossal tradesman without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan grabbed at the sprinting teenager, trying to halt his hysterical flight. \"No, you damned fool! WAIT!\" Just like before he chased after Andy. The athletic teen well out-paced the tired scientist in both height and stamina. Grout in between each tile proved sizable - with collections of dirt and chalky grit. Andy left Bryan tripping over a muddy piece of grass tracked in only hours before from his own shoes. He ignored the older man's pleas and sprinted onto the next stretch of tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the humongous exterminator rose back to his full height. His gaze idly swept the tile floor before him. Neither Bryan, Andy, or their minuscule chase stood out to the colossal man, whose only thought was his task.</span></div></div>",

That determination had led to the attempt at moving the television, which had resulted in the accident that left the expensive, state-of-the-art set less than worthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing every loud sound and sudden vibration, his body showing the visible evidence of his ordeal, muscles tired and aching, the shrunken man cowered in the dark space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he didn't want Tommy on the hook for the damaged set, that wasn't at the top of the tiny man's priorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he needed Tommy's help in order to regain his normal size.With each new hurdle, the tiny scientist began to realize that his hope of ever escaping his shrunken nightmare continued to recede farther and farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that Tommy would play a fateful role in his immediate future, he decided he should make one more attempt to contact his enormous teenaged neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his unruly and deplorably irresponsible friends, the miniaturized scientist retained his faith in Tommy, the neighborhood teen who had performed odd jobs for him for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfortunate scientist's own arrogance and some simple twists of fate had made Tommy the most important person in this bizarre drama. Unfortunately, the teenager was blissfully unaware of the struggles of his tiny neighbor and the part he had, so far, played indirectly in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlucky scientist had given Tommy a simple job, which was to mail a package for him. What Tommy hadn't known was that the plan called for Mr. Smith, a brilliant research scientist, to mail himself to his nephew at college in California.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he regretted his actions, as much as he now wished he had done things differently, the shrunken man could not go back and choose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scheme had gone terribly wrong, of course, and now he huddled in terror in his own home, terrified and humiliated at every turn by four teenaged titans who, at every turn, seemed out to destroy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his earlier attempts at contacting Tommy had ended in failure, the tiny man could not simply give up. Even as his attempts became more desperate and more dangerous, he kept railing against fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, there had been no quakes caused by the footsteps of titans. He had not heard any loud, thunderous voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, and resolved to try again, the tiny man breathed a sigh of relief and walked toward the light. He exited the dark space beneath the TV stand and tried to scan the living room, which looked bigger and stranger than some alien fantasy city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fastened on a titanic form. \"Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man scurried over the floorboards, racing toward the building-sized recliner on the other side of the living room. His enormous teenaged neighbor's impressive body was sprawled in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to run, screaming out Tommy's name from time to time, only for the colossal surroundings to swallow up his feeble voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other titans had disappeared. He knew they were probably somewhere in the house, and they could return at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to reach Tommy,\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis path across the floor was unimpeded this time until he saw the huge obstacle that loomed from the flat floorboards. As he drew closer, he recognized the object as one of Tommy's sneakers. Several yards away rested its equally huge mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had taken off his shoes to relax in Mr. Smith's comfortable recliner. His friends had gotten on his nerves, and now he just wanted to take it easy and try to think of some sort of excuse he could offer to Mr. Smith about everything that had gone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man stared in mesmerized astonishment at the size of Tommy's discarded footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, his goal was the teenager, not his sneakers. Besides, as he got closer, he also smelled the intense odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! His feet reek!\" The tiny man exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetouring around the sneaker, the bug-sized man ran toward the recliner. Tommy's socked feet were on the floor. He kept running, closing the gap, until he was standing right next to the titanic teen's cotton-covered toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The tiny man screamed as loudly as he could. \"Please! Just look for me! Down here, at your feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply could not attract the giant's attention that way. What could he do?</span></div></div>",

When he gazed upward, he could see nothing but the sole of the worn sock, which looked quite dingy from repeated and frequent wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" The shrunken man shouted as loudly as his miniature stature permitted. \"It's me! Down here, at your foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that failed to stir any response at all from the giant, the unfortunate scientist proceeded reluctantly to Plan B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to climb his foot,\" he said aloud. \"Climb higher, and hope I can get him to notice me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to hope the giant would notice and recognize him as well. So far, every time he had attracted attention, the giants had quickly misidentified him as a bug, with almost lethal consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he grabbed fistfuls of the cotton sock in his tiny hands, the little man pulled himself up. After an exhausting climb, he reached the teenager's ankle. At that point, it dawned on him what a monumental task he had chosen for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tommy rested in the recliner in Mr. Smith's living room, his three friends had stepped outside to await the delivery of a television that they hoped they could switch for the one they had accidentally broken when moving things around in their pursuit of a \"bug\" that had taken refuge beneath Mr. Smith's entertainment center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a van pulled into Mr. Smith's driveway and two guys in their twenties stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone order a TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy greeted his older brother. \"About time you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan flashed his kid brother a grin. \"Where do you want it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and his partner, Larry, struggled with the television, wrestling it out of the van and carrying it inside the house while Andy held open the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the shrunken scientist had climbed to the top of Tommy's sock, and now reached a wall of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the bare skin of Tommy's massive shin. The flesh was hard and warm to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy clinging to the wiry leg hairs, he was able to continue his upward climb. He began to feel like he might have made a wise decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Tommy felt an itch and was about to scratch it when his friends burst back into the house with two other guys hauling a huge television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got it,\" Andy announced to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stood, looking in dismay. \"That doesn't look anything like Mr. Smith's TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he detected movement, the tiny man tried to wrap his hands around one of the giant's thick leg hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to hang on,\" he cried out loud. He knew that if he fell now, he would be completely exposed on the floor with multiple giants stomping around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he gripped at the rope-like leg hair, he felt his grasp slipping.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To his dismay, there wasn't even enough space between the floor and the bottom of the door, which was farther sealed by a wide plastic strip to insulate the home and keep out unwanted pests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to get back inside through the front door unless Tommy returned for him. Dejected, he realized that his huge teenaged neighbor didn't even have a clue about the terrible predicament his careless actions had left the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man scanned the gigantic surroundings of his own front step and the lawn, which stretched forth like miles of untamed jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder, he realized the jungle probably came with an assortment of predatory insects, all ready to make a meal of a tiny human who had unwittingly dropped far, far down the food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to wait here for Tommy,\" he said aloud. \"If Tommy comes, I can get back inside the house and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off. The tiny man had no more ideas. He had tried in vain to contact Tommy, but he was too damn small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long. The door opened unexpectedly, disgorging two of the titans from inside Mr. Smith's living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the giants was the one speck-sized Mr. Smith hoped to see. By the time he overcame his shock, he also missed his opportunity. The giants closed the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Andy stood on the porch step, oblivious to anything tiny and insignificant at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your buddy Tommy sure is uptight,\" Dan remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy laughed. \"Well, he's not usually like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan grunted and struck a match, lighting up his cigarette. He waved the match, dousing the flame, and dropped the still smoking stick onto the concrete surface beneath his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the house, Joe tried to convince Tommy that everything would work out. \"It may not be the same TV, but it's a good one.\" Joe said. \"Mr. Smith will understand. Accidents happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure Mr. Smith knows all about accidents,\" Tommy muttered. \"Well, at least I didn't let Andy's stupid brother smoke inside Mr. Smith's house. He would really hate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith screamed and dodged as the smoldering match fell from the sky, missing him by mere inches. The discarded match was so close to his puny body that the acrid smoke choked him and caused his eyes to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled blindly, trying to get away from the noxious smoke released by the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, the two giants talked, oblivious to the discomfort their casual actions had inflicted on the tiny, unnoticed homeowner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan puffed on the cigarette, and reminded his brother that, because he had delivered the television as promised, he owed him a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, man,\" Andy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's house is pretty sweet,\" Dan said. \"So, what's the deal? Your buddy Tommy house-sitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cigarette burned steadily, and from time to time, Dan tapped away ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis latest disposal of the ash poured down a fiery storm of ash on the tiny man, who had dared to gaze skyward for a look at the faces of the two mighty gods. Instead of making another desperate attempt to get noticed, he was forced to flee the vicinity of the scorching ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinded, the tiny man panted, trying to come up with his next move. Then, that too, was snatched away from him. His fate came down to a casual action on the part of an unknowing and uncaring titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cigarette spent, Dan dropped it onto the porch step. Once again, a smoldering object fell from the sky, almost landing on top of the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the match had smelled bad, the smoldering cigarette butt was even worse. The smoke wafted around the tiny man, who staggered to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you around, bro,\" Dan said, raising his scuffed boot to finish off the discarded cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought the boot down squarely on top of the smoldering butt, while at the same time trapping the shrunken scientist in the oncoming shadow. There wasn't time for any reaction as the giant moved the sole of his boot on the rough concrete, grinding the cigarette and the tiny man into the unyielding surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened as he lifted his boot. Tommy ushered his other friends out of Mr. Smith's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whiff of cigarette smoke lingering in the air made him feel right at least about one decision he had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith would surely be glad that Tommy had demanded that Dan take his smoking habit outside to the front step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan desperately clawed the sand, trying to climb out of the deadly sand pit, his tiny fingers sinking fruitlessly into the sand causing him to slide downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting out the dry sand, Bryan suddenly noticed a huge shadow loom overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the insignificant bug trying to escape the clever ant lion's trap, Tommy frowned slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant lion had ceased pulling the little bug to its doom, and refused to show itself. \"Must of decided to wait for better prey than this tiny ant\" Thought the disappointed teen, unaware that his own casual actions caused such violent seismic activity as to frighten the fearsome ant lion into hiding. Despite himself, Tommy felt a pang of pity for the incredibly small insect that was valiantly struggling to escape the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go little guy\" He said shoving his large index finger behind the ant, pushing it roughly back onto flat ground and burying the ant lion's pit accidentally. The tiny pale ant seemed to wiggle around, as if trying to tell him something, which of course Tommy thought was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you go into the house now, or I will have to deal with you personally!\" He joked, almost to himself. Rising back up to his full stature, the young man decided to take a short walk, having become bored with the insignificant bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERE YOU GO LITTLE GUY.\" Roared Tommy's explosive voice from above. The shrunken man screamed in terror as a street-sized digit crashed into him from behind, throwing him forward with intense force. Bryan struggled to stand up, brushing off sand he felt numerous scratches and bruises caused by the gigantic Tommy's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the dry sand causing his little eyes to hurt, he noticed the huge teenager's expression still showed no recognition, only a bemused look of pity. \"Tommy! Look closer, please! Why can't you just see!?\" Bryan squealed as he excitedly jumped and waved his arms. Tommy's face showed no signs of change, and the tiny man watched as the huge lips moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU GO INTO THE HOUSE, OR I WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU PERSONALLY!\" Came the thunderous, booming voice. The bug-sized scientist covered his ears, glaring up at the frustratingly oblivious Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it, Tommy was kneeling down, looking right at him, yet he still didn't realize he was anything other than a little ant. Bryan's heart sank, feeling once again his hopeless situation. A loud rumble caught his attention as the impossibly huge Tommy rose from his crouched position, his massive sneakers crunching the sandy ground as the shifted. The tiny genius craned his head back, his eyes watering from the dry sand and his own emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The tiny man cried as Tommy's massive sneaker landed with an explosive thud right next to him, missing his little form by only a few meters. Tommy wasn't even looking where he stepped, having almost forgotten the rather boring ant at his feet. The titanic sneaker lifted off the ground, leaving a noticeable tread impression that easily spanned many football fields in its wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little speck of a man watched as his oblivious saviour stomped away to resume his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That possibility conjured forth images of being blotted out by a huge paper towel or washed down the drain of a lake-sized sink basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't have been quite so fearful if he could have known with certainty whose foot he was trapped beneath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighed in relief when he was finally able to lock Mr. Smith's door after driving his friends from his neighbor's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the key that Mr. Smith had entrusted to him, he walked out the back door and exited past Mr. Smith's carport. He walked past a garden hose hooked to a spigot in an exterior wall. He knew all about the hose because washing Mr. Smith's car was one of the many chores that Mr. Smith paid him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he stopped and picked up the hose, intending to wash off the bottom of his sneakers. He had stepped into a muddy puddle on his way over to Mr. Smith's, and figured he should spray off the mud before he went home or else he would never hear the end of it from his mother if he tracked mud and dirt into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropped on one arm against the wall and holding the hose with his free hand, Tommy lifted his right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking quite the pounding with each step taken by his titanic teenaged neighbor, tiny Mr. Smith was relieved when everything turned topsy-turvy. From his position stuck deep in mud squished into the tread of Tommy's sneaker, the bug-sized man locked his gaze on Tommy's enormous face. The teenager was looking right at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to free an arm from the mud, the speck of a man managed to feebly wave one arms as he screamed for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of a waterfall drowned out his feeble cries. When Tommy looked down, he saw only the mud packed into the tread of his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torrent of water from the hose blasted into the crevice, accomplishing the shrunken scientist's wish to be free. Unfortunately, now swept into a river of onrushing water, the tiny man was carried to the asphalt driveway. The water followed the path of least resistance, carrying the flailing tiny man to the edge of the curb and toward a enormous drainage culvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy finished cleaning his sneakers, he turned off the water and watched a thin stream of water flow across the pavement toward the drain build into the curb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flood whisked the tiny man away from Tommy and his representation of salvation and carried him toward his doom. As the water spilled tumbled into the drain, the unfortunate little man dropped into a river that carried him through a subterranean system of tunnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled valiantly, but eventually he grew too weak to resist.

He stopped to rest in the meager shade offered by a colossal bottle with its label peeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle looked bigger than a building to the bug-sized man.

As the alarmed little man stared at the intruders, he realized each of them looked even more enormous, more powerful, more muscular than Tommy and any of his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't realize he was looking at three members of the high school football team, including their star quarterback, Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wore jeans, sports jerseys and stylish sneakers.

His body looked more like a lumbering mountain to the bug-sized scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man listened in terror at the way their huge shoes squished in the mud. He saw they carried empty glass jars and one of them held a long-handled mesh net. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giants continued to stomp through the woods, but they complained non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is freakin' boring,\" Justin said. \"Making us collect a bunch of puny bugs for extra credit.

If we flunk his class, it's goodbye to the football team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the third titan said. \"So, shut up and look for bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith heard their conversation and realized with increasing horror that, far from being oblivious to him, these three monstrous jocks were actually looking for tiny \"bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified by their swift advance, the tiny man faced two possible options.

Why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself addressed directly by the awe-inspiring giant, Mr. Smith stammered. \"There...there was a mix-up,\" he managed in a wavering voice. \"Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he saying?\" Biff asked. \"Make him speak up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who had detected more of the words than he wanted to let on, scowled. \"Forget it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked the helpless little man from the net and dropped him into an empty jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you two keep your mouths shut?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Justin, but...\" Blake began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No discussion,\" Justin said. \"Let's just keep the bug-man our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff grinned, catching on. \"Right!\" Biff exclaimed. \"Finders-keepers, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Sometimes, Biff and Blake could be total morons. \"Yeah, something like that, Biff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the jar, after recovering from being so callously dropped from a bone-jarring height, Mr. Smith shouted protests at the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Blake. You got those lids with the punched-out airholes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake produced one from his pocket. Justin took it and with a look of malevolent satisfaction, screwed the lid onto the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you guys drop off the rest of the bugs to Mr. Mendez?\" Justin suggested. \"This little guy can go home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff looked disappointed. \"Can we come over and play with him later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the jar to his face, and to his embarrassment, tiny Mr. Smith took a couple of steps back from Justin's enormous face despite the fact a half-inch thick layer of glass separated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home, little man!\" Justin gloated. He felt himself at full mast in his pants, and didn't want his buddies to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and off the field, Biff and Blake followed his commands.

Dared he hope?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, he saw Tommy's huge form, which looked distorted by the thick glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" The shrunken scientist exclaimed. He ran across the floor of the jar toward the curved wall closest to his titanic neighbor. \"Tommy! Save me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy groaned silently. He'd always resented the way Justin and his buddies felt they ran the school just because they knew how to toss a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ran into me,\" Tommy said. \"What's so interesting in that jar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin glared as he placed the jar behind his back. \"That's my business,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugged. \"Like I really give a fuck,\" he retorted as he turned to walk across the school parking lot. He had meant to take the short cut through the wooded lot to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no wheels?\" Justin said in a gloating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the jar, the little man went nuts as he watched his only possibility at salvation ready to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please. You can't leave me with him!\" The little man screamed. \"Tommy! Help me! TOMMY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite me,\" Tommy called over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his friends to back him up, Justin didn't feel like accelerating the confrontation. Besides, he wanted to get home and \"play\" with his tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man, his hopes dashed so cruelly, watched his next-door neighbor walk away. Justin, chuckling loudly enough for the little man to hear, opened the door of his car. He lowered the jar into a cup-holder, then climbed into his car for the drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, he fantasized about Tommy Duncan being shrunk down to the size of the little bug-man.

Several times, he took his eyes off the road to glance into the jar placed securely in the plastic cup-holder between the seats of the car. The puny man inside the jar was sent sliding every time the car rounded a curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin grinned at the blatant evidence of the tiny man's utter helplessness. A glance at the trapped little guy also fueled his erection, giving him a palpable surge of arrogance and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pulled his car into the garage, he didn't note any other family vehicles. As his hand encircled the jar, he announced, \"Looks like I have you all to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man might have responded, but Justin didn't trouble himself to make any sense of the shrill squeaks that did escape the confines of the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through the rooms of his home, the jock made a bee-line for his bedroom, locking the door behind him. He plunked himself on the ruffled, unmade covers of his bed and placed the jar on his flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stillness of his room, Justin stared at the little man. Some of the little creatures words now registered, especially the often-repeated \"help me\" and \"let me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea,\" he said aloud in response to another plea from the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the jar in one hand, he tilted the glass container and let the tiny occupant fall onto his open hand that could palm a basketball or grasp a football. Needless to say, the shrunken man looked like a pitiful bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his cue, the little man tried again to communicate with the giant teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few words, however, his plea got interrupted by the giant, whose fascinated grin had darkened into a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not interested in your fuckin' problems,\" he said. \"I don't care how you ended up as little as a bug.

The jock reached down and adjusted himself, giving the pathetic bug of a man a show of his huge bulge beneath his tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Justin peeled off his socks.

Or I'll squish you under it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man cried tears in frustration, but was compelled to move closer. He opened his mouth and ran his tongue across the wide expanse of skin, pressed himself against the rough ridge of the toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Justin moaned. He had been curious, and now felt pleased that he could feel his tiny slave's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick them all,\" he ordered, and waited for the powerless little bug to move to the next toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of salt and sweat soaked into the little man's tongue as he began his new life as the obedient slave of this ruthless jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his humiliation, however, he was betrayed by his own body and desires. Serving his giant god sprang the bug-sized man's tiny cock to life. As he serviced Justin's huge toes, he felt his own aching hard-on begging for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it became too much, he paused and began to pull on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck you think you're doing?\" Justin growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand froze around his tiny cock. \"Nothing!\" The tiny man squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do nothing without my permission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man cowered in fear. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what?\" Justin bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared out of his wits, the tiny man screamed, \"Yes, master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin smiled, satisfied by how obedient and amusing the little slave was becoming.</span></div></div>",

None of them had ever considered the perspective of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, surrounded by three mighty titans, the shrunken scientist found himself paralyzed in place, petrified of making a movement that would slam destruction down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already attempted to connect with Tommy, and his effort returned by an ego-crushing sneer of disgust, the bug-sized man stared at the colossal footwear covering the feet of the titans.

He couldn't locate the eyes which were no doubt focused elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it he bumped into Tommy's bottom lip and the current sent him rolling head over heels into Tommy's mouth.

A tickle on his tongue alerts his subconscious and he feels something is missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze falls to the table of food in front of him. It's not a real game until he's munching on wings, chips, and pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs an empty paper plate and pours some ranch dip onto it. Tommy doesn't know it, but his body is already preparing for the food as he begins to salivate alot more. After picking his favorite chips and wings, he opens the pizza box nearest him so that when he is ready a slice is within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Smith stumbles across Tommy's undulating tongue he struggles to come up with a plan. He is trapped in his teenage neighbor's mouth. unnoticed with no method of contact. His odds aren't good. However Mr. Smith knows he is damn smart and his analytical mind whirls for a solution, refusing to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he works toward the front of the mouth he doesn't notice the increasing saliva beginning to flood from underneath the tongue. When it washes across the surface its sudden presence on Mr. Smith's feet makes him jump in surprise. As Mr. Smith stares at his feet a rumbling sounds from behind him. He spins around to find the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the low light he can see the tongue stretching towards the throat before sinking down into darkness. His long uvula sways over the abyss, the wall behind it glistening with saliva. The rumbuling, he realizes, was Tommy's stomach. Most likely unheard by the titan, his mind concludes that it signals something very bad is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh no...\" he says slowly as he turns towards the front of the mouth, the realization of what was coming rooting him to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's eyes dart between his plate and the screen. He snatches the largest chip and plows it through the dip. With his eyes glued to the screen he brings the chip to his mouth. Without realizing it Tommy stretches his tongue out to catch any falling drops of dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip lands on the tongue and his tongue pulls back, his lips closing around the food. The loud crunching of his food in his ears blends with the sounds of the game but Tommy doesn\u2019t mind.  He glances down, dips another chip, and brings it to his lips. It hovers there as he stares at the game and finishes chewing. He swallows but his team steals the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Tommy cheers. With his mouth wide open, light floods the interior showing the remains of chewed chip and dip smeared across the back of his tongue but no one is looking. The chip flies into the mouth and again his lips close around the latest catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith falls to the tongue as the whole thing moves out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d he shouts but none of the giants are looking at Tommy. Deep down he knows even if they did look they wouldn\u2019t see the tiny man stuck to their friend\u2019s outstretched tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screams in terror as the massive chip loaded with dip flies towards him. It flies right over his head and as it lands further back on the tongue he feels his world retract back into Tommy\u2019s mouth. Mr. Smith wails in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips shut him in near total darkness. Without even a second of peace Tommy crushes the chip against the roof of his mouth and forces the pieces between his powerful molars. Mr. Smith screams in agony as the loud crunching deafens him. He tries to lay as flat as he feels the tongue shifting under him, pushing the food around to be chewed. Since he was fairly near to the front he isn\u2019t swept into the mess, though bits of food shower him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sounds diminish into a more squishy noise Mr. Smith uncovers his ears and turns around. In the vague light he can make out the pile of chewed food disappearing down the slope in the back of Tommy\u2019s mouth. The back of the tongue rises and with a gulp Mr. Smith knows the food has moved on. He shudders knowing very well he could meet the same fate if he can\u2019t find a way out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips part and a sound erupts from Tommy\u2019s throat. Mr. Smith again covers his damaged ears as tiny bits of food and spittle fly at him and out the mouth. In the light he can see more clearly the soggy pile of chewed chips that stick to the center of the tongue, as well as the bits trapped in Tommy\u2019s sharp molars. The display is disgusting, and is made worse when Mr. Smith looks at himself and sees he\u2019s also covered in the chip slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is so disgusted by himself his vision gets darker\u2026 Until he realizes, looking up, that it\u2019s actually another chip entering. Mr. Smith, near the tip of the tongue, feels himself rise as Tommy shuts his lips and starts moving the chip to be crushed. He screams as he is practically hurtled towards the molars as Tommy starts to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels himself being pushed repeatedly against the side of a lower molar, the deafening crunches just above his head as he rolls with the movement trying to stay as far from surface of the teeth as possible. After a bit he feels a longer movement and guesses he has joined a glob of soggy chip to another part of the mouth. He hears a splat as the food is crushed and finds himself flying away from it landing on the tongue with a roll. The chaos has left him confused and he stays where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything stops he hears an indescribable noise and can sense something large rolling right by him. The tongue shifts and he hears a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith can\u2019t help but let out a sigh of release. As Tommy groans, sending a gale ripping out of his throat, the light from the open mouth shows Mr. Smith he is now near the back of the mouth, sitting next to a round pile of chewed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, what can I do?\u201d he laments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue underneath him moves forward, flowing out of Tommy\u2019s mouth like a snake. The bits of chewed food glint in the light and Mr. Smith is simply amazed that the friendly boy he knows is so oblivious to the destruction he is causing literally right under his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ball of meat smothered in ranch is now flying towards the teenager\u2019s mouth and his unnoticed passenger. Mr. Smith stares at it, unsure how to react. He feels himself giving up; he is no match for the giant boy\u2019s appetite. Sooner or later he will join a bite down the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and his friends intently follow the man with the ball, as though their concentration would improve his ability to score. Tommy groans unhappily when a shot is swatted away from the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at his plate and chooses a large BBQ wing. Tommy, being the fan of ranch that he is, drags it through the lake of white sauce.  Having already swallowed the last chip is tongue rolls out of his mouth before the wing is very close. Strands of saliva mixed with ranch stretch from the upper molars to the extended tongue. Chunks of chewed chips are jammed into his molars and are scattered across his wide tongue, more dense in the back. Joe glances at Tommy to say something and sees this display. But it is nothing to him and as Tommy\u2019s tongue disappears into his mouth with the wing, he has already forgotten the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, we should\u2019ve bet Justin! The Pistons are winning! Man\u2026 I would\u2019ve loved to have taken the money from the jackass\u2026 \u201cJoe trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned to him still chewing \u201cLyg ee woodve payed oo!\u201d he says through a full mouth, bits of wing flying out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d says Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sighs and holds his finger up, signaling Joe to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focuses on chewing the large bite faster and struggles to move it to the back of his mouth. Earlier than he should have he forces it down into his throat and gulps.  As it is sinking into his esophagus Tommy turns to Joe and says \u201cLike he would\u2019ve paid y\u2014\u201c before he says 'you' he starts coughing violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts his hand to his neck and thinks in chewing so fast he must've not noticed a bone in his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy comes up behind him and smacks him in the back \u201cAren\u2019t these supposed to be boneless??\u201d he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith didn\u2019t turn away from the bits of meat pelting him. He swayed with the movement of the tongue underneath him, and didn\u2019t try to scoot away from the growing pile of food beside him. Eventually the ball of food shifted and slammed into him, the saliva and meat adhering his side to it firmly. Knowing this was his inevitable fate he did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy finished chewing he seemed to try to speak, before the pace of the teeth quickened. This change of events vaguely intrigued Mr. Smith, but mostly the tiny man was waiting for the end.  The ball of chewed wing, bits of chip, and Mr. Smith are pushed down the slope of Tommy\u2019s tongue. The boy speaks over the descending food. Mr. Smith\u2019s free arm and leg brush the side of the throat as he descends which gets the entire cavern shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turn of events shakes the tiny man out of his stupor. Glancing around he feels hope rise in his chest.</span></div></div>",

As he takes a swig Steve stares at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hope that wasn't a bone!\" he warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugs. \"Whatever, its gone now,\" he replies. The four boys then return their attention to the game as it returns from a commercial break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was technically right. It wasn't a bone in the sense the boys would have thought. Mr. Smith,being the culprit of Tommy's choking fit did have a skeleton, no matter how small. Tommy on the other hand was completely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bite of food wasn't gone. It was passing through his chest, down the esophagus on its way to his stomach. And more importantly Mr. Smith was there, riding the bite down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt completely crushed. He had let his hopes up, only to be violently swallowed anyway. He was slightly mystified by how much effort Tommy had put into sending him and the food down his throat. He had watched as the light of freedom shining from the front of the mouth was cut off and the pressure had forced him into the ball of food. Then the entire thing sank deep into the pit of Tommy's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concentration is shattered as he yelps when the food slips into the stomach, landing with a splat on the chewed chips Mr. Smith had seen only a minute before. He couldn't believe the situation he was in. Unceremoniously gulped down by his teenage neighbor, no different from a buffalo wing or potato chip. Soda rains down onto him and he feels himself snap. He is done. His situation is hopeless and he is tired. He cannot even muster the energy to be angry. He simply accepts that this end was directly his fault, and unfortunately most likely no one will ever figure out what happened to him. He leans back and stretches out, trying to get comfortable to use his last moments in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy continues to eat, the fading pain in his throat is his only reminder of choking. He doesn't worry about what had gone wrong because like he said the food is gone. And to him it might as well have ceased to exist. After he thoughtlessly swallows, the food makes its way unnoticed through his chest, landing on top of the forming mountain of food. When Tommy scratches his belly he doesn't realize less than an inch from his fingers lies the food that is \"gone\" as well as an unnoticed passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith is soon buried by the snacks that Tommy continues to devour and passes out from a lack of oxygen before digestion can kick in. After their team won, Tommy had his friends help clean up before they left. Ready to go, he took one last glance around the room, satisfied it was clean enough that Mr. Smith would be happy when he returned. As he shuts and locks the door his stomach starts pumping out acid and churning the soggy food sitting inside of it. This causes a gurgle to sound through his belly. Tommy unconsciously puts his hand against his stomach and pats it. He doesn't give a thought to his hour-gone meal. All he can think is how he is going to use the money Mr. Smith gave him to bet on the Pistons in their next game.</span></div></div>",

Instead it lands out of Mr. Smith's sight, though he does feel its jarring impact, coupled with a wet squish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting off a wave of nausea, Mr. Smith finds himself in sudden darkness. An automatic look upwards reveals Tommy has leaned in closer. His blue eyes look like ponds as they dart over the chunk of food. He exhales lightly out of his nostrils that hover over the scene, buffeting the tiny man with his breath. However Mr. Smith is unconcerned with this, continuing to wave his arm desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Tommy\u2019s eye seems to snap onto him. His pupil widens, and Mr. Smith cheers having finally been discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy\u2019s voice abruptly thunders past him, temporarily deafening the minuscule scientist. He hadn\u2019t heard the whole sentence, but one word repeated in his head: bug. He had been mistaken for an insignificant pest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance upwards reveals Tommy turned away, seemingly coughing once more. Instead the titanic teen named Steve is approaching. Mr. Smith waves his arm again, more weakly than before. The impossibly tall young man reaches down, his thick fingers the size of airplane cabins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mr. Smith tries to scream, but with his ears still ringing, he has no clue if he actually made a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to be easily grossed out, Steve pinches the chunk of soggy food between his fingers and retreats to the kitchen to toss it out. He pauses in the doorway, scanning for the trash can. Assuming it\u2019s under the kitchen sink, he approaches the cabinet, and discovers he is correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he pitches the food into the trash, Steve pauses and brings it closer to his face. It only takes him a second to locate the squirming pest. Snickering at its pathetic struggles, Steve gets an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezes the bug free from the food and holds it trapped between his fingers. Tommy had already suffered from it, but Steve just couldn't pass up the opportunity! It only takes him a second to decide to use the insect to prank...</span></div></div>",

But now that he's seen it, he can't help but think it's a tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends see him get closer to his food with a look of utter shock on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude\" Andy laughs \"It wasn't going to kill you, quit being so dramatic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy ignores him, \"Look at this\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Joe asks, his curiosity piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look!\" he insists, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's eyes lock onto the tip of Tommy's finger and at first he sees nothing. But as his eyes focus he sees a strange looking bug... that kinda resembles a tiny person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\" is all Joe can get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy jumps up and walks over, \"What's so interesting guys?\" as he pushes in front of Tommy to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" he cries out jumping back as if it might get him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy leans forward and carefully scoops the chunk of food with the tiny man on it onto his finger. He brings it to his eye and tries to make out more detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny person is waving frantically and as Tommy stares, it starts to look very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith?\" he gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!! TOMMY YES!!!\" Mr. Smith screams in elation as the giant boy utters his name. He is still waving, never having faltered even when the massive finger tip seemed about to crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU HAVE TO HELP ME GET BACK TO NORMAL!!!\" he wails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith is that you?\u201d Tommy says in wonder. Suddenly realizing the tiny man\u2019s voice probably didn\u2019t carry he held his finger to his ear and motioned for someone to turn of the TV. Joe scrambled for the remote and with a click the room went silent save for the teenager\u2019s heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that your neighbor?\u201d asked Steve from behind Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhh!\u201d Tommy shushed him and listened carefully. He could hear the tiny man screaming that he needed help, but he couldn\u2019t make it out very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u201d Joe murmured, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me!\u201d exclaimed Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll help you but I can\u2019t understand you!\u201d Tommy said to his finger. \u201cSomebody find a microphone\u201d Tommy ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looks up and seems the Karaoke Machine Mr. Smith received from his sister (Zack\u2019s mother) a few Christmas\u2019 ago. He rarely used it, but had kept it because of the nice gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Steve says simply as picks up the microphone and switches the thing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy walks over and places his finger near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I can\u2019t believe its finally over\u2019 Mr. Smith thinks to himself. He feels more joy than ever before as the giant teenagers work to communicate with him. He already had a promise of aid, now they just needed the details to do it. He looks at the mesh of the microphone, takes a deep breath and starts yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you get me out of this?!\u201d he bellows into the massive microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSURE\u201d rumbles from above and Tommy\u2019s other hand flies at him and Mr. Smith struggles to stifle a cry of fear. He is surprisingly gently pushed out of the food which Tommy unceremoniously shoves off his finger. For a moment Mr. Smith gets ready to reprimand the young man, but then remembers that this boy s his savior and more importantly he wants to waste no time in returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 we need to go to my lab\u2026\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s voice is weak but clear over the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy nods, remembering the office building near the airport where Mr. Smith worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI participated in an experiment and it went wrong,\u201d continued Mr. Smith. He had decided it best to leave out that this was intentional. \u201cThe solution\u2026 the antidote is at my lab. When we get there this can all be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then he\u2019ll owe us, right?\u201d chimes in Andy, the initial shock of the situation fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Tommy growls in response. \u201cHe won\u2019t owe us anything, I almost ate him!\u201d The sentence registers in Tommy\u2019s head. He had nearly eaten his neighbor without knowing it. Just 5 minutes ago he was watching a game, chowing down chips and wings like nothing was wrong while poor Mr. Smith went through who knows what trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And what did I do?\u2019 Tommy thought \u2018I tried to eat him, like part of a wing\u2019 The thought made him nauseous.  He looked at his belly and poked it. What else had he eaten without ever noticing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello!?\u201d Joe snapped his fingers in front of Tommy\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy blinked, remembering he was with his friends, and now they had instructions on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he muttered. Rather than explain what he had thought, he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, c\u2019mon! We gotta go to the lab right now!\u201d he said motioning with the hand that didn\u2019t hold a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s voice drifted from the speakers. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you what to get, or how to get into my lab!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, I just felt so bad since I\u2026\u201d Tommy trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Tommy, really. Anyway\u2026\u201d and Mr. Smith explained what they needed to do.</span></div></div>",

He opened the phone book and ran his finger down the L page. He settled on a number and started dialing. After the second ring someone picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" said the voice. \"Hi, Walden... I mean Mr. Lake... I um... well, Bryan says he needs you Mr. ah... Waldo\" Joe stumbles through the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence on the other end. \"Why can't he talk to me? And besides its my day off!\" replies the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say its an emergency, and to meet us at the lab ASAP\" Bryan urges the gigantic young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's an emergency and you need to... I mean could you meet us at the lab?\" he asks, similar to a child asking for a toy at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh sounds from the other end of the line \"I suppose, but this better be good!\" a click signals that the call is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get going!\" says Tommy. When Mr. Smith doesn't protest this time he walks to the door. \"C'mon guys, we can take my brother's car.\" Like a flash he's out the door, his friends close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith sat in Steve's hand while Tommy drove them to the lab. He was still so glad to finally be making progress on the situation. He was glad it had been Tommy who had found him. Andy didn't seem as trustworthy, Joe while good intentioned probably wouldn't have noticed anything, and Steve seemed to quiet to have spoken up. And now Tommy was spear-heading the effort to return him to normal, something Mr. Smith was deeply grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts moved to Waldo. He and Bryan were friendly though not too close. The man just wasn't that social. He was prone to crankiness, and coupled with his overly technical mind he wasn't far from a stereotypical nerdy scientist. But the man was very smart, and he wouldn't have any trouble using the notes to return his tiny co-worker to normal. Mr. Smith felt so good, things finally were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pulled into a parking space in front of the low building. Looking around he realized he didn't know what the guy looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though reading his mind Andy piped up from the back seat \"What's Waldo even look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugged but jumped when a man tapped on his window. Tommy rolled it down and stared at him. The man was unremarkable. His skin was pale, but not abnormally so. His hair was short, black, and had some gel to hold it in place. His gray eyes looked uninterested behind a pair of wiry, silver glasses. Tommy also noticed he already had a lab coat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Waldo. I'm assuming you're the kids who called me. So what's the emergency?\" his voice contained a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy gave him a quick story of what had happened and what Mr. Smith had told them. Waldo's face shifted between surprise and disbelief several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\"he says finally. Steve holds his hand up from the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaldo stares at the speck in the boy's hand and reaches for it. \"Give him to me,\" he demands \"I'll return him to normal, if you said its in the notes I can do it.\" Steve carefully turns his hand into Waldo's. They both watch as Mr. Smith moves down the slope onto Waldo's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word the scientist spins around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Tommy calls after him \"Where are you going? We want to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessary!\" Waldo replies dismissively without turning back. He looks down at his shrunken co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a discovery you've made Bryan!\" he says happily. \"You would make a great test subject!\" he laughed. Tiny Bryan waits for a 'just kidding' but it doesn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up worried, to see Waldo seeming to stare through him, deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could really benefit from the credit for this...\" he trails off. \"Of course I'd have to test it some more, but that's what I have you for!\" he says. To Waldo Bryan is now another test subject, no different from a lab mouse. \"Nothing personal\" he adds to the tiny man on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith feels his world spinning. Things had gotten really bad really fast! He finds himself hoping that somehow Tommy will rescue him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy watches the man walk away, periodically leaning down to talk to the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go with them, we're part of this.\" Tommy murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy obviously doesn't want us there\" Joe states with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Tommy trails off.</span></div></div>",

His entire body aches after his rough landing on a thankfully empty paper plate. However he knows he can't waste much time crying about it. He doesn't seem to have any injuries and he has learned already that plates are not safe places.

He doesn't bother yelling as the thunderous sounds of the TV almost drown out his own thoughts. Around him are towering bags of chips, and stadium-sized containers of wings.

Though already deafening, the increase of sound actually makes his tiny eardrums throb and he instinctively covers his ears.

He gasps as a pizza box soars over head and lands on a container of wings which is then shoved to the right. A bag of Doritos is pushed towards Mr. Smith. Before he can react, the container of dip slams into him from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy is searching frantically, almost knocking food on the floor.

The rubber wall, almost four times his height, stretched out for hundreds of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to circle around the foot, hoping to discover some means of scaling the massive footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't move,\" the little man whispered in a prayer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis survey of the entire length of the shoe gave him no better idea for climbing the monstrous shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he happened to glance at the neighboring shoe, located a few hundred feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" The little man exclaimed when he saw a dangling shoe lace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raced with a surge of energy, soon drawing close to the dangling lace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" he said, noticing lots of frayed fibers, some large and rope-like. \"This should be a cinch to climb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, with considerable exertion, he managed to climb Tommy's sneaker. Once he reached the top, he stood on a thin ledge and faced a wide wall of denim.  Folds in the stiff fabric provided pathways, but they were steep and unpredictable. At any second, the giant teenager could get on his feet and start walking about the room. The results could be catastrophic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, without his help, I'm doomed,\" the shrunken man told himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had it not been for the awful situation he might have laughed at the awkward noise. Tommy's exhaled out his nose, bringing a very welcome gust of warmth that caused waves across the lake of soda before dissipating. Within a second any warmth it had provided merely made the return of the cold more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Bryan shouted desperately gazing upward. Tommy's face was illuminated by the TV. Past the towering nose were Tommy's blue eyes, staring ahead at the game, unconcerned with the drama playing out in his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tilted his drink Bryan screamed again. His view quickly changed to Tommy's upper lip as it stuck into the glass. He felt a strong current pull him towards Tommy's mouth as Tommy took his first drink. The upper lip quivered as Tommy sucked more liquid into his mouth, the peach fuzz on it barely noticeable even for the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wasn't much of an athlete, actually he wasn't an athlete at all.

However he soon found himself able to breathe again, and not nearly as cold as before. He opened his eyes to discover he sat on Tommy's lip. He sat in a drop that had escaped the glass without entering the mouth. \"Yea-\" Bryan started to shout in celebration when suddenly something slammed into him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as his eyes shut instinctively. He felt himself move and when he opened his eyes he was in darkness. The air was also humid and smelled rotten. Light appeared in front of him, lighting up a silhouette of Tommy's upper teeth from the light that streamed between his open lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!!\" Bryan screamed in anger. He hadn't even been able to celebrate before he ended up in the place he had so much wanted to avoid. He beat his fists on the spongy surface of Tommy's tongue in frustration. The thing simply continued to sway gently. Bryan's anger had no effect whatsoever on the massive muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy licked the drop off his lips automatically. His thoughts as he did so were on finishing his soda. It tasted so good, and he could feel his thirst almost quenched. His eyes focused on the game he put the glass to his lips and gulped down the rest of the soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared as the lips parted wider allowing more light into the mouth. Tommy's teeth towered above him, strands of saliva stretching between them and the tongue. He cried out when he recognized the approaching rim of the glass and stood to run away. He took only one step when the wave of cola hit him from behind. He rushed towards the gaping black hole at the back of Tommy's mouth which deformed itself into a steep cavern as Tommy swallowed the last of his soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan cascaded downwards in the waterfall of soda through Tommy's throat he felt slightly stupid for trying to outrun the tsunami of pop in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's descent into the stomach was rough as he stopped for half a second with the soda at the sphincter closing off the stomach before  falling one last time into a lake of soda. The lake was warm as the heat radiating from Tommy's surrounding body had brought it to a comfortable temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan treaded the soda as he started to cry from the helplessness of his situation. He could see floating chunks of food, unrecognizable from being chewed, swallowed, dumped into the stomach, and stirred by the incoming drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy please don't digest me!\" he cried out knowing it was fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he would be dead soon and there was nothing he could do about it was a huge blow to the man who considered himself quite the genius. All this intellect brought to an end by his teenage neighbor's digestive system. \"Hell, my intellect is what brought me into Tommy's digestive system!\" he shouted aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to die by digestion Bryan made a hasty decision. He swam downwards, sadness in his heart and waited until his body would force him to inhale the soda. At least he would choose when he went and it would be quick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy watched the game unfold, the light from the TV flickered across his emotionless face. Except for the occasional cheer Tommy remained motionless. He had gotten used to the feeling of his full stomach and had pushed thoughts of it out of his conscious mind. Occasionally however he would place his hand over it and rub instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's gut was comfortably filled with chips, wings, soda, and one floating, unconscious, tiny man. But the contents of his stomach were not on Tommy's mind. As his hand yet again unconsciosly moved to his stomach, his only thought was how he wished he had made a bet on his team.</span></div></div>",

His progress hadn't taken him out of the living room before he depleted his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man curled into a tiny ball next to one of the massive wooden pillars supporting the plush armchair that was one of several gigantic pieces of furniture in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he needed to be well rested and energized when Tommy returned. As he drifted deeper into unconsciousness, vivid thoughts returned to the forefront of his brain. He recalled the sight of the two titanic teenagers as they had loomed over him in his own home. Those awe-inspiring mental images lured him into strange dreams as he enjoyed a brief nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tommy and Joe returned to Mr. Smith's home, they were accompanied by their friend, Andy. Like his buddies, Andy was a rather typical teenager. He wore an old  T-shirt that clung to his body. A well-worn pair of jeans hugged his lower half, and he wore a ratty pair of Vans sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This house is so freakin' awesome!\" Andy exclaimed as they entered the kitchen through the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, the commotion from three giants entering his home jolted Mr. Smith from his sleep and a dream that had found him tiny and scampering at the feet of titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with the floor trembling beneath his own tiny feet, he realized that that dream was rapidly coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this guy do for work again?\" Andy asked. \"He must be loaded to have a house like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the living room, Andy gasped. \"Is that a flat-screen TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what does your neighbor do?\" Joe asked when Tommy wasn't immediately forthcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the questions from Andy and Joe, Mr. Smith somehow got new hope. Perhaps Tommy and his friends were not that bad. If he could make contact with them, there would be a good chance (if they could only recognize him) that they would help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis optimistic thoughts were cut off, however, as the three titans tromped into the living room and his teenage neighbor  chose to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he's supposed to be some brilliant scientist, but he's still just a nerd,\" Tommy responded. \"And, if you ask me, he's not even all that bright. I mean, he can't be that smart if he pays me these big bucks just to mail a stupid package for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith, who had always regarded Tommy as a kind kid who did hard work for him, felt crushed at the teenager's indifference and ingratitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, gonna play the bad ass now?\" Joe remarked in a joking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could care less, as long as this guy pays me that much money, I will play nice and do whatever he wants. It beats getting a real job at the McDonalds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man stared up and noticed that each of the titans had helped themselves to a soft drink from his fridge as they made their way into his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed and Tommy tilted the can of soda and guzzled half its contents. For tiny Mr. Smith, the giant's actions produced an awesome display of immensity and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, how would he ever know? Right?\" Tommy chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless he has the place bugged?\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they wouldn't find any hidden microphones or cameras, but the tiny man reflected on the irony. The only \"bug\" near these giants was his unlucky self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid,\" Tommy said. \"Why would he do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a lucky guy, do you know that?\"Andy asked. He chuckle and continued. \"I wish I had a neighbor like this moron that I could milk like a cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much! Caught up in his anger and disappointment, the little man charged into the open. \"Get out!\" Bryan screamed up at the giants. Forgetting that they represented his only hope of returning to normal, he just wanted them gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gross,\" Andy remarked when he saw a pale insect scurry away from the plush armchair that he had eyed as a comfortable seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tommy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a disgusting bug,\" Andy said, pointing in the little man's general direction. \"Down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith's righteous anger evaporated. \"Oh god. What have I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and ran back toward the shadows beneath the armchair. Even as he tried to cover the distance as fast as he could, he still picked up the loud words of the conversation between the titanic teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't be very smart anyway\", Joe said. \"With all these bugs in here, I mean, come on, who ever would allow them to share his own home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Andy got an idea. \"You have to lay down a good word for me,\" he told Tommy. \"If he's that stupid and lazy, he may pay me, too, if I take care of his bug problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Tommy answered his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept it to himself, but Andy's plan was actually a good idea. Of course, Tommy would tell Mr. Smith he had taken on the job of eliminating the bug problem in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Andy lift his foot high off the floor, ready to stomp the offensive little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy yawned, barely reacting when Andy brought his sneaker down with a sturdy thud. He was content to let Andy do all the real work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down,\" Tommy remarked and slapped Andy on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the truth after all, even if Andy deserved the credit for taking out the first bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, where there's one bug, there's sure to be others. He told himself that if they encountered any other bugs, he would make sure he took out a few of the little pests, personally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest of all, Tommy figured with self-satisfied smugness, he could not wait to let Mr. Smith know what he had done for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The white handkerchief wrapped around endlessly throughout the entire box.  In the far back corner of the box, Bryan spotted the spare clothes he had packed, along with the bread crumbs.  He reached down and picked up one of the \u201ccrumbs\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d Bryan exclaimed aloud as he held the breadcrumb with both hands.  \u201cIt\u2019s as big as a fucking basketball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I won\u2019t go hungry,\u201d Bryan thought as he dropped the mega-sized crumb back to the pile of six or so other ones.  \u201cHey, look at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan noticed a beam of light shining through one of the air holes he had so carefully created.  He walked up to the peep hole and peered out.  He could see the two teen giants in the next room.  They were indeed whoppers.  Bryan estimated they stood at least 1500 feet tall.  He was a little disappointed that Tommy wasn\u2019t taking his job so seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here we go,\u201d Bryan thought to himself as he watched Joe and Tommy re-entering the kitchen, headed right for him.  Intense excitement filled his gut as if he was waiting on the start of some wild roller coaster ride at an amusement park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Joe, I\u2019ve got to get this package in mail,\u201d Tommy insisted as he approached the kitchen table.

He held a half drunk bottle of beer in the other.  \u201cI want to pick up that skateboard after I mail this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, chill,\u201d Joe retorted as he lifted the Heineken bottle to his mouth in an effort to guzzle down the remaining contents before they left.

A small amount of beer spilled out, directly onto the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.  Look what you made me do,\u201d Tommy blurted out quite pissed at Joe.  \u201cMan, there\u2019s beer all over it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Dawg,\u201d Joe responded as he took a paper towel and started to wipe the beer off the small box.  \u201cSee, no harm done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, this part of the address is all blurry now,\u201d Tommy said as he noticed the spilled beer had caused the ink on the address label to run.

I can fix this,\u201d Joe said as he examined the blurred address label.  \u201cIt\u2019s just this one number that\u2019s messed up.  I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe found a pen and began writing over the blurred number on the address label.  \u201cNumber two, one, eight,\u201d Joe spoke as he \u201cfixed\u201d the obscured number. \u201cSee buddy, all better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s the same number that was on there before?\u201d  Tommy asked with a slight skepticism.  \u201cI can\u2019t screw this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Joe responded with a mischievous smile that left Tommy a little uncomfortable.  \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the commotion, tiny Bryan had found an edge of the giant handkerchief and held on.  He hadn\u2019t planned on such a rough ride.  He could only make out a couple sentences from the thunderous voices outside the box.

Joe sighed and gave Tommy a look of disappointment.  \u201cHell, I\u2019ll still have about eighty five dollars left Joe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2014step to the side, fill this out, put the package inside and seal it shut,\u201d the postal worker instructed Tommy as he handed him a large pliable overnight envelope.  \u201cThat will be thirteen sixty five please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy addressed the overnight envelope, reading the address out loud as he wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, Dude,\u201d Joe urged Tommy impatiently.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the skate shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant\u2019s voices from outside the box sounded like distant thunder.  Bryan could hear Tommy\u2019s voice read the address as he was labeling the overnight envelope.  As he listened intently to the slightly muffled boom of Tommy\u2019s voice, Bryan thought he heard the words two eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooh, that\u2019s not right at all,\u201d Bryan thought to himself as a nervous chill overtook his tiny body.  \u201cI must have heard that wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll set,\u201d Tommy said with a smile as he handed the overnight envelope over to the postal worker.  \u201cC\u2019mon Joe.  Let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe postal worker tossed the overnight envelope into a large bin as Tommy and Joe exited.  The brilliant research scientist was on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have thought to bring a fucking flashlight,\u201d Bryan thought as he sat in the now darkened box within the overnight shipping envelope.  As the words \u201ctwo eighteen\u201d popped into his head again, he began an urgent search in the darkness for the lost vial of shrinking antidote.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to find that fucking vial.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan had told him to expect a delivery in a couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it has been a couple of days,\" Zack said to himself as he closed the door to Dorm Room 212. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast evening, overcome with building curiosity, Zack had phoned his uncle. He only got Bryan's voice mail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of leaving a message, he had hung up the phone, figuring he could wait one more day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack strolled through the corridor. As he passed Dorm Room 218, the door opened suddenly and a big, half-naked guy stumbled into the hall. He wore a pair of form-fitting boxer briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zack,\" the guy said. He had dark, disheveled hair and he looked at Zack through sleep-bleary eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, man,\" Zack said. \"I'm headed to class. Uh, shouldn't you be on your way, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy laughed. \"I stayed up late,\" he answered while scratching absently at the crotch of his shorts. \"Thought I'd blow off my morning classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shrugged. \"Well, see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack liked the guy, but he was almost too much of a slacker for Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack exited the dorm building and headed across campus toward his first class. Only a moment after his departure, a postal carrier entered the dorm building with a brown sack filled with packages and letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package, Bryan's torment continued. His trip, courtesy of the U.S. Postal Service, had been an endless hellish nightmare. The tiny man had lost all track of time. He didn't have a clue to how long he had been in the box. He had tried to locate the missing vial of antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of crawling in darkness on his hands and knees, Bryan finally gave up on locating the vial within the warehouse-sized box stuffed with yard upon yard of cotton fabric comprising the handkerchief he had placed in the box for insulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, during his searching, he did locate one of the basketball-sized crumbs of food, so he did manage to avoid hunger pangs during the torture of the journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe postal carrier stopped outside a dorm room on the second floor of the building. He knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big, muscle-bound guy in boxer briefs opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a package for Zack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The guy looked like he had just rolled out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe postal carrier frowned and shoved the package toward the college student. \"It's a package for Room 218.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the package safely in the guy's hands, the postal carrier turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's dorm neighbor looked down at the label on the box. He saw his own dorm room number but Zack's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the box, tossed back and forth again, Bryan managed to find a stable niche in the folds of the handkerchief in time to hear an indistinct conversation. Once again, he heard the words \"Room Two Eighteen\" uttered by a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not right,\" Bryan said. \"What the hell's going on?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He guzzled the bottle dry in a few seconds.  The buff college guy headed back to his desk and plopped down in wooden chair, creating an unsteady creaking noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick flipped the package over a couple of times and then re-examined the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 Zack don\u2019t live here,\u201d Rick said to himself as a bit of curiosity began to set in.  \u201cGuess the fucker who sent this got the address wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably something from Zack\u2019s rich uncle,\u201d Rick thought as just a tinge of jealousy set in as he thought of Zack\u2019s sweet little blue sports car.  \u201cGuess I\u2019ll give it to Zack when he gets back from class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was tossed as the box was turned upside down a couple of times.  He heard a distant boom as a strange giant talked, but he couldn\u2019t make out any words.  He just knew it wasn\u2019t Zack\u2019s voice.  Bryan thought he heard the postal carrier earlier say he had a package for room two eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be right,\u201d Bryan thought nervously as the box became eerily motionless.  The thought of being delivered to the wrong room and a complete stranger terrified the tiny scientist\u2014especially since he had no way to return to normal size without the vial of antidote that was lost earlier.  \u201cI know I put 212 on this damn package!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick sat thinking for a couple of minutes, trying to completely wake up.  He brushed his fingers lightly across the overnight envelope wondering what was inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell!  I\u2019m just going to open the fucker,\u201d the muscular college guy mumbled defiantly.  \u201cIts got my fucking address on it anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan froze when he heard the thunderous intentions of the strange giant from the outside world.  \u201cOh God no, this can\u2019t be happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick easily pulled away a thin strip from the top of the envelope and gave a quick look inside.  He reached in and pulled out a little cardboard box.  His large hand engulfed the small box as he examined it from all sides.  He chuckled as he tossed it in the air a couple of times, and even held it up to his nose and gave it a quick smell.  \u201cFuckin box is light as a feather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small amount of light entered the box as it left the overnight shipping envelope.  Bryan\u2019s mind raced for some sort of plan.  He was beginning to realize his package had been misdirected and he was about to be discovered by some strange giant.  The bug-sized man knew there was no time to resume his search for the lost vial that could return him to normal size.  \u201cI gotta fucking hide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tucked himself just under an edge of the immense handkerchief, positioning himself so he could just peek out from the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick positioned the box on the desk before him, and reached into a cup.  He pulled out a long pair of sharp scissors.  He placed the pointed tip of one of the razor sharp legs of the scissors on one edge of the box and gave a quick JAB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh Fuck!\u201d  Bryan screamed as the sharp metallic scissors entered the box with a loud, powerful screeching noise.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick pushed and pulled the scissors in a sawing motion until he created a major tear in one edge of the box.  The brawny guy then poked two fingers in the tear and effortlessly ripped open the small box.  Curiously the box seemed to contain only one white handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could have prepared Bryan for the sight he was currently witnessing.  The young man before him was a monster.  Bryan shivered as he peeked from behind the handkerchief, looking skyward at the looming figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a gigantic hand began to descent toward the handkerchief, and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsumed with fear, Bryan began to run.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving the package behind him, Bryan sprinted across the giant's desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when he found himself exposed on a vast, flat surface. The tiny man spun himself around in a full circle as he looked desperately for a place of concealment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge stretch of familiar white fabric dropped down onto the surface, trapping Bryan between the box and what he recognized as the handkerchief the giant had removed from the box and then dropped on the desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, in total confusion, raced back toward the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, WHAT THE FUCK?\u201d The giant said in a loud tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d Bryan changed direction and ran back toward the handkerchief. He didn't dare even look up. He reached the outer edge of the huge expanse of white cloth and flung himself forward to land in a crevice formed by a fold in the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, instead of offering the speck-sized man any protection, the fabric began to buck and warp as a giant hand picked up the handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick, having spied the tiny creature's darting movements before hiding in a fold of the cloth, shook out the handkerchief. His sharp eyes saw a pale form fall onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, on his back, opened his eyes and saw a massive hand, palm side down, rushing toward him. The hand filled his entire range of view. He could not even see the hand's owner, although he knew the giant must be one of his nephew's fellow college students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed as two colossal fingers reached toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo enormous fingertips closed on his tiny form and grasped him.  \u201cNo! Let me go!\" Bryan cried. \" Zack! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" Rick said. Intrigued, his voice began to take on an excited edge. \"IT'S A LITTLE MAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt as if he might explode. He knew the giant must be exerting barely any pressure, but the shrunken man felt as if trapped in an enormous vise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the giant recognized him as a human being! For a few seconds, Bryan feared being mistaken for a bug and indiscriminately squished by the colossal college student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHY THE HELL'S ZACK HAVING A TEENY-TINY MAN SHIPPED TO HIM?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned the packing box on its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unclasped his fingers and let the tiny speck of a man drop onto the label spread across the surface of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, glad to breathe freely again, looked beneath his feet. For the first time, in hand-scrawled letters bigger than his body, the tiny man got a glimpse of the blurred label and Joe\u2019s bungled attempt to fix the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoom 218!\u201d Bryan exclaimed. His fear confirmed, he lifted his face and stared up at the colossal guy. \u201cNo! It was supposed to be 212. Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick stared in amazement as he saw Bryan take a few steps on the white shipping label. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAWESOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's voice, so close and so loud, terrified Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, who had been staring at the damage where Rick had ripped into the box with scissors, turned and stared up at the giant. He felt very insignificant under the giant's intense scrutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge man's hairy chest spread out like a mountain. The giant's head and shoulders looked like higher peaks in an unbelievable mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Bryan reasoned, this giant surely knew his nephew. Maybe, he hoped, the giant could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me?\" Bryan screamed as loudly as he could. \"My nephew's a student here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick continued to stare without changing his fascinated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't hear me,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

THERE MUST BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED OF THESE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ideas entering Bryan's head about his next science expiriment -- cloning? maybe, he thought -- Bryan was ambivalent. At least he'd made contact, but on the other hand -- look who he'd come into contact with. A lacrosse player with a brain that seemed to be smaller than the puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Bryan was incredibly afraid and humiliated. At his normal size, Bryan would have been intimidated by Rick. But at a fourth of an inch tall, he was, well, three hundred times as intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, HOW TALL ARE YOU, ANYWAY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wasn't sure how to respond to the comment, but realized quickly that he wouldn't need to. As Rick had said that, he reached toward Bryan. Bryan shrieked, utterly afraid. The mere width of Rick's finger was 25 feet across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wanted to run but he realized that he couldn't just jump -- it was a 50 foot drop to the ground, one that Bryan wasn't sure he could survive, even at the falling velocity of his newly diminished state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous finger bearing down on Bryan and getting closer, Bryan made a split-second decision. He jumped *towards* the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger was close enough to Bryan that he could reach it. Bryan hit the front of the finger, and he immeditaley grabbed at a part of the underside of the finger. It was slippery, but Bryan realized that such factors were irrelevant in his shrunken state. The mere presence of sweat on something was enough to make Bryan cling to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to the bottom of the finger, Bryan had originally attended to make himself fall from a lesser distance. But he realized that Rick was quicker than he'd given him credit for; directly under him was Rick's other hand. He was trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME GO!\" Bryan screamed, as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand suddenly turned over and Bryan fell into the other hand, which contracted slightly. Bryan felt like he was in a dome; the edges of the hand rising up around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick has very good hearing, and he was sure that he had just heard a call for help. A miniscule one, but definitley there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU...YOU CAN TALK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Rick had assumed that Bryan was mute, as well as a clone. Bryan sighed. </span></div></div>",

He grunted as he tossed the handful in a small trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least safe for the moment, Bryan was mesmerized as he took in all the features of the young titan before him.  His hair was dark and a little grungy, and his massive face was covered with dark stubble that looked to be about two day\u2019s growth.  And even to a normal sized person, he would be considered a big guy.  But to tiny Bryan, he was colossal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan then began to look around the immense dorm room.  The floor was littered with dirty clothes, textbooks, and an array of other items typical to a college dorm room.  The entire room smelled of dirty socks and stale pizza.

The air around him was thick with putrid foot stench.  It was all he could do to keep from throwing up.  \u201cHow could any guy\u2019s shoe smell this fucking bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew he had to escape this hideous smelling shoe as fast as possible.  The thought of ending up an insignificant red smear on the bottom of some college guy\u2019s foot was not the way he wanted it all to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter inch tall scientist walked around the towering walls of the sneaker, surveying for any possible way to climb out.  The fabric was extremely worn and smooth.  The walls of the sneaker would be impossible to scale.  He kept walking around the wall of the sneaker looking for any means of escape.  When he saw the enormous number 16 stitched high on the side of the shoe, he nervously gulped\u2014and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the jumbo sized sock balled up in the front of the Nike sneaker.  The massive opening of the sock loomed directly in front of him, and it really stank.  Bryan held one hand to his nose as he approached.  As he looked upward, Bryan noticed many folds in the sock extended to the very top of the shoe, almost like a fabric ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge adrenaline rush washed over Bryan and his heart pounded.  He jumped up to the first fold in the damp musky sock, and then reached for the next highest fold.  The tiny scientist no longer cared about the sock\u2019s heinous smell.  It was now his salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan reached the top of the shoe rather quickly and carefully crawled out onto the ledge that was the top of the shoe\u2019s tongue.  He stood with the satisfaction and pride of someone that had just scaled some daunting cliff or dangerous mountain.  \u201cGod\u2014this is one fucking huge ass shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb down would be easier, but no less dangerous.  He began his descent through the maze of shoelaces, headed for the toe.  When Bryan reached the toe of the shoe, he had to rest.  As he sat on the dirty worn shoe leather, he pondered his situation.  The tiny vial of antidote that could restore him to normal was probably in the enormous waste basket.  At his meager size, Bryan knew it would be nearly impossible for him to retrieve.  Somehow, he would have to get help from a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this giant made Bryan very nervous.  What would a guy like that do if he found someone as small as him?  Would he even recognize him as a man, or think he was just some bug, and stomp him out of existence with those huge feet of his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Bryan froze as the room became silent.  The giant had stopped snoring.  The silence was pierced by a thunderous yawn.  Rick had awakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!  I\u2019m going to be late for practice,\u201d Rick thought aloud as he rose from his bed and glanced at the clock.

In near darkness, Bryan\u2019s surroundings shifted alarmingly as the monstrous contents were jostled about.  The shrunken scientist feared at any second he would be crushed by the gigantic college athlete\u2019s size sixteen sneakers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick made it to the gymnasium in record time and headed for the locker room.  In the locker room, his teammates were already in the process of getting changed for practice.  After some quick small talk with several of the guys, Rick slung his gym bag down next to his locker and unzipped the bag.  He pulled out some pads, a helmet, his sneakers, and a gold Under-armour t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick placed his street clothes in the locker and quickly got dressed in his lacrosse practice gear.  He pulled on an extremely snug fitting gold Under-armour t-shirt, and then proceeded with his socks and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I really gota do some laundry,\u201d Rick said to himself as he took a quick sniff of his Thorlo socks before his put them on his oversized feet.  \u201cMaybe next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan covered his eyes as the bright light of the locker room flooded the gym bag.  As the light revealed the contents of the gym bag, Bryan was horrified by the wickedly huge lacrosse gear that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the bug sized man could even manage a scream, Rick\u2019s monstrous hand entered the gym bag and began pulling out the huge pieces of lacrosse gear, one by one.  Bryan held on with all his might to the putrid smelling t-shirt, horrified as the burly lacrosse player lifted it high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Under-armour  t-shirt was lifted, the folds in the shirt straighten out, and tiny Bryan lost his grip and began a quick descent to the hard cement floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the miniaturized scientist landed on one of Rick\u2019s humongous Thorlo socks.  He quickly scurried off the sock onto the dull gold painted cement floor just before Rick\u2019s massive hand reached for his sock.  Bryan surveyed the vast locker room in disbelief.  The thunderous voices of the rest of the lacrosse team echoed throughout the locker room.  The sight of the gigantic athletes changing into their lacrosse gear was nothing less than breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan was awestruck as he looked skyward at the impressive athlete.  As the hulking lacrosse player finished up by donning his should pads and helmet, the transformation was complete.  Now, nothing less than a colossal gladiator towered over Bryan.  The meager scientist stood mesmerized at the awesome sight. Bryan soon regained his senses as Rick\u2019s massive shoe rose and passed directly over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick closed his locker and quickly headed to the field with his teammates, oblivious to the traumatized quarter inch tall man he left next to his locker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw several benches rising up like strange plateaus from the flat, gold-painted floor. The rows of lockers rose like metal cliffs. A few colossal gym bags looked the size of a sports coliseum to the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere reeked of a strange blend of powerful odors, including mildew and the unmistakable sweat of the jocks who used the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan saw a stray sock beneath one of the benches. After a quick jaunt, he stood in the shadow of the enormous sock. A pungent odor from the damp, sweaty sock filled his nostrils and stung his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his curiosity, Bryan beat a hasty retreat from the immediate vicinity of the sock. Choking and near tears, he took in some desperate breaths of semi-fresh air. \"I've never smelled anything that awful!\" Bryan exclaimed only to hear his teeny voice get lost in the vast emptiness of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his head cleared, more pressing thoughts intruded into his consciousness. Back at the dormitory, he had at least been close to making contact with his nephew. To get back to normal size, Bryan still needed to get help from Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, last time we talked, Zack didn't play lacrosse,\" Bryan said, putting his brain to work to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to think of a way back to the dorm. The most obvious way, he decided, would be a return trip via Rick's gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big jock, unfortunately, had secured his bag inside his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll have to get changed,\" Bryan thought. \"When he does, I'll need to be ready and find a way back inside the bag.\"</span></div></div>",

The giants took him by surprise, forcing the shocked shrunken scientist to seek immediate cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the only nearby source of concealment rested with the stray sock beneath one of the benches. Despite his earlier experience with the sweaty sock, the bug-sized man had no choice. He scurried over the tiles and dived into a fold in the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the offensive odor from the damp, sweaty sock filled his nostrils and stung his eyes. The little man almost gagged from the stench. His fear and awe of the giants made him suck in several deep breaths, which only made his situation even more unbearable when instead of fresh air, he inhaled the air made rancid from the scent of jock foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no choice but to cower in his hiding place, hopefully waiting for the giants to finish and leave the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat option might have worked, if one of the giants hadn't noticed the sock and reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan felt the sock leave the floor, but he wasn't going along for the ride. He slipped and fell from a height of several inches, landing hard on the unforgiving floor. His tiny body was sprawled on the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he was even more vulnerable, he forced himself to his feet and prepared to run when a massive foot slammed down next to him. Another few inches, the foot would have landed squarely on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo shocked to move, he froze in place. He stared at a row of toes, even the smallest of which massively larger than his shrunken body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick, seated on the bench, planted his feet firmly on the tile floor. He had already stripped off his practice garb, leaving him in nothing more than his jock. Of course, most of the other lacrosse players were in a similar state of undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched in terror as another pair of huge bare feet slapped across the damp tiles. He could not move, terrified that if he made any sudden movements, one of the jocks would mistake him for a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing anything later?\" Rick asked one of his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. Got anything in mind?\" Jason asked. Like most of his fellow players, Jason was a burly, intimidating brute with extreme muscle. He also had feet almost as large as Rick's Size 16s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason also had exceptional vision, and as he talked with Rick, he noted a tiny, pale creature close to Rick's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, there's some sort of disgusting bug down there near your foot,\" Jason warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan heard the jock's words and immediately felt icy fear seize his insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Rick demanded, lifting the foot farthest from the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your other foot,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, a couple of other players meandered closer, their own bare feet slapping the tiles, adding to the rising panic in the shrunken scientist's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked down and saw the tiny, pale bug. He watched as it scurried across the tiles, heading under the bench where he sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan panicked and ran, but he did have enough thought to head for the doubtful shelter beneath the massive locker room bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I do with pests like that,\" Jason announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man heard, but kept running, most unwilling to discover what the huge lacrosse player did with pests.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stopped cold in your tracks as you saw dozens of giant feet slam and hit the ground in a sweaty stampede of death as they walked over to where you were. The jocks made a crowded half circle around you, Jason, and Rick sitting on the cold cement bench against the lockers behind him. You were trapped on a dirty locker room floor, caged in by dozens of sweaty feet blocking your exit out of this sweat ring of death, and all eyes were on you. You looked up at all the half-naked and naked jocks looming above you looking down upon you at their feet with smirks, looks of disgust, and excitement at what was about to happen to this bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw an opening to your left and ran for it, but all of a sudden a new foot emerged from behind the jock wall and blocked it as another jock joined the mob to see what all the commotion was about.

Other attempts were met with the toes scrunched up last second and you ran head first into a the distorted image of your frightened face on one of the godly jocks giant toenails. This went on for what it seems forever as this ring of jocks laughed and prevented your escape with a wall of toes. The the cackling jocks above let out one liners like \"It's like this thing likes feet or something? HA! Maybe I can train it to clean between my toes\" and \"Almost feel sorry for the fucking thing, almost.\" with each and every failed attempt at escape from their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally turned around almost completely broken in mind and body as you make one last attempt to be recognized. You run to the feet of Rick who has been sitting this whole time watching his friends torment and tease the insect. You run up to his big toe and pound on the sweaty flesh screaming \"I'm a human being, please save me!\" between choking gasps as the smell of his feet almost asphyxiates you. He smirks and say's loudly to his teammates \"Ha look like it's come back home to big daddy\" as he curls his big toe back and flicks you, sending you flying back into the middle of the torturous circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the sky from on your back at the many smirking faces of these gods among men as they look down upon you and the glaring fluorescent lights of the overhead lights of the locker room ceiling. Every part of your body is in shock and you can't move, all you remember was the toenail of Ricks big toe coming out of nowhere and slamming into you like a cement truck. As you lay paralyzed in shock on the floor Rick says \"Jason just end this pathetic excuse for a bug already, I'm bored with this now\" which was met by shouts of encouragement by his friends and teammates of \"Yeah smear it under your sole!\" \"Crush that little shit under your big toe just like we crush the competition!\" \"Turn em' into toe jam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the testosterone floods the air from all these hot headed jocks you realize they are blind to everything but your demise and will never see you as anything but some sick mob induced pass time to alleviate their boredom in your death under their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason steps forward and says \"Yeah, this has gone on long enough....not that I haven't enjoyed it but it's time to end this fucker!\". He raises his foot slowly of the ground and you slowly see the light disappear as the sole of his long lethal foot blocks out the sky and the taunting jocks staring down relishing every last second off this bugs life about to end under Jason's soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole hovers above you as Jason poises his foot above, laughs and yells \"This is what I do to bugs\" as he lowered the uncompromising and unforgiving sweaty sky of flesh down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinypic.com/r/dwat8j/8\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinypic.com/r/dwat8j/8</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sweat soaked skin making contact with his body, instantly covering him in a layer of jock sweat. The smell was horrible. Jason's sole had just went through hell at practice, trapped in a shoe. Bryan choked and gagged on the scent, unable to breath. He began pushing and squirming on the flesh, trying to free himself. He faintly heard something being said above him, and then he felt the pressure begin to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time the pressure increased, so did the pain.

Please!\", he begged, \"I am not a bug!\" But his cries fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with one final push, Jason's sole smashed the bug into the floor.

Everything was his own fault, and now he was lost, smaller than most bugs, in a locker room populated by massive, muscular titans oblivious to his presence in their universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence of the enormous locker room added to the ominous feeling oppressing the tiny man.

In his shock, he wanted to run in fear but forced himself to stand his ground and observe the new giant. As he studied the massive man, Bryan realized the man was a janitor with a mop and bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked young, not much older than his nephew. He had a friendly face, long, dark hair and a nice build. He also had a set of earphones in his ears, listening to music as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan choked off his first instinct, which was to scream for help. The giant janitor would never hear him over his music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still debating whether he should attempt to be seen when the janitor reached down, tipped over the bucket and released a flood of soapy water across the floor near the benches and lockers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could scream, the shrunken scientist felt the flood crash into him with the force of a tsunami. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But before he could form the concept of just why that was in his frantic mind, he slammed down onto the edge of the sneaker, and bounced off the lip through the air again, landing softly on a field of white and gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDisoriented and light headed, Bryan attempted to stand and fell over as his head spun. Before long his head started to clear enough for his senses to be mildly regained.

Taking a deep breath, the tiny scientist pushed himself to his feet and got a quick look at his landing spot. For a moment the miniature man couldn't put two and two together. Then it hit him, 'His Sock!' he thought with initial disgust. He quickly stumbled off the lip of the sock about six feet to the ground and stumbled away gasping for breath.

Getting himself back to normal size before the situation spun farther out of control now dominated his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box that had transported him here now rested inside the metallic trashcan that loomed on the distant horizon like some example of modern architecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger than a skyscraper,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he told himself that the antidote was more important than contacting his nephew. When he faced the reality of his situation, he realized he didn't have the first clue as to how he could ever find Zack on a college campus populated by titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he trudged a path toward the distant trash receptacle, he noticed the other structures littered at different points along the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open pizza box bigger than a city block rose up like a blunt factory building constructed of cardboard. A trip around the box would cause him a significant delay. Fortunately, the lid of the box offered a ramp that he ascended only to come to a stop at the point where the box formed a square that could have held several NFL football fields. He could lower himself over the edge and make his way to the other side of the box, eliminating considerable time from his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he dropped the equivalent of about 24 feet to the cardboard floor of the box. He started to sprint across the strange floor. He passed a wide smear of congealed cheese and a torn strip of pepperoni. As he pushed farther across the box, he encountered a complete slice of pizza, the remains of a feast left untouched by the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened in amazement as he studied the stale pizza slice. His stomach grumbled, reminding him that he hadn't eaten and this was, technically, food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried, without success, to tear a morsel from the hardened crust. The smell of stale baked dough, tomato sauce, cheese and pepperoni reminded him that he had been fasting for almost two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed onto the slice of pizza, which offered a slippery, greasy surface for his feet. He approached a whole pepperoni and tried to tear loose a strip of the cured meat. When that didn't work, he simply bit into the pepperoni, using his teeth to wrench free a morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chewed and swallowed, but the cold, grease-laden pepperoni made his stomach feel a little queasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes disgusting,\" he muttered, but he knew that a tiny beggar could not afford to be finicky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring he might need fuel for his journey, he took another bite of the pungent pepperoni slice and then moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crossed the vast interior of the box, he began to realize a difficulty. The vertical walls of the box rose more than 20 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the pizza box hadn't been difficult, but getting out on the other side might prove a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his years in high school, Rick's attitude toward cleaning had been to let his surroundings become as messy and intolerable as possible before finally working to clear mess and clutter from his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he moved into the college dorms, his avoidance of cleaning had not changed. All his friends remarked on his room, and most girls never returned after their initial visit. It didn't seem to bother the guys as much, but even Rick had his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile moving his mountainous body clad only in a tight, well-worn pair of boxer briefs, the huge, hairy jock caught an unpleasant whiff of rancid food. He looked down at the burger wrappers, fry cartons and pizza boxes strewn on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to move some of this crap,\" he said aloud. He lowered his arm and picked up the pizza box, causing the one remaining slice to careen across the cardboard surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bug-sized man saw Rick's arm descend, he screamed for attention. When that produced no results, he screamed again as the landscape tilted and the huge slice of pizza slid toward him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he reached for a white garbage bag, he idly thought about grabbing the slice and scarfing it down, but couldn't remember when he bought the thing in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick flick of his wrist the young man opened the garbage bag. With his other hand he quickly folded the pizza box in half before dumping it sideways in trash bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed as the wall of stale dough and hardened cheese came rushing at him. He threw up his arms in a weak and futile gesture to save his life. He screamed, a blood curdling terrified shriek. The box suddenly lurched and the oncoming discarded hillside of food slowed enough that when it hit him, it didn't instantly splatter him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Exclaimed the tiny scientist s the air was expelled suddenly from his lungs. But his panicked mind knew even now that the danger wasn't over. He craned his head around to see the brown wall of unyielding cardboard he knew he would be crashing into zoom closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only an inch to spare the momentum of the pizza stopped. The bug sized man almost had enough time to holler in relief. When suddenly a cacophony of grating and tearing cardboard filled his ears. Then suddenly changed its orientation and the minuscule man found himself plummeting along side the pizza slice as the unaware Behemoth above him simple shoved the box containing him into a trash bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick quickly scooped up bag after bag of discarded wrappers and fast food containers into the gladd trash bag, crumpling each item and the pizza box below them into a more compact form. He even upended the small silver garbage bin next to his desk into the bag, including the recently opened 'empty' box he'd casually opened. Not noticing a tiny speck of glass that remained in the bin after he placed it back under his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick took a quick survey of his room and nodded satisfied. Most people would still consider the room toxic-waste-dump status. But to him it more than met his standards for \"clean\" living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tying up the bag he quickly threw on a pair of shorts, grabbed the bag and walked out into the hall. Outside other students were hanging out between classes or rushing off to various errands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by the men's room he ran into one of his Jock buddies, a man name Juan Carlos. He stopped to talk to his handsome friend, not noticing that his bag had begun to rip from the pressure of too much garbage and released several small wrappers and a good amount of crumbs in front of the lavatory door. </span></div></div>",

His tiny bare feet slapping against the hard floor. On either side of him the toes of two young jocks towered above him. The tiny professor took a quick glance skyward, past the hairy pillars of legs and up beyond they towards the faces of the two Titans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the fact that there was two of them now, or maybe it was the fact that both of the studs were bulging with muscles, or most likely the tiny professors current size, but he had to stop and stare as awe swept over him. Any thought of attempting to get the attention of either Giant was wiped from his mind. They appeared more like portions of the landscape rather than humans that he could identify with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow cast itself over the minuscule man, and a wall of flesh blurred across his vision. An earthquake threw the scientist from his feet, and as he regained his footing he saw what had happened. The Titan Rick had moved his foot forward and crushed the candy wrapper he'd been in only moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic took over and Bryan bolted. He turned away from the foot and ran towards the passage way underneath the near by door. Once safely in its shadow, the tiny man didn't stop running. He was only vaguely aware that the space underneath the door way was like a large indoor stadium in height. Sounds of explosions came from behind him followed by a rumbling proclamation from one of the giants \"CATCH YA LATER BRO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scientists mind began to process the words and what they meant, a creaking groan filled the air and the thick wooden ceiling above him began to shift, a wall of air slammed into the tiny man and sent him soaring through the air. As he crashed into the hard tile of the men's shared bathroom, Bryan caught a glimpse of the young Latino man from outside the door, before the shadow of his sandal fell over the worlds tiniest human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scientist screamed, and stared in horror as the massive appendage fell towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch ya later bro!\" Juan Carlos smiled at his Buddy Rick. The two slapped their hands together in a complex hand shake, learned semesters ago. When they had completed the gesture, Juan Carlos turned and walked into the men's room, showering materials in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on his face Juan Carlos, or \"JC\" as his friends called him, walked into the men's room, not noticing as he nearly stepped on a bug sized pale form near the door.  Stepping over to the mirror next to the door he dropped his showering materials on the floor and got a good look at himself in the mirror. His goateed face was rugged and handsome. He considered himself to be, if not a gift from god, then at least a blessing for women. Peeling off his shirt he tossed it on the ground near the shower directly behind him and kicked his sandals off under the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked to the shower and with a quick flick of his wrist set the water to hot before turning back to his shower caddy. As he knelt beside it, he pulled out and dropped his wash cloth on the floor as he dug through it looking for a bar of soap. \"Aha! Gotcha.\" He said finding the nearly dissolved Irish Spring bar before picking up the wash cloth and heading back to the shower. Checking the water temperature, and finding it to his liking, he quickly removed his shorts before stepping beneath the hot stream of steaming water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bryan has ended up... </span></div></div>",

He grunted in disapproval, and realized he was leaving a small trail of filth in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt Rick shook his foot until the wrapper fell to the floor and walked to the double doors leading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan Smith screamed, and clutched onto himself for dear life, terror causing his heart to race, the wall of thin plastic in front of him flattened and a thunderous Boom rocked him to his core. The plastic walls twisted and contorted into a constricting prison around the tiny professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had a short moment to process this information before the now all too familiar sensation of his stomach dropping hit him as his new confinement rose into the air. \"Help!\"  The tiny scientist screamed before he felt the ground slam into him. Pain flooded through his senses threatening to knock him unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process repeated itself twice more, each time increasingly painful. On the fourth time rising into the air there was a brief reprise before a violent shaking thrashed him about. The walls of his wrapper prison began to loosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" The professor exclaimed at first his arms freed, but the air began to rush past him as the wrapper fell free from what the tiny man could only guess was a giant foot. He would have fallen to his untimely demise if the wrapper had not fallen as gently as it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to rest upon the ground, Bryan sighed with momentary relief. \"I have to get out of here!\" He exclaimed and attempted to move down the tunnel the wrapper created towards freedom. However, the tiny man realized all to soon that he was stuck to the sticky residue of a simple piece of candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick continued the last few steps to the door leading outside and quickly thrust them open with more strength than was needed. Which resulted in him nearly slamming the opaque door into the face of his dorm-neighbor Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Rick, watch where you're going man.\"  Zack said, moving out of the way of his muscle-bound-shirtless neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, Sorry!\" Rick laughed and continued lugging his trash down the stairs without slowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careless asshole...\" Zack muttered under his breath and walked back into his building. He decided to come back between classes to see if his Uncles surprise had arrived, having seen the Mail Man come in as he was going out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so preoccupied with thoughts of what the surprise package could be, that he hardly noticed as his foot came down on a discarded tootsie-roll wrapper. </span></div></div>",

As he tried to keep from getting squished beneath soda cans and other trash, he saw a pinpoint of light shining down from a tiny rip in the bag far out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried in frustration, realizing he could not possibly scale the distance to free himself from the plastic prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, MAN, YOU'RE LOSING SOME OF YOUR TRASH,\" Juan Carlos observed as a few bits of paper fell free of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick spun the bag. \"LET ME TAKE THIS DOWN TO THE DUMPSTER.

He raked his hands on the plastic \"floor\" beneath him, but he was far too small to rip through the thin layer of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick walked into the alley behind the dorm and, with a grunt, hoisted the bag into an almost overflowing dumpster. As the bag dropped into the garbage-strewn bin, the small rip tore wider, and half the contents escaped to mix with the other garbage bags, some of them also torn open, already present in the dumpster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man found himself lost in a world of debris, shifted in scale to gigantic proportions. A half-carton offered six oval-shaped chambers that had once packaged eggs. He crawled through them, and then plowed through the stale coffee grounds collected in a discarded filter. To his left, he saw an apple core resting on some rancid-smelling fast-food wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench got worse as he found himself in close contact with some truly loathsome items. Several plastic bottles and containers, along with paper debris,such as ripped envelopes and no-longer-need notes on pages torn from a spiral-bound notebook. A couple of aluminum cans, some that had once held beer, others sodas, loomed over him, as big as houses in their own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crusty walls of the dumpster rose steeply all around him. He could never in a million years scale them. He huddled at the entrance to a discarded soda can and cried. He had been tossed away with things of no value at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome college students left the dorm, and he heard their passage near the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" The little scientist screamed. \"In here!

That's where his plan for a big surprise had fallen disastrously apart, leading to his current predicament as he sat, trapped, within an enormous plastic garbage bag tossed into a monolithic dumpster behind his nephew's college dormitory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mood veered from despair at the unfairness of it all to wild hopes each time he heard the thunderous but fleeting voices of giants walking near the dumpster. On each occasion, he tortured himself screaming for help, knowing that his puny voice, swallowed up as it was by the enormity of the encrusted metal dumpster, would never be heard by the ears of any humans of normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irony, which ate at him, was that he hadn't even gotten to surprise his nephew. Zack's hulking friend, Rick, had been the literal hand of fate, tossing the tiny man out with the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight filtered dimly through the dark plastic, leaving him to explore his giant world in a gloomy twilight. The bug-sized man made his way carefully across the landscape. He detected a pungent odor that he could not quite place as he ran his hands over a smooth expanse of material, perhaps plastic. He continued following the length of the odd object. He walked onto it, finding the material felt odd beneath his feet. As he continued to travel across it, he felt his feet step into something congealed and squishy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shrunken man's perspective, it looked like he was standing inside a deflated hot air balloon. But he was still thinking with a mind attuned to the scale of the normal world. When he adjusted his thoughts for his new reality, all the clues clicked into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross,\" he said, trying to back out of the inside of the balloon-like item. Tiny Mr. Smith realized he had walked inside a used condom. His feet were standing in some titan's stale cum, the source of the pungent smell he had noticed earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, he heard a loud, mechanical beeping outside the dumpster, and froze in place to listen. A moment later, everything erupted in chaos as a giant sanitation vehicle backed to the receptacle to empty it. The motion pitched the tiny man deeper into the used condom, where he found himself trapped within its slimy walls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any second now his dream would come true and Zack would get the surprise of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tape no longer an obstacle, Zack peeled back the cardboard folds of the box and peeked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he expected a check or even cash (although his uncle was surely smart enough not to send paper bills through the mail) he was disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for a handkerchief, the box looked empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT GIVES?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \"roof\" of the box was pulled back, bright light flooded the dark interior of the box. Tiny Bryan's first glimpse of his nephew's mega-sized features was marred by having to squint and blink as his eyes adjusted to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Zack's confused voice and began to feel somewhat uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the box in one hand, Zack's attention got diverted by movement on the stained and cracked tiles on the bathroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT ANOTHER DISGUSTING BUG!\" The college student exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his foot, but the roach detected the danger and scurried into a pile of discarded clothing consisting of a pair of Zack's boxer-briefs and sweat socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the box, the tiny scientist heard his nephew's words and the tone of disgust. Climbing over a fold in the sprawling handkerchief, he tried to scream a warning. \"I'm not a bug, Zack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sprang to his feet and placed the package on a precarious perch on the edge of the bathroom sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer encumbered by the cardboard box, he reached for his discarded clothes. He shook them out and saw the roach drop back onto the tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't hesitate. \"Time to die, bug!\" Zack proclaimed. Still, the bug almost got away, but he managed to catch the insect with the toe of his sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squishy crunch brought a smile to the college student's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trapped inside the box, bug-sized Bryan heard his nephew's ominous words but could no longer see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack! Where are you?\" The shrunken scientist yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the box lurched violently and fell about three feet to the damp tiles under the porcelain sink basin attached to the bathroom wall. The impact with the floor ejected the tiny man from the comparative safety of the box at the worst possible moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my head,\" the shrunken man groaned. He had fallen hard on a wet tile. He gazed skyward and saw a rusty pipe rising from the floor and disappearing into the mildewed, crusty underside of the sink basin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the tile vibrate softly and then determined the source of the movement. Zack made two steps across the floor, his sneakers sending tremors through the cracked, loose floor tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his aching head, his tiny nephew scrambled to his feet. He needed to get back inside the box, but before he could even move in that direction Zack's enormous hand dropped down and plucked the container off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-oh!\" His shrunken uncle cried in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, having dealt with the roach, dropped his clothes back onto the floor at the same time he retrieved the package from his uncle that had fallen off the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside the box again, he still found it empty. He removed the handkerchief and gave it a good shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Zack, his tiny uncle witnessed his every action. The little man screamed again when his eyes saw something tiny and translucent tumble through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe precious vial of antidote clattered on the tiles and started rolling away from the tiny man's hiding place beneath the sink in his nephew's filthy bathroom. Although, miraculously, the glass container hadn't shattered, its momentum increased as it rolled away from the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror, he saw the reason the vial wasn't coming to rest. Cut into the middle of the tiles was a rusty drain to deal with excess water. His only means of restoring himself to normal size was seconds away from being lost in that drain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn obviously disappointed Zack expressed some loud curse words and questioned whether his uncle's special delivery had all been some huge joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan knew that to rescue the vial, which was spinning closer to the drain in the slight depression in the floor tiles, he would have to dash across an open expanse of floor. With no other choice, he darted forward. The vial was now rolling at a slower pace. Would it come to rest without falling into the drain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway to his goal, a patch of slick mildew on one of the tiles defeated the little man. He slipped and fell, sprawling belly-down on the hard surface. The fall hurt, but he didn't have the luxury of time to nurse a scrape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an anguished cry, he pushed on but even as he closed the gap, he saw he would be too late. The tiny glass container rolled onto the rusty metal grate spanning the drain. In an instant, the gleaming glass disappeared down the hole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man continued running onto the rusty grate himself. He was so small he could navigate the grill covering. He stretched out on his belly and peered into the dark drain. He could not see the bottom, and he also failed to see the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't fail to hear Zack's disgusted comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT ANOTHER DAMN BUG!\"</span></div></div>",

He took a seat on the cushion in one of the dorm's round futon chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is Zack,\" he said into the phone as he eased back into the low-flung chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got into the conversation, he lowered the package onto the floor in front of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the box, Bryan tried to determine what had halted his nephew's opening of the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man ran to one of the air holes that permitted him to peer outside. To his shock, he found himself staring at the broad canvas wall of one of his nephew's sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I doing on the floor?\" Bryan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Zack's voice, loud but muffled, speaking to someone on the phone. Zack's conversation was punctuated by bouts of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan sighed as he realized the conversation didn't seem to one of a quick nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept staring out the peephole, amazed at the size of Zack's shoe. With a shiver, he realized he could hardly wait to see his nephew's enormous body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to get together,\" Zack told the caller on his cell phone. Bryan could easily pick up his nephew's half of the phone conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll see you. Bye!\" Zack said in a cheerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it!\" Bryan told himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zack, excited by the phone call from a friend he hadn't heard from in awhile, forgot about the small package from his uncle. He snapped his cell phone closed and prepared to stand up before he slipped the phone back into his pocker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And with that, he took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnto the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he heard the crunch of the torn cardboard, Zack swore and quickly retrieved it from under his Adidas. Mindful of future incidences, he also slipped off his shoes and threw them into the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't break it,\" he said mournfully, as he looked at the misshapen parcel in his right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was practically buzzing with excitement. This was it! This was what he'd been preparing for for weeks. He took a deep breath, mentally steeling himself for his nepphew's humongous face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how much he steeled himself, Bryan wouldn't have prepared for a huge structure, more than 100 feet high and 300 feet long, to crash through the cieling of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handkerchief came down on him like the sky was falling, and he was immediately smothered in it for a moment before being thrown from it into a ruptured wall of the box. His back ached like hell after such a violent action. His head was spinning for clarity; he was trying to figure out what happened, but he was too winded to summon speech or thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zack hadn't even stepped down all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the entire tennis shoe collapsed down, the entire box gave way, splitting at the corners. And for an ironic moment, Bryan was thrown to the side again, and he saw the antidote lying just feet away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the shoe hit the bottom. The antidote was crushed completely; its liquid sunk into the carper, leaving a negligible stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was in awe. His nephew's shoe has missed him by only a couple of feet, at his size.  But to Zack, he would have only given his uncle an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, unexpectedly, Bryan began to cry. He felt so powerless and helpless, buried under tiny pieces of cardboard shrapnel, and fearing his nepphew's footwear. It was so outrageous, but so meaningful. Bryan realized he had no power. He was absolutely helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, what did he do once it arrived?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had left it on the floor, took a phone call and then stepped on the small parcel. \"Stupid, stupid, stupid!\" Zack chanted and slapped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing left to do now but open the nearly demolished package and hope for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked across the room toward his bed, not once looking down toward the floor where, if he had been exceptionally observant, he would have seen a tiny figure in desperate straits. He stepped over his sneakers, still on the floor where he had tossed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne huge socked foot landed mere inches from the tiny form, causing a concussion that impacted with incredible violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in less than a couple of minutes, his nephew's huge feet, without coming into direct contact with him, had caused tiny Bryan a world of pain.

Another building-sized shoe rested a short distance from the one that had interrupted Bryan's momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man tried to summon the strength to plant his legs beneath him again after the close call with Zack's enormous foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nephew, now seated on the colossal bed, held the damaged package in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack opened the package, not knowing his movements were being followed by his awestruck uncle trapped on the distant floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Zack said in obvious irritation. \"He made a big deal about mailing me a handkerchief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

One look, however, at those colossal feet outlined by the snug cotton socks, convinced him not to press his luck. Exposed, vulnerable, his brain wanted him to flee.

Bryan raced to the shoe. He still needed to clamber over the edge, but found some frayed ropes of fabric that he grabbed and used to hoist himself onto the bottom rim of the overturned sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stomped down, only inches from the sneaker, unleashing another blast of concussions. Bryan, hearing and feeling the footfalls from the monstrous feet of his nephew, dove deeper into the sneaker-cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as he ran, everything seemed to turn topsy-turvy, sending him airborne through the open space in the sneaker toward the toe region.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside, his shrunken uncle is tossed about and ended up on his back on the spongy surface of the bottom of the sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" Bryan grunted as he stopped rolling. He found himself on his back and staring up out of the interior of the massive sneaker. Everything happened so fast that he is not sure what happened!  Nothing is recognizable to the speck-sized man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he realized he is on a slightly spongy surface.  He looked for any light, but the only source is from directly above. With rising dismay, Bryan realized what had happened<br>\r\n\"The shoe is now upright!\" Bryan gasped.  In only a couple of seconds of staring far above at the entrance to the shoe he realized he is trapped!   <br>\r\nHis shelter has suddenly become a prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still looking around, his eyes focused on the tag on the tongue of the sneaker. \"I'm actually inside Zack's size 13 shoe!\" Bryan exclaimed.<br>\r\nThe numerals \"1\" and \"3\" look as big as his body. Even though the shoe is almost the size of a stadium to the tiny guy, he began to feel claustrophobic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of thunderous booms from outside the shoe alarms him. Zack must be moving around.  \"He will never see me in here,\" Bryan said looking around the dark confines of his nephew's shoe. \"I have to get out to get his attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He ran to one of the sides of the sneaker and searched for any kind of a way to climb out! Before he even reached the side, he can tell it's far too smooth.<br>\r\nHe is almost ready to stop running when he tripped and fell face down on the insole!  He detects a horrible  whiff of foot odor and felt  a slick stickiness all over his face and hands. Horrified, Bryan realized that he had just slipped because of Zack's sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically looking around as the heavy footfalls outside the shoe continue to rumble, Bryan is faced with the impossibility of escape.<br>\r\nWhile slowly accepting his imprisonment, he heard a voice both loud and frightening.<br>\r\nHis nephew is talking aloud, and he is still mighty pissed about the weird package. \"WHY THE HELL DID HE EVEN BOTHER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom deep inside the stadium-sized shoe, Bryan looked skyward and saw Zack framed by the outline of the shoe. \"He is so unbelievably huge!\" Bryan exclaimed.<br>\r\nBryan pushed up from the sweat-soaked insole.<br>\r\nThe booming voice caused the tiny man's legs to go weak as he stood inside the shoe. Zack doesn't sound very happy. As soon as he stopped talking, there is one more footfall and a shadow eclipsed the shoe.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking far up into the sky Bryan saw Zack!   He seems to be looking right at the shoe!   <br>\r\n\"Maybe he sees me!\" Bryan said aloud.  \"Zack!  Look down here!  In your shoe!\"<br>\r\nBryan yelled as loudly as he could manage and started waving his arms around hoping if his nephew can't hear him, he might be able to see him.<br>\r\nAll his efforts are in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAYBE HIS IDEA OF A JOKE!\" Zack said, still upset about the disappointing package from his uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan continued to gaze up. His screams are cut off when he gets a good look at his colossal nephew. The tiny man is left completely speechless. \"My God! He is just so incredible looking,\" Bryan said when he found again his power of speech.<br>\r\nHe is reminded of all his fantasies about being this small in the presence of a titanic man.</span></div></div>",

Although he knows it is only his nephew talking, Bryan can't help but feel awed. Zack looks and sounds so much more powerful than a simple human could ever appear!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized that he had stopped yelling as his nephew spoke words aloud to himself.  The tiny man found himself mesmerized by his nephew.  <br>\r\n\"Am I really in awe of my own nephew?\" Bryan whispered in the enormous confines of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact he can't seem to take his eyes off of him provided an answer to the question. Zack stands so far above the shoe, completely unaware of his imprisoned uncle. The college student is in such control of this whole situation and he doesn't even know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stepped out of view, but Bryan can hear \u2014 and even feel tremors \u2014 as the young man walked through his dorm room.<br>\r\nBryan heard some sort of random distance noises.<br>\r\nHe can no longer see Zack, but he does feel the tremors as they increase in intensity as Zack returns.<br>\r\nWhen Bryan caught another view of his nephew, Zack is now holding a towering beer can in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack moved out of Bryan's view, the tiny man could still feel him walking around the apartment again. This time, however,  hearing the massive thuds prompted Bryan to think of Zack again. He remembered how his nephew looked standing so high above him.  Bryan thought of all that weight crashing down with each step his giant nephew took. He recognized the power Zack had in just his feet.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious thoughts raced through the tiny man's mind as he heard and felt the powerful footsteps.<br>\r\n\"I'm in one of his shoes!\" Bryan thought, with  a quick glance around the interior of the shoe. \"His massive powerful foot would fill this entire cavernous space!\"<br>\r\nInstead of feeling scared, Bryan felt almost excited!    <br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me?\" Bryan wondered. \"This is a terribly dangerous situation to be in!\"<br>\r\nHe wondered why he did not feel more scared?   <br>\r\n\"That's what I should be feeling,\" Bryan said aloud.<br>\r\nYet, after some more noise and footfalls, a shadow fell over the shoe. He saw Zack filling his entire field of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also saw a towering can of something - probably beer, in his nephew's huge hand.    <br>\r\nBryan stood in silent awe as he stared up at his impressive nephew.<br>\r\nHe remembered the different times he shrunk in the lab before in the tests. He had always felt excited about it, but this.... \"This feels much different,\" Bryan said as he stared at his gigantic nephew.<br>\r\nZack tossed his head back. Bryan watched the progress of a river of beer as his nephew poured the contents of the huge can down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a person at this scale is something Bryan could never have imagined with such clarity.   He knew that he hadn't accurately known what to expect. He had definitely not imagined anything like this. Even though Zack's body stretched up and up to an incredible distance, Bryan could see him all quite clearly.   <br>\r\nHe continued to stare in silent awe.  He can't break away from his awe-struck staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan suddenly heard a massive hissing noise as the beer is opened. Zack moved the can to his lips and tilted it back.  But he doesn't actually put the can to his lips, so the beer flows out like a waterfall from the can down into his mouth.    <br>\r\nBryan watched what looked like Niagara Falls disappearing into Zack's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guttural gulps thundered down to Bryan in the shoe. They sounded almost erotic to his tiny ears. Zack's throat rippled as the flood poured down into his stomach.<br>\r\nThere is a loud masculine gulping noise from such a giant throat.<br>\r\nHe continued to gulp down lake after lake of beer.    <br>\r\nBryan began to imagine shooting those beer rapids.<br>\r\n\"That would be insane,\" he whispered with a dry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Bryan doesn't want to be swallowed alive, but he can't help picturing himself trapped in that flood of amber liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at all that beer rushing down from the can makes Bryan picture himself in that fast-flowing current. He pictured himself in a speedboat rushing against the current, having a blast.    <br>\r\nThat fantastic vision is followed by Bryan picturing himself  alone in the current, swimming, trying to keep ahead, but obviously having no luck against such a torrent.   <br>\r\nHe imagined himself flowing down the fall from the can into Zack's mouth. At that point, he panics after hearing a loud thunderous gulp. He is too weak to fight the surge of the liquid as he gets sucked down... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, what a thought!\" Bryan said as he forced himself to snap out of his daydream and wonder just what that futile fantasy was all about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard a jarring crunching sound and look skyward. Finished with his beer, his nephew crushed the huge can with very little effort.<br>\r\nThere is an explosive belch produced by his nephew after guzzling the beer so quickly.<br>\r\nSnapped out of the daydream by the loud crunching metal noise, Bryan looked up again and witnessed the empty beer can being crushed so effortlessly by Zack's enormous hand. He saw some of the muscles in his nephew's thick hand move as they crushed the can. He had trouble even trying to imagine the strength Zack must have in his hand, much less any of his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't have time to finish that thought when he is forced to cover his ears as a loud explosion of noise filled the room.  Again, even though it was amplified a thousand times, it took tiny Bryan a few seconds to realize it was just a belch from Zack.    <br>\r\nEvery little thing his enormous nephew does can be such a spectacle at Bryan's tiny size. The more he looked up at Zack, the less he seemed to be thinking of him as his nephew and more as some titan, or even a god...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, almost without Bryan's realization, all these powerful images have begun to arouse some very definite feelings within him as he continue to act like a voyeur within Zack's massive sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the knowledge that Zack has no awareness of him  only increases the immensity of the feeling of being overwhelmed in his presence. He steps out of view again, giving Bryan a chance to catch his breath as his heart races.</span></div></div>",

His mind is telling him that Zack's his nephew, and he needs to get out of the shoe to contact him to get himself big again.   <br>\r\nBut his own body is betraying him. It doesn't seem to want to move. Bryan can't seem to stop looking up at his titanic nephew. Even the smell of the inside of the shoe doesn't bother him any longer. He knows it should, but it doesn't. Bryan realized with a jolt of surprise that he feels like he is almost getting turned on!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can my body betray me like this? Bryan asks himself.  \"I'm a scientist!  My mind should be in control.\" As the shrunken man wrestled with these feelings, Zack stepped aside, and Bryan quickly moved within the shoe to try to get an angle to see him again. He sprinted across the sole of Zack's shoe just so he could keep watching him!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a sudden stop. \"What's happening to me?\" Bryan asked himself again. He noticed the spongy surface beneath his feet is damp and slightly squishy. \"Zack's feet must sweat profusely,\" Bryan said aloud as he started running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, not too far into his sprint, he slipped, almost falling. He remembered his last fall. The insole is totally drenched in foot sweat. Bryan can't believe how much sweat must come out of Zack's feet.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step he takes is accompanied by a slight squishy noise. Everything about the situation is affecting him.   His body seems to be loving it all. Subtle hints inform the tiny man that he is definitely getting turned on even though everything logical thought is telling him he I shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just when Bryan began to hope he might check his raging feelings,  Zack came into view, giving the tiny man another surprise. Zack has stripped down to his underwear and has also fetched another beer from the fridge. Bryan realized that Zack must have decided to stay put in the dorm for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Bryan's mind is beginning to lose control. His body and instinct seems to be winning out. Seeing the huge nearly naked body looming above him is too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore thuds announced Zack's has finally come back into view, and Bryan found himself surprisingly relieved. He desperately found himself wanting, even needing, to look up at his nephew's colossal form.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, Zack is only wearing his underwear, which is a pair of form-hugging briefs. Everything about him is now huge, even majestic. He is a perfect specimen, and it makes him appear even more godlike than ever before to his shrunken, unnoticed uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept of Zack as his nephew has been all but obliterated. To his shrunken uncle, he is Zack the titan or Zack the god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is getting totally turned on by this, and there's nothing logically he can think of to prevent it!   His brains have lost this battle! He totally surrendered  to his body's natural instincts. Bryan felt one hand move down and rub the front of his  pants as he continued to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, his hand began to move down to the front of his pants and began to rub an increasingly hard bulge.  He is engulfed by the smell of foot sweat and he has given up caring why it too now smells delicious to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's tight briefs outline his massive body in glaring detail. His colossal torso boasts wide ridges and curves from his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lowered himself down onto the insole and rested on his back on the wet squishy surface.  Sweat seeped into the rest of his clothes, but he just stared up at all the curves and ridges from Zack's body looming above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so perfect,\" Bryan muttered. People should be worshiping something like that, Bryan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In trying to see more of Zack's face, which  seems cut off mostly from the bulge from his underwear, Bryan found himself even more obsessed. He also noticed Zack's hidden bulge seemed larger than it was just a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization took Bryan's hand down as he began to undo his pants.<br>\r\nAt the same time, Zack finished off the second beer as his tiny uncle pulled down his pants, unable to cease feeling fascinated by that colossal bulge beneath Zack's tight briefs. Bryan realized that, by comparison, he would be so dwarfed it is almost impossible to imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stepped closer, now almost standing right next to the edge of the shoe holding him trapped. His new vantage point gave the tiny man a profile view of both Zack's front and back from this angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack finished off his second beer, Bryan heard the thunderous gulps from his  nephew's throat and finished removing his pants. He noticed that his hand is slick and he realized the slickness came from touching the wet sole of the shoe covered in Zack's foot sweat.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotally losing it, Bryan actually rolled on the sole to feel the sweat cover his whole body. As he stared up he noticed Zack moving again until his huge body ended up standing almost directly over the tiny man!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Bryan can notice is the pair of towering slightly hairy legs extending far far above before they enter Zack's enormous underwear, complete with a massive (beyond comparison) bulge at the front, and his butt at the other.<br>\r\nThe rest of the giant body, except for one arm, is hidden from view. The rest of Zack seems obscured past his underwear! Without even thinking, Bryan pushed his own underwear down below his  knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man is totally wet, although most of the dampness is not his own sweat but produced by Zack's great body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bryan is fully unclothed, he let his naked body sink back onto the soft squishy surface and stared up at this new god. At this point, Bryan has totally lost it.   The rest of his foot sweat soaked clothes are tossed off and he lowered himself back down onto the soft, squishy sweaty insole of this new god looming above him.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nWithout doing anything other than exist, Zack now totally dominated his shrunken uncle's entire universe\u2014 and the college student doesn't even know it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tilted his head to the side slightly so that he could still see Zack above him but also so he could reach the sole with his tongue. He stared up at the god and licked Zack's sweat from the sole of his shoe. So caught up in this new thrill, Bryan failed to notice Zack's face turned downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S THAT?\" Zack said after he saw something pale moving inside his sneaker. \"A FUCKING BUG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another lick, Bryan felt himself almost physically jolted by Zack talking again.  But, the tiny man is so euphoric that he missed the first few crucial words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pulled himself  back so he could see Zack looking right at him, or at least the giant's gaze seemed fixed inside the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's sluggish reactions hampered him until he heard with amazing clarity a single word \u2014 \"BUG!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill so incredibly turned on, the word doesn't seem to frighten Bryan as it probably should!  The tiny man stared up, like a deer startled in headlights, unable to move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN PEST!\" Zack muttered in an angry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan saw an enormous hand drop down from the heavens. The shoe is jolted as Zack picked it up and Bryan is sent rolling along the surface away from his tiny clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a couple of seconds have elapsed from the time he heard the word \"BUG\" to the time he saw a hand beyond all recognition descend on the shoe.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's eyes fastened on two titanic fingers lowered to grab the side of the shoe. Then his world is jolted as he experienced incredibly fast movement!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man is thrown across the insole and in an instant is so far from his clothes he can't even see them any longer. The shoe, held at an angle, sent Bryan rolling into a darker area \u2014 the toe area of the shoe. His clothes, however, are still in the heel area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the shoe is turned upside down!  Bryan, still in the toe area, is now thrown to underneath the enormous tongue of the shoe. In an instant, he can see something fluttering far off in the distance.  His clothes must be falling to the floor.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBryan heard another loud thud and the shoe is turned over again.  Zack said something again, but Bryan's ears are ringing from all the tossing and he doesn't hear his nephew's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack placed his shoe back on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the show, Bryan noticed a shadow appear over the opening\u2014 a shadow much darker than ever before. The little man found himself totally out of breath from all the tossing. He cannot scream when he saw something large entering the opening far down the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pushed his socked foot into the shoe. \"GUESS YOU CAN COPE WITH THAT, YOU LITTLE PEST.\"</span></div></div>",

He arrived just ahead of his nephew's massive toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last push, Zack settled his foot into the sneaker. He wasn't even really curious about the little bug.

Then something makes him wrinkle his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn overpoweringly masculine scent. He gagged \"Is that Me?\" He sniffed his arm and whipped his head away. \"Ugh...\" The smell was disgusting yet... for some reason he could feel his body become energetic, excited, maybe even a little turned on by the scent. Then he noticed something else, that smell was also in the air around him, not just emanating from him. Curious he rubbed his eyes to get a better look at his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHH\" He cried out, the salt of his nephew's foot that coated his hands burned his eyes, making sight impossible.

Something about this seemed so familiar. Something about this scent, this heat seemed so much like home..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no memory of falling into his nephew's shoe, of being toejam for the past 7 hours, or of being overcome by his nephews pheromones. Curiosity becoming lust as his brain was hacked by the sexual chemical messengers in the sweat. His idol, the giant foot drops down upon his body. Suddenly he is pinned below the ball of the giant foot. Bryan tries to think about what this rough, hot, humid thing was that fell atop of him, but his mind is clouded by lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his nephew pleasures himself the foot flexes and twists, pushing the professor around and rolling him like a toy. All the while the professor purrs from the touch. The foot lifts off of him and then drops back down, toes splaying overhead and then squeezing together, pulling a very tiny man between their grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan squirms against their grasp and this seems to awake his nephew from his masturbation. The sheet is tore away from his body and Zack instantly pulls his foot to himself, spreading his toes to get a good look at the thing between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought was \"Bug.\" But he had a smart head on his shoulders. Bugs didn't have two forelimbs and two hind limbs. It's coloration was interesting, Underneath some blue leg coloration and a white thorax its head.. the skin on its head matched the color of the skin of the foot it was squished against. Then it hit him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan!?\" Zack asked with eyes wide and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pulled himself to his feet and sat down on the inside of a toe, unable to stand after the rough play. He blinked his eyes clear of sweat and looked at his nephew. Sweat glistened over his nude body. His eyes watched him from giant curious, familiar face down his muscular sweaty chest to his... \"Oh my... god.\" He mumbles noticing the nine inch cock, which pointed at him, staring him down like some great serpent. Throbbing and bucking sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head he looks back up to Zack. \"Sorry.. I'm not used to being this small...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack chuckles and his cock bounces. \"Yeah I guess that probably looks pretty big compared to you.. how'd you get under my foot anyway uncle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan thought for a moment and then.. in a flash it all came back to him. The lust, the wet insole, the bare toes pressing down on him.. \"I was trying to get your attention... fell in your shoe. You put your shoe on and wore it. I got stuck between your toes and now I'm here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack raised his brow higher. \"So you were stuck to my foot for over 7 hours just stuck in my sweat like toe jam? I'm sorry Bryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shrugged. \"The important thing is you found me nephew.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack snickered \"I'm glad I found you too, toejam.

Giggling at the sensation he stands up and walks over to his desk. Before he opens it he looks down to make sure his uncle couldn't see. He gave his dick a few slow strokes as he milled through the desk with his other hand. He withdrew a small red-top tube filled with some liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved back to his bed and sat down, plucking his uncle from his toes. He sets his little uncle on his arch, the head of his dick hanging down almost touching him. Bryan backs away from the intimidating organ, panting as the throbbing thing moved a little closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny that you shrunk yourself because I've been working on something that grows molecular structures. I doubt it will grow you much but it should help you not look so much like a bug. It's normally meant for food but.. Oh well.\" Without asking his uncle's consent he leans forward to grab the vial and open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack leans down his hips lower as well and he unintentionally pins the little man between his foot and the head of his dick. His cock throbs viciously as he realizes instantly where his uncle was. Still it felt so good, him squirming under his cock, that Zack pretended to not notice. Instead he set the vial down and pressed his cock hard into his foot, ensureing his uncle couldn't escape. He shut his eyes and began to pump his cock. Pre began to leak from his slit, soaking his little uncle. Realizing he'd soon cum he fought with his own mind trying to stop himself but the power he had over his uncle, the squirming and thrashing under his cock.. he couldn't help it. It was just too exciting. The man panted, his back arching, his stroking becoming violent as he felt his balls tightest and cum shoot up his urethra. As it reached the tip of his dick he clenched, holding it in. 'he can't know I just jacked off to him being under my cock..' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing his dick he grabs his vial again and leans back, cracking it open. As he sits up normally, his dick lifts off the little man and instead is pointing at him like a gun, so close he can just barely feel his uncle against his slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay uncle I got it try this.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he caught his breath he was still excited, thinking about the little man stuck under his foot by sweat and cum. A part of him wanted to slide a sock on and trap him there. To keep him underfoot, it made him feel so powerful, like a god. He could do anything he wanted and the little creature could do nothing to stop him. Still this -was- his uncle and he promised he'd help, he needed to make sure his games didn't go too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and pulled his foot up, staring at the glob of cum and the tiny man squirming within it.

I didn't notice you were so close to my cock when I saw you there I got excited and... well you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis uncle seemed unamused but desperate to grow.. and forget that he'd been cummed on by his nephew. \"Can we just get on with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack squinted, he was lucky it was night and his house was dead silent or he'd never be able to hear his uncle. \"Yeah, hang on Bryan.\" He slid the lid of the vial off and picked his uncle up.

It needs a five minute contact time to work.\" The little man nodded, though didn't like that he was being restrained by a foot instead of a hand, though it made sense. His Nephew was using both his hands..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack withdrew a syringe and drew  up a small amount of the liquid. He squirted the liquid into a vaccu-tainer containing some sort of powder.

He can feel his uncle squirming between the balls of his feet. \"Don't try so hard.. you can't overpower these size 13's Uncle hehe.\" He mumbles to himself, his toes wiggling as he watches the clock.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack's large sweaty big toe was crushing the life out of you. When Zack shoved his socked foot into the shoe, you ended up right under his big toe. A big toe that happened to be sticking out of a hole in the grungy sock your nephew hadn't seemed to wash in at least a week. Every time he took a step, he pushed your body into the spongy sole of his old ratty sneakers, which fortunately for you was the only reason you are still alive. Unfortunately that insole was waterlogged with your nephews sweat which he was currently contributing even more gallons to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every step Zack took, his large toe smothered your body and face as he pushed you down into his insole. The sweat raising above your head, nearly drowning you before the pressure released on the next step of the other foot. In these split seconds where you gasped for air, you screamed, cried, and begged Zack to stop as the slippery hot skin on the underside of his big toe muffled your pathetic struggles for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack decided to walk to the bar. It was a muggy night, and he was sweating rivets. He felt sloshing in his shoes and he laughed to himself and said \"Trickle theory, it all has to go somewhere, lol\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar wasn't to far from his dorm and it was a relatively quick walk. He could't wait to get hammered and down a couple cool pints with some buddies. Let out some aggression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the torture continued, you barely clung to life. The steps continued on forever. The sweat increasing. You feared it would reach a point where you would just drown in a pool of Zack's sweat, as it traveled down his body, secreting from every nook and dark crevice on it's way down to his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack eventually reached the bar. He headed inside to see his buddies. He laughed with his jock buddies Rick and Juan. They all got extremely drunk and headed up back in Rick's dorm when they were told to leave by the bouncers at the bar. They came crashing into Rick's dorm, chucked their shoes off, grabbed more beers from the fridge. There night was just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Zack's Uncle experienced every foot fall, flex of the toe, and increasing level of sweat in the shoe of his inebriated nephew........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Zack, Rick, and Juan loudly crashed into Rick's dorm they grabbed some more beers and all sat in beanbags facing each other in the middle of the very dirty dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack ripped off his shoes and tossed them to the side against a wall. A steady stream of sweat trickled out on the floor as one sneaker laid out on it's side. As he laid back and crossed his ankles out in front of him Juan drunkenly said \"Dude you socks are freaking waterlogged with sweat. Ha ha. Those things are nasty, your big toe is like 'Hi!' sticking out of those rags\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack uncrossed his feet and brought each foot up towards himself as he peeled of the socks which had become plastered on as a second skin onto his feet. He unceremoniously threw them against the wall towards his shoes and they made sweat smacking noises as they hot the wall, stuck, and slowly peeled off before falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stretched his legs back out, crossed at the ankles, and wiggled his toes to air his slick wet feet out as he  said \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Juan laughed and gagged Rick spoke up \"Dude you think that's bad? Watch this!\" Rick slowly peeled off his large 14 size basketball high-tops slowly in exaggeration like a big unveiling as he revealed his large athletic sweaty barefeet and long toes. The smell was like a locker room in a shoe. Everyone laughed and gagged. Rick said \"I don't even bother wearing socks anymore because I just sweat through them in Lacrosse practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan slipped of his flip flops, chucked them drunkenly behind his head and planted his feet in the middle too as he said \"Might as well add my foot funk into this too\" the latin soccer jock kicked back and stretched his dirty sweaty feet out into the middle with the rest of the groups. Three pairs of sweaty feet. Three drunk jocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all faced each other. Legs stretched out ankle over ankle. Kicked back in beanbag chairs getting drunker by the minute as their feet aired out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you saw light and smelt relatively fresher air. The last couple of hours were hellish. You didn't think you were going to make it. All of a sudden you saw Zack as he pulled his shoes off. You were plastered to the bottom of his big toe sticking out of a hole in his sock. You couldn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden things whooshed by as you found yourself crossed over Zack's other socked foot. The things were literally dripping in sweat. You screamed your head off and as you pulled against the skin of his toe, your body unmoved and glued by a mixture of sweat and toejam. You finally looked around and saw that you were in the middle of a circle giants. Extremely large handsome giants. Extremely drunk looking giants. All of a sudden you noticed the largest pair of high tops you have seen as you looked at their soles facing you. Covered in unfortunate bugs unlucky enough to fall under their tread. These things were massive. The giant who they were connected to even larger, a wall of muscle by even normal standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed a giants second pair of feet. These strong looking tan feet belonged to a latin looking jock. His large feet straining against the confines of the straps on his thong flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the large latin giant pointed right at you and spoke. Were you finally discovered? Freedom at last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderous in volume. You managed to make out that he was talking about Zack's disgusting socks. <br>\r\nAll of a sudden you were rushed towards Zack's face as his giant hands came over you. Suddenly the sock started to peel off. The squelching sounds and tearing sounds made as the fabric was peeled off of his slick soles were forever haunt you, but not as much as the entire sweat ridden sock passed over your form on Zack's. The fabric sliding in it's almost congealed footsweat, sliding over your body, and essentially water boarding you until finally Zack's big toe popped of out the hole and his foot was freed. You were still stuck to his big toe after all that?! If that didn't shake you lose, nothing by any means allotted to you would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack rested his big feet back out towards the center of the group, resting his feet ankle over ankle. Stretching his toes and curling them as the sweaty appendages battered you. You had a nice view of his gleaming sole below you form your vantage point. A large expanse of glistening flesh, the fumes airing out towards your direction. Gagging you cried. Will this nightmare ever be over. All of a sudden you heared Zack's humerous loud sigh as his voice roared \"That better\" to your tiny ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the large jock with huge shoes started to talk, and then reached his ginormous hands to slowly pull off his large shoes off of his huge broad bare feet. You couldn't understand all of what the deep voiced giant was saying but the cocky tone was apparent and you could make out he was proud of what he was unleashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant pulled out his giant bare feet out each shoe. You saw the long muscular foot with equally longer athletic toes be unveiled in horrifying detail from a front seat view. The heat of his feet washed over you as he too crossed his ankles over each other. His long arched soles facing you; you could almost make out your terrified expression in the reflection of his wet muscular soles. His toes started to flex and dance under the light from above as this giants large toes slammed against each other with a sound akin to whales slapping each other in midair. This titans feet were so large even by normal standards that they towered above Zack's and you plastered to his big toe. You screamed as the smell hit you. It was like a locker room full to the ceiling of used jocks and socks left out in the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to add insult to injury another pair of feet joined the fray as the latino jock chucked his flip flops off and rested his large tanned soles facing you. The smell. To be expected. You got a horrifying view of the grime and seat congealed on the soles after wearing rubber thongs at a bar all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped on the barefoot of your drunk nephew, surrounded by jocks and their feet in a circle of hellish foot funk. As you screamed against the bonds of your suffering suddenly Rick's huge as zoned in on you in disgust as he thunders \"Dude Zack you got a bug on your big toe\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the foot you were stuck to moves at lightspeed until Zack's big drunk eyes glare at you as he holds his foot near his face for inspection. Smirking Zach.....</span></div></div>",

It was sent flying to the base of the wall, making a high pitched scraping noise as it slid across the dust on the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops\" grunted Zack as he followed the box's movement with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached down to pick it up he felt his stomach grumble. He suddenly remembered he had skipped lunch for some last-minute cramming for his chemistry test that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should start studying at night!\" he said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he tossed the package onto his desk and took a step towards his mini-fridge to see what he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wasn't at all prepared for what happened next. An earthquake jarred through the package and Bryan was momentarily deafened by the symphony of screeches that followed. Not that he focused on those as he was sent flying across the package. Luckily he landed on the handkerchief, but his body still throbbed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOPS\" He heard right before the box lurched upwards violently. Bryan screamed uncontrollably as everything in the box, himself included, seemed to hover for a moment. Then it all crashed downward as the box landed. Bryan's tiny form simply couldn't take this trauma and he passed out, seeing stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighed. All that was in the fridge were some cans of pop and a jar of French onion chip dip. Disappointed, he slammed the door shut. He decided to head to the Union Building, he could probably pick up a sandwich and some chips. As he slipped on his shoes, Zack glanced at the box sitting on his desk and decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

His stomach could wait, besides he was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down at his desk and picked up the box. Again he was surprised by how light it was. He shook it a bit but that didn't clear anything up. His stomach growled louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. I just need to open it already,\" he muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed a whole in the top. Without thinking about accidentally damaging what was inside, Zack roughly cut across the top of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally opened the box Zack was confused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" he said in disbelief. \"Is this a joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned it upside down. A single handkerchief gently floated to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan didn't awake as his nephew jostled the box. As light streamed in from a hole above, he remained unconscious. The thundering voice of disappointment also failed to rouse him out of his trauma-induced slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when the world flipped upside down, it was enough to jar him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had passed out in a storm of movement. And now he awoke falling rapidly. He screamed as the he, handkerchief, and the crumbs all plummeted to the surface below. He landed in the fabric and grunted as he rolled roughly onto the desk. He sputtered in pain and shock as he lay still trying to recover from this horrible ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack\u2019s annoyance quickly dissipated. His uncle wouldn\u2019t play a stupid prank on him. Okay he would, but not like this. Maybe he had forgotten to pack whatever he wanted to send.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shrugged and stood up. He was hungry and didn\u2019t feel like dealing with this now. He dropped the box onto his desk next to the handkerchief and walked out the door. He decided he would call his uncle the next day to clear up the confusion.</span></div></div>",

The tiny scientist, sprawled without any decorum or dignity on the wide handkerchief, tried to pull himself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't even notice me!\" Tiny Bryan realized as his confidence ebbed with each passing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, his madcap scheme began to lose some of its appeal as the quarter-inch tall man forced himself to stand, despite the pain. He groaned as he took a few steps on the uneven linen landscape represented by the handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him rose his nephew's desktop computer, complete with a massive keyboard, huge mouse and a towering monitor. Other items littering the vast plain of Zack's desk included a stack of books, pencils the size of redwood logs and a plastic T-Rex that loomed over the shrunken man like the real dinoaur brought back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the tiny man saw something that offered a glimmer of encouragement. The box remained on the desk as well, although the container looked in rough shape after Zack's less than elegant manner of opening the shipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, although he had failed to locate it during the bumpy journey to Zack, the vial of antidote remained inside the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can find it,\" the tiny man said in a shaky voice, \"I can prevent this situation from spiraling out of control.\"</span></div></div>",

But his stomach was telling him what was more important. Zack walked out the door, his thoughts focused on ham or turkey\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned twenty minutes later. It had been so tempting to just eat at the building. But he was still really curious about his uncle\u2019s package. Also it was pretty loud there and his dorm was much more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the container holding his sandwich and chips next to the box. He retrieved the chip dip, popped it open and sat down at the desk. He dipped a chip and popped it onto his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u201d he groaned. French onion was by far his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the box and was again surprised by how light it was. A gentle shake revealed nothing of its contents to him. Zack finally reached for a pair of scissors and he recklessly began to slice the top of the box open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan remained unconscious while his nephew was gone.

His head throbbed and every part of his body ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay still trying to gather his thoughts. He remembered his world being shaken to its core instead of being gently found by his nephew as planned. And he had passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan glanced about without moving. It looked he was still in the box. In his condition that was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the box trembled again Bryan let out an automatic shriek of fear. As the world jostled around he worried for his safety. And he hoped desperately he would finally be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack put the scissors down and pulled open the box.

He looks up to see the handkerchief covering the round container he found himself in. It lifts away and he can see his nephew's massive face staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas Zack realized his mistake and found me? Bryan wondered. His answer was quickly received when a chip appeared and scooped out some dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Bryan shouted in disbelief. He watched Zack\u2019s tongue slip out of his mouth to claim the chip. Reality hit him like a ton of bricks as the crunches from Zack\u2019s mouth reached Bryan\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had fallen into the chip dip, and his nephew was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack followed the falling handkerchief with his eyes as it settled onto his jar of chip dip. Seeing nothing else he tossed the piece of cloth to the floor. He pulled another chip out of his bag, dipped it and popped it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would Uncle B send me a handkerchief? he wondered silently. He put the box down and reached for the sandwich. Lifting it to his face he took a huge bite without glancing at the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he made a mistake and didn\u2019t send it. Or maybe this was a weird prank considered Zack. Neither theory sounded very convincing but he could think of no other possibilities. He decided to call his uncle to figure this out. Well he would in a sec, he wanted to eat a little bit first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan searched for an escape. But the walls towered high above. Not that he could reach them; he couldn\u2019t seem to propel himself through the dip even in the slightest. He looked up at his nephew again. Zack\u2019s attention seemed to have gone from the box to his sandwich. Bryan stared awestruck as his nephew took a hillsized bite. It disappeared into his mouth effortlessly. He didn\u2019t want to meet the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZACK!!\u201d he screamed, waving his arms above his head. \u201cI\u2019M RIGHT HERE! JUST LOOK DOWN!\u201d Zack didn\u2019t seem to notice anything awry. But then he glanced at the dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d shouted Bryan. And a chip appeared, it shoveled its way through some dip, rose above and quickly disappeared into Zack\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d shouted Bryan, furious over being overlooked. And so he watched Zack continue to devour his sandwich and chips. The whole time he struggled to gain his massive nephew\u2019s attention, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack popped the last bite of the first half of the sandwich into his mouth and reached for his phone. He flipped it open and sped dial his Uncle\u2019s house. As it rang he dipped a chip and brought it to his mouth. His mouth widened to eat it but he stopped when he heard the answering machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it beeped he left a message. \u201cHey Uncle B. I got your package but I\u2019m kinda confused. Call me back ok? Bye.\u201d And he hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Uncle B, what the fuck are you doing? Don\u2019t send me some weird ass gift again.\u201d He grumbled. With that he brought the chip into his mouth. As he chewed he reached for the other half of his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was letting his voice rest as Zack pulled out his phone. After putting it to his ear Zack\u2019s arm reached for something Bryan couldn\u2019t see. He cried out as a large chip appeared. It bore down right towards where Bryan floated. He struggled to move and started screaming in terror, but nothing he did made a difference. So his gigantic nephew scooped him up with a mound of dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZACK, HELP ME!\u201d Bryan screamed as he flew upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowed in front of the lips. He gasped in horror as they parted. His nephew opened his mouth and for a moment Bryan saw his nephew\u2019s teeth glint in the light. He was so close he could see the plaque at the gum line of his nephew\u2019s perfectly straight teeth (courtesy of braces paid for by Bryan). But then the mouth shut and the chip was pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked up hopefully. \u201cYES! RIGHT HERE!\u201d he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deafening gale tore past him as Zach spoke. Bryan coughed from Zack\u2019s bad breath, it was truly awful this close up! He was too close to discern the words, and was still coughing as the chip was pulled further from Zack\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears rang from his nephew\u2019s words. But through his pain he still picked up \u201cDAMN IT UNCLE B, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? DON\u201dT SEND ME SOME WEIRD ASS GIFT AGAIN!\u201d Bryan felt a pang of hurt. He thought Zack liked the little things he sent him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he wasn\u2019t given time to linger on this as the chip lurched forward. Bryan screamed as Zack\u2019s mouth opened yet again. In the moment before he entered the mouth he clearly saw the mounds of soggy bread, lettuce, cheese, and ham spread across the outstretched tongue. And worst of all he saw the black hole at the back of his nephew\u2019s throat leading to oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO ZACK, DON\u2019T EAT ME!\u201d begs Bryan as the chip drops to the tongue. He gags on the humidity and stench of the air inside his nephew\u2019s mouth. Zack\u2019s breath may have been bad before, but now it was ten times worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pays no heed to his unnoticed uncle on his snack and begins to chew. Bryan is jarred as one side of the chip is crushed. After a few swift movements of the jaw destroys the chip, Bryan drops to the tongue, landing in a pile of dip as his nephew continues to chew. Covered in soggy chip dip, Bryan is ironically overjoyed to have something to keep him relatively still. Zack stops chewing suddenly and Bryan braces for the food to be swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack lifts his sandwich to his mouth. Without bothering to swallow the chip he takes a bite of the sandwich. As he chews he struggles to understand his uncle\u2019s intention with the package. Unable to think of anything he turns his TV on and starts to channel surf. He automatically swallows his food and again lifts his sandwich to his lips for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is surprised to see the mouth opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZACK!\u201d repeats Bryan, trying one last time to get his nephew\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets a good look around his nephew\u2019s mouth. Chewed piles of chips stick to the sides of the mouth and are spread across the tongue in clumps. Massive amounts are jammed into the molars and hang from above suspended by strands of saliva. Before Bryan can even shudder at his surroundings he is greeted by an incoming sandwich. The mouth widens as Zack takes a bite of his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan feels something in him break. He can\u2019t fight anymore, it\u2019s too late. It had been too late for awhile, he had just refused to believe it. As his nephew starts to chew Bryan is rained on by bits of food but luckily never lands between the gnashing molars. He is tossed about violently, struggling to process his impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack finishes chewing and moves the mixture of chip, dip, and sandwich to the back of his mouth. With a loud gulp Bryan disappears down his nephew\u2019s throat with the food. As Bryan sinks deeper into his nephew he feels his temper rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could my nephew eat me?!\u201d he shouts. But he realizes the fault doesn\u2019t lie with Zack, but rather himself. This only makes him angrier. Fuming, he and the sandwich are squeezed into the stomach, landing on top of the growing mound of masticated food in Zack\u2019s stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could I be so stupid?!\u201d Bryan yells. \u201cWhy would I do this? Why couldn\u2019t I visit Zack on a plane like a normal uncle? No wonder he thinks my gifts are stupid, I over think everything!\u201d he shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his pause he hears a gulp from above. Bryan gasps and tries to move but finds he is held fast by the soggy food. He stares up in dread as his nephew\u2019s next bite approaches. It appears at the valve above and is slowly squeezed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan throws his hands up in a futile attempt to protect himself as the food crushes him into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack continues to mindlessly eat his sandwich and chips as he tries to find a TV show to entertain him. The last bite of sandwich disappears past his lips and he works on finishing his chips. The moment the food is in his mouth, Zack has already forgotten about it. He chews based on habit and swallows. He doesn\u2019t give an ounce of thought to the food as it sinks deep into his body. He rests his hand on hisstomach, unaware that it is mere inches from his eaten food and uncle who sit awaiting digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dozes off in his chair, the gurgles and groans of his stomach soothing him deeper to sleep. He dreams happily of beach babes and bonfires in the summer. On the other hand the inside if his stomach is a storm of churning acids, tearing his meal apart. When he awakes the next morning Zack gets ready for class like he always does. He grabs a quick breakfast on the way, his gut already empty and demanding more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack continues to call his uncle and is horrified to hear he has gone missing at the end of the week. Zack sits down in shock and picks up the mysterious box he had saved for a week. He feels horrible that the last thing he thought of his uncle was how stupid the gifts he sent were. But he knows that his uncle couldn\u2019t have heard that so it was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at the box for some clue, never noticing the microscopic vial that falls to his desk. He munches on some chips as he thinks. He doesn\u2019t realize the similarity of the moment and it passes. He puts the box down and sighs unhappily. All he can do is pray his uncle returns. With that thought in his mind Zack smiles hopefully and pops another chip into his mouth.</span></div></div>",

Even as his brain raced to think of a way out, stomach acids began to seep into the sludge to reduce the meal to its basic nutrients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack decided to take a nap since he didn't have to meet his friends for a couple of hours. He spread out on the small futon in the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned and rubbed a hand over his stomach. \"That was a good sandwich,\" he said aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he had no clue that his sandwich had contained an actual passenger, now just a measly portion of a meal being quickly digested in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought that he should call his uncle and question him about the weird package. \"Why would he have sent me an empty box?\" Zack wondered as he grew drowsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his stomach, after a flurry of panic, his tiny uncle also grew sluggish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, waking refreshed from a nice nap, Zack visited the bathroom and then left to pick up his friend. He already felt hungry, and wondered if he should pick up something else to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, he made the call to his uncle, which went straight to voice mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Uncle Bryan,\" Zack said in a cheerful voice. \"Got your package. Was it supposed to be some kind of joke? Anyway, I don't get it, but you can call me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled. As he slipped behind the wheel of the Acura his uncle had purchased for him, he belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess some of that sandwich was still with me,\" he said with a laugh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His search was constantly impeded as the box randomly lurched and was jostled about.  Suddenly, the shrunken scientist was unnerved by a bizarre clicking noise, evidently from some sort of postal machinery.  And then, due to the smooth motion, he guessed the box had been placed on a conveyor belt.  Bryan had never really thought about all the intricacies that got a package from point a to point b, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching half the night, Bryan had no luck in finding the vial that could restore him to normal size.  He found one of the enormous bread crumbs and bit off some of the stale, tasteless food.  Bryan then realized, due to the haste of this plan, he had also forgot to pack some water for the trip.  Demoralized, the meager man laid back and fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was awakened later by a thunderous roar.  Strong vibrations shook the small box.  He guessed that his package was being placed on an airplane.  Bryan wrapped himself in the soft handkerchief the best he could, and tried to get some more shut eye.

As the giant stretched out his hand to pick up the box, the tiny man knew he might be in for big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the box in one hand, Johnny read the mailing label. He shrugged and lifted the box near his ear and gave it a terrific shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the box, even nestled in the soft confines of the handkerchief, the little man was unprepared for the whiplash violence from the curious giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing any tell-tale rattles or other clues, Johnny grew bored and dropped the box into the seat of Zack's chair. For the tiny man, the box landed upside-down, making his disorientation even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crawled through the cloth folds in the handkerchief, the tiny man was simply relieved to be out of Johnny's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Zack returned. Entering the dorm, he found his roommate had arrived ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny, now sprawled on his bed, gave Zack a friendly nod. \"Not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pulled out his desk chair, so eager to open the delivery from his uncle that he didn't notice that the box had been moved from his desk into the seat of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny saw the impending disaster, but his interest in always setting up his friends for pranks and jokes kept him quiet as Zack planted himself into the chair.</span></div></div>",

He pulled off his back pack and tossed it on a dresser.  Reaching into a small fridge, Zack pulled out an ice cold Heineken.  He had gotten the taste for this expensive beer from his Uncle.  He glanced over at his desk.  \u201cWell, I wonder what ya got me Uncle B.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack!\u201d Bryan screamed at the top of his lungs as he watched his enormous nephew enter the room.  \u201cGet me the fuck out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe site of his nephew filled tiny Bryan with exhilaration.  As soon as Zack opened the box, he would be safe in the hands of his giant nephew, whom he trusted completely.  Although, Bryan was a little anxious as he thought of what it might be like if Zack actually held him in one of his gigantic hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist\u2019s imagination ran wild as he contemplated first contact with a giant.  In the pit of his stomach, Bryan felt like he was on the starting incline of some terrifying roller coaster.  Then, Zack turned and looked at the box, and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack took the small box in his hands and sat down next to his desk, totally unaware of the fragile contents.  He carefully examined the box, contemplating what was inside.  Zack flipped the box over a couple times, and then gave it a gentle shake.  He loved surprises, and his Uncle had hooked him up with some doozies in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I bet its Superbowl tickets,\u201d Zack exclaimed with enthusiasm.  \u201cI mean, the box\u2019s light as a feather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, careful Zack,\u201d Bryan yelled as he tumbled backwards and slid to the other side of the box when his nephew picked it up.  When Zack flipped the box over, Bryan plunged to the roof of the box\u2014then suddenly fell back to the bottom.  \u201cNooooh.  Zack\u2026Stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his nephew had no clue the stressful situation his was putting his uncle through.  He was just having fun trying to guess what surprise the box held.  He held it a couple more minutes as he took a few gulps of his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not see his nephew, who he decided must still have the box in his hand, but he got a good look at Drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big college dude leaned forward and took a close look at the box in Zack\u2019s hand. He saw the mistake on the label. \u201cDUDE, YOU\u2019RE LUCKY YOU EVEN GOT THIS.

By the time he returned, he could open the package in privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package, staring out a peephole at the two giant college students, Bryan could not get over how awesome and mighty they appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he also felt incredibly frustrated. \u201cCome on!\u201d Bryan yelled uselessly. \u201cLet me out of here!

His roommate appeared reluctant in opening the box in his presence, which to a regular person would signal that it is none of their business, but made Drew all the more curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack knew his roommate was a card, and much to his annoyance, Drew was always finding new ways to joke around and irritate Zack. Otherwise, the two got along wonderfully, Drew being a basketball enthusiast like Zack, and them both liking the same films and music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward in the chair, the college guy glanced around and listened. With a perfectly innocent expression, Drew stood up and stepped over to the bed. With a last cautionary glance, the guy snatched the package and looked at it in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat interesting bit of contraband might be inside? Drew's mischievous mind couldn't wait any longer, and without a seconds delay, he easily tore the box open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Zack!\" Tiny Bryan complained at the sight of his oblivious nephew leaving the room. How much longer would he have to stay in this blasted box? With an impatient sigh, he turned his little gaze to the giant roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in a desk chair, the colossal Drew casually tapped away on his cellphone. The youth looked about the same height as his nephew, with had medium length brown hair, and a fairly muscular build. He was dressed in a striped sweater, jeans, and a well-worn pair of blue and white Nike sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little scientist couldn't tale his eyes off the roommate, imaging just how huge the young guy was. Bryan also noticed how the youth kept glancing in his direction. He wondered if the big guy sensed his staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith surprising speed, the titanic Drew suddenly rose up and stomped towards to bed. The box trembled from the heavy steps, and without warning the tiny man flew back as the giant picked up the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" He squeaked, as his body did a somersault into the handkerchief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded the spacious interior of the box. Bryan scrambled out of the fabric desperately, and looked up at the impressive sight above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?\" Thundered an incredibly deep and loud voice. Looming above him was the planet-sized visage of Drew. His huge brow furrowed at the strange contents of the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock and awe overtook the bug-sized Bryan, as he hawked up at the impossibly huge face. The ground lurched nice more as a colossal hand with building-like fingers snatched the handkerchief, roughly pulling it from the box, sending the tiny man's provisions flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing! You idiot!\" He screamed indignantly as he pulled himself up. Bryan didn't trust this young giant, but he needed to stop this careless treatment before he was injured by the colossal brute. Jumping with waving arms, Bryan succeeded in getting attention, seeing the huge eyes look back down and lock onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A FUCKING BUG? GROSS.\" Drew's huge voice stated with animosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No, I-...\" His cry was cut off as the humongous box up-ended, sending him into a violent free fall. His little wailing screams didn't even reach Drew's lofty ears as the titan turned the box over, dumping what he thought was a bug out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis minute form crashed into a thick, coarse material after falling for what seemed like a lifetime. Digging his tiny fingers into it, the shrunken scientist hung on. A quick look down gave made his stomach turn as he realized he was hanging on to Drew's gigantic pant leg. Far below, Drew's massive right sneaker rested, pressing firmly into the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt of disgust, mixed with disappointment was the reaction Drew had upon opening Zack's box. The strange napkin hid a tiny little insect underneath, which Drew promptly dumped out of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, where did it go?\" He muttered, looking at the floor before his feet. He had planned on stomping it quickly, not thinking it could fly away or something, and unaware that the \"bug\" might not even make it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, Drew stuffed the useless napkin back into the torn box, and dropped it back on Zack's bed. What a disappointment, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow bored, Drew prepared to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan dug them in once more, attempting with all his might to keep his grip upon the enormous denim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! No, no, no, NO!\" The shrunken scientist squealed as he looked down once more. \"Dear fucking God, NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVertigo made his entire body shake badly, his fingers threatening to slip through the thick threading once again. The astronomical distance down to the floor was positively daunting. He must easily be many hundred of feet in the air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew's deep, powerful voice thundered high above him. The words seemed to reverberate through the giant's body, rattling Bryan's teeny form. Shifting movements came shortly after, causing Bryan to shriek in terror as he prepared for the worse. The giant was going to take a step!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron! How could you be so damn careless! Help me, rig-...\" The tiny man's insults were instantly absorbed by the huge mountain of denim and space around him. Looking up the dauntingly tall expanse of Drew's body--he couldn't even see the young student's face from his perspective. Like the movement of a mighty glacier, the denim landmass began shifting as Drew prepared to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt his body swing into open air, held only by his weak grip. Far below the gigantic sneaker--tattered and dingy with dirt and wear--began to lift off the carpeted floor. The view Bryan had made the experience all the move dangerous and frightening; watching some so powerful and so enormous move was surreal. He was swung roughly, his throat rasping from the cries and screams for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneaker slammed down again, buffeting the ground thunderously and sending a shockwave of force through the behemoth's body. All this was of course inconsequential to Drew, who had no inkling of the power and size he presented as he simply cross the dorm room. Bryan, on the other hand, was flung forward then backward to crash into the strong wall of denim. He felt his arms near tear from socket as he held on desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take anymore of this... My fucking arms are gonna fall off, dammit!\" He cried out with rasping dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to his plight, Drew kept his gaze fixated before him and continued his procession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized man was lightly rattled watching the other foot lift, swing forward a great distance and crash into the ground heavily. Bryan knew what was coming. It seemed to make it worse when the sheer cliff of material shifted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the monumental shelf of denim he hung onto shifted at an angle, sloping his arms. <i>Crrrruuuuunch!</i> The left shoulder cracked out of socket from the stress, sending a tremendous amount of pain through Bryan's little body. He instantly lost his grip and tumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, he fell.... and fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-...!\" Air buffeted past him, throwing his frail, injured form around. \"-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was given little image of where he was falling. Everything was a blur, his head spinning and his stomach threatening to purge itself. He suddenly made contact. Slamming hard into a surface before falling a short distance again, then crashing into the fibrous ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny genius groaned. Among the flashing thoughts in his mind was the fact that he was still alive: evidenced by the incredible shoots of pain he felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground trembled fiercely with a heavy sound. Bryan clutched his injured arm and rolled over, struggling through the cacophony of thick carpeting around him. Right beside him a large expanse of the thick carpet had been compacted by some tremendous force, slowly retaking shape. All feeling of pain and misfortune left him when he took sight of the source. Only a step away to somebody of regular size, but translating to what seemed like a whole mile to Bryan, stood Zack's gargantuan-- and dangerously oblivious--roommate Drew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lay in the tangle of large fibers in a transfixed state of awe. His initial impression of the big guy from the safety of his box had been one of idle curiosity and fantasy; that view didn't do the college student any justice. He was gigantic, if not absolutely ginormous. The sheer magnitude of his size was more than daunting to look upon. Drew currently faced away from Bryan, paused before the desk opposite Zack's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had nearly forgotten his disastrous encounter as he greedily took in the behemoth roommate's form. His head was covered by a woven hat, allowing some of his shaggy brown hair to be seen over the sweaters collar. He shifted, wholly unaware of the tiny set of eyes watching him. Bryan looked over the giant's broad shoulders, past his waist, over the enormity of his loose jeans and to the titanic footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable...\" Bryan whispered, staring intently. He had never interacted with humans before while shrunken. Despite the misgivings of all that had happened, Bryan was enthralled by this encounter. His nephew's roommate barely felt like a fellow human being to Bryan. Instead, he appeared like some vastly superior (not in intellect, of course!) being--completely unaware of the raw power and danger he posed to smaller beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe severity of his situation had yet to sink in, and Bryan only realized it too late. Drew lumbered into motion again, finished with his task on the desk, he turned around. His large feet shifting and slamming heavily into the carpet, sending shaking tremors through the dorm room floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueaking, Bryan's mind clicked back into reality just as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew Zack would throw any of it away if he left it out, so Drew was in the habit of keeping it in his desk, or backpack. The ragged black and brown backpack was slumped against the side of his bed, next to an equally trashed skateboard. Nearly everything he owned was scuffed up in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew side-stepped and snatched his pack up, plopping it heavily on his own bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... What did I do with them?\" He grunted in annoyance. An overall good student and chill guy, Drew still found himself mentally lacking at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a hamburger wrapper out, he tossed it towards the trash when he happened to glance down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are ya little fucker!\" Drew said lightly with a smirk when he spied tiny movements on the floor. \"Don't even think about tryin' to fly away this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny speck seemed to halt movements, as if in reaction to his statements. Drew knew better. Bugs were just stupid creatures, only capable of hiding and fucking stuff up. It began scurrying towards Zack's bed at a slow pace. One large step caught him up with it and he positioned his feet on either side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoulda stayed outside, bug,\" He stated with a flat tone, completely forgetting that this bug had been intended for his roommate. \"Meet my size fucking thirteen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he lifted a grungy Nike skate shoe over the bug and stomped down. Drew could never hope to imagine the small insect's feelings, never for a moment thinking it was anything but a common pest. That his lovable and goofy demeanor was unappreciated by the bug who saw him much differently; impossibly gigantic, cruel, and uncaring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, Drew stepped back and resumed his backpack digging. Any thought of the bug washed away when he discovered his prize: tattered paper rolls for rolling his smokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, fuck yes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling back into the desk chair, he prepared the smokes and propped his feet on the desk. Drew started some tunes going from his phone and relaxed. It wasn't until his smoke was reduced to a stub that his roommate returned. Zack entered, began shrugging his backpack off when he sniffed the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dumbass, what the hell are you doing?\" Zack snapped at his stoned roommate. \"I told you not to smoke that crap in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew shrugged in response, his attention directed to his phone. Zack approached, looking over at his bed quickly he did a double-take. The packed lay on its side, flaps open and handkerchief on the floor. \"Seriously? You opened my mail! Shit, dude, what is wrong with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what'dya freaking out for? It was a joke, man! There was nothing but a shitty towel and a bug inside,\" He explained to Zack. \"I did you a favour. Stomped the tiny bastard before it escaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack glowered at his roommate, glancing momentarily at the propped sneakers that faced him. The soles were filthy. The Nike \"swoosh\" was barely visible among the worn coloured tread, packed with dirt, grime, and if he looked closer, various bugs and a smashed spider from earlier that day. If Zack had also looked closer, perhaps with a magnifier, he may of noticed the very tiny splotch of crushed minutely-sized gore and bones near what looked to be the torn top half of a human torso pressed into clods of grime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went completely unnoticed to Zack, who could care less about some bug that stowed into the gift his uncle sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks a ton for the favour, I owe you one.\" Zack's tone dripped with sarcasm. \"Whatever, man. Just lay off that shit and let me do my homework.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew sighed, taking a final drag of the smoldering stub. As he rubbed it out on his desk, a fly that had been buzzing the room for hours landed lazily upon his chest. Stoned and careless, Drew chuckled and expelled his smoke upon the confused insect. It stumbled from the smokey gale, obviously distressed and bewildered. He plucked the fly between his fingers and considered it's struggling form before flicking it towards the window absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your lucky day, bug\" He said under his breath, amused at his own magnanimous action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored again and dozing, Drew leaned back and readjusted his shoes over one another causing bits of dirt and grime to fall free from his treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack would never know the fate of his uncle, who had thought his plan so flawless and clever that nothing could go wrong. </span></div></div>",

Bryan continued watching the giant college student until he suddenly left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan located the small tear in the box and thought seriously about exiting, but thought it wise to remain in the relative safety of the box until Zack\u2019s return.

Tiny Bryan was tossed backwards, but soon regained his composure as the box\u2019s movements steadied out.  As Bryan looked out of the peep hole again, he got an up close view of Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was huge.  The miniature man found it hard to even think of the behemoth that held him as his nephew.  Bryan cringed nervously as he felt the box being ripped open by his hulking nephew.  He wondered if this crazy plan was such a good idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack effortlessly ripped open one side of the little box, and then carefully tore open the entire box from end to end.  Curiously, the box only seemed to contain a white handkerchief.  Zack lifted the handkerchief and examined it closely.  \u201cWhat the fuck.  Is this some kind of joke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down at the torn box, and noticed what seemed to be a little bug scurrying around.  He slowly lowered his finger until it was directly above the small \u201cinsect\u201d.  The little \u201cbug\u201d moved around frantically trying to avoid the giant\u2019s finger. Zack chuckled as he followed the \u201cbug\u201d around with his finger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Uncle B.\u2014you sent me a handkerchief and a bug.  I guess the handkerchief is to wipe the bug guts off my finger when I pulverize the little piece of shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the tiny man, everything erupted into a blurry chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head over to the student center and shoot some pool,\" Drew suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!

The impact ejected the tiny man from within the confines of the box only to leave him trapped within the even more massive environment of a tall aluminum garbage container lined with mile upon mile of black plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rested prone on the mound of garbage within the can's plastic liner. When, after a pause of a few moments, he realized he hadn't been killed, he tried to determine the seriousness of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on a discarded envelope in the shadow of the building-sized cardboard shipping package. A sizable chunk of someone's discarded burger rested a short distance from the package. In addition, someone had tossed in a colossal \"Big Gulp\" cup, old candy wrappers, a couple of soda cans and assorted other debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt truly insignificant, knowing he had been tossed away like worthless garbage. He also knew, without a doubt, he was trapped in the deep pit. The smooth plastic offered no possible means of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sticky, sweet residue of soda had leaked onto some of the papers, and the stench of stale food filled the tiny man's nostrils. He gazed at the discarded box and almost longed for the confines of his dark shipping package. He just wanted a place where he could curl into a tiny ball, sleep and perhaps awaken to find all of this horror was merely a bad dream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He searched for a way to climb out, but the walls covered by the smooth plastic bag stretched thousands of feet above. Despite himself Bryan felt a lump rise in his throat, he just wanted to cry. This whole thing had been an awful idea, and now his situation had become downright hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he allowed his grief to overwhelm him he remembered something. And he felt like a complete idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe antidote! Though lost, it was not gone! Bryan turned towards the box, its base nearly level with him. Bryan rushed across a chocolate wrapper and yelped with joy when he saw the slit he could enter through. This was so easy it must be a sign! Feeling confident that he would find the antidote once more he sprinted into the box to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack returned hours later from shooting pool. Drew had left with some friends and although they had invited Zack to join them, Zack chose to return to his room. He needed to sleep before school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack passed the trash can he pulled out some scratch tickets from his pocket and tossed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned waste of money\" he grumbled, before entering the bathroom to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was exhausted. He had been searching for hours. But the box was so large and so far the antidote was nowhere to be found. He worried for a moment that it had flown out of the box. He sighed and kept looking. Only if he finished searching unsuccessfully could he worry about the antidote lying somewhere in the massive dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the door slam shut and glanced upward. The trash can shook as someone approached. Large objects appeared from the sky and landed next to the box. Bryan recognized Zack\u2019s voice but didn\u2019t try to shout as the steps faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would keep looking for the antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack emerged from the bathroom feeling clean fifteen minutes later.

Anxiety quickly merged into excitement as the tiny scientist felt the box being ripped open by his enormous nephew.  When the entire box had been torn apart, Bryan found himself exposed to the outside world.  His colossal nephew loomed ominously over him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsumed with fear, Bryan watched as Zack effortlessly lifted the handkerchief that surrounded him.  He was now vulnerable, completely at the mercy of the young giant above.  Bryan swallowed nervously and then began to wave up to the giant and shout, \u201cHey Zack\u2014down here.  It\u2019s me, your Uncle Bryan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing his nephew utter the \u201cbug\u201d word, Bryan erupted in a fit of panic.  \u201cNoh, I\u2019m not a fucking bug!\u201d the tiny man screamed with all his might as a jumbo finger rapidly descended upon him.  Bryan wanted to cry as the huge, fleshy digit hovered mockingly above him, ready to squash out his existence at any moment.  Bryan began to run in an attempt to escape sudden doom.  But the threatening finger easily mimicked his every movement.  And then it began to lower even more, almost touching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Zack was about the squash the tiny bug with his finger, he began to wonder why his uncle would play such a bizarre practical joke on him.  It was so unlike him.  He had never displayed much creativity or a sense of humor.  He lifted his finger and decided to have a closer look at the package, and the little \u201cbug\u201d.  Maybe he missed something.  Zack lowered his face to the opened package and looked real close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Zack uttered in complete disbelief.  He closed his eyes tight, shook his head, and then took another look.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter inch tall scientist sighed a breath of relief. Being squashed to death by a giant college student\u2019s finger wasn\u2019t the way he wanted to exit this world.  And he was also thankful he had somehow managed not to piss his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle B.\u2014is that you?\u201d  Zack whispered to the bug sized human below him.  \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u2014Zack, it\u2019s me!\u201d  Bryan screamed with all his might at the God-like creature above.  \u201cI shrunk myself and had myself mailed to you as a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan found himself becoming exhausted from all the yelling and Zack just loomed above with a quizzical look on his face.  He couldn\u2019t even hear him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack could see his tiny Uncle was trying to talk to him, but he couldn\u2019t hear a word his miniature Uncle was saying.  \u201cUncle B.\u2014I can\u2019t hear anything you\u2019re saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack reached for a note card and placed it next to his tiny uncle and said, \u201cHop on this, Uncle B.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan carefully stepped onto the massive platform, then fell to his knees at he felt the ground beneath him suddenly rise.  He had no idea what his giant nephew had in mind, but Bryan trusted Zack completely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack tilted the note card and his tiny Uncle slipped off right into the palm of his enormous hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan landed with a tiny plop on his nephew\u2019s massive hand.  Bryan found himself in the middle of a lake of pink, squishy flesh.  It glistened with a thin layer of sweat, and Bryan studied the lines and crevices of the giant hand in amazement.  He reached down and thoroughly felt the surreal surface with both hands.  It was an experience he could have never imagined.  It was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was a little amused at his tiny Uncle\u2019s fascination with his hand, but the big question was how did this all happen.  He lifted his hand up close to his face and softly spoke.  \u201cUncle B.\u2014how did this happen to you?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That gave him an idea, suddenly. He reached up and tugged at his own ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAR?\" asked Zack, perplexed. Then he got it. \"OH! ARE YOU SURE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan nodded. Cautiously, Zack raised Bryan up towards his own ear, which looked like a cave. In his sweaty hand, Bryan was trying hard to stand up. With a sudden motion, Bryan fell and nearly slid off the side of Zack's hand. He was stopped by Zack's finger, which siezed him and put him back on the hand.

He slowly moved his hand on the desk toward the edge, forcing his Uncle into the palm of his other hand.  \u201cJust jump on my hand Uncle B.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan found it a little unsettling to be forced onto his giant nephew\u2019s hand in such a manner, but he just went along with it for now.  In an instant, Bryan was lifted high into the air as Zack lifted his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here in my pocket,\u201d Zack said softly to his Uncle as he placed his hand next to his shirt pocket.  \u201cJust jump in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan climbed onto the top edge of the pocket and tried to hold on with both arms.  His intentions were to hang on the top edge so he could see out, instead of being in the dark at the bottom of the pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few seconds, he lost his grip and fell to the bottom of Zack\u2019s enormous shirt pocket.  Zack chuckled softly.  \u201cYou\u2019ll be safer that way Uncle B.\u2014that way you won\u2019t fall out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack locked the door and began the trek across campus to the high rise dorm where his friend Alex lived.  He checked his pocket a couple times to make sure his Uncle was doing okay.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry Uncle B.\u2014almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack entered the lobby of the high rise dormitory, got on the elevator and headed up to the seventh floor.  When he got to Alex\u2019s room, Zack gave a couple knocks on the door.  After a response from Alex, he opened the door and walked in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sat at a desk in one corner of the room playing Tetris on a laptop computer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had managed to climb to the top edge of Zack\u2019s shirt pocket.  He peered out and surveyed the room of his nephew\u2019s friend.  A long table that extended the entire length of one wall was packed with an array of various pieces of test equipment.  An expensive looking telescope was positioned next to the window, and a near life-size poster of Albert Einstein was taped to one of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Zack,\u201d Alex greeted his friend with a big smile.  \u201cWhat\u2019s this big favor you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s more like a little problem,\u201d Zack responded as he walked over and gave Alex a firm pat on the back.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange so just listen and don\u2019t laugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack went on to explain to his friend about the small package he received containing his extremely tiny Uncle.  \u201cAnd the worst part is that I can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying because he is so tiny.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, being the size of a bug would explain that part,\u201d Alex responded at the verge of completely cracking up.  \u201cAnd just when did you start doing drugs, Zack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but you won\u2019t be laughing in a minute when I show him to you,\u201d Zack said.  \u201cHe\u2019s right here in my pocket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked down and saw his miniature uncle holding on to the top edge of his pocket.  He reached down with a massive hand and let his bug sized uncle climb onto his palm.  Zack carefully lowered his shrunken uncle onto a textbook that was sitting on Alex\u2019s desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan surveyed the thick shiny textbook, noticing the title.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWave Particle Duality &amp; de Broglie Waves Made Easy,\u201d Bryan read the title to himself as he walked along the surface of the humongous book. \u201cThis is one of my favorite books.  This Alex guy must be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026,\u201d Alex exclaimed wide eyed unable to finish his sentence.  He sat frozen in his chair looking down in complete disbelief as a tiny man waved up at him.  \u201cThis can\u2019t be. It\u2019s impossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told ya smarty,\u201d Zack said with a chuckle, amused at his friend\u2019s reaction.  \u201cYou got any ideas on what I should do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just stared at the shrunken man for a few minutes and then said, \u201cHold on just a minute, Zack.  I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex opened the drawer to a nearby metal cabinet and began rummaging through an assortment of various electrical devices.  \u201cGot it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut this in your ear,\u201d Alex instructed Zack as he handed him a small earpiece and then placed a very small wireless microphone next to tiny Bryan.  \u201cYou guys do your catching up.  I\u2019ve got some work to do.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took a handful of items he had collected from the storage cabinet and spread them out onto his worktable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack, can you hear me?\u201d Bryan nervously spoke into the mic Alex had placed next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! YES!\u201d  Zack responded unable to control his excitement.  \u201cI hear you loud and clear Uncle B.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow tell me what the fuck happened to you,\u201d Zack demanded as his tone became more serious.  \u201cHow did you get like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan spent the next ten minutes explaining his fool hearty plan in its entirety to his gigantic nephew.  \u201cIt was just supposed to be a big surprise for you Zack.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued the story about how he had lost the antidote during shipment, and it was probably somewhere in Zack\u2019s trash can back in his dorm room.  Zack just sat silently with his mouth wide open, mesmerized at his tiny uncle\u2019s every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, all finished,\u201d Alex exclaimed with pride as he rejoined Zack and his bug sized uncle.  \u201cJust let me have that mic for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex carefully positioned the microphone inside a very small box that was hooked to a silver chain.  He held the chain up as the box dangled precariously below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve got something to carry him around in besides your shirt pocket,\u201d Alex explained.  \u201cAnd best of all\u2014you can talk to each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Bryan thought angrily as he looked at the box and chain.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to be put in a box and worn around someone\u2019s neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Zack replied to Alex as he handed him the little box and chain.  He looked down at his miniaturized uncle.  \u201cLook what Alex made for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The floor and ceiling are solid, but the walls are perforated with tiny holes. Alex's titanic hand reaches over your head and flips a small latch, allowing the door to the interior to open. \"It's from a bug collecting kit I use to use a couple years ago.\", he explains, \"I lost my interest in entomology a while ago, but that was some mini bug cage. Just open and close this latch when he wants to get out.\" The box is about the size of a phone booth to you, with the holes about the thickness of your arms. You don't feel relieved that this is an actual cage that the boys are putting you in but unfortunately the microphone is inside there, hanging from a thick wire in the ceiling. You step in to test it, and a mighty finger closes the door behind you. \"Is the microphone working Uncle B\": Zack asks<br>\r\n\"Uh... testing... testing.\" you say into the mic.<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear\", Zack says, \"Thanks for all your help Alex. Call me if you think up anything. I'm going to take my uncle back to my room.\"<br>\r\nThe cage wobbles as Zack lifts it up and puts it around his neck.

Your air smells like deodorant and Zack's musk. Zack begins walking out, and the cage bounces slightly against his chest with each step, causing you to feel a bit woozy.<br>\r\n\"Hey Zack, are you going to walk all the way home, I think I might be sick from this jostling\" You say into the mic.<br>\r\n\"I think there's a bus stop ahead, I'll see if I can catch the next one back home\", he whispers.</span></div></div>",

He also felt awe at the young man's gigantic physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked tall and lean, dressed at the moment in a pair of faded denim jeans and a form-fitting T-shirt. He had unruly black hair, pale skin and dark eyes concealed behind wire-frame glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the colossal size difference between them, Bryan imagined they might have a lot of common ground to discuss over a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless he wanted to go swimming in a hot, caffienated beverage, however, that would have to wait until he got restored to his normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan dared to gaze up at his nephew's giant friend.

He shook his head, only then aware he hadn't replied to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on my hand,\" Alex urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Bryan, the tone of the giant voice seemed elusive.

Bryan also saw a few glistening slicks of moisture and realized Alex must have sweaty palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can do it,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help!\" Alex volunteered eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Bryan's shock, Alex grabbed a memo pad and ripped off a sheet. \"Step on that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stepped onto the bright blue platform formed by the memo sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex lifted the platform and its tiny passenger over his palm.

After all, hadn't he always wanted to enjoy being tiny and totally under the control of some all-powerful giant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so bad,\" he said aloud, although his comment went unheard by Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment...</span></div></div>",

Bryan looked with some distress at the plastic dolls on the other side of the plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool!\" Zack said as he looked at the male dolls dressed in Army fatigues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store didn't have a lot of variety,\" Alex said. \"They did have some superhero action figures, but I didn't know how you felt about spandex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack picked up the box and effortlessly tore away the plastic wrapping. His uncle watched with increase unease as Zack began to strip the fatigues off the plastic doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack dropped the pants and shirt on the floor in front of his uncle. \"Uncle B., try them on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan took the clothes into his small hands. The fabric felt scratchy and the dolls didn't come with such extras as little undershorts. He raised his eyes and noticed the intense scrutiny from Zack and Alex. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He placed the little matchbox bed on the stand next to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered down into the box. His uncle looked almost lost in the huge wad of cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, Uncle B,\" the huge young man promised. \"If we can't get you back to normal, at least you'll be in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, his nephew's attempt to ease his mind backfired. Now, as he tried to get some sleep, Bryan's mind raced on the thought of what would become of him if he remained a speck-sized man in a giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, simple exhaustion won out, and he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he ought to have to live like this,\" Zack said in a downcast tone to his friend, Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Alex admitted, looking down, way down, at the tiny man standing between their feet on the floor of Zack's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember what I discussed with you,\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just can't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex clapped a hand on Zack's shoulders. \"I'll take care of it for you,\" he said. \"Just step outside for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, Bryan listened to their conversation with growing unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Dr. Smith,\" Alex said after Zack left the room. \"We have done all we can. You are never going to grow back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Bryan tried to shout. \"Where did Zack go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you would rather just end it quickly,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End it?\" Bryan squeaked. \"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex raised his huge shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan gasped as the shadow engulfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold still, and I will make sure this is done quickly,\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan tried to run. \"I don't care! I still want to live! Please, you can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bryan fell, hitting his head on the floor. The commotion also woke his sleeping nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack opened his eyes and saw his uncle standing in the room, normal size again, and rubbing his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, damn, that hurt,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw Zack, who looked normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself. \"I'm normal!\" Bryan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan blushed then. \"Normal...and naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Zack said. He tossed his uncle a pair of his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Bryan pulled on the shorts, his nephew gave him a huge hug. \"Good to have you back,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to be back,\" Bryan said, looking up at his nephew. Looking up a little higher than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack noted his uncle's alarmed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Uncle B?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan confided his worry. Soon enough, a quick measurement confirmed that Bryan had not completely grown back to his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am two inches shorter,\" Bryan complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at it like this,\" Zack said. \"It beats being two inches tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Bryan said, thinking back on that awful nightmare just before he woke to find himself, almost, restored to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if I hadn't grown back, you would have taken good care of me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Zack said. \"You could have counted on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I get spring break in a couple of months,\" Zack said. \"I'd love to visit you. Maybe we could conduct some followup experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Bryan said. \"Maybe I ought to take my research in a new direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn't push too hard. He wanted to play it cool. There was no need to let his uncle know how big a thrill he had experienced finding himself in complete control of a tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no need to decide now,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since discovering his shrunken uncle and learning of his impulsive (no, it's more like insane) scheme, Zack had felt a creeping resentment in the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always thought of his uncle as brilliant and, yes, slightly geeky, but what could have possessed him to shrink himself to bug size and make a trip via the U.S Postal Service inside a package?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, only briefly, had considered canceling his plans, but decided that he didn't owe his uncle the courtesy of putting his social life on hold just because he had gotten himself into such an odd dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, perhaps he should have insisted that the tiny man remain behind with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter securing the pill bottle in his duffel bag, Zack zipped the bag closed, or almost closed. He also patted the bag and whispered, \"Hope the ride's not too bumpy, Uncle B.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick and Todd had already steered their bags in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to put that bag in the trunk?\" Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to keep it handy,\" Zack answered. He handed the bag to Todd, who had been assigned the backseat when Rick called shotgun. \"Could you stash it in the back seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Todd said, grabbing the bag and placing it in the floor behind the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hit the road,\" Rick said, taking his place in the front passenger's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got behind the wheel and put the keys in the ignition. As he pulled out, he knew they would be in Las Vegas in about five hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was the plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bag, trapped in the plastic prison of the pill bottle, the bug-sized scientist had no way of monitoring the activity of his gigantic nephew and his two colossal friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to tell himself it was better that way. The humbling circumstance of finding himself transported in an pill bottle began to make him see that he might have made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trusted Zack, but as his adventure had already taught him, the world's a dangerous place full of unexpected surprises when you're only a quarter-of-an-inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how long he had spent inside the bottle when the car hit a bump. No serious damage except for the fact that the lid popped off the bottle. His nephew must have failed to snap the lid securely in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the bottle had been placed inside the bag in a way that now caused the tiny man to begin sliding along the curve of the smooth plastic walls toward the now enormous opening of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to gain some traction, but he only accelerated his slide down the two-inch section of smooth plastic. Suddenly, just like that, he fell out of the bottle and landed on a soft surface. He didn't know it at that very moment, but he had managed to land inside a folded pair of his nephew's boxer briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three college students gathered around the blue Acura and gazed at the two flat tires... one on the front driver's side and the other on the rear of the vehicle on the passenger's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the chances of two flats?\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Zack kicked up sand and pebbles. \"Dammit,\" he said. \"I've just got one spare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd tried to get a signal on his cellphone. \"Not getting anything, man,\" he reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We passed that gas station just a couple of miles back,\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more than a couple of miles,\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't,\" Rick retorted. \"I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, great short-cut,\" Todd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why did I listen to you?\" Zack piled on. \"There's not even any other cars on this damn road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you and I can walk to that gas station,\" Rick said, trying to sound reasonable. \"Todd can stay here with the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack didn't want to be reasonable, but he didn't see any other choice. He sighed and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends had been gone almost a half hour when Todd's stomach began to grumble. Thinking that Zack might have packed some snacks, he reached into the car for his friend's duffel bag.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unzipping it he began rummaging through the clothes hoping that Zack might have tucked a muesli bar or some other food in amongst his belongings. Pulling the clothes towards him as he dug in amongst them he didn't notice the tiny man who was laying on a pair of Zack's underwear, blinking in the unexpected bright light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tried to focus as the bag was unzipped but having been locked away in darkness, the sudden brightness of the desert sun had his eyes watering and blinking. He had the vague impression of a giant shape looming over him and he tentatively called out to who he presumed was his nephew, \"Zack, I fell out of the bottle.\"<br>\r\nHe had no real warning as the clothes beneath him suddenly lurched upwards as the giant rummaged through them. Bryan felt himself sliding towards the giant and his vision finally cleared just in time as he was flung into the air by a sudden movement by the giant pushing the clothes around.<br>\r\nBryan had no time to yell as he saw a wall of denim hurtling towards him. He slammed into it and immediately started to fall downwards. He saw a lifeline and managed to grab it, holding on for dear life as the giant continued to move around.<br>\r\nAs his vision cleared he realised that he was hanging from some loose threads from the top of the jeans pocket of this unknown giant. As the giant continued his hunt through Zack's bag Bryan tried to get a better grip but he could already feel the thick threads slipping through his hand. With a yell of frustration he lost his grip and plummetted downwards. Luckily the giant's leg was bent and it provided a steep slope that Bryan tumbled and slid but he could see the precipice formed where the giants knee bent the leg back the other way. Trying to halt his fall he scrambled for a handhold but he was moving too fast and there were no more loose threads. <br>\r\nWith a scream he shot off the knee of the giant and into open space. His plunge was arrested quickly by the simple act of him hitting the side of the backseat of the car and he bounced back towards the giant, hitting the loose denim covering the giant's calf, then he dropped straight down.<br>\r\nThe various impacts knocked the wind out of him and he was sure he would be covered in bruises but at least they had the effect of slowing his fall so that when he finally hit a flat surface he wasn't killed on impact.<br>\r\nFor a moment he just lay on his back where he was, gasping in air and thanking the heavens that he was still alive. Slowly his sense of where he was crept back in and he groaned as he realised his predicament had continued its run of bad luck.</span></div></div>",

Even the indignity of having been dropped into a pill bottle and stuffed into the college student\u2019s duffel bag (for his own good\u2026 like hell!) had been instigated by Zack, who was more concerned with interrupting a road trip with his friends than to take a moment to consider the welfare of his favorite uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the bug-sized man found himself mercifully at rest on a vast terrain of sand and boulder-sized pebbles. He definitely did not want to remain outside the refuge offered by the enormous Acura he had purchased for his nephew only a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he swallowed his aggravation, he started to make a survey of his surroundings when he noticed the huge sneaker planted on the ground only a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with almost no warning, that same giant sneaker lifted and then slammed down only a few inches from his location, sending up an eruption of grains of sand and grit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified little man looked up, seeing one of his nephew\u2019s titanic college buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack!\u201d The tiny man screamed, not realizing that his nephew had left on a quest for assistance to solve their problem of two flat tires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd, having failed in his search for any hidden food caches in the automobile, walked around the vehicle and parked himself atop the hood, trying to gaze into the distance for any sign of his returning friends. He hoped they would bring back some snacks or at least something to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around the vast, flat desert landscape, everything looked so harsh and monotonous. \u201cWish to hell they would hurry up,\u201d he said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t notice as a tiny man no bigger than a puny bug crept over the sand and dirt, taking exhausting detours around pebbles now grown to the size of immovable boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the desert sun beating down on him, Todd removed his shirt, figuring he could soak up some rays until Rick and Zack returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist, grateful that Zack\u2019s huge friend hadn\u2019t accidentally trodden on him, took a moment to collect his wits and catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the titanic college student move around the vehicle, his gigantic shoes lifting clouds of dust and grit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt some relief when the huge man settled on the hood of the car. At least he posed less of a threat seated than stomping around in those colossal sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan still detected no trace of his nephew or Zack\u2019s other friend. As he made a timid survey around the vehicle, he saw the problem. One of the mammoth tires, now deflated and sunken into the sand, had sprung a flat. He realized that Zack and his friend must have gone looking for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he keep a spare?\u201d Little Bryan wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw that the titan was on the move again. He tensed to run, but this time the huge youth only stood and removed his shirt. Bryan stared in awe at the incredibly muscular body exposed by the now shirtless giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" The tiny scientist exclaimed as he saw the titan's muscles ripple and gleam beneath the bright desert sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He realized that perhaps he should play along for the moment.\u00a0\u00a0 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a cautious nod to let Alex know that he understand what he wanted, and that, within reason, he agreed to it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long after Alex saw Bryan nodding his miniscule head that a grin started to creep across his face.\u00a0 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until that moment, Bryan had thought that restoring his size was foremost on Alex's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose assurances, however, had been freely offered only when Zack was still around.\u00a0 Now that it's just the two of them, Bryan sensed a slightly different mood from his nephew's titanic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't at all sure he liked the mood that he sensed from Alex. He watched as Alex reached out and activated the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge hand reached over and effortlessly moved the giant metal switch with complete ease.\u00a0\u00a0 The loud click and then a slight humming in the air alerted Bryan to the device's re-activation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hear me again?\" Bryan asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex, what was that all about?\u00a0 Why did you turn off the speaker there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed. \"I suppose I wasn't paying attention. Sorry 'bout that, little guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex lowered his face down to the surface of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering that mischievous  smile on that enormous face, Bryan's not sure he can put too much faith in Alex's honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it's possible, Bryan decided, that Alex might not even realize he had smiled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his much smaller size, everything about the giant's facial expressions are much more exaggerated \u2014 even a tiny smirk really shows!\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Bryan spoke hesitantly into the mic.\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't wanna worry Zack,\" Alex confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt his heart beat faster at that revelation. He meant to ask Alex to explain, but his question got cut short again as a shadow loomed vastly over him. Alex's giant face moved much closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan instinctively backed up until he realized with logic that Alex wouldn't smash his face into the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex does speak at this close proximity Bryan is forced to cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please not so loud!\" Bryan pleaded through the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For such a tiny guy, you sure have a big brain,\" Alex said. \"I can't imagine all the obstacles you overcame to find a way to shrink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's plea, transmitted through the mic, brought an instant apology. \"Oops, sorry!\" Alex said. He lowered his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the booming voice gets more bearable, Bryan noticed that Alex isn't moving his face any further away.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed things about your face now that a normal-sized person would never see, such as tiny pits from acne, as well as dark hairs forming stubble that appears quite thick to the shrunken man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did have a lot of trouble in getting here,\" Bryan recollected. \"I thought my plan was perfect, but at least I did make it here in one piece.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Alex agreed. \"Lucky for you...and me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat intimidating smirk formed again on Alex's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was supposed to be a big surprise for Zack,\" Bryan said, now fully into communicating his incredible story to such an attentive listener.\u00a0\"He is always telling me to take a vacation, so this time I thought not only would I listen to him, I would let him take total charge!<br>\r\n\"I thought this would be a cool thing to do, though as soon as I started on this adventure, I wasn't so sure,\" Bryan admitted. \"And now he's leaving for Vegas.<br>\r\n\"So even this part isn't turning out exactly as I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing ever goes exactly as planned,\" Alex said with sympathy for the little guy's plight. \"I'm sure we could still arrange for some adventure for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex spoke, Bryan watched the smile on the huge face grow even bigger <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I'm just so glad to be noticed finally!\" Bryan said, unwilling to quit talking now that he has started his story. \"I had quite a disastrous adventure just to get here.<br>\r\n\"All I want to do now is chill for a little and take a breather.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex made a disapproving noise. \"Oh, that's no fun...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex open his mouth, and suddenly he is exhaling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlowing his breath across the table toward Bryan. It's like the game where kids blow pennies across tabletops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action, totally unexpected, takes Bryan completely by surprise.<br>\r\nHe saw the huge mouth open, but not expecting anything to happen, Bryan just stare dumbfounded, until Alex started to blow toward him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\nThe tiny man is immediately assaulted with warm moist breath of a hurricane force. He is literally lifted off his feet and blown across the surface of the table.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" Bryan cried out.\u00a0\"I...\" is all he is  able to get out of his mouth before the mic wire is ripped out of his tiny hand and lost in the wind storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Alex, laughing like crazy, stared down at Bryan's clumsy antics in the face of the gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tried to get a fair distance from Alex, but the giant is still blowing and the tiny man is still being pushed back further along the smooth tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could blow you away!\" Alex announced with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least by talking, however, the giant shut off the windstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan saw how he had been blown within a few centimeters from the end of the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested there, as the winds die down to be replaced by loud reverberating deep laughter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened as Alex started talking in between chuckles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tried to get up on his feet again and started yelling a couple of expletives at the giant, but without the benefit of the mic, Alex has no idea what Bryan is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't hear you, Bryan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally on his feet, the tiny man realized he should be quite bruised from being blasted like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scientific mind kicks into gear. \"I am fine,\" Bryan said aloud. Thinking about the situation, he realized that his much decreased mass versus surface area must now mean that he is less prone to being hurt from simple falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that logical thought is interrupted by the rage he felt at Alex's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his feet, walking fast towards the huge grinning face, Bryan froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized in any other situation, this would look ridiculous, a bug-sized man walking to confront a giant like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must look so funny, but Bryan cannot help feeling angry. He slowed his approach, trying to keep a bit of a dignified look to his walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the huge mouth begins opening again, and Bryan realized there is no way to have a \"real\" confrontation with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist saw that Alex is simply waiting for him to start any kind of argument, so he can blow him away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan determined not to give the giant the opportunity. He would remain calm and in control\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alex flicked his tongue out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stopped and lifted up his hands as he saw the huge tongue.<br>\r\nTotally unprepared, Bryan watched helplessly as the huge tongue darted out of the gaping mouth. Stopped in his tracks, Bryan fell down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex closed his mouth, hiding his tongue back behind his lips. He laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing this close to the giant mouth again, the laughter is just booming in Bryan's ears. The tiny man is on his butt from the shock of Alex's tongue and now he has got his hands over his ears from the laughter.<br>\r\nBryan began to realize the futility of his situation and the fact that he has lost even the semblance of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan  is left to wonder if that is what Alex had in mind all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're gonna have a really fun weekend,\" Alex pronounced. \"And you've been left in really good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant's laughter died down, and Bryan looked up again at the huge face smiling down at him, he felt incredibly small and powerless.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Figured you might have the same sort of\u2026 thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist listened, transfixed. The motivation for his decision to shrink had involved finding himself tiny in the company of his nephew\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that hadn't turned out exactly as planned\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came all this way, so I think you ought to experience what you have been dreaming about,\" Alex said as his hand drifted down to his crotch and his fingers grasped the zipper at the front of the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grating noise from the parting of the metal teeth of the zipper echoed in the shrunken man's mind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The package, ripped open violently, let in the harsh light from a bulb in the lamp at Zack's desk,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinded by the brilliance, Bryan could not see anything. Then, in that blind state, he felt the sickening sensation of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, after using the scissor to tear open the package, turned it upside down. He didn't notice the tiny form falling free through the jagged tear in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a million to one shot that tiny Bryan would plummet from the box and fall through the circular opening of the massive green glass bottle on his nephew's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was about the sort of luck he was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed, not with the the hard impact he anticipated, but a chilling splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surfaced, gasping. As his eyes cleared from the harsh light, he found himself surrounded by strange green walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA splash of the liquid into his open mouth revealed much more than he wanted to know. He recognized the taste of an ice-cold Heineken beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Bryan cried. \"Zack, get me out of here. I'll freeze to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack continued to stare into the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty?\" The youth finally said in a puzzled tone. \"That doesn't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook the box, but nothing rattled or appeared to his inquisitive eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched his nephew's movements through the green glass of the Heineken bottle. He felt his tiny body growing numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Zack...you have got to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's voice trailed off when Zack wrapped his fingers around the bottle and hoisted it aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man had more to worry about than possible hypothermia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside the box, the fourth-of-an-inch tall scientist gripped a section of fabric from the insulating handkerchief and tried to prevent himself from being tossed to and fro within the spacious confines of the cardboard box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Bryan began to regret, ever so slightly, placing his fate in the hands of a teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the constant swaying stopped abruptly and Bryan struggled to regain his equilibrium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the post office involved going past a city park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look!\u201d Joe said in an excited voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Mark and Jeff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Tommy asked. Mark and Jeff were two of their buddies from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe pointed to a basketball court. \u201cOver there!\u201d Joe waved and shouted at his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wore a pair of baggy shorts, a red tank top and a really beaten-down pair of sneakers. He kept his blond hair concealed beneath a wool cap. He stood about 6\u20192\u201d tall and weighed about 170 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, a little shorter, had close-cropped black hair and dark eyes. He dressed similarly to his friend except he wore a new pair of Adidas Badrocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust in time,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cWe can have us a two-on-two game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Joe said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta get this package to the post office,\u201d Tommy said in a wavering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark slapped a hand on Tommy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHell, that can wait long enough for a game of B-ball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Sure,\u201d Tommy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the edge of the court and placed the package on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package, Bryan strained to determine what was going on outside.

He used the hole to peer out of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt a crushing realization of how small he had become when he saw the quartet of colossal titans playing basketball. His spying through the hole gave him a limited view, but he saw quite enough to make him feel really tiny and vulnerable again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe debated for an instant whether he should simply uncork the vial, drink the antidote, return to normal size and end this insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought down that impulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan peered again through the peep hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile watching the clash of the titans on the basketball court, Bryan...</span></div></div>",

His clothes and skin were soaked with sweat and he felt light-headed and weak. The box, along with the antidote, was gone. And not one of the four teenagers remained. And it was raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that, Bryan had to remind himself, was probably the only reason he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cast an eye around the dark, empty court. Here and there, the rain was coming down only lightly, but Bryan saw gallon after gallon fall from the sky. They looked like tiny glass beads, shattering as they hit the ground around him. If they didn't scare him so badly when they exploded in front of him, Bryan would have thought they looked very beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, he wandered toward the edge of the court. The ground was still hit under his feet but quickly cooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unsafe to wander around at night; at a fourth of an inch tall, that didn't change. He heard noises around him: crickets singing mournful songs, dogs yelping. Every so often, he heard feet in the distance but they were too far away to be of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunk himself down a few times, but never had he been outside. Glancing around with wander at the huge, green canopy, Bryan could barely believe it was only grass. The emerald poles seemed to choke the damp soil, growing tightly together. Bryan had to climb over and around them. He realized, after a few minutes, he did not actually know where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sidewalk surprised him somewhat, until he remembered he was in a city park. He must have reached the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked around, helplessly. What was he to do? The sidewalk stretched on. Cars whipped by every so often, but the road was otherwise quiet.

Nothing would have stood out under most ordinary conditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis current circumstances, however, hardly ranked as ordinary conditions. At his paltry size of a quarter of an inch tall, nothing about his surroundings struck the tiny scientist as ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredible variety of plant life in the park ranged from trees and tall shrubs to cultivated flowers, plants and grasses. Bryan found the trees almost impossible to contemplate. They stretched to such heights that not even the tallest city skyscrapers aspired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vast savannah of grass intimidated him. He could travel easily between each blade of grass, but the overhead fronds drooped down, enclosing him beneath a green canopy that made the tiny man claustrophobic despite the enormity of everything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan knew, from an academic standpoint, something about the workings of an ecosystem. The diversity of the park's plants, in turn, maintained an incredible number of insects and invertebrates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, about 200 species of spider alone make their home in the average city park. Bryan didn't know such precise facts, which probably spared his mind the torment of such fearsome worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park in Bryan's neighborhood included tranquil pools and larger ponds, which allowed for an even greater diversity of life. These sources of water helped the insect population expand to include dragonflies, damselflies and many other aquatic species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt like one of those contestants dumped onto a deserted island, to fend off the land and survive to win monetary prizes. He always dismissed such television fare, but he had sometimes been absorbed, sort of like watching a traffic accident, into watching some of the so-called reality dramas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prize, however, was literally survival. He could only return to the normal world by surviving the dangers of the park and finding someone to assist him in his quest to regain his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding assistance had to take a lower priority for now as his \"fight of flight\" reflex kicked into action with the sudden appearance of a hideous and mammoth creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curious monstrosity lumbered awkwardly on six spiky legs, its rounded body covered with protective armor plating. Two fearsome mandibles extended from the creature's head, which also included beady black eyes and spiny antennae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, if he had wanted to make a direct comparison, would have barely reached the large beetle's abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of any such possibility, Bryan cowered behind a pebble until the huge beetle, at least four times his size, disappeared into a forest of grass off to one side of the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man trembled, unaware of the harmless nature of the bug, thankful to have escaped harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug drove home the fact that he had fallen, like Alice, into a very weird world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he only wanted to escape. The possibility of such a feat, however, didn't look very promising considering his quarter-of-an-inch size.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He unwrapped a sandwich and unscrewed the lid on his water bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 24-year-old city employee wore the usual park uniform of brown cargo shorts, crisp green shirt and a wide-brimmed hat. His legs, toned and tanned, slipped into a pair of hiking boots. He remained unaware that one of the lacings had come undone and now dangled on the concrete sidewalk beneath the bench fittings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith found the park near his home a frightening terrain filled with roaming alien creatures and humongous trees dwarfing the still huge shrubs that loomed over a jungle of grass blades and weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing chased by the vicious beetle and encountering two gigantic grade school boys had left him feeling even more morose about his chances of ever finding a safe haven, let alone regaining his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepression would have to wait, however, when he heard the slap of the rubber tread of a pair of mammoth hiking boots slamming on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steady stride of the giant meant that the boots were almost upon him before the bug-sized man even had time to react. In his panic, he flung his arms into the air as one of the boots smashed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's step missed him, as did the subsequent steps as he made his way to a towering bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the peril passed, the little man dared to raise his eyes. Thankful to still be alive, he studied the enormous man, evaluating the wisdom of seeking help from the behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man knew he needed to seek help, and he had no choice but to look for that assistance from the titans who had once been his peers in a normal human universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his spirits lift slightly when he recognized the man as an employee of the park. It was the job of rangers to help park visitors, and the speck of a man could only hope that applies to visitors regardless of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the enormous park bench, which was supported on four massive columns of industrial steel, his gaze fastened on those boots that had stomped so dangerously close only a few moments ago. With one casual move, the giant park ranger could easily obliterate him in the blink of an eye and not even know what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis courage almost deserted him. The tiny man considered running away and waiting for another opportunity, but at that instant he saw the lace that dangled from the giant's right boot. At least an inch of the lace was draped over the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking aloud in his excitement, the tiny scientist said, \"I can climb the lace, and reach the top of his boot and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off. He didn't know what he should do once he reached the top of the boot. He saw no socks exposed above the boots. Conceivably, he could get close enough to touch the titan's bare leg and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what?\" The little man asked himself in a forlorn voice. His brain, the same one that had gotten him into his dilemma, predicted that the giant would never feel something as tiny and insignificant as he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've got to try,\" he shouted into the vastness of the park as he lunged toward the lace, which was twice as wide as he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout letting any other thoughts get in the way, he began to climb...</span></div></div>",

At normal height, this pebble would be no larger than a grain of rice, but to Bryan, it concealed him completely from the terrifying beetle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood and looked around nervously. Where should he go? The chance that he might encounter another frighteningly large insect unsettled him. He knew that he couldn't just stay where he was if he ever hoped to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frantic thoughts were interrupted as he felt slight tremors reverberating through the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Williams jogged back to the spot where he and his girlfriend Judy sat. The young couple both attended the nearby college, and had ventured to the park to enjoy a picnic together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 20 year old guy worked at the local petroleum station as an attendant. He stood an impressive 6 feet 1 inches, a good head taller than his slightly younger girlfriend. Rob sported short, almost buzzed, blonde hair with a light patch of facial hair on his chin. A casual dresser, Rob wore a t-shirt, jeans, and DC sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis size thirteen sneakers easily flattened the grass with each step as he approached. The last thing on the young man's mind was the small plants and insects he was crushing. Rob was too busy thinking of the ham sandwiche Judy had made for their picnic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Bryan barely had time to cry out as the entire landscape was thrown into shadow. A gigantic sneaker crashed down just before him, the thunderous shockwave threw him back. He just had time to take the terrifying site in, before the grass-stained footwear lifted in seemingly slow-motion and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock, Bryan heard (and felt) the thunderous footfall grow distant. Bryan was still shaking as he pulled himself upright. Crying despite himself, he watched slack-jawed as the previously sturdy blades of grass recovered from being flattened. It occurred to the insect-sized man that this plant had adapted itself to this treatment, at least to an extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I were so resilient...\" He muttered gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis current predicament was so far from what he had initially planned. How could he have been so stupid to think that shrinking himself was a good idea? He wiped blood from his nose as he tried to concoct a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, he was completely surrounded by the tree-like grass. He needed to get a higher vantage before he started wandering blindly again. Looking to his immediate right, he saw a broad blade of grass that looked climeable. Bryan took a deep, albeit shakey, breath and scrambled up the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the climb was rather easy, and he suddenly found himself with a panoramic view. All around was a sea of grass that seemed to stretch for miles. All except for a sight that both frightened and enticed the tiny man. Not too far off, he saw the two young lovers, sitting on their huge expanse of blanket. Bryan licked his lips hungrily as he noted the mountain of food piled next to the colossal pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniscule man had not eaten since before he shrank himself. Shaking his head, Bryan focused on the important fact. He needed help. More importantly, he did not want to spend a night in a forest of grass teeming with fearsome insects. The couple was his best and only option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down the grass blade, Bryan sprinted in the direction of the picnic. He made good time, with little interruptions,and found himself suddenly on the edge of the classically-patterned picnic blanket. Gulping nervously, he took in the entire scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and foremost, Bryan shivered at the unfathomably huge form of the young guy. His bulky frame positively dominated the area. The titan sat with his huge legs half-extended before him and his giant sneakers feet firmly planted. Bryan couldn't help but whimper at the sight, especially since he recognised the dirty DC sneakers as the ones that almost flattened him. A loud sound startled Bryan out if his memory when the giant coughed and spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't spit like that near the food, Rob! It's disgusting!\" Cried the girl, who looked clean and manicured in her summer dress and heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIT, SORRY. HAD A BUG IN MY MOUTH.\" His deep voice boomed like thunder to little Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the giant college student and his girlfriend,  man watched. Bryan swallowed nervously, as the scene was reminiscent of a animated movie he once saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided now was the time to act...</span></div></div>",

Bryan watched the giantess easily move these gigantic things like they were nothing. He decided he ought to approach a giant and wait for an opportunity to present itself. He settled on approaching Rob, who was closer. At his size even an inch closer was a major difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him the two titans began to eat while Bryan slowly zigzagged between platters and bowls. They were piled with, what were to him, tons of food. Wondrous food! Bryan's stomach was getting the better of him and he unconsciously drifted closer to each bowl and plate he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled at Rob and gestured to the food. \"Dig in\" she said simply. Between them lied a platter of fried chicken, a huge bowl of potato salad, a smaller container of fruit salad, a stack of sandwiches, and a small bowl of deviled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn't need any more invitation. He had been anticipating this picnic all day and, knowing how good of a cook Judy was, had eaten very little. While he began piling food on his plate, Judy reached for a bowl of fruit salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob snatched a bowl of potato salad and uses the spoon to dump it onto his plate. In his haste he scoops a chunk onto the blanket instead of his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops\u201d Rob grunts as he pinches the chunk of food between his fingers and pushes it into the rest of the pile. He lifts his fingers to his mouth and licks them clean. His face lights up and he turns to Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking delicious!\u201d he says proudly. Judy gives him a half-hearted smile. \u201cCan you try saying it a little more sophisticated?\u201d she asks gently. Rob gives her a funny look before loudly saying \u201cWhy I do declare, this is quite delectable my lady!\u201d in a poor British accent. Judy laughs and pokes him in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at her plate which has a pile of fruit and a lonely sandwich half. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna have more?\u201d he asks. Judy shakes her head and mutters something about her diet. Rob shrugs knowing he can\u2019t convince her otherwise. He grabs a chicken wing and bites into it savagely, savoring its rich and juicy flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is stunned and mortified. He cannot believe what had just happened. His mind replays in slow motion what had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been nearing the giant named Rob. The young man reached over and around him as he piled what looked like mountains of food onto his plate. He had shifted position, his long shoes now facing Bryan. Caked into the patterned tread was dirt, grime, and ripped grass blades. A few unnoticed bugs who hadn\u2019t escaped Rob\u2019s footfall hung loosely from the shoe sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shuddered, but kept walking as he passed Rob\u2019s plate. A shadow appeared above him and he could hear the squishes of some soft food being dumped onto the plate. Before he knew it he was crushed and lay in darkness. His mind panicked he had been mistaken for a bug and braced for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he felt himself lifted into the light, stuck to what had landed on him. With an audible plop he stops moving. The giant man is looking at him as he sticks his long fingers into his mouth far above. He sucks them clean before his eyes glance ahead and he roars something at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Bryan is trapped in the potato salad, the giants above booming at each other. The young titan reaches down and lifts an airplane sized chicken leg to his face. He tears into it savagely and Bryan feels his heart skip a beat. What could he possibly do?</span></div></div>",

Judy nods, as he knew she would. \"I just need to keep working on my history, there's so many dates to remember!\" she replies unhappily. \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob pauses to swallow. \"Hell yeah! I'm ready to graduate and have a great summer!\" he says with a wide grin. \"With my babe of course! ...and them other girls at the university...\" he adds. Judy glares jokingly. \"You ass!\" she laughs. Rob simply shrugs and lifts the leg to his mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God this is so good!\" he says through a full mouth. Judy smiles \"I experimented a little with all the food. You need to tell me what you think.\" she tells him. Rob swallows and replies. \"So far so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob reaches for a deviled egg and easily pops the whole thing into his mouth. \"Mmmmmm!\" he says happily. Judy laughs and says \"If you like everything I might think you're lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shakes his head as he swallows \"You've never made a single piece of bad food!\" He picks up his spoon, digs into the potato salad, knowing it will be as good as the rest of the spread. He pauses as a gust of wind blows Judy's hair into her face. He laughs loudly before placing the spoonful into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is making slow progress as he struggles to free himself. Above he can hear the giants speaking and eating. Every now and then tiny bits of food rain down onto him from the giant's mouth above. Bryan curses as he continues to struggle in the mushy off-white mountain. A shadow darkens his spot and he looks up in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob lifts what looks to be an egg the size of yacht to his mouth. The entire thing disappears into his mouth, his jaw moving rhythmically as he chews. Bryan struggles faster but it seems to be counter productive. Always more a man of intellect than that of physical strength his limbs already burn and scream for a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain a shadow darkens his area but Bryan refuses to look up, not needing the sight of more food disappearing to terrify him further. But when a curved, clear wall appears to his side he yelps in terror. He feels his part of the mountain shift and he finally looks up. Rob is staring right at him, or rather the pile of potato salad. In his hand, terribly magnified, a plastic spoon that Rob is using to lift a chunk skyward. This chunk just happens to hold a very unfortunate tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's mind shifts into slow motion as his mind spins to come up with a solution. Unable to think of one Bryan takes in every detail of his view. Rob's face look friendly from his blue eyes to his smiling mouth, which show off a set of perfect teeth. A gust blows past and the gigantic face scrunches as Rob shuts his eyes. Bryan sees a small black speck hit the food he is trapped on. A small fly, at the mercy of the wind, has now also become stuck in the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob takes no notice of the new addition, as the spoon stops in front of his face. He apparently sees something funny as his mouth opens and laughter booms out of it. Bryan however is focused on the mortifying scene ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast Rob's jagged, white teeth his tongue bobs up and down with the laughter. Smeared across the back of it are bits and piles of the chicken and egg that had disappeared down his throat already. Between his large molars, crammed with chewed remains, a thick strand of saliva stretches from top to bottom. In the back, the gaping entrance to his throat frames his long, swinging uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Bryan screams in desperation as the spoon moves forward. He is hit with the stench and humidity of the cavern as the spoon lands on the tongue. The light dims and a scraping sound is heard as the spoon leaves the pile of food in Rob's mouth and his tongue begins to maneuver it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Rob's saliva has freed tiny Bryan from the food and he falls to the tongue. It's rough, undulating surface feels warm, slimy, and disgusting but the tiny man holds on tight nonetheless. He hears squelches and squishes as Rob chews the food and moves it to the back of his mouth. Bryan feels the tongue move underneath him and with a loud squelch it seems the food has moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan laughs crazily from shock. He can't believe he made it! He then remembers he's hardly safe at the moment. Inside some young man's mouth was still a massive danger. The lips part slightly allowing light to enter once more. Bits and smears of food spread across the tongue ahead of him. Mr. Smith looks behind him to see Rob's front teeth tower above him. Their surfaces look like sheer cliffs. Bryan knows his time is limited and he must act quickly.</span></div></div>",

How does he not...!\" Bryan paused his verbal thinking to scream when the bumpy surface shifted suddenly and all light was cut off with a dull crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding over massive bumps that coated the gigantic surface, he quickly groped for a clump of mashed food larger than himself. The air was thick and heavy, only making his turmoil worse, and stank pungently. Unable to see, Bryan could only clutch the food, praying to God that he didn't become part of this behemoth's meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight burst in from between the huge lips as they parted, glaring past the towering teeth like sunlight through a cityscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan screamed vainly, trying to keep steady as the plain of gooey flesh moved beneath him. From behind, his tiny voice was rendered useless by an explosion of guttural breath and sound. Thrown against the nearest taste bud, Bryan clutched his ears. The thunderous notes exploded past him, feeling like the shockwave of an explosion. The giant was speaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva squished noisily around him, both spraying into the air and falling from the ridged roof like vehicle-sized stalagmites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't waste any more time screaming; Bryan had to do something more! \"Notice...<i>ME</i>!\" The bug-sized scientist proclaimed with surprising vigor. Digging his nails and biting his teeth, he assaulted the tender taste bud. It was difficult. The taste bud, out of many hundreds, was almost his size - but, he scratched and dug into it with ferocity. Putting every ounce of strength; every ounce of frustration and anger from this whole ordeal in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tongue slid roughly and a finger the size of a building entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How interesting...\" Judy smiled, leaning upon her hand as she listened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, and then Bobby dropped the camshaft,\" Her boyfriend said, spitting with every other word. \"Almost on his foot! The dumbas-... Uh... <i>the dummy</i> had a freakin' hangover still, and there he was trying to move parts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word entered Judy's mind before politely exiting out the other side. She understood little, and cared less for Rob's talk about his work. Still, he liked to gab, and she would sit quietly while he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss was-...\" Rob frowned suddenly, twisting his mouth. \"Eck...the fuck..?\" He poked his finger into his mouth, causing Judy to frown. She opened her mouth to chide his language, but didn't have the chance when he furrowed his brow and stuck two fingers in. Not a moment later, he pulled them out with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wretched back, disgusted by both the action and the cause. \"Some damn bug in my mouth; little motherfucker bit my tongue!\" He said. An expression that was nowhere near Judy's disgust on his face, instead he looked unimpressed. Between his index and thumb, coated in a sheen of saliva, was a minutely sized speck that wriggled helplessly. Sloshing his tongue around for others, Rob continued to stare at the tiny voyager, rolling it between his digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he shrugged and simply wiped it off on his jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is disgusting! How did you get that in your mouth for Pete's sake?\" His girlfriend looked mortified, no longer leaning languidly, but sitting upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shrugged again, smacking his mouth while he cleaned with his tongue. \"Tiny bitch probably jumped in my food... I don't know,\" His mouth felt cleaner now, he thought, despite the potato salad and few ants still remaining between his teeth. \"Who cares? Just a teeny little one anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dismissal was ineffective against Judy, who placed her plate upon the basket. She hated bugs. Even thinking of or looking at them made her feel sick. The mere idea that one could be in his food made was almost too much... But, what if they got into <i>her</i> food? It was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay... Don't worry about it. I'm sorry for being gross!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began covering up, grabbing each container and clipping the lid over. There was no chance she would let her delicious food become lunch for a bunch of gross insects. Rob watched, giving her a look. \"Come on, I don't want to go yet,\" He reasoned with a soft edge to his deep voice. Setting his hoodie up in a bunch, he patted it. \"Let's lay down and enjoy this great day - we don't get to do this, like, ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I feel a food-coma coming on!\" He added with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stopped, and looked at him. He was too much sometimes - but, she loved him for it. \"Oh... Okay,\" Clipping one last container, she shifted over to him. \"...<i>you big dope</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lovers laid down: Rob stretching his long bulk over the entire blanket, laying on his back and propping his thick arms behind his head. Judy leaned against his shoulder and they both relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxed and unaware of the tiny \"creature\" stuck on Rob's knee by a glob of spit. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, where the hell am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, the ground shuddered and seemed to move. Bryan fell over, slopping into the drying pool of saliva once more as he did. This time, he screamed in anger and humiliation, leaping out. His whole body was covered in the drying spit, creating an almost cellophane-like material that smelled like crap. Disgust washed over him and he began to wipe it off when he heard a distant rumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body went limp with disbelief as he stared. \"Holy.... Oh, my... Oh, God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan went into to noiseless gawking, realizing what he was looking at. Somehow - someway - while he was incapacitated, he had been relocated to the pant leg of the monstrous titan that nearly ate him for lunch. Bryan had trouble keeping himself focused. Just looking from his tiny location, across seemingly miles of thick blue denim, past a black mass of cotton that hung against the titan's torso, to a distant face propped up by a mountain range of huge arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... He's laying down!\" He noticed half-mindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extreme angle made the giant seemed otherwordly... In fact, more specifically, the giant resembled an entire world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could barely discern the distant face. It was blurred such, that he still could only tell the overall features of the huge man. Turning around, he saw the other leg across a limitless chasm of space that ended with the patterned picnic blanket. Behind him, over far less land, but long and treacherous as well, ended the pant-leg with a huge sneaker that tilted to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much for the tiny man to take in at once. He felt himself panicking - almost hyperventilating! This giant fucker was just too huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having trouble believing they were even the same species. That this gargantuan landscape was living, moving, breathing; just like himself. Bryan looked back towards the vastly distant face. The giant shifted his head, eyes closed, moving his large arms. Moments later, Bryan felt his world tremble slightly in reaction to the mundane movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to collect his emotions, he gulped. \"Okay. Alright. Yes... just fine. This is my chance to get somewhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could use this chance to trek across the length of leg, across the huge torso, and get this behemoth's attention... face to face! Or, he could climb down and escape. That was a very viable option that seemed limitlessly safer, but wouldn't get him any closer to being saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, the tiny man decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The female sat quiet and modestly, sipping a beverage and smiling at her companion with loving interest. The huge young man on the other hand kept a steady roar of conversation, his booming voice reverberating through tiny Bryan's body. Bryan noticed the young girl seemed especially interested in the man's opinion of the food--of which he took daunting portions of at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized man looked on. \"Young lovers... Great.\" Taking an impressive bite of what looked like potato salad, the young man leaned in a gave the girl an wet kiss of approval. He also said her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy. Her name is Judy.\" Bryan noted out loud, continuing his eavesdropping. Not more than a moment later, he caught the giant's name from Judy. \"She called him Robbie\" Bryan repeated turning his gaze from the two unaware giants. The name Robbie hardly seemed to fit such a frightening behemoth of this stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied momentarily with his eavesdropping, Bryan looked over to the impressive display of food in the distance. His stomach rumbled. \"Crap, I forgot how hungry I was. When did I last eat?\" It had only been over a day, yet Bryan felt as if he has been running in this nightmare for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just pondering the possibility of purloining the gigantic couples food when he heard strange noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned quickly to face an oncoming group of ants. The hideous insects quickly surrounded him, one brushing an antennae larger than a telephone pole against him. He shrieked at the unwelcome touch, and reeled back in terror. \"Get away!\" He yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had him surrounded. Seven of them to his measly one. It was a frightening situation for tiny Bryan, as he had always been terrified by any insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne approached suddenly. Clashing mandibles and bulbous coal-black eyes made Bryan cry out for mercy and squirm into a tiny ball. The large ant swiftly inspected the trembling ball and with a loud <i>click, clack</i>, it seemed to communicate to the other ants. The sound of many legs scuttling away prompted Bryan to peek from his huddled position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're... They... They're leaving!\" Bryan almost giggled. He was unsure why, but they had deemed him unworthy of consumption. It was the best stroke of luck he had yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ants had resumed a hurried crawl towards the enormous, looming form of Rob. Seeing the automobile-sized beasts in comparison to the dizzying size of the giant made Bryan remember just how small he was. The giant young man continued his endless thundering dialogue, that appeared to be an exciting story for him, but less interesting to his girlfriend who feigned interest in between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, all I need to do is get their attention!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was closest, but by far the most dangerous. Judy was seated furthest, separated from Bryan by a mass amount of food that was constantly being disturbed by her hungry boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to Rob. \"It will have to be him. He is sure to notice me if he stops blathering for just a moment...\" He looked the giant over, cringing at the familiar sneakers. One hand held a paper plate piled high with food in his lap, while the other wielded a plastic fork that brought large portions of the meal to the giant's mouth between sentences. Drops of crumbs and glomps of food rained to the ground with eat colossal bite and made an easy destination for the ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist steadied himself in preparation, and looked upwards to the sky. \"Please... I just wanted to go back to normal... I-...\" His empty prayers suddenly halted when distant movement and a shadow encompassed the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Bryan was upended when the ground lurched due to a gargantuan hand crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossibly huge, it slammed down almost directly on the group of ants. Bryan saw that only three of them remained, the others presumably smashed beneath digits larger than buildings. Bryan looked up towards Rob's distant face, fearing he meant to smash the minuscule invaders, but Rob showed no sign of notice as he belted an uproarious calamity of laughter from his own joke. He had taken a break from eating, and set his hand down to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer danger posed by such an involuntary and oblivious action scared Bryan. It never ceased to astound the tiny man how dangerous the world became when reduced to a smaller size. Most of it because of the massive callous behaviour displayed by his fellow humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he just began to resume his journey when he spotted the remaining ants. They bustled angrily around the much, much large foe--in reality Rob's index finger--and looked as though they intended to attack it. The realization smacked Bryan suddenly and he began running and yelling as if to halt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne ant approached to attack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mandibles clacking noisily, the speck-sized ant rushed towards the enormous wall of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticeably smaller than an ant - and far less adapted to such magnified environments - Bryan had difficulty traversing the patterned vinyl blanket. Miss-stepping, Bryan fell over himself with a grunt. Laying still, he peered at the giant hand that rested casually before him like a  flesh-toned mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny specks caught his attention as it approached Rob's index finger. The tiny man swallowed, fearful of what might happen next. \"I've gotta get away before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the side of the behemoth finger, the ant wasted not a moment before lunging at the offending mountain of ridged flesh. Evolved to be sharp and strong, the ant's pincers sunk into the thick wall of calloused flesh. Bryan's gaze shot upwards, looking toward the humongous man's face for a reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientist's held breath released in one fell gasp. Seconds went past, and the titan remained unaware of the minuscule assault upon his finger. The determined ant, unable to realize his opponents power and stature, remained adamant. It wriggled, attempting to thrash back and forth to cause maximum damage to the building-sized finger. Bryan looked on, noting as the tiny creature twitched that it had become stuck; unable to pull either pincer from the thick flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, the stupid bug is stuck!\" He cried out, still huddled on the ground as if he were watching an interesting sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob continued to chat high above, oblivious to the tiny world below. Other ants began collecting around the stuck ant. Their movements and antenna motions seemed to suggest that they were trying to determine how to release the trapped ant. One began climbing the huge finger, while the others uselessly batted their comrade with concerned antennae. The whole spectacle seemed comical, but sadly desperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkin to a shifting glacier, the hand suddenly shifted and began to lift upwards. The climbing ant was sent flailing off by intense forces, while the trapped ant whipped back and forth violently as the hand raised higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the side of his left hand, Rob gave Judy a playful grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused her idle nibbling of a strawberry, and returned with a quizzical look. \"What are you smiling at me for? Is there something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides the usual pretty lips, eyes, and nose?\" His deep tone sounding kind, yet intolerably corny. \"I'm just thinking how lucky I am to have a girl like you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his position, he seated his legs up and planted his feet flat before him so he could lean over to give her a peck. Her face flushed from the affection. Setting her small plate of fruit down, she giggled. Judy loved it all. His cheesy lines, his gruff appearance due to his job, and especially the soft demeanor he adopted especially for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute moment suddenly shattered when Rob burst out with a loud curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck these flies!\" He said with a frown. One buzzed off of his knee, barely avoiding a large hand. More of them busily investigated fallen crumbs on the blanket, and zipped around Rob's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another bite of his potato salad, he used his free hand to swat at the increasingly annoying insects. One fly came near, slower than the rest due to an almost unnoticeable malady, and made the gamble of buzzing towards Rob's chest. Ready for action, Rob set the paper plate down and brought his hands together with a clap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! Got you!\" Parting his hands revealed the smashed remains of an over-sized fly across his palm. While he smiled in triumph, Judy clucked in disgust at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retrieved the wicker basket and began sifting through it. \"Really, Rob? On your hands? That is so gross!\" Judy made a gagging noise when he reached for his plate again. \"Use the flyswatter, for goodness sakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the green-coloured plastic mat from her, she passed it over to her boyfriend. She had learned to pack such things whenever they went outside to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome... Prepare for the SWAT, ya little shits!\" Setting his plate aside once more, Rob brandished the cheap fly-swatting tool. Judy rolled her eyes at his silly \"boyish\" behaviour before preparing to cover up the food from the insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Judy snapped a lid over the container of potato salad, ignoring him and lightly humming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching at his blond buzzed-cut hair, he spotted another foolhardy fly land nearby. \"Easy as cake...\" He grinned, feeling no remorse for these tiny \"stupid\" bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping it down, Rob cursed. The fly had easily flown out of danger, buzzing into the air as careless and blissful as ever. It hovered away, heading towards Judy and her plethora of still-uncovered food. Rob however didn't notice; only staring at the blanket with annoyance before grinning enigmatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ants!\" Rob grunted, unimpressed. Surveying the tiny black specks upon the blanket, he smacked the swatter upon a group of them. Judy gasped. \"Oh my...!\" She dropped the plate she just picked up. \"Robbie, there are ants on your plate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering with disgust, Judy began to imagine the invasive insects crawling all over her. She turned to her boyfriend who had set the swatter down and was twisting his thumb upon the blanket. \"They are everywhere for goodness sake,\" She slapped his shoulder. \"Do something before they ruin all my food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strike was anything but powerful, yet he recoiled playfully anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am</i>! The thumb of God serves judgement swiftly and justly.\" Viewing the tiny lives as nothing but mere entertainment, he slid his thumb over a couple more; reducing them to smears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis immature behaviour was simply too much. Judy stacked the containers and stood up. \"Stop joking around and get rid of them - this is disgusting.\" Rob turned away from his work and grinned at her. Not in the mood, she pinched his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owch! Fine, alright!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to appreciate what she had enabled, Judy watched her tall boyfriend stand up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he stood up to his full impressive height for people at normal standards, Bryan cowered in fear as the giant's visage blocked the sun out. He stumbled back and fell onto his back as his neck craned up along the length of the towering giant, the giant face turning downwards at him in a devilish sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan quickly got up and started screaming at the ants to move, he knew what this young man was about to do and his best chance was to get the ant's to disperse fast enough as to delay disaster. The ant's never even looked up from the feast of crumbs they were feeding on in the landscape of the multicolor picnic blanket fabric. Completely ignoring Bryan and his unthreatening size and unable to process the threat of the giant looming above as his scale was beyond their small world. Robs voice thundered above as the ground began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy rolled her eyes as her boyfriend stood up to his full height, hand on his hips attempting to look godly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie stamped his feet in place as he thundered in a deep bellowing voice below \"You have disobeyed your God, now suffer the punishment of the heavens\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie slowly and dramatically raised his long athletically veined bare foot over the group of ants and lowered it as he laughed maniacally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy snorted at this, her boyfriend might be a little on the immature side but this was probably the most efficient way of getting rid of the ants all at once. Robbie had size 14 feet, she almost felt sorry for the ants as he watched her boyfriends sole descend upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan started to run as he watched the giant raise an unbelievably large foot over himself and the unsuspecting ants. The giant was booming something loudly as the giant expansive soul hovered above his form, the foot too large to possibly escape from under in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all hell broke loose as the sole descended, and the proverbial slightly sweaty flesh colored sky fell. Bryan sarcastically thought to himself \"I feel like Chicken Little\" as the giant's sole crashed down upon him. The ant's finally sensing a disturbance and fleeing as fast as they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie was actually having fun. Initially just trying to tease his girlfriend with the overly mach display of pest control, he soon enjoyed the game as he continued exterminating the ant's lucky enough to escape the shadow of his foot after the first stomp. He walked around the small area of the blanket, crashing his feet down on various ant's until their numbers dwindled to zero under his soles. He felt kind of sad after he got them all, but the fuckers had gotten on his girl's nerves and had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down laying opposite his girlfriend, feet crossed at the ankle facing towards her head as he smirked toes wriggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy yelled \"eww gross Rob, you got Ant gut's all over the bottoms of your feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob laughed and grabbed one of his large feet as he slid it up his leg angling the sole facing it towards his face as he saw a battlefield of smeared ant corpses littered across his long large soles. He smirked as he saw some half crushed ants wiggling, trying to escape the rest of their mashed bodies adhered to his sole. He absentmindedly began flicking them off his feet as he talked to his girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

Bryan was in shock, trying to get his bearings as a massive shadow loomed over the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!

Bryan took in every terrifying detail as he gawked, utterly petrified. A hard rubber sole stood over four stories high, it appeared almost new, only lightly grass-stained and mud. The rest of the popular style of sneaker looked positively alien, employing a lime green and black scheme. Its sheer size was almost uncomprehensible, not mentioning the titanic hair-covered leg looming endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous grinding sound chilled the little man as the huge sneakers aggressive tread shifted on the asphalt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed as if in slow motion. Another heavy boom thundered from behind, sound further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I- I need to get out of here!\" His terrified mind managed to process the thought, sending his body into motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man ran...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan awoke the next morning feeling refreshed and eager to start what promised to be a very big day\u2014 in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He saw his pre-labeled package on the table. Bryan picked up the box in one hand. He could hardly believe that, in about seven hours, he would make himself small enough to fit inside the package in preparation for being shipped to his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan placed the box aside and started some coffee. Soon, the aroma of coffee filled the kitchen. After pouring himself a cup, the scientist took a seat at his table. He spooned some sugar from a bowl and sweetened his coffee. A few grains of sugar fell off the spoon and landed on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few sips of the sweetened cup of joe, Bryan sighed and looked at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's mind raced ahead to thoughts about his nephew opening the box and finding him. Bryan tried to imagine what Zack would look like to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis earlier experiments with shrinking had given him an appreciation for the sheer enormous scale of his surroundings, but he had never yet encountered another human being from his drastically reduced perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, dark form crawling across the tabletop drew him out of his daydreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn ants!\" Bryan muttered. He reached for a napkin and used it to reduce the tiny pest to a smear. After wiping up the spilled grains of sugar, which had attracted the tiny ant in the first place, Bryan stood and tossed the napkin into a trash can next to his kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked down at the package and saw something that gave him pause. The ant had arrived with companions. He watched one of the tiny creatures crawl across the address label on the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shiver, Bryan realized that, once he put his plan in action, he would be no bigger than the ant. And, with one careless movement, his nephew would be capable of obliterating Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Bryan paused in his headlong rush to continue with the plan. Still, he reasoned, there should be a way he could give Zack the surprise of a lifetime without putting himself at risk for any undue harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ringing phone startled Bryan. His voice sounded shaky. \"Hi, uh, hello,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Uncle Bry!\" Zack's voice greeted him with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!\" Bryan felt as if the phone call must be a twist of fate. \"I'm really glad to hear from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Zack said. \"I felt bad after our last talk. I didn't mean to act like a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Bryan said. \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You're the greatest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Zack,\" Bryan began, \"I am still sending you that package...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that,\" Zack said. \"You've done enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is something I really want to do,\" Bryan said. \"But I need to tell you a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when the package arrives, treat it carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it fragile?\" Zack inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat,\" Bryan answered. \"It's very important that you open it carefully and take a close look at the contents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Zack said, intrigued by his uncle's precise instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very close look, do you understand?\" Bryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be careful. I wouldn't want to break my present, Uncle B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Bryan said. \"All I want to add is that I think you're in for a big surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed. \"Can't wait, Uncle B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't wait to see you,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for the holidays, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or even sooner,\" Bryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can manage to get away before then,\" Zack said. \"And I know how busy you are at the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know,\" Bryan said, his enthusiasm for his scheme completely restored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't wait to see what this big surprise is,\" Zack said. \"Talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Good bye, Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan made his way back to the kitchen table. He saw that a couple of other ants had joined their companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another napkin in hand, but this time he brushed the ants gently off the table instead of squishing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that your second chance, guys,\" Bryan said aloud. \"I'm going on a trip, so that gives you time to vacate the premises before I return. If you're still here when I get back, all bets are off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to the sink and rinsed out his empty coffee mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked at his watch. He now had time to take a shower and get ready for his big shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hardly wait!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before taking his shower, Bryan made one last check of his preparations. Staring down at the tiny box, soon to serve as his transportation for a trip to California, he felt the electricity of excitement begin to build in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't bother to get dressed after his shower. After using a towel to thoroughly dry his body, he wrapped his towel around his waist and walked barefoot into his kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan took the vial of shrinking formula in his hand. He watched, mesmerized, as he sloshed the pale blue liquid within the glass tube. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe upended the vial and swallowed the contents in a single gulp. The formula remained virtually tasteless except for a faint metallic aftertaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan removed his towel and tossed it onto the kitchen counter. He then moved quickly to use a chair to step onto his kitchen table. Although he had undergone the astonishing process on several other occasions, he still marveled as his surroundings appeared to expand rapidly in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than two minutes the brilliant research scientist shrunk from six feet tall to a mere quarter of an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs on past occasions, his body felt somewhat numb for a few seconds after the shrinkage ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he re-asserted control over his body, Bryan took in his surroundings with the same sense of wonder he had experienced the first time he used the formula to reduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared across the vast expanse of the kitchen table. The shipping package now resembled some large building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began his trek toward the box, eager to dress in the clothes he had shrunk in preparation for this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the box, however, Bryan suffered a rude shock when he saw a bizarre sight. Two lines of ants, each individual ant measuring a full four feet in length, streamed toward and away from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan halted and stared at dozens of the large insects. Each six-legged insect stood at shoulder height to the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Bryan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved with a measure of caution closer to the lines of ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer, he could clearly see antennae twitch on the hideous heads of the segmented insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, he saw that some of the ants held items in their mandibles. A second look identified the items as crumbs of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're stealing my supplies!\" Bryan yelled in anger. The little man rushed forward, nimbly stepping between two ants rushing away from the box with crumbs of food held in their jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched as ants crawled in and out of the small entrance he had cut into the side of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked around and saw that the ants appeared even more numerous. He saw dozens of the insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard a strange grating noise and turned to see an ant heading toward him with its fearsome mandibles clicking. Bryan gasped when he saw this ant looked larger and more sturdy than the worker ants milling around the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prepared to run, but two smaller ants blocked the oncoming ant's path. Bryan used the diversion to slip past the ants and reach the entrance into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan started to make his way inside the box when he met an ant making its exit. The tiny man recoiled and let the ant make its way past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the kitchen door opened. Bryan, startled by the unexpected noise, looked up and watched as Tommy entered, right on time, to pick up the package for mailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's nerves nearly failed him. Nothing could have prepared him for how huge Tommy now looked to him. The teenager looked like a fearsome behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't stop to wonder why Tommy sounded so excited about the discovery of a few ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's take care of this!\" Tommy said, lowering his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift swoop, Tommy scooped the box off the kitchen table, leaving Bryan in shock. \"No!\" The tiny man screamed. \"Tommy! Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shoved the little box into a pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bryan watched, the huge teenager fished in another pocket until his hand withdrew a round glass disc attached to a long silver handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of sunlight shone through Bryan's kitchen window at Tommy's back, perfect for focusing high intensity beams through the mammoth magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the magnifying glass over the tabletop, Tommy narrowed the beam of light and moved the super-charged shaft of energy toward the nearest ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny creature writhed and tried to escape, but Tommy followed its every move with relentless efficiency until the insect sizzled and popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had enjoyed this particular game since he had been a kid. He moved his laser toward another ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan had to shield his eyes from the intense beam of light. He watched horrified as the beam fell onto another ant. He heard the crackling as the ant burned to a quick crisp under the highly focused beam of sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tommy felled a third ant, Bryan realized the teenager meant to obliterate every ant in sight. Unfortunately, Bryan realized, he wouldn't look all that different from the tiny ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Bryan shouted. \"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked around for any possibly hiding place, but found himself completely exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, glancing upward, he saw the beam of light moving across the tabletop toward him. Far above, holding the magnifying glass in a steady hand, Tommy smiled at his trek of carnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As living ants became scarce, the teenager noticed a weird ant that looked paler than the others. Intrigued, he began to pursue the tiny ant, which fled ahead of the path of the unstoppable beam of light across the polished, smooth surface of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had toyed for almost a full minute with the strange, pale little ant, noticing how the tiny creature seemed to anticipate the oncoming beam and try to evade it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost to tired of the game when his friend, Joe, opened the back door and strolled into Mr. Smith's kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing, dude?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zapping ants,\" Tommy said and chuckled. \"It's fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been calling and texting you, dude,\" Joe complained. \"Don't you ever check your phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nearly finished,\" Tommy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the second giant entered the kitchen, Mr. Smith took advantage of the brief reprieve.

He did make out the god-like hand wielding the mammoth magnifying glass that focused mere sunbeams into infernal death rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lethal beam approached, he weaved to the right, attempting to run as fast as possible for a being reduced to the size of a small ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, he saw the fiery beam of light change course, adjusting to follow his every attempt at evasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the back door opened and the tiny man looked away from the beam to follow the entrance of another mega-sized teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATCHA DOING, DUDE?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy lowered the magnifying glass when he saw his best friend, Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZAPPING ANTS,\" Tommy said, He chuckled when he looked down and saw that the weird pale ant was no longer moving. \"IT'S FUN!\" Tommy added for Joe's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Joe, however, complained in a loud voice about texts and phone calls unanswered. \"DON'T YOU EVER CHECK YOUR PHONE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NEARLY FINISHED,\" Tommy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized man listened to the conversation between the two titans as he struggled to catch his breath, regain his strength and formulate a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't trust Tommy's buddy, but at least Joe wasn't chasing him with a death ray trying to burn him to a crisp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to his horror, Tommy raised the magnifying glass again, maneuvering to catch the sunlight at the best angle to produce a perfect zapping beam of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Joe complained some more and watched with a frown as his friend resumed his chase of a pathetic little ant across the surface of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny man ran for his life, he heard Tommy's voice directing Joe's attention toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE, THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THIS BUG,\" Tommy said. Yet again, he gradually directed the beam of light toward the little ant, only to watch it veer away from the beam. \"SEE WHAT I MEAN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe yawned and remarked that he was bored. When he looked down at the table, he saw only a tiny, pale bug, much too small and insignificant to retain his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the tiny scientist took one more opportunity to communicate his true identity to his giant neighbor. \"Yes, look closer,\" Mr. Smith screamed and waved his arms over his head. \"Tommy, it's me! It's Mr. Smith, not a bug. Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON, MAN,\" Tommy said. \"I JUST WANT TO ZAP THIS LAST ANT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man shrieked and ran as fast as he could across the vast plateau of the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BETTER BE CAREFUL, OR YOU'LL BURN A HOLE IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S TABLE,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy scoffed and continued to follow the tiny bug with the incendiary beam right to the edge of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, the shrunken man saw that he was coming toward the edge of the tabletop, which represented an unimaginable abyss for the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a leap off the edge wasn't an option. He was sure he couldn't survive the plunge to the distant floor. He stopped and turned to face his gigantic neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy noticed only that the tiny pale bug had halted its flight.

His instinct told him to run, but he knew he could not possibly run fast enough to escape the two enormous teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PULL UP A CHAIR AND WATCH,\" Joe instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy seated himself just as Joe lifted a bare foot and hovered it over the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized scientist watched the bare foot rise a few inches off the floor and move to cover him. The enormous foot blocked his view of the titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, without applying too much weight, Joe lowered the sole of his bare foot onto the tiles. He caught the speck of a man beneath the arch of his foot, halfway between the heel and his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT YOU DOING MAN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S FUN. I'VE DONE THIS SINCE I WAS A KID.\" Joe explained as he rolled his foot back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WON'T THAT JUST CRUSH THE ANT?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT IF I'M CAREFUL,\" Joe said. He felt a tiny form, no bigger than a grain of sand, provide a hint of resistance between his foot and the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy grinned and began removing his shoes. \"I WANNA GIVE IT A GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe lifted his foot and saw the tiny bug sprawled on the floor. \"BE MY GUEST.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith had been certain the giant meant to stomp him, but Joe had merely trapped him. Then, the cruise ship-sized foot began to roll him back and forth. He had produced unheard screams, begging them to spare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the foot lifted, he imagined he had been heard. Instead, when he weakly turned over on his back and looked up, he saw Tommy removing his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The little man screamed. \"Tommy, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neighbor's foot hovered over him for a moment and then began to move closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Please, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he found himself trapped against a teenager's bare foot. The pressure felt greater, owing to Tommy's inexperience with playing with bugs beneath his bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAREFUL,\" his friend advised. \"IT'S EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY SMUSH THEM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH,\" Tommy said as he began to slowly roll his foot forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FEEL IT?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, I THINK I DO!\" Tommy exclaimed. Indeed, he felt the pinpoint of friction where the tiny body prevented his foot from meeting with the unyielding floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, ROLL YOUR FOOT BACK, GENTLY,\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy followed the instructions, a wide grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ISN'T IT COOL, MAN?\" Joe asked. \"I COULD PLAY WITH THESE TEENY BUGS ALL DAY LONG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy continued to roll the puny ant beneath his bare foot, discovering why Joe found this activity such a thrill. He held absolute control over the tiny creature. The application of the slightest pressure could smear it beneath his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became a game, the challenge being to see how long he could roll the unfortunate bug beneath his foot without accidentally bring too much force to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Too bad you can't teach bugs tricks,\" he joked. \"We could teach it to worship our feet.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only had his next-door neighbor mistaken him for an ant, but had kept him trapped beneath his huge, smelly foot for the past 10 minutes, rolling him over the smooth floor tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly coated in the foot sweat from his time under the bare soles of the two titanic teenagers, the teeny man found himself on his back as Tommy kept him securely imprisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath, and only inhaling more of the rank stench from Tommy's sweaty foot, the shrunken scientist tried not to speculate on how much pressure his tiny body could endure without suffering dire consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suspected that his ordeal had already sent him close to the upper limits of his endurance. \"Please, Tommy!\" He shouted in a hoarse voice. \"Please, lift your foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pressure eased back. The foot, bigger than many an ocean-going vessel, swung out of the way to permit Tommy to stare down at the speck of a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it survived,\" he said. \"Well, more or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man tried to pull enough oxygen into his lungs to revitalize his exhausted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you like that, you pathetic little bug?\" Tommy spoke down to him as if he expected an insect to understand his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed. \"I half expect it to plead with you for mercy, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy wiggled his toes, and the little man's eyes widened as each of the massive appendages flexed. \"That what you want, little bug? Mercy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, please,\" The tiny man said through clenched teeth. \"Tommy, just look closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his strength returning, although with frustrating slowness. He rolled over onto his side, but still could not make his legs work to raise him onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be cool if you could teach it to worship at your feet,\" Joe admitted, referring back to Tommy's earlier comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's far too stupid and puny to ever do anything worth keeping it around,\" Tommy said. \"Might as well put it out of its misery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The little man cried. \"Not that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged. \"Whatever, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy yawned. \"Well, we can always find another ant,\" he said as he moved his foot back into position just as the tiny man got back onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan's foot slammed back into him, forcing him again onto his back. As the foot pressed harder, the hard-won air in his lungs was again squeezed out. The pressure grew, preventing anything but the screaming in the tiny man's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Joe asked. \"Over yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smirked. \"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his foot, again enjoying the friction from the tiny point of resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just being mean,\" Joe laughed in admiration of his friend's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tommy agreed. He did have other things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe increased the pressure, but he wasn't quite expecting the sudden instant when the resistance simply vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed. \"Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy broke into a wide grin. \"Bug's gone, dude!\" Mildly disappointed, he lifted his foot and tilted it for a look at the surprisingly small red dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Tommy asked nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno,\" Joe answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys looked bored. \"Let's go play some videogames,\" Joe finally suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy agreed, but deep down wished he had kept the little bug around a little longer. He really had enjoyed the feeling it gave him to control the fate of something so puny and powerless.</span></div></div>",

He marveled at his good fortune until he realized that the \u201clucky break\u201d represented merely more evidence of his transformed nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of all the times he had observed tiny bugs and ants tumble from tables and counters, seemingly immune from any lethal consequences. Their salvation rested in their extremely tiny size and mass, however\u2026 a trait the former scientist now shared with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis most immediate need upon impact was to pull air into his lungs. The breath had been literally smashed out of his body after his inevitable contact with the floor. As he remained motionless, fighting for air, he pushed aside the pain of his burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could, given enough time, recover from the burns. He idly wondered if the damage inflicted by his gigantic neighbor\u2019s magnifying glass might leave scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would gladly put the nightmare behind him, if only he could succeed in attracting Tommy\u2019s attention without the terrifying possibility the teenager might mistake him for a real bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh wave of pain blurred his vision, making him question why he had ever been so foolish to shrink down to such a small size, making himself totally powerless in a world populated by awesome giants that could destroy him in the blink of an eye and not even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took a few steps toward the table, making a cursory search for the strange little bug that his buddy had so inconveniently blown off the tabletop.

The two teenaged behemoths remained utterly unaware of the scorched \u201cbug\u201d desperately attempting to avoid their destructive feet. The tapping of the one giant's shoe on the tiles sent powerful vibrations and loudly distracted the little man's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as one of Tommy\u2019s huge shoes sailed over him as the teenager moved toward the back door. \u201cYEAH, LET\u2019S GO.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnergized at seeing his only hope depart, the bug-sized man scurried over the enormous kitchen tile. \u201cWait! Don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned and saw Joe staring at the floor. His friend had detected a tiny form sprinting over the flat tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, thinking fast and not wanting to alert his curious friend, lifted his Airwalk a few inches off the floor and maneuvered it over the ugly, burned bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M RIGHT BEHIND YOU,\u201d Joe said, letting his shoe drop on top of the location where he had seen the scurrying bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden action took the tiny man by surprise. So intent on reaching Tommy, he had let himself forget about the presence of the second giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Airwalk looked immense as it hovered only inches over him, blotting out most of the light in the room.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d The tiny man screamed as the shoe dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe could have ignored the bug and spared its life, but he didn\u2019t want Tommy to see it and delay their departure because of his insistence that the \u201cbug\u201d looked strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange or not, it was just another bug, and Joe knew a thing or two about how to deal with bugs.

Well, the giant teenager didn't dwell too long on those fleeting thoughts of how huge he must appear to his neighbor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man who was the object of Tommy's attention stared up, trying to determine what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T WORRY, MR.

Just as the creature raised up, ready for the strike, it quickly stopped and scurried back to it's hiding place. Perplexed, Bryan didn't have to wait long to discover what drove off the spider. Tommy's head was slowly getting closer and closer to the very spot Bryan was stuck in the web. Had he finally seen him? Was he saved from this mess? Hope quickly fleeted away as the top of Tommy's head continued on it's descent. However, Tommy's head brushed against the spiderweb, removing Bryan from one prison into another: Tommy's hair! Even worse, the webbing he was trapped in was twisted and warped around Bryan after it adhered to Tommy's hair, and now he was effectively bound and gagged, trapped in a forest of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the ground around where he was looking, Tommy was unable to find the source of the noise he heard, perhaps he was merely hearing things while frantically looking for his neighbor. Giving up hope and with completely shot nerves, Tommy decides he needs to find a way to relax so he can better find Mr. Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, I need to do something for a bit, why don't you come back a bit later?\" Tommy asked his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, we'll see you later dude.\" And with that, Joe and Andy head out the backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his friends gone, Tommy went upstairs to find something to soothe his mind.</span></div></div>",

To tell the truth, the tiny man felt a little more secure once enormous Andy and gigantic Joe cleared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if he could only get free of the sticky strands of spider silk, he was in an excellent position to gain Tommy's attention and then his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this nightmare will soon be over,\" he dared to hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he anticipated too much too soon.

He tossed the shirt onto his bed, then proceeded to slip out of his pants, underwear, socks and shoes. His frantic search for Mr. Smith had left him stressed and worn out. What he needed now was a warm, relaxing bath. Then, he would look again for his shrunken neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the little man must still be in the house. Tommy just could not understand why Mr. Smith would hide from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stepped in front of the bathroom mirror, which gave the bug-sized man trapped in his hair an unobstructed view of the teenager's muscular, nude body. The tiny man tried to find his own reflection in the mirror, but he was now so small all he could detect was the tangle of spiderweb that had got attached to Tommy's head when he had kneeled over the houseplant in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy moved again, and the tiny man felt his body lurch back and forth.

The silken cords felt sleek but they held him as securely as steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" Tommy spoke again as he closed the cabinet doors.

Nothing in his worst nightmares matched the terror of the spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality no bigger than Tommy's thumbnail, the alien-looking creature looked more terrifying than a lion or tiger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling for the moment on a single silken cord, the ugly spider's lethal-looking fangs glistened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's huge body loomed no more than the length of a ruler in front of his tiny neighbor's location in the web, but none of the shrunken scientist's increasingly frantic pleas for help reached the teenager's ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the trapped man watched, Tommy stood to his feet and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The shrunken man cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the vibrations of the titan's footsteps on the floor grow fainter as the teenager left the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he screamed for Tommy to return, the spider dropped a short distance and reached tentatively with its forelegs to tap at the tiny \"bug\" in its clever trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prey differed from its ordinary victims, such as flies and ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the terrifying fangs reached him, there was a slight sting and then everything drifted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke, the shrunken scientist found himself woven into a silken cocoon from head to foot. Only by the vagaries of chance had the cocoon remained unfinished around his face, allowing him to see and breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have been dead... the giant spider had bitten and poisoned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to turn his head, but found to his surprise he could not move. He tried again, with no more success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move a finger, then a toe. Nothing responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bite had paralyzed but not killed the bug-sized man. Not hungry enough to finish him off, the spider had preserved him and then wrapped him in a silken cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inevitable had only been delayed, unless someone found him in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to scream Tommy's names, but the paralysis also affected his vocal cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his own private hell, he waited for the return of either Tommy or the spider. </span></div></div>",

He looked up in amazement as Joe lifted the silver, blue and red tower of aluminum toward his lips. The titan's huge mouth opened and poured a river of ice-cold, fresh-from-the-fridge soda down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring, his jaw dropped open in amazement, the bug-sized man was totally caught off guard then Joe bellowed out his buddy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, man,\" Joe shouted in his loud, impatient voice. \"Where'd the hell did you get to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man, forced to his knees by the awful, head-splitting sound of Joe's loud voice, looked upward again and screamed when he saw Joe's massive hand lowering the towering can of soda toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming still, he veered out of the way, only to skid on a slick spot near the edge of the countertop. With another, even more shrill scream, he plunged over the cliff of the counter and plummeted toward the distant floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, he realized one benefit of being so small. Although he felt the impact, his much smaller form cushioned the damage, letting him escape with some bumps and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when Joe's massive Airwalks slammed down on the kitchen tiles near him, he realized how temporary his reprieve from danger might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Come on!\" Joe yelled again, not knowing how his loud words caused actual physical pain for a tiny, unseen man on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy raced into the room, a shocked expression on his face as his eyes raced to scan the nearby counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe!

Indeed, his sense of gratitude for all the odd jobs Mr. Smith had arranged for him in the past seemed forgotten as he stared down at the bug-sized man blocked by the barrier represented by Tommy's hand on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cursed when Tommy's enormous hand dropped down to thwart access to the shipping box. Tommy, if he even noticed Bryan's irritation, didn't show any sign of concern. Instead, he moved his hand and lifted the small box off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't think you will need this,\" he informed the tiny, stunned scientist. \"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took a few steps away from the table, opened a cabinet door and stashed the box within the kitchen cabinets, far beyond tiny Bryan's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched in amazement every move made by his undeniably handsome, enormous employee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pushed back one of the chairs and took a seat at Mr. Smith's kitchen table. He grinned as he stared at the puny, pale figure cowering in full view of his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan tried admirably to shield himself from Tommy's prying eyes, but only succeeded in drawing the giant youth's attention to parts he would rather have kept under wraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed and, without warning, pulled off his T-shirt. \"Wow, it's hot in here, don't you think, Mr. Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt his mouth gape open as he stared at the muscular torso of the young giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, pleased with the expected reaction, stretched and flexed for his appreciative audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized how Tommy was leading him by the nose, or rather by one part of his anatomy, but he felt helpless to tear his gaze from the incredible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is your lucky day, Mr. Smith,\" Tommy said. \"I can stay here, as planned, and look after your house and make sure you are in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll only help me grow back, I wouldn't need you to...\" Bryan began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked at the tiny man. \"In fact, I think I will call over...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tapped on the glass walls of his neighbor's prison before striding out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Come back! I forbid you to bring anyone into this house!\" The little ant-sized man tried to give orders that went unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, both the giant teenagers returned to the kitchen. Although the wall of glass tended to distort everything, Mr. Smith could not help but stare at them in awe. Formerly skinny teenagers, Tommy and his friend now looked like impossibly huge titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I got something to show you!\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Joe asked, rising to the bait. \"Oh, by the way, could not get hold of the guys. I guess it's just us this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy picked up the water glass, sending Mr. Smith careening from side to side in the deep container. Handing the glass to Joe, Tommy invited him to look inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked, then frowned. \"So? It's just a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man screamed in frustration. \"I am a man, not a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closer,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe brought the glass closer to his face. \"Oh, shit! It's a tiny, little dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man!\" Tommy said. \"It's my neighbor.

He screamed in terror, landing in the middle of Joe's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, he really is tiny,\" Joe said, staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! Make him put me down!\" The outraged little man screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him on the table,\" Tommy said. \"I want to show you the TV set in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe tilted his hand and the little man fell off the suddenly steep slope of the giant hand. He was still checking himself for bruises when he heard Joe's voice loud and clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another one!\" Joe said. \"Another tiny man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teenagers looked at the floor, but Tommy laughed. \"Naw, that's a real bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without missing a beat, he raised his shoe and stomped the filthy bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have those things crawling around near Mr. Smith,\" Tommy said. \"They could be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titans left the kitchen, leaving a shaken, terrified little man in their wake. Mr. Smith replayed Tommy's stomping of the helpless, tiny bug, only his brain edited the footage to insert him into the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Mr. Smith cried. \"I'm in the hands of two blundering, over-sized morons.\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't really like the way Joe looked at him, both irritated and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken when Joe's phone rang. In his haste to answer the phone, he leaped up from his seat, bumping the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe never even noticed his action, but Mr. Smith felt the explosive force as the teenager rocked the entire table and jettisoned him into space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AaahhhhH!\" He screamed as he fell toward the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapped up with his phone call, Joe glanced at the table and saw a pale form crawling over the wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you wouldn't believe what Tommy has me doing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the phone pressed to his ear, he didn't hear the tiny screams coming, not from the tabletop, but from the floor near his gigantic sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the little man had been ripped from the haven of the kitchen tabletop to the perilous floor tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe!\" He shouted, desperate to make himself heard. \"You idiot!

Each time, he saw the pale, tiny form crawling erratically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird little dude, the teenager thought to himself. Why doesn't he just stay put?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, had he looked closer, he might have noticed that the tiny form on the tabletop belonged to an ordinary little ant. The timely arrival on the scene by the tiny insect had ensured that the teenager hadn't noticed the absence of his friend's shrunken neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt parched, so he walked toward the fridge, never noticing  when his sneakers slammed down, forcing the bug-sized scientist to run for his life in his own kitchen!</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, the little speck of a man kept  pacing in random circles on the polished tabletop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK, Mr. Smith?\" The titan bellowed down at the bug-sized figure on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scurrying form paused. \"I forgot\u2026 I can't hear you, anyway,\" Tommy said, but he misinterpreted the halt in the creature's movement as a signal that all was OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell is he talking to?\" Mr. Smith shouted as he gazed up at the two massive teenagers. When Tommy had taken the steps to the table, one of his equally massive sneakers had almost taken out the shrunken scientist. The little man still shuddered as he recalled that second of absolute, freezing terror when the shadow of the sneaker had come down on him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.missing him by mere inches. And then, with amazing speed, the sneaker had taken another step and left him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to stare up at his huge teenaged neighbor, Tommy put his hands on the table and looked down at the speck. Something wasn't quite right\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, come here,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summons brought those colossal Airwalks closer to Mr. Smith, who most certainly didn't want any place near those lethal, enormous shoes. Fortunately, Joe, like Tommy, stepped over the shrunken man and stood next to his friend, staring down at the tabletop and oblivious to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing it again,\" Tommy said. \"Running around like that\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Joe asked, not bothering to hide his irritation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's he doing it?\" Tommy wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Joe said. \"Why would he shrink himself down to the size of a damn ant? He's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tommy said, not disagreeing with any of his friend's assessment of his neighbor. \"But I am not sure that's\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 he leaned closer and really focused his eyes on the scurrying little creature. Nothing matched. It looked dark and tiny. It had more than two legs, unless Mr. Smith was crawling on hands and knees\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe, you're a moron!\" Tommy shouted angrily. \"That's not even Mr. Smith! It's a freakin' ant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe looked closer, and laughed sheepishly. \"Well, hell,\" he said. \"I think you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy slammed his hand down on the tiny creature, which disappeared into oblivion from one distracted, casual blow from the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Me? How did I lose him?\" Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind! We have to find him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith listened to the conversation with increasing awareness. \"Yes, Tommy will look for me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn preparation, he ran toward Tommy's shoes. He waved his arms to attempt to gain the huge teenager's attention. \"Here! On the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned. \"We've got to look for him.\" He scanned the table. \"Where could he have gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell off the table,\" Mr. Smith shouted. \"I'm on the floor, down here at\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy moved. Once again, a dark shadow fell over the little man, who found his mouth open in a gape as he was suddenly too terrified to even scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe dropped down as Tommy walked across the kitchen floor. \"He's got to be nearby,\" he said. \"Help me look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe groaned. \"Your neighbor's a real pain, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys searched, Tommy a little more diligently than Joe, for nearly half an hour. They found no trace of a tiny man. Of course, Tommy never thought to look into the tread of his left sneaker, where a close examination might have found some remains of the squished little bug-man who had been pulverized in an instant, stomped just as the enormous teenager was beginning his search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he will turn up,\" Joe offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy just frowned. \"I can't believe you thought that ant was Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did, too, for a moment,\" Joe countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I would know the difference between Mr. Smith and some bug!\" Tommy protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe suddenly got an idea. \"Maybe that ant ate Mr. Smith! He was awfully tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy never figured out the mystery, but he wasn't adjusting his thinking. After all, he probably destroyed countless bugs in the course of daily life and never even knew it. What was one more little bug stomped and squished beneath his feet? He would never be the wiser. </span></div></div>",

He looked down at the tabletop, but he expected to see something tiny and his eyes obliged his expectations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" the teenager said. \"We'll keep you safe, Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joe added in a sulky tone. \"We won't let any big, nasty bugs eat you for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Tommy ordered. \"Don't listen to him, Mr. Smith. If we see any bugs, I'll take care of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said!\" Joe objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you were trying to scare him,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the floor, Bryan listened to the titans talking about him and grew ever more frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! That's not me on the table,\" he shouted in vain. \"I'm down here! On the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a drink,\" Tommy announced unexpectedly. \"You want something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged. \"No, thanks. I'll just keep an eye on your itty-bitty neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, Mr. Smith braced himself as Tommy's footsteps rocked the tiles beneath the bug-sized man's feet. He tried to force himself to feel braver than he actually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!' He ran toward the titan's advancing sneakers. \"Here I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about his tiny, darting movements must have succeeded... at least in part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Tommy said, pausing in his trek to Mr. Smith's fridge. \"There's another one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another what?\" Mr. Smith and Joe asked at the same time. Only Joe's question registered with Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ant. Here on the floor,\" Tommy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be getting into the house through some crack or something,\" Joe said. He stood up from his seat at the table and walked over to stand next to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Mr. Smith gazed up as the two titans stared down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! It's a mistake! I'm not a bug!\" The little man screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I get to do Mr. Smith does another favor and exterminate this one, too,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe laughed. \"Look at it. It's not even got the sense to try and run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy turned back toward the table. \"Mr. Smith, you're gonna owe me some extra pay for acting as your exterminator,\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good one,\" Joe said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Look closer! It's me!\" Mr. Smith screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the table one last time, Tommy tried to assure his neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mr. Smith. I'll be glad to take care of your bug problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he turned back toward the ant on the floor. It still hadn't moved far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at the last second, it tried a burst of speed to evade Tommy when the teenager lifted one of his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye-bye, bug,\" Tommy said, stomping down and  finally squishing .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to make certain, he doesn't just step on it. He scraped his sneaker several times from side to side, reducing the pesky ant to nothingness and a thin layer of film on the underside of the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, who had watched everything with amusement, sat down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it!\" Tommy shouted in warning. \"You'll sit on Mr. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's still here,\" Joe said, seeing the little man still racing around like mad. He lowered a fingertip and said, \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tommy... come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Tommy asked, coming over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is an ant, too,\" he said. He pointed with his fingertip almost on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy squinted. \"Hell, you're right! So, where is Mr. Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stood up, and both he and Tommy started scanning the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that ant ate him?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid,\" Tommy said. \"It's barely the same size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy got on his knees and looked under the table. Joe stood behind him and noticed the undersides of Tommy's sneakers. The dirty soles were smeared with the remains of little bugs and ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, man, your soles are really dirty,\" Joe said. \"I think I see some bug legs smashed on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about that?\" Tommy snapped. \"We've got to find Mr. Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they never did, and Tommy never put two and two together to come to the conclusion that a case of mistaken identity had been Mr. Smith's undoing.</span></div></div>",

A bit spoiled, Joe's family had their own state-of-the-art entertainment center at their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to stay here much longer, are we?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we are,\" Tommy answered. As he spoke, he flipped through the channels using Mr. Smith's remote control. \"I can't just leave Mr. Smith on his own. He's so tiny and helpless. I've got to keep an eye on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Joe said, less than thrilled to find himself roped into babysitting for a grown man the size of an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tommy fully engaged with Mr. Smith's television, Joe wandered back into the kitchen. Instead of giving any attention to the speck-sized scientist on the table, the teenager opened the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the tabletop, tiny Mr. Smith watched in disbelief as the teenager not only ignored him but raided the fridge as if he wasn't even in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could ask permission,\" the tiny man said aloud, knowing his voice would never reach the titan's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe grabbed what he wanted from the fridge and, making a stop at a cabinet on the way to grab a bag of chips, made his way to the table. He lowered the bag and a huge, white plastic container onto the tabletop as he settled into one of the chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith, near the center of the table, struggled to identify the objects the massive teenager placed on the wooden plain. Reading the wording on the green and white label on the round, plastic container, he recognized it as Onion Dip. Looking up again toward Joe, he saw the titan rip open the bag of Scoop chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man summoned some courage and moved closer. \"What do you think you're doing?\" He challenged Joe in a squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe munched on the chips, scooping up dip with each bite. He eyed the tiny man moving closer. He heard some faint squeaks, realized the shrunken man must be trying to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Can't hear you, little dude,\" he said, spraying some crumbs and tiny globs of dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted, the tiny man tried to scrape off the pulverized crumbs that dropped from the giant's mouth onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry,\" Joe said, not altogether in a convincing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he got an idea.Taking one of the chips, he used it to chase the little man across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the huge edible scoop approaching, tiny Mr. Smith tried to flee. He didn't get far before he was scooped into the massive, edible structure and lifted off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs he going to eat me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man screamed, but the teenager didn't open that cavernous mouth. Instead, a huge grin formed on the features just before Joe tilted the chip and dropped the tiny man into the dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming the entire way, Mr. Smith landed with a squishy plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is he doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched to see what the titan's next move would be. Joe, spying the tiny man in the dip, lowered one of his fingers into the container. He used the huge digit to push the tiny man beneath the surface of the clinging dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the terrified little man surfaced, coated by the thick dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron!\" He squeaked in outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot listening, Joe grabbed the dip and chips. He walked back into the living room. Tommy, now seated on the sofa, looked at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This TV set is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, grinning, put the dip and chips on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Tommy said, scooping some dip after taking a single chip from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe watched, fascinated, and then somewhat disappointed when Tommy's chip came nowhere close to the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how's Mr. Smith?\" Tommy asked after he swallowed the bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Joe lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Fine! The moron has dumped me in the dip!\" The listening little man screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Joe had a plan beyond just randomly subjecting the shrunken scientist to horrible peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to play the hero, perhaps become the \"savior of the day\" by pretending to discover the tiny man in the dip at the last moment and bringing about a last-second rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy scooped up some more dip. \"Well, we better get back to Mr. Smith soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe noticed the second scoop had again missed the little man mired in the enormous container of dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps now was the time to suddenly notice the \"speck\" in the dip\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on the verge of doing just that when his phone beeped to announce the arrival of a text message. He pulled the phone from his pocket and viewed the text as Tommy scooped a third helping of dip from the container.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joe started typing out a response on his phone when a heard a loud crunch. His body tense with shock, Joe slowly lifted his face to stare at Tommy. He was still very much focused on the TV; its light bathing his face in an eerie bluish glow. His jaw moved up and down rhythmically as he chewed up another chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe flicks his eyes downwards at the jar of dip. Where there had been a tiny man, there was now a gaping crater. Joe stares again at Tommy, focusing on his mouth. Watching as his lips parted with every smack and gulp. Joe could just barely see glimpses of the food as the crunches slowly turned to smacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hold it back Joe uttered \u201cOh shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had still been thrashing while yelling at the top of his lungs towards Joe when it happened. He had only a moment\u2019s warning when he had suddenly been placed in shadow. For the second time in the last few minutes, a massive chip was scooping him up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Tommy, wait!\u201d he screamed ineffectually. He gaped at the wide thumbnail grasping the end of the chip. Every minuscule clump of dirt trapped in the nail was easily the size of a basketball or more to the tiny man. It was hard to believe it was simply the fingertip of the boy next door! The boy who in mere moments would eat him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy\u201d Mr. Smith pleads, staring upwards in desperation. For a moment the chip pauses, as Tommy becomes especially interested in what\u2019s happening on the TV. Not an ounce of attention goes to the simple piece of food in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith screams wordlessly, mentally willing Tommy to look down. He glares at Joe, \u201cYou prick! You put me into this, let me free!\u201d he rages. The other teenager however is focused solely on his phone, a fact confirmed by the disengaged expression on his face as he stares at the device in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lurch upwards signals the chip is moving again. \u201cTommy, no!\u201d Mr. Smith begs again. Tommy\u2019s eyes however are still locked into the screen in the distance. As his mouth yawns open, his tongue slides out like a monster. The light from the room and television lights up his cavernous mouth, giving it a truly ominous appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpread across the tongue are soggy, chewed clumps of chip amongst smears of dip. The jagged teeth glint in the light, food remains compacted into every crevice. The tongue stretches back until it descends into the darkness of the throat, above which the long uvula hangs. Back there is where all the food goes. Permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith screams again, in rage, agony, and fear all at once. However his titanic teenaged neighbor never noticed the sound or the tiny addition to his snack. Tommy would unknowingly send him deep within his body like a piece of food! And he wouldn\u2019t even realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chip hits the tongue, it withdraws into the mouth rapidly. Tommy\u2019s long fingers release the food and his mouth clamps shut, instantly surrounding Mr. Smith in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second of hesitation, everything erupts into utter chaos. All Mr. Smith can hear are ear-splitting crunches as he struggles to find a stable spot amongst the thrashing teeth and flailing tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith heard a strange ringing sound amongst the cacophony of crunches and smacks within the mouth. He realized a second later it was himself, screaming in pure terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy asked, surprised by Joe\u2019s random statement. When he didn\u2019t get a response, Tommy turned to face Joe. Immediately he leaned away in confusion after noticing Joe\u2019s intense stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Tommy asks pointedly, spewing bits of soggy chip crumbs as he continues to chew. Joe can still see the food as Tommy chews and moves it around his mouth. He can\u2019t imagine the tiny man inside of Tommy\u2019s mouth. He can\u2019t imagine him surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Joe is going to explain himself, Tommy purses his lips and swallows. Joe surprised and still imagining the tiny man\u2019s fate starts coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d Tommy exclaims, smacking Joe on the back. Joe clears his throat and glances down at his phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Tommy asked. Never one to admit guilt, Joe looked up and hurriedly replied, \u201cNothing!\u201d This was meant with a suspicious look from Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI read the text wrong, I thought it meant something it didn\u2019t!\u201d Joe insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you stared at me?\u201d Tommy insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe snorted, \u201cNo! I was thinking! I don\u2019t want to see your ugly ass face more than I need to!\u201d He punctuated the end if his sentence with a punch to Tommy\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a retard!\u201d Tommy shot back, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you put something in my food!\u201d Joe gasped, though Tommy didn\u2019t notice. Instead he chuckled and thankfully let the subject drop. Tommy reached down into the bag of chips and snagged yet another one. He scooped another hearty helping of dip and brought it up to his lips as he flipped through the channels to find something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe couldn\u2019t rip his gaze away as Tommy\u2019s tongue flowed out of his mouth, tiny chunks of chewed food coating its surface. A second later the dip loaded chip was resting on the tongue as it withdrew into the mouth and Tommy started loudly chewing. He literally had no clue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe stared at the wall , \u201cNo one will ever figure this out... Not even Tommy will know! We\u2019ll\u2026 we\u2019ll just figure a bug got \u2018em or something\u201d Joe thought to himself. \u201cBesides it\u2019s not my fault he decided to get so small! I\u2026 I don\u2019t even know this weirdo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe, having absolved himself of any guilt, leaned back and finally finished his reply text. He reached forward to begin snacking on the delicious chips and dip, putting his friend\u2019s tiny neighbor out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Joe had no way of knowing was that Mr. Smith\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan Smith spent the better part of the morning attending to the final details of his impulsive scheme. When he was satisfied he had taken care of every single detail, he carried the packing box to his kitchen table, placing the carton a few inches from the napkin holder and the paired salt and pepper shakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cardboard carton, he had placed insulation to cushion his journey and also stashed the antidote that, eventually, he would need to grow back to normal size. He looked down at the tabletop, feeling the excited fluttering of butterflies in his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the room to take a quick shower. Afterward, he didn't bother getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be the point?\" Bryan asked himself. \"After all, once I shrink, they definitely won't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he had also placed some tiny pre-shrunk garments inside the shipping carton. He could use wear those once he arrived in Zack's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe research scientist walked barefoot into his kitchen. Bryan's eyes focused on the gleaming glass tube he had left on the countertop near his microwave. He took the vial of shrinking formula in his hand. He watched, almost hypnotized, as he sloshed the pale blue liquid within the glass tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" he joked aloud and upended the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed the liquid in a single gulp. The formula remained rather bland except for a faint metallic aftertaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt the surge of inner heat that seemed to radiate out in waves. He had felt the sensation on previous occasions, and he knew he had to move fast. By the time he walked a few steps toward the kitchen table, he had already lost a couple of feet of height and was shedding inches rapidly. The swiftly working shrinking agent fooled even his intellectual brain into thinking that the room was expanding in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped on the seat of a kitchen chair as he lost approximately half of his size. He had to use the chair as a step onto the surface of his kitchen table. Although he had undergone the astounding transformation on several other occasions, he still marveled as his surroundings appeared to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked across the tabletop, toward the shipping carton. Even as he got closer to the box, it grew larger... and larger still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the space of mere moments, the brilliant research scientist shrunk from six feet tall to a mere quarter of an inch.  As on past occasions, his body felt somewhat numb for a few seconds after the shrinkage ceased. He looked around his kitchen, almost breathless at comprehending his familiar world from the lowly status of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he re-asserted control over his body, Bryan took in his surroundings with the same sense of wonder he had experienced the first time he used the formula to reduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared across the vast expanse of the kitchen table. The shipping package now resembled some large building far away on the horizon. He continued his trek across the level tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an awful sound split the silence. Taken completely by surprise, the loud ringing noise panicked him into flight, and the tiny man took shelter near the colossal napkin holder as the almost deafening sound repeated at regular intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third blast of sound, the little man recognized both the sound and the pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my phone,\" Bryan said, laughing at how something as mundane as a ringing phone had caused him to seek shelter in a blind panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang a few more times before the ringing stopped. \"Sorry,\" Bryan quipped out loud. \"I can't reach the phone. Leave a message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about ready to leave the shelter of the napkin holder when another sound, even louder, assaulted his ears. He heard pounding at the front door, and almost at the same time, someone began beating on the back door in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cowered and covered his ears with his hands. \"What the hell?\" Bryan wondered. \"It's too early for Tommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BREAK IT DOWN!\" A man's loud voice roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere followed a horrible crash as the back door flew open, admitting three men in black uniforms and heavy black boots stormed into his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man, watching from hiding, recognized one of the black-clad giants as the head of security for EDL Labs. Bryan knew him as a no-nonsense by-the-book type of man. He remembered that his name was Andre Franklin, a strong, muscular black man who looked huge even when Bryan wasn't shrunken to the size of a bug and gazing up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing here?\" Bryan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre barked out orders for the other two guards. \"I WANT HIS COMPUTER AND ANY DATA STORAGE DEVICES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men stomped out of their room, their big black boots stomping on the floor boards with enough force to send vibrations through the floor and into the table, shaking the tiny research man's footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's main work for the past decade had been on developing anti-cholesterol drugs, but he had used the lab's resources to work on his own secret project. Terrified of the huge security guards, he cowered in his hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was helpless to intervene as Andre walked to the edge of the table and reached down, taking the shipping package into his hand. The tiny, unseen man prayed that he would simply put the package back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck! Andre slipped the package into a wide pocket in his uniform jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan wanted to scream. The package held his only available supply of shrinking antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, the two men re-appeared, carrying Bryan's computer and a box with DVDs and memory drives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO SIGN OF DR. SMITH, SIR,\" one of them informed Andre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO PROBLEM,\" Andre said grimly. \"WE CAN DEAL WITH DR. SMITH LATER. THE BOARD WANTS ALL COPIES OF THE PERSONAL RESEARCH THE EINSTEIN WAS DEVELOPING ON THE SIDE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, tiny Bryan realized the reference to \"Einstein\" wasn't being spoken in any manner complimentary to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS TAKE THAT STUFF BACK TO THE LAB,\" Andre ordered. \"I AM GOING TO WAIT FOR DR. SMITH TO GET HOME.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID HE DO, ANYWAY?\" One of the men asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S ON NEED-TO-KNOW,\" Andre said. \"LET'S JUST SAY THAT THE GOOD PROFESSOR IS IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT IF I GET MY HANDS ON HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug-sized professor followed the conversation with an increasing sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The firm needed someone to safeguard its corporate secrets, and he employed a methodical, focused precision to the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when he discovered that Bryan T. Smith, one of the laboratory's senior researchers, had managed to thwart his elaborate security protocols, the chief took the affront personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, muscular man moved around Mr. Smith's kitchen with a confident stride and an arrogant indifference to privacy. He didn't really understand scientists, much less their work, but Mr. Smith had apparently been involved with some amazing extracurricular research. If the scientist hadn't bypassed some of the lab's safeguards to smuggle out some of his \"personal\" research, the suspicions of the security chief would never have been triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he saw very little practical use for a \"shrinking\" formula, the company's CEO saw things differently. His orders had been quite firm and carefully phrased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me Smith and his research, and we'll overlook the fact that he developed his personal project with company resources right under your nose, Mr. Franklin,\" the CEO instructed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it done, sir,\" he promised the CEO, who regarded him coldly from behind his huge desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, Franklin, keep this under wraps. Consider it need-to-know, and I think it best that just you and I know for now. I don't want word getting out before we can analyze how we will market this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin, still on the defensive, had been firm in his reply. \"Sir, you have nothing to worry about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he waited impatiently in the wayward research scientist's home. He studied the surroundings. Surprisingly, he made notice of the fact that Smith lived quite modestly. If he had set out to swindle the company, no evidence showed that he had yet profited from his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security chief tried to recall everything he knew about the man. When he had bothered to notice Smith around the lab, the scientist had not made much of an impression. But then the security chief had never cared much for intellectual types. In general, he distrusted what he didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ringing phone interrupted his pacing back and forth in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is it?\" Franklin barked impatiently into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his men informed him that they had placed the computer and other equipment under lock and key. \"Any sign of Smith, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security chief's gaze during his conversation on his phone strayed to the surface of the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's not showed up,\" he said. \"I will stay here a little longer and then head back to the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke into his phone, he noticed something pale and tiny near the edge of a napkin holder near the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended his call as he moved his hand into position to slap the tiny pest crawling over the tabletop...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The massive shape slapped down at him at a speed that made running totally pointless. Closing his eyes, gritting his teeth and trying not to cower, Bryan braced himself to be wiped out of existence by the unobservant security chief.<br>\r\nThe loud slap as the hand contacted the table, combined with a rapid change in air pressure nearly burst the scientists ear drums but even as he clapped his hands to his ears in pain he realised that he was still alive. Miraculously he had managed to fit into a small gap at the base of two giant fingers.<br>\r\nHe was about to congratulate himself on his survival when the hand lurched forwards slightly and the join between the two fingers slammed into him even as the hand lifted off the table, taking the little scientist with it.<br>\r\nHe barely had time to register what had happened, screaming in combined terror and excitement, before the hand came in contact with heavy black fabric. As the hand scooted across the fabric, wiping what should have been a man-shaped smear off it, Bryan found himself ripped out of his temporary sanctuary, caught on a fold of material.<br>\r\nAs the hand pulled away, the tiny professor had a split second to gather his bearings before he toppled backwards into the hip pocket of the massive security chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a boring hour sitting at the table, Franklin stood up and, after double checking the security devices were active, left through the kitchen door. </span></div></div>",

Using his other hand he brushed it off, sending it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brian screamed desperately as the huge hand crashed into his tiny form sending him flailing to the floor.

Please don't crush me!\" Brian cried out pitifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniscule man cowered as the huge Vibram-soled boot encompassed the sky. Mr. Smith noticed the menagerie of things stuck in the heavy tread. Clumps of mud littered with bits of grass, bits of flattened food, and dozens of crushed insects, a few seemed to be moving still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" He screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith took in these details in the split second the boot loomed over him. Convinced he was to end up as another unnoticed insect, he closed his eyes. There was a massive BOOM behind him, that shook him like an earthquake. Brian nervously turned to see the mammoth scuffed heel of the boot. It had stepped over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped n relief as he watched the hulking security chief  lumber through a doorway that closed behind him with a dull boom. Brian squinted up at the colossal door taking it in. He recognised it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security chief had brought him to the opposite side of the complex.

With his partner gone the titan walked towards the backdoor. Which happened to be right in the path of Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian screamed as the unaware titan's heavy, black combat boots loomed over him. There was no carves in these boots, as they were filled in with muck from the titan's previous mission. These landing on Brian would mean certain death. Right as it was about to land on him something dropped next to him. The boot returned to its original position. And suddenly the titan bent over and its face, covered by a full helmet only allowing part of its eyes to be seen, was right above him. Brian began jumping up and down hoping the titan would see him. And for a moment he was ecstatic as the thick gloved hand reached towards him. But it grabbed the dropped thing, which turned out to be a keycard and since Brian was so close to it, he went along for the ride. The hand coiled around him, almost protectively, and Brian found himself falling, as the titan deposited him into his chest pocket on his black, combat top, slowly zipping the zip on his chest pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the chest pocket was incredibly dark and dusty, and Brian choked for a minute as the dust went to his lungs. He was thrown about every now and then, as the titan jumped, dived, climbed or did something involving lots of movement. Brian assumed the titan was on a mission due to all the movement and the fast heartbeat he could hear when he pressed himself against the walls. He couldn't signal to the titan he was in the pocket, as the inside of the pocket was very thick due to being a combat top. However Brian noticed something that he could escape in. In the very corner of the pocket was a hole. It wasn't very big but Brian could probably tear it enough to fit through. However would the risk be worth it? Brian...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dreading the thought of him falling from this height, Bryan began slowly descending the sweaty chest, not thinking of where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Bryan the titan stopped running, and even better stopped moving overall. Bryan's world lurched as he felt the titan going down, and since he was still upright he assumed the titan had taken a seat. This made descending even easier and Bryan with the adrenaline made breakneck progress. And ,unnoticed by Bryan, he had began climbing on the titan's treasure trail.

He noticed the flaccid cock above him finally descend down and screamed as it landed on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it wasn't for long as the titan snapped back his boxers shorts trapping Bryan into near darkness then gave his mighty package an affectionate pat while small for the titan this was huge for Bryan as this small pat threw him off the already slippery scrotum and caused him to slip down into the canyon of the titan's package.

Bryan couldn't help himself and he ended up biting down on the scrotum and he felt salty juice fill into his mouth that he was forced to swallow. The pressure suddenly stopped and Bryan felt a tense situation as he felt almost fear as the package that had once been crushing him suddenly was normal and almost felt lighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier was bored on the journey to pick up some soldiers and so when the leader asked for someone to volunteer to head towards the soldiers to lead them back to the van he jumped and got picked.

Desperate not to embarrass himself in front of these ladies he lowered his hand to his package and pressed deeply and was shocked to suddenly feel almost a bite on his package!

After minutes of this situation constantly becoming worse as the package became more and more heated, Bryan eventually passed out underneath the titan's ballsack due to heatstroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan woke up hours later stirred by the sudden movement of the titan. With the sudden down step, Bryan assumed they were exiting the van and heading back towards the site, and with this his lab and the possibility of manufacturing a new antidote! With renewed strength he toughed out the situation he was in, glad as he felt the sweltering conditions suddenly cool down with a cold breeze and the exit of the stuffy van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was large movement, and having experienced this a few times already, Bryan realized the titan was taking off his trousers and boxers!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Squinting up at the door, Bryan could only fathom how huge it was. On more than one occasion during his tenure working here, he had passed through this very door without much thought. Simply walking through the portal, often held open for him by one of many security men, and continuing down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bloody likely I will be getting through here,\" He cursed. Looking both ways confirmed this: a thick mountain of dirty black weather stripping effectively sealed the underside of the door. \"No bugs allowed in the laboratory!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned after voicing that. Such a statement only reminded him what he had foolishly done to himself. With his previously thought impossible breakthrough, Bryan had only managed to blundered into serious trouble with the government run lab, and reduce his size to that of an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at the humongous door, he could just see the profile of a titanic security guard through the lofty window. \"Looks like Donny, or Hank... If only they would open the door for me now. I've gotta find another route!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite the task lay ahead of him. Even at such an insignificant size, the lab would be difficult to infiltrate. EDL Labs prided itself on the cleanliness of both space and equipment. This level of cleanliness included zero tolerance for \"<i>foreign agents</i>\", as the night janitor called them, but otherwise known as bugs. Bryan had truthfully seen the occasional fly or roach, but never to an extent that it interfered with their experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be some way,\" Bryan said. \"Really, this place is quite filthy...! Dirt, grime, and shit all over the floor - there's gotta be an entrance for those damn bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently unknown to the overzealous janitor, but overtly noticeable to tiny Bryan, was a positive menagerie of mud, pebbles, grit, and other varieties littering the floor. Simply dotting the tremendous expanse of tiled linoleum in every see-able direction. The janitor would have a fit if only he knew how filthy the space was on a macro level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly walking where the moulding met the floor, Bryan had been looking down one end of the hallway in search of any gaps or cracks in the wall when a tremendous crash broke the silence. He looked off to see a huge man step through a door and slam it shut behind him. The titan was clad in such familiar dark gear as worn by the military-contracted security, but Bryan only looked upon him momentarily before he spotted the massive beast flanking the huge man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good!\" He breathed quietly, as if the tremendous canine could hear him. \"Don't come this way you dumb fucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to spite him, the oblivious guard nodded at the dark-furred hound and directed it down the hallway - headed right for Bryan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth guard was still very far away, but gaining quickly with each massive step. The huge dog was kept in-check by a thick black leash, held tightly in the giant man's gloved grip. Bryan didn't care, as he could only remember what experience and knowledge he had of these well-trained hounds. Some of which shifted into gear when the dog began snuffling the air with curiosity. It turned to the ground, pressing a huge nose into the baseboard as it sniffed. With a deep, indiscernible thunder the huge man pulled the dog along, keeping his heavily concussive pace down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his gawking was costing precious seconds, he turned to the looming baseboard immediately his right. Scuffed with dirt, lightly stained in spots, but overall intact, Bryan nearly screamed with frustration. He needed someplace to hide: and fast, or risk being discovered! Worse; the gigantic dog might inadvertently smash him or eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lip, he scanned frantically and broke into a trot along the span of wall. Suddenly, Bryan gasped. \"Oh my God, yes!\" He locked onto a section of baseboard that lifted off the floor with age. It created a cavernous space, merely centimeters in height, but more than enough for Bryan's minute form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the ground begin to tremble and concussive booms sounding off, Bryan bolted for the safety. He swept past a crumb, leaped over a pile of dust, and slid into the roomy gap with a thankful squeak. Huddled inside, Bryan began to feel the steady vibrations grow heavier and more powerful, accompanied by a terrifying rumble of breathing. The shrunken man finally felt like the bug-sized fugitive he was; hiding from a gigantic security guard and his Cerberus-sized dog. Worst of all, they weren't even looking for him, much less did this guard in particular know Bryan existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook violently, thunderous thuds audible. Dust rained upon Bryan's head with each concurrent vibration. It was akin to being in a bomb shelter during the blitz. Worst of all, he could hear the now roaring sound created by the dog's sniffing and breathing. Bryan couldn't keep himself from shaking. With a powerful gale, all dust and particles visible outside were suddenly blown away with huge powerful gusts. Bryan squealed despite himself: the dog was upon him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping from one scenario to another, Bryan found himself assaulted by flurries of vile wind that buffeted against his hiding spot. It felt now as if he had been dropped into a hurricane beyond any measurable chart of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Leeeaaave meee aloooooneee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny plea was immediately lost and reduced to shrieks of terror when his view was clocked by a cosmic mass of moist, dark flesh. Bryan pressed himself almost flat against the back of the wall. The air had become so foul and humid that his body began convulsing with heaves of revulsion. The huge blockage lifted away suddenly and allowed only a split second of fresh air before being replaced by something worse. Bryan found himself doused in thick gobs of saliva that scraped from the huge beasts tongue. He spat mouthfuls out, screaming vainly as he did, but to no effect. The squishy wall of pink flesh returned over and over in an attempt to rouse the tiny man from safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt vanished suddenly, like before, allowing Bryan to gasp. He heard an earth-shaking bark from above, followed by angry grunts and a building-sized paw that slammed outside. Behind it: two gargantuan combat boots loomed, shifting and grinding in response to the dog's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was completely beside himself. \"Pleaaaaasee, leave me alooone...\" His cry came out shrill and pained. \"...<i>I don't want to dieeee</i>!\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, he could more than easily set himself up like a flea in the massive jungles of fur that covered it. Another rolling bark blasted from outside to put the tiny man in check once more. He could hear the gigantic guard mumbling to the dog in a deep, distorted voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of his minuscule hidey-hole, Bryan watched the massive paw shift and suddenly lift away. Momentary elation filled him before he jerked back and screamed. One of the massive black combat boots that towered ominously in the far distance lifted and suddenly soared forward. Like a cataclysmic event, it slammed upon the floor with a deep boom, disrupting dust and small debris. The vast linoleum landscape that Bryan could see was beneath that monstrosity of hard rubber and anything else was under the shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard noises he couldn't identify. All he could see was the rough, scratched wall of rubber that creaked and shifted slightly and all he could think was how much he just wanted this huge guard to leave. \"What is he doing? Why hasn't he left yet?\" the tiny man said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether to do with his ironic question or not, Bryan got his answer moments later. The massive boots slid backwards with a tremendous grinding quake followed by something terrifyingly huge descending from above. Confused and panicked, Bryan was afforded a violent preview of it when the thing crashed into the ground just outside of his sanctuary. Something like a wall of metal. Grey and dull, thick as a cinder-block, and coated in gouges filled with grime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Bryan squealed, standing in alarm and nearly splitting his genius melon open on the low, rough ceiling. \"Fucking god dammit, my head! My fucking head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of metal pulled away momentarily, dislodging itself from a deep gash it had made in the floor. Not a second later it returned with intent and directed clumsily towards the crack and the tiny, shrunken man inside. Dazed and hurting, Bryan shrieked at it. The object was gigantic. It didn't take a scientist to realize there wouldn't be enough room for the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one option: bail out of his hiding place and run. </span></div></div>",

It would obliterate him for sure. Soft and pink, nothing but flesh and bone, leaving a red, gory smear behind. Bryan stared helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he dashed forward, squealing in accompaniment as he slid sideways on the ground and barely skirted the huge underside of that horrible metal object. He made it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in time as a rumbling, grinding crash came from behind him as the massive metal object dug into the cave, destroying it. It was still above him. Bryan looked up in alarm, seeing this thing for what it was. A huge thumb pressed against the flat side of it leading to more massive digits wrapped around a plastic shaft. It was a knife! Ceasing all celebration, the tiny scientist bolted away from the wall and the knife. He heard it dislodge and a quick glance upwards showed it lifting above and away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....NOTHING BUT A LITTLE BUG...\" boomed a deep voice from the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't help but look, stumbling as he tried to keep pace and failing as the sight towering above him took his breath away. The guard was a colossus that even crouched as he was still absorbed the sky completely. He was enormous. Behind a pair of massive, reflective sunglasses, Bryan could feel those huge eyes looking right at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no! You've got to see me...I'm not a bug! I'm a person! I work here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive visage showed no signs of even hearing the minuscule man voice, much less recognizing him. With those glasses, the man's huge face was an impassive mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Help me!\" Bryan yelled, his voice cracking in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the giant put away that huge knife and began rising to his feet. His full, towering stature that nearly made Bryan fall back trying to comprehend the sheer scale at which the colossal guard stood. Everything inside the tiny man told him to run and find a new place to hide. This battle was already lost. David versus Goliath was nothing in comparison to the vast difference between Bryan and this gargantuan security guard and his equally monstrous canine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep shifting rumbled through the linoleum floorscape as one of the guard's huge boots lifted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back his pocket knife, the guard spotted a small speck scuttling from the crack. He smirked and eyed his dog that sat anxiously next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Blitz\" he said, looking back at the ground. \"Nothing but a little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an ant or a flea, he thought while staring at it. Might have even jumped off of Blitz before it ran under the crack. That dog could use a bath. Grunting, he stood back up and slid his pocket knife away, using his freed hand to rustle the well-trained, but often overzealous dog's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get moving...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Exiting through the back door, the muscular black man strode confidently along the walk to the curb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments earlier, the bug-sized man recovered to a state of groggy awareness. He remembered falling into the giant security chief's pocket. He also remembered hitting his head against something hard and solid and blacking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, just as he began to regain his senses, he felt the giant begin to move. Was he only walking around in Bryan's kitchen, or was he leaving the house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andre climbed into the cab of his truck, his tiny unseen pocket passenger continued to scream for help. \"Let me out!\" The tiny man demanded from the dark, deep pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Andre started the truck and pulled onto the road, the sound from the engine and traffic noise drowned out the feeble protests from the shrunken scientist. The sleek lining of the pocket provided no means at all for the tiny man to climb to freedom, so he resigned himself to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited, he remembered Andre's huge fingers entering the pocket. The terrifying incident, which ended only seconds after it began, featured five huge fingers that intruded into the pocket. One of the huge digits had brushed against the tiny man.

It was almost too much to think about. Andre Franklin had always looked huge even when Bryan Smith wasn't shrunken to the size of an ant. Now, he had achieved truly humongous proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, one of the giant's fingers had brushed the tiny man when he reached into the pocket for his keys. The terrifying experience had petrified the bug-sized man, but now he found himself hoping that Andre would reach into the pocket again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be ready this time,\" he told himself, desperate to escape the pocket and gain the huge man's attention before things continued to spiral out of control. Already, the giant security chief had tried to swat him like a bug. Of course, from his perspective, the shrunken scientist probably looked almost exactly like a run-of-the-mill pest that a huge guy like Andre probably casually exterminated every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving Smith's home, Andre drove toward the fitness club where he kept his enviable body in top physical condition with a dedicated daily gym routine. This afternoon, however, he was more interested in one of the other benefits of the facility, namely the relaxing, luxuriant sauna available to club members. He was a salaried EDL employee now, so if he wanted to take an hour for a deserved break, who would dare to say anything to him? Even most of his superiors at the research facility experienced feelings of inadequacy next to the towering black man in his form-fitting uniform and no-nonsense attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he liked it that way. He parked his car, reached into the back seat for his gym bag and walked toward the entrance of the fitness facility. He shoved his keys back into the pocket as he walked across the parking lot. Entering the building with a confident stride, he waved at one of the desk attendants on his way into the facility, never realizing that deep in his pocket a tiny passenger was being mercilessly jostled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre stopped in the changing room to shed his EDL Labs uniform. He folded his shirt and draped the pants over a bench next to where he had placed his towel.He didn't notice a pale speck that emerged, disoriented and disheveled, from the pocket of the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lastly, he pushed down his boxer-briefs, flexing his muscles as he reached for a towel to wrap around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan blinked. The experience of the giant man removing his pants, then folding them with him still in the pocket, had been terrifying. He ran from the dark pocket and emerged on a wide platform of wood. It took him a moment to realize he was standing on one of the wooden slats that formed the seat of the bench. He looked up, and screamed, when he saw Andre's naked body towering over him like an ancient god. Even semi-hard, the man's huge, dark cock loomed ominously overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he hadn't been so overawed, he might have thought of a plan. Instead, the tiny man was completely unprepared as Andre reached for the towel. </span></div></div>",

Keeping it up for a few minutes he eventually reached under his towel and wrapped his fingers around his cock shaft, giving it a few strokes to get it semi hard. Letting it flop onto his thigh and making sure it was outlined through the towel, he sighed loudly.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds he opened his eyes and locked onto the young man, \"getting a good eye full there, son?\" he chuckled when the good looking lad jumped guiltily and stammered out that he wasn't doing anything.<br>\r\n\"Lad, you and I both know what you're about,\" sitting forward and spreading his legs so his towel gaped open, Andre continued, \"and as much as we both know I could break you in half like a twig, you need to know that I've had a long, frustrating day and could do with a little... relief.\"<br>\r\nSitting back and letting his eyes close, Andre wondered if the kid wanted it bad enough to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had found himself plastered on the giant black cock, about half way along it's thick shaft. Laying there, spread eagled and face down, the smell of the giant security guards cock surrounded him. He could feel the pulse of blood beneath him through the warm flesh. Knowing just how sensitive the skin of a mans cock was, he barely dared to breathe. When the towel suddenly pushed down on him with a heavy weight he felt his bladder release itself in terror, sure he was about to be smeared but the pressure released and then resumed several times. As blood started to rush into the massive organ and the steam from the sauna continued to heat up the giant guard, Bryan felt sweat starting to break out in the cock and his own body. <br>\r\nAs the cock started to harden and lift upwards, Bryan clung on even tighter. Something enormous joined him under the towel and he was suddenly sandwiched between two fleshy surfaces. As the giant man gave himself some gentle strokes Bryan found himself slid one way and then the other. Finally he felt himself come up against another wall of flesh and slammed to a halt as the hand pulled away. <br>\r\nWith a deep swallow of nerves and utter humiliation, the tiny scientist realised that the wall of flesh was actually the back of the giants glans. He was resting at the back of the giant cock head, a flea on a black mans dick.<br>\r\nTrembling with fear he was vaguely aware of voices but couldn't make out what was being said. Dim, filtered light washed across him as the towel was pulled roughly aside and he blinked as he tried to make out what he was seeing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the vial with the tiny professor in it he casually dumped it into the same bowl before heading to the kitchen to get a beer. <br>\r\nTwisting the top of the bottle of beer he took a good long drink, his eyes resting on the glass vial across the room. He could see some sort of movement inside it, probably the little geek pounding futiley on the glass to get out. It reminded the powerful security officer of a moth beating itself against a screen door and he smirked to himself at the aptness of the bug comparison.<br>\r\nWalking over to the sofa he sat down with a soft groan of contentment and stretched his long legs out in front of him onto the coffee table. Crossing his legs at the ankle he grabbed the remote and flicked on the tv while he downed his beer. From the corner of his eye he could see the vial in the bowl near his black combat boots and he found himself imagining the vial dropping onto the floor and him crushing it to powder under his boots, the tiny scientist turning into a red smear. Surprisingly he found the imagery arousing.<br>\r\nHe had grabbed the tiny scientist almost on a whim and had no clear ideas or plans for what to do with him. He had just seen the opportunity to take the snooty professor down a few rungs and had grabbed it with both hands. Well, technically it was only one hand, so small was the scientist.<br>\r\nHim and all his 'educated' buddies had looked down their noses and Andrew and his fellow officers for years and despite getting some satisfaction from some physical intimidation, Andre knew that the scientists still thought of themselves as better than the security teams.<br>\r\nAndre lifted his left boot with half a thought to bring it smashing down on the bowl but at the last moment he simply placed it down on the other side of the bowl so it rested between his boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan recoiled in terror at the enormous boot as it moved overhead. For a moment he thought for sure the giant was going to smash it down on him but instead it now joined its partner on the other side, towering over him. Every time he looked at those massive boots he felt his bowels loosen in terror. None of this was going to plan and all the exciting novelty had well and truly worn off. He had no idea why the giant security guard had decided to capture him but he didn't like what he had seen so far. <br>\r\nHe had already bruised his hands beating on the glass, trying to get out even though he knew there was no way out without outside assistance.<br>\r\nForcing himself to face his fears he took a deep, calming breath and made himself study those imposing black monoliths. The boots were well worn with plenty of scuff marks and Bryan felt the thought \"a working mans' boots\" float through his mind.<br>\r\nTiny pebbles, twigs and other detritous were caught in the deep tread and he had to forcibly stop his mind from imaging his own broken body joining them. <br>\r\nHe was shocked out of his reverie when the giant leaned forward, hands outstretched in his direction.</span></div></div>",

Sitting back on the soft he lifted the vial closer to his face and examined the bug-sized scientist inside. He could see the look of terror overlayed with a desperate hope that Andre would do something to help him. Casually turning the vial upside he sniggered as the tiny scientist was tumbled to the other end. He repeated the move so that the bottle was back up the right way. <br>\r\nCasually dropped the vial into the palm of his hand he wrapped his long, strong fingers around it, totally encasing the bottle inside his fist. Grabbing his beer bottle with his other hand he took a long drink, finishing it off. Heading into the kitchen he let the fist with the scientist inside it swing casually by his side.<br>\r\nBack on the sofa he cracked open the new beer and took a long mouthful before sitting it on the coffee table and opening his other hand. <br>\r\nA mischievous thought came to him and he unscrewed the lid to the vial. Grabbing his beer he bought the two bottle together and carefully poured some of the beer into the vial, filling it about halfway. Screwing the lid back on he gave the vial a little swirl. Watching the tiny scientist get spun about in a whirl pool the beefy security guard laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the giant had casually upended the vial, tumbling him about, Bryan had had to force himself to take rein of his anger.

Yet.<br>\r\nBryan forced himself to remember that he could have been just a smear on his kitchen table, so the fact that he was still alive was to be considered a positive thing.<br>\r\nWhen he saw the giant unscrewing the lid his heart started to beat faster. While he didn't like being trapped in the vial and knew that it provided him with a false sense of security, it was still somewhat comforting to have the glass barrier. Bracing himself to be tipped out he didn't know what to think when the beer bottle appeared. He had barely time to give out a brief, indignant shout before ice cold beer poured down on him, instantly sweeping him up and off his feet. <br>\r\nEven as the giant swirled him about in a maelstorm of frothy, amber liquid, he couldn't help but realise that this flood of beer wouldn't even be a mouthful to the giant security guard.<br>\r\nAs he got swept under the current time and again his good will took a serious beating. If the giant didn't stop soon he was going to drown.<br>\r\nAlmost as he thought it, the rough tides that had been sweeping him around stopped and he sucked in a lung full of air, treading water.<br>\r\nHe barely registered the shapes moving outside the glass but his eyes shot upwards as he the lid started unscrewing again.<br>\r\nLooking quickly back through the glass to see what was happening his heart lurched as he saw the giant's face coming ever closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre pursed his lips as he bought the vial closer and closer. Strange thoughts and feelings were running through his body and for some reason his cock had gone rock hard, pushing against his tight underwear. <br>\r\nLifting the vial to his lips he let his tongue flicker out and brush across the round opening. Slowly, not letting himself over think it, he started to tip the vial and its contents. His breath was coming faster and his other hand had strayed down to his crotch and he started to caress his hard shaft through his pants.<br>\r\nThe first drops of beer spilled into his mouth and a shudder ran through his body eliciting a slight groan of pleasure from him. He didn't understand the feelings washing through him and he didn't care. He felt good. He liked the feeling. That was enough for him.<br>\r\nAs his cock throbbed in his pants he started to tip the vial even more, letting more beer pass his lips.<br>\r\nAs the vial tipped even further, the contents washed into his mouth in a rush.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now he could feel the little man moving and he quivered in delight.<br>\r\nResuming his motions on his cock he used his tongue to manipulate the little man around, holding him against the roof of his mouth then running him over teeth before trapping him beneath his tongue.<br>\r\nHe was getting close to climaxing when a loud ringing made him jump. He was going to ignore the call but a glance at the screen showed it was his boss.<br>\r\nCursing he let go of his cock and grabbed the phone with his other hand.

With a wicked grin he lowered the jar to his lap and slowly used it to trace the outline of his semi hard cock through his black pants. His grin widened as he saw the little scientist trying to keep his balance. He imagined the little man wasn't feeling anywhere near as superior now.<br>\r\nThe little vial was dwarfed by his cock and the tiny little man inside it even more so. <br>\r\nIt gave him a dark pleasure to slide the vial around his shaft, making it throb as it thickened and hardened.<br>\r\nAndre prided himself on being a man of action and decided not to overthink what was happening.<br>\r\nHe placed the vial on his shaft and rolled it back and forwards under his palm, pressing down firmly as he did.<br>\r\nDeciding to get more comfortable, Andrew thrust the vial between his legs and leaned down to undo the laces of his boots. Kicking them off and then his socks, he retrieved the vial in one hand as he stood up to push his combat pants to the floor.<br>\r\nSitting back down, he placed the vial on his boxer briefs, resting against his thick shaft while he undid his shirt and discarded it to the floor.<br>\r\nMuch better, he thought to himself as he resumed toying with the glass bottle.<br>\r\nHe rolled it against his balls, up his shaft and around his cock head. He was pleased to see a wet patch forming at the head of his cock and let his precum smear the glass. <br>\r\nA thought struck him and he let the tip of his cock poke out the top of his underwear. One handed he unscrewed the lid of the vial and then pushed the opening against his cock head. Squeezing out a huge drop of precum he let it drip inside the vial. Holding it up to his face he grinned as he watched it slowly ooze down the side of the glass. The tiny scientist cowered in the bottom in obvious horror and disgust as the clear liquid approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't believe what was happening to him when the giant security guard starting rubbing his glass prison against his crotch. The huge trouser snake dwarfed him. The thought that only a thin piece of glass and some fabric were between him and... that...that...monstrosity! Bryan struggled with feelings of terror, lust and awe!<br>\r\nWhen the glass vial was plunged between Andre's legs Bryan let out a most unmanly squeak, sure he was going to be crushed between the giants thighs.<br>\r\nThe giant piece of meat was so much more defined, so much more <i>real</i> when it was just clad in thin underwear and, despite himself, Bryan's body reacted instinctively. <br>\r\nBut when the bare cock head came into view, itself almost as large as the glass vial, Bryan was swamped with terror. The thick, glistening precum that was scraped into his prison and oozed down the wall towards him sent him into shivers of awe-struck terror and disgust that he was reduced to such insignificance.<br>\r\nEvery step seemed to be escalating and Bryan quaked at what Andre would do next.</span></div></div>",

He withdrew the vial a couple of inches from the cockhead, then tipped the vial forcefully over. He shuddered with delight as the tiny little form of Bryan spilled out, just past his bellybutton. Andre laughed as the miniscule Bryan attempted to situate himself on his big, beefy body. The gigantic security guard could only just make out the scientist, and thanked god he was black - the guard showed up against his skin, making him relatively easy to spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving him a moment to get his bearings, Andre pulled down his boxers and allowed the dick to fully spring loose. It was now fully erect, standing around 9 inches - in other words, about 35 times bigger than Bryan. To Bryan, this monolith appeared to be over 200 feet in itself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan inexplicably found himself missing the security of the vial, but Andre had reached over and placed it well out of each on the coffee table. The now-naked, dominant, huge security chief had complete control of Bryan, and yet Bryan couldn't help but be intensely aroused, in awe, at the structure before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the chief's enormous, beefy arm reached past him and one of the strong hands wrapped itself around the dick, pushing it down slowly. All light began to fade and Bryan had no chance of escape as the enormous dick pressed down on him! Bryan was caught under the squishy head, otherwise he would have been crushed due to its rigidity. Andre let out a sudden deep groan of joy at the feel of the minute man against his sensitive head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be there a lot,\" he said with relish. He'd already decided the tiny scientist would be staying with him - this was too good to pass up.

The palm alone was the size of a football field, casting a dark shadow over it's intended victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre's massive hand came down with frightening speed. Tiny Bryan Smith felt like a jumbo jet collided into him, a thunderous boom resounding through his minute ears. He found himself caught between a fold in the giant man's glove, the thick material folding where the fingers bent. The rough material surrounded him all over, an intense heat radiating from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a seconds more delay, the massive weight lifted, taking the terrified scientist with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre grunted at the thought of the pesky Bryan Smith running rampant with materials purloined from his company's lab. The annoying scientist had given him problems before, often wasting the time of the security personal with trivial tasks and complaints. It didn't surprise him that the queer Bryan Smith would steal valuable chemicals so he could sell them on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the pesky man was missing leaving, Andre at a loss. Until a tiny moving speck caught his attention from the nearby kitchen table. The tall, bulky black security chief had little time for such a small creature, but he felt a certain satisfaction as he smashed his large gloved hand down on it, imagining it was a tiny Bryan Smith. The thought amused him, as he brushed his hand off. The door opened suddenly, causing Andre to forget the insignificant bug as two other security men entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir black combat boots thudded loudly as they approached Andre, both of them standing at attention. \"We have collected all of the computer hardware, sir.\" Reported an officer wearing a dark cap. The other young guard with him nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware that the scientist was ant-sized at his feet, Andre stomped around the table, his huge boot just missing the scurrying speck. \"Search the house for any signs of where he went. We're going to nail this bastard.\" He said, grinding his fist in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Andre, Bryan Smith hadn't left.</span></div></div>",

The black boots gleamed from the every-other-day polishings that the security chief applied with military-style precision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boots were so massive. They looked like twin tower skyscrapers fashioned from leather. A half dozen silver portholes lined each side of the boots, admitting a criss-cross design of thick laces. The security chief's pants that matched the rest of his uniform were stuffed into the top of the towering boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding still, the boots were intimidating as hell. When they moved, the tiny man screamed and tried to run. With each step, the floor shook beneath his feet. Each footfall sounded like the roar of thunder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he survived the first steps made by the enormous security guard, Mr. Smith knew his luck could not possibly last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get away from him,\" he said, \"before he stomps on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor of his kitchen, however, offered very few hiding locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he darted over the enormous tiles, he overheard the giants speaking again. Listening in fear, he heard them discuss the confiscation of his computer. That didn't worry him as much as the fact that the package with the essential antidote had also fallen into their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEARCH THE HOUSE,\" Andre ordered, his irritation growing. \"LOOK FOR ANY SIGNS OF SMITH.

Bryan struggled with his facial expression to keep from showing his irritation as Dr. Thompson explained a minor problem that should have been easily solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take care of it?\" Dr. Thompson asked after he finished with his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Bryan said. He wanted to add, \"Of course, any grad student could have done just as well. I sure as hell didn't need to re-arrange my schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, since he was already there, he decided to fix the problem. After all, he could spend two extra days with his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to quickly solve Dr. Thompson's problem \u2014 yet again, Bryan thought to himself \u2014 and hurried to his office. He saw the package and his vial of shrinking formula on his desktop where he had left them. He took out a hundred dollar bill from his wallet and placed the bill in an envelope. He wrote Tommy's name on the envelope and sat the box atop the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan closed the door to his office. He could not lock the door, or else he would prevent Tommy's access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe improvised. Bryan removed his shoes and socks. He stashed them beneath his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lifted the vial of shrinking formula. After drinking it, he quickly got onto his desktop while fully dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew how ridiculous he must look. But, he also knew that the formula worked rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his office seemed to expand around him. His clothes grew heavy and bulky. By the time he lost half his size, he kicked off his pants and boxers. He removed his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to quickly decrease in size as he gathered up his clothing. He moved awkwardly to the edge of the desk. He dropped the pile of clothes onto the floor between his desk and chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't neat, but it was the best he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and watched as the small shipping package began to grow. The box went from looking the size of a small shed to the size of a large home. Finally, by the time the shrinking left Bryan only a fourth of an inch tall, the box looked like a spacious warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan walked toward the small entrance he had provided himself into the box. He took a final look around his enormous office. He looked at the clock on his desk. The clock looked the size of an office building. Bryan saw that Tommy should arrive in less than 20 minutes to pick up the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have timed it any better,\" Bryan said as he made his way deeper into the box. He found the stash of tiny clothing he had packed earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had finished getting dressed in his pre-shrunken clothes when he heard a noise. \"This is it!\" Bryan said aloud in an excited voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he could have seen Tommy's entrance, but he had closed the small incision in the package after he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thompson, accompanied by a younger man, entered Bryan's office. \"I had hoped we might find him here,\" Dr. Thompson said. \"I suppose he has already left on his vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I could find somewhere else to work,\" the younger man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thompson looked at Greg, his graduate assistant. \"Nonsense! I'm sure Smith won't mind you borrowing his office in his absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard voices. He could not be certain, but he thought one voice sounded familiar. \"Thompson?\" Bryan wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he needed a look outside, Bryan started toward his exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get far, however, before the interior of the massive box turned upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear some of this stuff from his desk and get to work,\" Dr. Thompson told Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg picked up a small package. He barely glanced at the labels. \"I think someone has left Dr. Smith a package,\" Greg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 22-year-old graduate assistant never noticed the envelope that briefly clung to the bottom of the box before coming loose and falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thompson turned too late to see the envelope flutter to the ground. He took the box from Greg's hand but didn't bother to read the labels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked across the room and placed the box on top of Bryan's bookshelf. \"There. He will find his package when he returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll check in on you later,\" Dr. Thompson said before he left in haste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg started to take a seat when he noticed the clothes on the floor. \"Why would he leave clothes under his desk?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dr. Thompson had already left the office. Greg gathered the clothes and walked across the room. He opened a small storage closet and stashed the clothes.</span></div></div>",

He was a mere quarter of an inch tall, smaller than most bugs.  He was in completely unfamiliar surroundings in a strange house, and he had lost the antidote that could return him to normal size.  It had to be some crazy nightmare, but in reality, Bryan had never had a dream quite this bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard a variety of noises coming from Tommy\u2019s room.  Bryan figured he must have the radio on or something.  He realized that Tommy was probably the best person to try and contact for some help.

The burber carpeting provided a somewhat but not impossible challenge.  It was almost like walking on a sea of giant pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it through the doorway, the tiny scientist saw Tommy sitting at a desk on the other side of the room.  Bryan began his traverse across the bedroom floor.  About a third of the way across the room, he was startled by a loud and threatening BOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looked up in complete horror at an aquarium on a stand low to the ground.  It contained a snake the size of which Bryan found inconceivable.  And the snake had spotted him.  It was banging its head on the glass wall in an effort to get at the tiny man, which it probably thought was a little snack.

The tiny man grabbed fistfuls of cotton fabric, trying desperately not to get hurled off the top of the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few steps, Tommy crossed the room and threw himself onto his bed. One tiny speck of a man, still tied to the teenager's sock, went with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeels against the bedcovers, his toes pointed at the ceiling and the back of his head resting on a pillow, Tommy didn't notice the tiny man now dangling by one leg on the vertical cliff face represented by his upturned socked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the quarter-inch-tall man dangled helplessly, he looked down at the distant bedcovers. He felt as if his leg might be wrenched from the socket if the giant made any other sudden, violent movements. But he was too exhausted to even attempt working at the knot on the string that made him an unwilling passenger on Tommy's socked foot. Even the slightest movement on Tommy's part turned the tiny, unnoticed scientist into a human pendulum, swinging to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the frayed string had also suffered during the brief walk from the desk to the bed.

He tilted back in the swivel chair, propping up his long legs and large white-socked feet on his desk. He stared absent-mindedly at the moniter, then his gaze moved to his resting feet. Tommy's eyes lingered there for a moment - he thought he'd seen something - and then he let them drift away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Bryan had begun to attempt to free himself from the string, the entire world turned upside down. And then right-side up again, and soon Bryan was lost in a whirlwind of movement. To him, Tommy's feet were the Earth and the Earth was moving. A lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to fly though the air, and the pressure of the air suddenly coming down on him was unbelievable. He was pushed onto his back and stuck into place as thousands of winds attacked him, knocking the air out of him and holding him against a moving landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the instant that the universe had shifted, it stopped. Lack of centripetal force meant that Bryan was no longer bound; he noticed that the feet had up righted itself. Bryan would have fallen into Tommy's ankle, but a tree-trunked size rope suddenly hung out of place: the string that had previously bound him. Bryan, with eyes shut, grabbed the shoelace in midair and swung an inch before letting it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan soared away, about an inch above the surface of the desk; equivalently, he was very high. He hit the desk roughly, and rolled once. His nose was bleeding, but otherwise, he was suprised that he had survived. The compacting of his skeleton hadn't made him invulnerable, not anything near it, but it had made him more enduring. For the first time, he was glad he'd been shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan lay, battered, on the cool surface of his desk for a minute without moving. He started breathing slowly, gaining more and more breath as he found he was able to stand. His vision was blurry, but focused and he realized where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he found that he felt very insignificant. He stood in the shadow of the sky-scraper sized sole of his former employer. Bryan felt incredibly inferior: If Tommy's foot was a skyscraper, Tommy himself was...monumental. </span></div></div>",

Stranded on Tommy's desk, the tiny man yearned desperately to make contact with his titanic neighbor, but even a casual move by the enormous teenager could potentially spell disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist realized that, before undergoing the massive reduction in size, he could never have adequately imagined anything as huge, powerful and awe-inspiring as Tommy's towering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven seated at his desk, the teenager looked god-like to the tiny voyeur. He felt a twinge of guilt, as well as other feelings, as he stared at the teen titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wanted to see more of Tommy's enormous body, to gaze at the handsome youth's billboard-sized face, what dominated his attention for the moment were Tommy's massive feet. Covered in his cotton socks, Tommy's feet, just by looming over the bug-sized man, contributed greatly to the crushing of his ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his intellectual bent, the tiny man reacted more with male instinct than scientific detachment. Although completely irrational under the circumstances, he wanted nothing more than to touch the socked sole of the closely enormous foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing all his courage, he walked across the desktop, drawing closer to the foot. As he got closer, the enormous foot loomed even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he stood close enough to touch the foot. He reached out with his tiny hand and ran the flat of his palm over the fabric, which felt warm and slightly damp to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" the little man moaned as, totally unbidden, an image flashed into his brain of that enormous socked foot coming down on top of his insignificant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want that!\" The shrunken scientist exclaimed, but he began to suspect that, rooted deeply in his psyche, existed the urge to embrace extinction as a bug under a god's titanic foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled a deep breath, which fogged his mind more with the severe odor of sweat mixed into the fabric of the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get away from here,\" the tiny man gasped, taking a reluctant step back from Tommy's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he would find cords and cables at the back of Tommy's desktop computer.

As the surface of the desktop rushed closer, he lost his hold. He fell, hit hard but managed to roll over in time to see the descending socked foot fall upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck-sized scientist found himself buried alive beneath a teen foot that might as well have weighed tons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan screamed. \"Tommy, don't do this! Lift your foot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis futile screams were unable to escape any more than he could move his tiny body from beneath the monumental foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, wanting to check something on his computer, leaned closer, pressing his feet more solidly on the desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't breathe...\" Bryan gasped. He inhaled one last time, taking in the stink of foot sweat. When he tried to exhale, the pressure was too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to scream, but his mouth just opened on the dirty cotton that pressed remorselessly down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...not like this...\" Bryan thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before he could react, that same immense foot fell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in desperation, he recognized how he had jeopardized everything that mattered to him, including his years of experimentation, his independence, his continued sojourn among the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? To feel ego-crushing humiliation at the feet of an ordinary teenager?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he struggled to take a breath, as he strove to even scream from the increasing pain from the pressure, he realized that his end would be utterly complete.

His mind still failed to make allowances that anything so monstrously huge could move with such speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turn of events, however, seemed to favor the shrunken man. After all, he no longer had to worry about Tommy stomping around on the floor. In addition, the bedcovers reached to the floor, offering Bryan a means of ascending to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer he got, however, the more he appreciated the scale of the undertaking ahead of him. \"He's my only hope,\" Bryan said, refusing to surrender. With those words, he began climbing the bedcover, using folds in the cloth and stray fibers as a means of boosting his ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy rested on his bed and reached into a drawer on his night table for one of his favorite comic books. He enjoyed the passing thought that even if he purchased the skateboard he wanted with the money from Mr. Smith, he might have enough cash left to also purchase some new comic book titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was propped on two pillows with his body relaxed and spread across most of the bed. That's how tiny Bryan found him after a climb lasting nearly half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a difficult climb, Bryan felt exhausted. But, as he climbed over the edge and onto the level red and black plain of Tommy's bedcovers, he saw the giant youth spread out like yet another mountain range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral time during his climb the bed shook as if he was experiencing an earthquake, forcing him to hold fast as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without standing on two colossal legs with his head towering more than 1,600 feet above the teeny scientist, Tommy looked both awe-inspiring and terrifying. At some point during Bryan's climb, the teen had shucked off all his clothes save for a pair of boxer shorts. That must have been the cause of the quakes during the climb, Bryan decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan paused only a second before deciding to take the direct approach. He scurried across the vast field of fabric, making his way toward Tommy's head. The giant youth had propped himself on one elbow and turned onto his side to read his comic book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy!\" Bryan shouted as he drew closer. \"Please! Look! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile turning a page, Tommy's eyes detected a glimpse of tiny movement about 18 inches away from his face. Some tiny bug was crawling over his bedcovers toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout undue haste, Tommy watched the bug for a second before he rolled his comic book into a long, hand-held tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me...Mr. Smith,\" Bryan shouted. \"Tommy, please, see me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the mountainous form did move. Momentum kept Bryan running forward even as he saw the giant roll the pages of the comic book into a solid rod and lift the makeshift \"swatter\" over the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Bryan shouted. \"I'm not a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUGS!\" Tommy grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAP!

He needed to get out of this room, and quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasped loudly as a huge white object suddenly landed in his way. At first, Bryan thought it was Tommy's foot, and the thought of something so large frightened him. But then he realized it wasn't his socked foot; it was only Tommy's toe. It was nearly 25 feet to the top it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wanted to scream, from the sudden landing. He threw himself away from it, landing awckwardly on his butt and rolling onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME HERE, WHAT'RE YOU SO AGITATED FOR?\" Tommy gently cooed to a small lizard, as he took it from its cage. Frequently, it hissed and darted its tongue towards the ground where Bryan was. Twice, it jumped from Tommy's palm, but he was able to hold it in place with his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third time, however, as Bryan looked up in fear, it leapt from Tommy's palm. The enormous lizard appeared to be a dinosaur, a grand pteryldactyl flying though the air.

Obviously, Joe didn't realize what he had done. If the world knew that Tommy had, even indirectly, fed his shrunken neighbor to a pet lizard, there could be unpleasant consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Joe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugged. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his shelter, the tiny man had been a reluctant witness to the cricket's grisly demise in the jaws of the monster lizard. He shuddered when he recalled the crunching sound as the reptile's jaws demolished the insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, he had heard Tommy's familiar voice, but now faced another dilemma. If he left the crevice in the wood chips, would the monster snap him up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened and only moments after Tommy's dramatic return, the tiny man heard the gigantic teenager utter the words \"NEVER MIND.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he mean by that? As he listened, he heard the rustling sound as the lizard's scales rasped against the wood chips. The huge reptile returned to its perch in the center of the cage, it hunger satisfied, temporarily, by the cricket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was convinced that the lizard was no longer interested, he emerged from hiding and made his way cautiously to the front pane of glass. Through the invisible barrier he watched the movements of the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't he looking for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the reason became very evident. \"He thinks the lizard ate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn panic, he pounded against the glass with his tiny fists. His anguish was made worse as he watched the two giants moving around the room without the slightest regard to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! I'm still in here!\" He screamed. \"With... oh god... with that monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pounded even more frantically, but his tiny fists produced no sound that the two titans were likely to hear, especially when Tommy started playing some loud music.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, he looked down at the tiny man he was holding between his fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith, I don't know which pocket to use, so you can decide which you think will be best!\" Tommy looked sure of his plan. \"You can ride in one of my pants pockets, or my shirt...oh wait, I guess I didn't wear a shirt with a pocket.

Without waiting for an agreement from his friends he went strolling out the door. Tommy shrugged and followed him. Joe stared at Tommy's back as he followed him, still thinking about the tiny man in the pill. However he too was hungry to worry much and his thoughts shifted to what he should order at the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith had been beating on the walls of the capsule ever since Tommy had reappeared. He was sure that once he got his attention this whole ordeal would be over. But Tommy hadn't inspected the pill, instead proving to his friends that he wasn't scared to do what they asked. So as Mr. Smith battled for Tommy's attention he watched the teen titan's mouth get closer and wider. For a split second he saw the white teeth glint in the light, a strand of saliva stretching from his tongue to his upper right molars... then he was plunging into the cavern. The pill made contact with the tongue and Mr. Smith grunted as he hit the bottom of the capsule roughly. Before he head time to orient himself, a massive rim approached himself and the mouth. A torrent of water gushed over the edge, sweeping past the giant teen's teeth and smashing into his trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooo!\" he had screamed in horror as he found himself swept to the darkness in the back of the cavern. The ride suddenly become even rougher which the tiny scientist hadn't considered possible as he plunged into the throat, the sounds of his young neighbor swallowing him magnified in surround sound. The water flowed away and tiny Mr. Smith gasped in terror as he realized he was being massaged down the youth's esophagus. Through the walls of the capsule he could hear the beating heart and gusting lungs hard at work. The pill stopped suddenly before being squeezed through a sphincter with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith yelled as he floated for a moment as the pill plummeted downwards. It landed with a splat and again Mr. Smith slammed into the bottom of the pill. He sighed, thankful for the horrible ride to have finally stopped. Ignoring the dull ache all over his body he did his best to look around. His pill appeared to have rolled down the side of a sodden orange pile. Mr. Smith grimaced as he recognized it to be the remains of some Cheetos Tommy must have eaten earlier. Though once a favorite a snack he doubted he would ever have any again... assuming he could get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire chamber rumbled, seeming to signal it wanted more than the Cheetos it currently held. He gazed around the stomach feeling defeated. Mr. Smith sat down and hoped something would happen in his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stepped into the lobby of the restaurant and stared at the menu. Tommy felt his stomach growl in anticipation. \"Well I know what I want\" said Andy, stepping forward to order a chicken nugget meal. Joe followed suit getting a McChicken with fries and a chocolate shake. Joe went to find a table while Andy filled his drink. Tommy, finally knowing what he wanted opened his mouth to order and looked to see the cashier smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica! Hey!\" he said happily. His stomach went into butterflies seeing his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big boy, what're you doing here?\" she asked, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hungry\" he shrugged pointing at Joe and Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you should've come earlier, I just finished my break\" she said unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well we can hang out tonight right?\" Tommy asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she replied flatly \"I'm going to New York to visit my aunt for spring break, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" Tommy mumbled \"Well I guess I'll call you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed but didn't reply as her manager walked by. She stood up straight and asked \"What can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, knowing how strict her manager was didn't push the conversation further. \"Can I have two cheeseburgers, a medium fry, and a large soda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica punched it in and gave him his cup. After paying he stopped at the soda fountain to get some Mountain Dew before joining his friends at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw look at the lovebirds!\" Andy taunted. \"Whatever\" replied Tommy sipping his soda, \"At least girls will look at me!\" he added with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you!\" Andy replied punching Tommy from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith stared around the massive cavern trying to pass the time he could not count. He noted the rough walls. His analytical mind began spouting out facts about digestion, and peristalsis, and hydrochloric acid... he shook his heads to stem the flow of thoughts not wanting to dwell on his likely doom. He turned his attention to the pile of soggy Cheetos observing the destruction they had suffered between Tommy's merciless teeth. Again he shook his head before realizing it would be very difficult to avoid thinking about being digested considering he was in a stomach. He struggled to shut out his surroundings but his panic was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach around him growled again. Though Mr. Smith didn't know it Tommy had just walked into McDonalds and the aroma of food had tripled his hunger. Mr. Smith did however notice a change when Tommy saw his girlfriend as the cavern seemed to quake a bit. Confused Mr. Smith simply hoped for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead after a minute, a deluge of yellow soda flowed into the stomach. Mr. Smith cried out as his capsule shifted in the shallow lake of pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! What are you doing?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica appeared carrying a tray with the boys' food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came up with an excuse to come out here\" she explained dropping the tray onto the table before kissing Tommy. \"I had to do that before I left, didn't want to wait a week\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll call you every night\" Tommy replied sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hugged Tommy before rushing back to her post at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfffft!!\" Andy made a farting noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow up!\" replied Tommy as he ripped open a packet of ketchup and squirted it onto a napkin. He dipped his fries and popped them into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm that'll hit the spot!\" he groaned happily. As he swallowed the fries he unwrapped a cheeseburger, raised it to his mouth and took a bite. He waited to swallow before turning to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what made you think to convince me there was a tiny man in that pill?\" he asked before taking another bite from his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe swallowed a bite of his sandwich suddenly very aware of its descent into his chest. He had forgotten about the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy however just shrugged \"We saw that movie where the kids shrink cuz of their dad's machine... It just popped into our heads I guess\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe put down his sandwich, unable to continue. His friends didn't notice as they discussed that movie while plowing through their meals. Joe watched as Tommy took a huge bite out of his cheeseburger, chewing quickly and swallowing as he listened to Andy. Without looking down he snatched up some fries, dipped them in ketchup and brought them to his mouth. His friend's mouth yawned open and the tongue shot out covered in chewed burger bits before everything disappeared behind Tommy's lips again. As Tommy chewed and swallowed Joe stared at his chest and belly, imagining the food joining the tiny man in the stomach. For a moment he felt sincere remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he thought suddenly it was just some tiny thing that couldn't be human. Something that tiny didn't matter. Feeling better Joe picked up his sandwich. He bit into it and focused on joining his friends' conversation. He chewed and swallowed without a second thought. He didn't consider where his food was going nor where Tommy's went. It was as if the moment hadn't happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stomach Mr. Smith heard a grinding noise accompanied by what sounded like a groan of joy. A distant gulp confirmed what was coming. He cried out as a soggy yellow blob appeared through the sphincter. The movement of the stomach had shifted him away from the center and he watched the chewed fries hit the stomach floor.  Mr. Smith felt a bit nauseous as he witnessed Tommy's meal from within the giant boy's stomach. He tried not to remember that what he saw was food that moments ago was being chewed up in Tommy's slimy mouth before being unceremoniously gulped down in the same manner he had been, and then being followed by more mounds of fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more food cascaded in and began to bury his capsule, Mr. Smith was thankful for his enclosure. Before long he was completely buried but he could still hear the sounds of Tommy chewing and swallowing his food from above as well as the splats as the mountain of greasy sodden food grew. The stomach growled and began to shift. Mr. Smith yelped and then curled up in the bottom preparing himself for disaster.</span></div></div>",

He sipped on the last of his pop and then looked expectantly at his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now what d'you guys wanna do?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe shrugged but Andy had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head to the mall and check out the new arcade, everyone who's been there says its great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy frowned, \"I don't wanna walk there though, I'm so full!\" he said rubbing his stomach for effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy shrugged, \"I know the bus we could take...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\" Joe chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the boys got up from the table and threw the trash remaining from their meals away. Each one looked forward to seeing the new arcade, hoping it would be as good as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith noticed acid pooling around the bottom of his capsule. He began to panic as he realized that Tommy, without realizing it, was starting to digest his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOMMY, HELP ME! GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" he screamed. While most of him recognized that his efforts were futile, a small part of him refused to give up on the young man who had been so dependable in the past. He started beating on the walls of the capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acid levels continued to rise, and Mr. Smith could see its quick effect on the food. The soggy, chewed mush of fries and cheeseburger slowly started to break down as the stomach's movement became more noticeable. As Mr. Smith moved about the capsule he suddenly became aware that the floor was becoming spongy. He looked down and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acid was very slowly burning through the capsule. Mr. Smith remembered that he was in a pill meant to be digested as a means of delivering whatever medication it originally had. This meant his barrier would eventually be destroyed and he would join the masticated remains of Tommy's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to sob as he realized his situation had no hope and he had only been fooling himself since Tommy had swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! He had been fooling himself since he had swallowed that shrinking serum that he would be able to stay safe shrunken in a world of giants. He finally realized just how insignificant he had made himself. Here he was a brilliant scientist, swallowed by a giant teenage boy without a second thought because a dare from the giant's friends. And now he was doomed to be digested with the giant boy's meal, no more noticeable than a crumb. And it was all his fault, he ad no one to blame, he had put himself in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, STUPID! NOOOOOOO!!!\" he wailed in rage and agony. Mr. Smith had finally realized that he was done for and there was nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy sat on the bus chatting with his friends he didn't think about the meal he had finished off mere minutes ago. He didn't know of the drama playing out in his gut. He was deaf to the cries of anguish echoing around his stomach. He didn't know that as his thoughts focused on the arcade, his stomach filled with acid and began to break down his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't feel the peristalsis that rocked Mr. Smith's world and violently stirred the soggy remains of his meal. He didn't know that as he leaned over to Joe to make fun of another bus rider's clothes that Mr. Smith's pill suddenly emerged at the top of the storm of chewed food and stomach acid. He didn't know that suddenly, the tiny man felt a glimmer of unfounded hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he did notice his stomach gurgle loudly suddenly. He glanced down for a moment before Andy pointed out that the next stop was where they would get off. His mind dismissed the gurgle and his excitement for the arcade became the center of his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Tommy would never realize was that gurgle was the signal of the moment that the capsule finally broke. Mr. Smith screamed as he was sucked out and tossed into the digestive storm. He only lasted a few seconds before being pulled under a wave and attacked by the acid.  As Tommy walked into the arcade his tiny neighbor passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's digestive system did its job and killed foreign life that found itself in the young man's stomach. And so Mr. Smith died inside Tommy's belly with no one any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his absence, Mr. Smith was missed by those who knew him, including Tommy who had looked up to the man as a role-model. No leads were found in his disappearance in spite of a very thorough investigation. Everyone was devastated as they were forced to accept they would never see Bryan Smith again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Joe pointed out that they had found the tiny man the same day Mr. Smith went missing, Andy shrugged it off. He managed to convince Joe and himself that they hadn't seen a tiny man, and it was just a weird bug. They also never shared any of this with Tommy, who never remembered to bring up the pill again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy for a short while was focused on Mr. Smith's disappearance but whenever he felt too sad about it, he found he could soothe the pain with a cheeseburger and some fries.</span></div></div>",

Though he heard the sound of a gulp he remained in the mouth. Dull thuds accompanied his rough movement about the mouth. The giant teenager's tongue easily relocated him as it pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim light streaming in from the barely open lips, Mr. Smith could see rows of massive molars, dotted with fillings. A long uvula swayed over where the tongue stretched downwards into the blackness of the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried out in surprise as the tongue maneuvered him once more and he lost his balance. he came to stop underneath the massive tongue, it's pink surface plastered against the pill wall. Under the tongue, with the saliva glands, a lake of saliva surrounded the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Andy shrugs at Joe the bottom of the pill liquefies due to the saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh!\" Mr. Smith yelps, attempting to escape the thick, sticky liquid that slowly floods the interior. A moment later the side of the pill breaks. Mr. Smith, seeing his confines rapidly break down, decides its time to flee. He pulls himself through the expanding hole in the side and treads through the saliva, attempting to get out from underneath the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches the gum-line, and see's Andy's jagged teeth towering above him. A sudden shift of the tongue pushes saliva, as well as Mr. Smith, up onto the surface of the tongue.

After he drank the liquid formula, smacking his lips and gulping down a fluid that tasted vaguely of strawberry, he figured he would have plenty of time to make it onto the kitchen counter and into the shipping package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected the process of shrinking to take place in much the same manner as on previous occasions. In that one, but critical, respect, he found himself quite mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor rushed up to meet him as the walls and furniture in his kitchen suddenly expanded. In an instant, he had gone from a size a bit shy of six feet tall to a measly fraction of an inch.

He drank the formula and barely had a chance to intake breath before his entire being was reduced to a speck upon his kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never worked like that before. The many times Bryan had experimented upon himself, drinking the exact same concoction, he always had a slight grace period of almost a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, I'm on the damn floor! This is not good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had been so absorbed with his own plight that he forgot just what time it was. Looking up at the sheer cliff of counter, towering over 1,700 feet into the sky, he suddenly froze when loud noises invaded from behind the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeaky turn and light creak, all blown up to near thunderous notes, the humongous door was pushed open. Immediately, a gale of hurricane winds giddily swept into the space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan barely had a chance to scream before he was thrown backwards. \"Oh, shit! He's early!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly by only a few minutes - a fact that was innocently unimportant to Bryan's teenaged neighbour Tommy. The gigantic teen entered the room with pounding stomps, each one sending tremendous vibrations through the tiled floor. Bryan pulled himself up, screaming in both fear and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just Tommy... same scrawny kid I have known for years,\" He intoned, staring banjo eyed at the giant in question. \"But look at him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of his neighbour's presence, Tommy rotated his planetary-sized head. A tiny black speck buzzed past his face, speeding quickly to dodge his enormous hand. Tommy easily stood more than 3,000 feet tall. Not as tall as Bryan's older and more athletic nephew, but such details were almost unnoticeable when smaller than a common ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting an enormous arm to check the time, the titanic teenager suddenly broke into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuuuck</i>!\" Bryan belted as he whipped himself around and fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground jolted with each godly step. Heading for the base of his kitchen island was his only option, but unfortunately, Tommy had the same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother humongous shockwave sent the tiny man to his face. Turning over, he was presented with a rare front-row angle of Tommy's monumental sole. Nothing more than a regular sneaker sole by any means, but now clown to titanic scale. Every ridge of rubber stood out like deep canyons. Some filled with dried mud or pebbles, while others were worn down almost flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could only open his maw once more and shriek. \"Noooooo!\" He vainly put his arms above him, unable to think of any other action to save himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly to hover briefly, the tread stretched over the section of floor in all directions. Then it descended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THOOOM</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt met the ground with such introduction that tiny Bryan was slammed flat against the ground by intense shockwave. And he lay there, disheveled and trembling, but somehow still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...How am I-...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak his question, he was rudely interrupted. In the dark, but somehow not pressed flat, he was greeted with an avalanche of dirt that fell upon him. Struggling, he froze again when light suddenly returned. Tommy's huge sneaked lifted off the floor as he stepped away from the counter. Bryan stared at the filthy tread - watching it raise into the sky, moving away at such impossible speed before landing with a hefty crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself up, spitting and scraping dirt from his naked body. Immediately, Bryan realized his trick to survival - without thinking, he had fallen into one of the many ravine-sized gaps between each tile. \"Thank you mother for convincing me against linoleum!\" Looking around, he spotted Tommy's gigantic being across the room. The hapless teenager had no idea he nearly erased his neighbour's existence like a mere insect. Tommy clutched the package in one hand, idly tapping it against his leg, while he read the small note Bryan had left him with the juicy bit of currency attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScampering back onto the mesa-like tile, large chunks of dirt and grit had been left behind from the giant's tread. Each one larger than himself, but just as insignificant. Bryan frowned at the mess as he looked back to Tommy. \"Ever heard of wiping your feet? Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ridiculous comment went unheard by the gigantic teen who stood immensely tall and so far away. Tommy only crumpled the written note, pocketed the valuable one, and prepared to leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The day that he really put the miraculous formula he concocted that was capable of shrinking him smaller than an eighth of an inch to the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet before him on the kitchen table was a shipping box the size of his hand. Rather unremarkable at a glance, the current contents included an ordinary handkerchief, and a collection of minutely scaled supplies. These included everything Bryan would need for his journey. Bread crumbs, blankets, and a barely visible bottle of liquid. This liquid is the most important item he would have after shrinking, it was the antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA careful check of the contents to be sure all necessities were there, and Bryan turned his gaze to the vial sitting on the counter. Roughly the size of his thumb, this vial contained the breakthrough formula. Bryan was able to develop it with ingredients and chemicals he had meticulously smuggled from EDL labs where he worked. The resulting concoction was a pale blue liquid that tasted bittersweet, and almost instantly shrunk the user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heaving thrust, he sat himself on the counter. His whole body trembled in excitement, it always did at the thought of shrinking himself. The feeling never waned, even after testing it briefly six times already. This time would be the longest.

One quick motion, and he down the bitter liquid, his eyes closed in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full ten seconds later, the scientist opened his eyes, prepared to take in his new surroundings. Bryan found himself staring at his refrigerator, the numerous letter magnets still at eye level. Strange, he thought, the formula usually worked after only a few seconds, the longest having taken only ten. So far an entire minute had passed and he remained unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan remained seated on the counter, waiting for the expected change. 10 minutes passed. Then 25, and then 45 minutes. It was already passed 1 pm, and yet the formula had done nothing. His mind wandered over various explanations. Could he have developed some sort of resistance to it? Or, perhaps something went wrong while preparing it? He frowned as he stood up, annoyed and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to examine himself back in his makeshift laboratory. Reaching for the telephone, he dialed Tommy's phone number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tommy? This is Mr. Smith. I am afraid that I will be cancelling my trip till further notice.\" Tommy responded with disappointment, sad that the promised payment would be delayed. Bryan apologized, and hung up the phone. Bryan hated to disappoint the teen, but he needed to investigate this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confused scientist spent the rest of the day trying to determine the cause of his formulas failure. He preformed numerous tests on himself and the extra shrinking solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan finally resigned himself to sleep after finding no solid results, his mind was beyond weary from stress and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, he woke late the next morning. Wandering gloomily to the kitchen, he sighed st the sight of the unused shipping box. \"How could his formula not work?\" He thought angrily as he reached to open the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother distressed sigh emitted from the bedraggled man as he took in the empty refrigerator. He had purposefully not stocked it in preparation for his trip. His stomach grumbled noisily, demanding sustenance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing himself, Bryan went to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some hot food would do wonders to re-focus his mind on the problem at hand, so Bryan pulled on some casual clothes and grabbed his keys and wallet from the bowl at the antique stand near the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis highly organized brain kept chasing possible theories to explain the baffling failure of his shrinking formula, but he could not let everything slide because of a minor setback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan drove the short distance to a local diner less than five minutes from his home. As a consequence of living alone, he often took his meals at the diner rather than trying to cook for one at home. The diner's fare was average, and attracted most of its patrons by virtue of its convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diner wasn't too crowded when he entered. Most of the day's breakfast rush had already thinned out. He chose a booth at the rear of the diner and smiled when his favorite waiter approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Mr. Smith,\" Corby said, handing the college professor one of the tattered menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan smiled as he took the menu, but he kept his eyes on Corby, who was a handsome 20-year-old working his way through college with his job waiting tables at the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are classes?\" Bryan asked, admiring the tall, handsome youth. Corby stood several inches taller than Bryan, and had a nice body outlined nicely beneath his T-shirt decorated with the diner's logo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, but between working here and trying to finish my end-of-term projects, I've really been stretched thin,\" Corby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help,\" Bryan volunteered almost too eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that's good of you, but I'm not taking any science classes this semester,\" Corby said politely. He didn't mind that the professor was often less than subtle with his infatuation. It ensured generous tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be?\" The college student asked the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet soda, a club sandwich and fries,\" Bryan said, pausing to consider the last aspect of the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold the mayo?\" Corby volunteered, knowing that the professor had been focused on trimming some less healthy items from his diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt his stomach grumble. \"You know, I think I will just risk it today,\" he said. \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby grinned. \"No problem, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took back the menu and went to turn in Bryan's order at the very moment Tommy and his best friend entered the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy saw the professor and made a beeline toward the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, professor!\" The teenager said as his friend, Joe, followed behind him, obviously less enthusiastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tommy,\" Bryan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just grab a table, over there,\" Joe said, not hiding his complete indifference to the older man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were left alone, Tommy asked, \"So, what happened with your vacation...and that package you wanted mailed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't just blurt out that he had meant to mail himself halfway across the country to his nephew's dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few unexpected problems,\" he answered. \"But, I'm working on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy brightened immediately. \"Well, you just let me know. I'm still available to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that,\" Bryan said. \"You'll hopefully hear from me soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he talked to the teenager, the professor began to feel a strange sensation that spread out from his complaining stomach and caused his entire body to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll catch you later,\" Tommy said and turned to join Joe at a table on the other side of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, at the moment, was startled by the sudden queasy feeling. It was all too familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt himself falling. He screamed out Tommy's name, but his voice seemed swallowed by a sudden darkness as he collapsed into his own clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis position in the corner of the booth concealed his disappearance from the smattering of customers elsewhere in the diner. Suddenly freed of his body, the clothes slid to the floor, hidden by the laminate tabletop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself suddenly tiny and naked, the shocked scientist stumbled out of his own pants and onto the dingy green and white pattern of the diner's linoleum floor. From his lowly position, he gazed up at the underside of the table and saw giant wads of ancient gum left behind by rude patrons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Bryan squeaked as he realized that the shrinking formula had finally taken effect after its inexplicable 24-hour delay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seriousness of his situation made itself plainly obvious. He was a mere eight-of-an-inch tall on the floor of the huge diner, several miles from his home and the antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two massive sneakers thudded down on the linoleum and he heard Corby's massive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERE YOU GO, MR. SMITH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man heard the clatter on the other side of the table as Corby placed his order on the laminate surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man knew he was safe from the huge footwear as long as he remained beneath the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't just stay here forever,\" he said, trying to think of a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MR. SMITH?\" Corby asked, looking around for any sign of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he shrugged and decided that he must have gone to the restroom. Besides, he had other customers. He left the sandwich and soda on the table, making a mental note to return later and see if Mr. Smith needed anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant footwear thudded away, Bryan broke out of his paralysis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait! Don't leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feeble words went unheeded, hardly surprising given his extremely diminutive size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had two options:</span></div></div>",

Crumbs from meals of previous patrons were scattered across the floor, like boulders to the tiny man. Where the booth and wall met his eyes could discern the movement of what was probably a scavenging ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered and started walking briskly in the opposite direction. As he neared the edge of the table\u2019s shadow he became more aware of the noises of the active restaurant. His table was around a corner, in the back. Bryan treasured his privacy, and this had become his favorite spot. It also was the reason no one had noticed his \u201clittle\u201d problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the clangs and sizzles from the kitchen mixed with the thundering voices of hungry customers. Stopping, he allowed the noise to wash over him. He had to be proactive and get help quickly, if he wanted to return to normal. With a deep breath he strode out from under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK! *SQUEAL* A large black shoe missed him by inches as it marched by. \u201cOh!\u201d Bryan cried out as he scrambled back under the table. Corby, unaware of the close call, returned to the kitchen holding a tray of dirty dishes. Bryan breathed heavily due to the close encounter. He needed to be more careful, he wasn\u2019t used to dealing with people at this size. Marching out into the open simply wasn\u2019t an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking another minute to calm down somewhat, Bryan forced himself to venture out again. This time he stayed against the sheer cliff formed by the towering booths, all of which were luckily unoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more customers had come in to the restaurant, although it was still fairly empty. Bryan noted this and knew that less people meant less giants to worry about. Over the din of regular noise a loud laugh rang out. Bryan\u2019s face brightened when he heard it. Tommy had arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after he had and was just across the room. That thought dampened his mood. Tommy was across this massive room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan needed Tommy\u2019s help, there was no doubt. And he would eventually get to the teenager\u2019s table if he stuck to the walls. But Bryan was no fool and knew if he went as the crow flies across the room, he would get there much faster\u2026 of course with a much higher risk\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bryan clenched his jaw and sighed. He had decided to be proactive. That meant making difficult decisions that would be for the better. He glanced around the room, making sure no giants were approaching and began to trek out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved as quickly as he could, terrified a giant would come stomping through with careless and fatal steps. He ran past various boulder sized crumbs and hairs like fallen trees. At normal size the debris was undetectable, but for him they were obstacles in his frenzied flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian flinched at the sound of monstrous voices that swirled together like thunder. These people, whom he had been one of mere minutes ago, were now terrifyingly huge. Their complete ignorance to his presence, coupled with their heedless and casual power made them deadly threats to the tiny man. He remembered the close encounter with Corby\u2019s shoe. He needed to avoid the massive customers and get noticed by Tommy! Brian wasn\u2019t sure how to do the second part but decided he could figure it out later.<br>\r\nContinuing to flee, Brian struggled against the growing tightness in his chest. He was not an athletic person, having spent most of his time exercising his mind rather than his body. He realized now that he should have considered some training before attempting to reduce himself down to such an insignificant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian wheezed as he began to unconsciously slowdown from exhaustion. He forced himself to press forward though. In an attempt to measure his progress, Brian counted the faded tiles still stretching between him and Tommy. Two white, one green, two white, one green and so on. He counted thirteen, each one stretching several football fields\u2019 worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was hit with the desire to look back, but was scared to see his pathetic progress. In an effort to keep himself distracted Bryan stared at Tommy and his equally huge friends. However the sun shining through the windows blinded him, forcing him to face the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing was becoming more labored and somehow staring at the ground felt slightly better. Scratches, chips, and scuffs were easily visible on the aged tile that stretched before him. This only held his attention for less than a minute. Finally overwhelmed by curiosity, Bryan looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive tiles. He had counted quickly to such a small number. Disappointment and exhaustion combined so that Bryan stopped and fell to his knees. Having been consumed by his thoughts for much of the run, Bryan had assumed it would be further than that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wheezed in the shadow of a towering table. He felt tears of hopelessness stream down his face. He was miles from home, and from the antidote and no one would ever suspect he was miniaturized on the floor of his favorite diner! Who would ever even imagine such a preposterous idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh ring perks Bryan\u2019s ears. He looks up, wiping tears from his eyes to see the front door has swung open. From the table he has stopped below he has a clear view of the door. Bryan recognizes the blond behemoth as he strides in. It\u2019s none other than his towering neighbor Mike Duggan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the \u201cseat yourself\u201d policy Mike strolls across the room towards Brian\u2019s cowering form. Brian whimpers pathetically, feeling particularly vulnerable in the open space below the table. Mike\u2019s white high-tops stomp closer, affording Brian a view of the smudges of dirt and grime that mark the wall of the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes stop mere inches from Brian and he is unprepared for the deafening screeching as Mike effortlessly pulls a mountainous chair from the table. His shoes squeak as they shift allowing Mike to drop into the seat, causing the lofty piece of furniture to creak under his weight. The tiny man stares up the jean-clad legs which meet at a gray shirt that stretches further upward beyond where the tabletop obscures his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan jumps as a pair of soiled black shoes approaches the table seconds after Mike had sat down. Each titanic sneaker crashes down blindly onto the various obstacles Brian had been dodging mere minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a rumble of exchanged words as Corby and Mike talk. Brian, figuring Mike made a more convenient savior than Tommy, began to cautiously approach his massive sneaker.<br>\r\nSuddenly Mike\u2019s face appears from the side of the table, his piercing blue eyes seemingly staring straight into Bryan\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike! Help me! I\u2019m right here!\u201d Bryan yells, waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEAH CORBY! I WOULD SAY YOU HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM!\u201d he says seriously, eliciting a confused grunt from Brian. Mike\u2019s right shoe lifts up without warning, flying closer to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno\u2026 NO!\u201d he screams in terror. The sole becomes easily visible, various dirt and grime packed deep into the tread. To his relief it passes him, and Brian watches as it slams down onto a couple of wriggling black ants. He snaps his head back up to his colossal neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike\u2019s handsome features are twisted into a warm smile. \u201cHAHA, DON\u2019T WANT THESE LITTLE GUYS AROUND HERE! THAT\u2019S FOR SURE!\u201d he laughs, as his head disappears to face Corby again. The shoe remains in place. Brian can make out half of one of the ants struggling at the edge of Mike\u2019s shoe, where it\u2019s back half had been crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sputtered in fear at the unprovoked and merciless attack Mike had made on the ants. All because they were so insignificant to him. Above he could hear him laughing with Corby, having already dismissed the lives beneath his massive foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could\u2019ve been me!\u201d Brian gasped in fear. Mike had always been so nice and helpful! But now at this size he was simply monstrous! Instinct told Brian to run, but logic reminded him that he still needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no ant!\u201d Brian roared to himself, \u201cThey\u2019ll see that!\u201d he added to reassure himself. Feeling more confident, Brian...</span></div></div>",

Like a rusted toy, his tiny legs remained in place, despite his increasingly desperate attempts to move them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What...the....fuck...</i>?!\" He said, grunting angrily to pull his feet off of the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing it, Bryan had blundered into a spot of liquid that dried to an almost glue-like substance. Both his little pink feet were firmly planted in it, with little leeway. His right foot pulled a little bit, yet remained stuck fast. Bryan screamed. A primal cry filled with all the emotion he had been building up since this began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to both his world and plight, Mike adjusted his enormous shoe slightly. It dragged backwards, grinding against the tiled floor with a gritty noise and finished with an idle shift of the toe region. The minor movements sent bothersome aftershocks, rattling tiny Bryan who barely kept his balance. If he fell, the bug-sized man might find his naked body stuck in the unnoticed gunk permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant pounding alerted him of another passing giant. The behemoth remained out of view, his gigantic sneakers only visible while he stomped nearby. Bryan watched, noting with a spark of recognition that they belonged to another employee of the diner. They crashed out of view, passing another familiar pair that belonged to Corby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bryan's entire body had become soaked with sweat. All his pulling and crying, Bryan feared any further attempts might very well rend his sensitive soles from his feet! Yet, when he did so, his foot peeled and popped from the sticky spill. Bryan cheered, balancing with huffing breathes. He felt his other foot squish slightly, moist from his own sweat. With a final leap, he plopped onto dry tile as a pile of sweaty limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan pulled himself up, clearing his face of sweat and thanking his lucky stars. \"I've gotta be careful...! That was a freaking deathtrap!\" He gazed at the spot in question, roughly the size of a large puddle and visible only as a pinkish slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash exploded behind him. Squeaking, the tiny scientist remembered his mission: <i>get Mike's attention</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to his lowly position upon the floor, this could only be done one way. Bryan would have to scale his gargantuan neighbour's huge sneaker! The leftmost one rested nearby. Bryan could only stare at it as he did before - a positive mountain constructed of hard rubber, dark canvas and suede, with laces thicker than trains. Worst part, Mike was constantly shifting his feet: tapping, sliding, and twisting them while he simply waited for his order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could think of nothing else but the ants Mike cruelly erased. Stomping them underneath without a second thought just because they dared to expose themselves under his table! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will see me! He's got too! Mike is my friend - he's <i>going</i> to save me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeled once again, Bryan ran towards the shoe - intent on his rescue. The towering footwear remained still as he approached, only emitting audible groans and gritty crunches as the giant man's foot shifted inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan quickly found himself nearing the looming rubber sole. He grimaced, noting every wear and tear of the previously white surface. It was coated in collections of dirt and dried mud that collected in every crevice and scrape. Predominately, a light green stain had been washed over the the lower half, coating the entire sole. This discolouration was a result of Mike's yard work, Bryan realized. It seemed each time Mike stomped through his yard, either to mow it or rend humongous weeds from the earth, were all evidenced on the sides of his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to not waste any more time, Bryan walked towards it, reaching. Suddenly, the shoe shifted again - dragging away from Bryan as it did and leaving behind collections of dirt. The tiny man jumped back, afraid for his life. The huge wall of stained rubber halted a few dozen feet away - nothing more than a couple inches to the oblivious owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark, smeared mass had been revealed pasted to the hard floor almost directly before the shrunken man. Bryan tore his awe-struck gaze to inspect it, but quickly retched back when he realized what it was. \"An ant!\" He gasped, clutching at his mouth daintily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfortunate creature had been devolved into a chunky, obliterated smear by the careless giant's tread. Legs, antennae, guts, and exoskeleton all crushed with such force to almost render the tiny life unrecognizable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan cried out despite himself. He never liked bugs: especially ants. Yet, now he was reduced smaller than them and dropped into their terrifying world. He couldn't help but feel horrified - and sick to his stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away, he returned his judgment to the tremendous footwear towering above him. Before this, Bryan could never have thought of Mike as anything but he helpful, nice, and neighbourly guy that he was. Shivering slightly, Bryan felt as though this friendly guy had been transformed into a capricious titan that wrought nothing but death and destruction wherever he walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud noises caught the tiny man's attention, redirecting his gaze past the gigantic hightop sneaker and up the looming tower of denim that was Mike's leg. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still waiting for his order, Mike idly flipped through a laminated display set on his table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing on a few pages, but ultimately uninterested, his stomach wanted nothing more than the food he ordered. He replaced the display next to a bottle of ketchup and yawned. Just then, a single black ant revealed itself from hiding and began frenzied trek across the enormous tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of his wife and child, along with food rolled through Mike's mind before suddenly evaporating when he caught sight of the tiny explorer. It continued, slowly from Mike's lofty perspective, but topping the charts of the local ant colony for speed before meeting up with a single crumb near the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smirked at it. <i>Dumb, pesky creature</i>, he mused. They always seemed to be crawling around where they shouldn't be. Lifting his hand, thumb poised out, he reduced the ant into a mixture of smeared body parts and crumb. The diner couldn't be blamed; after all, where ever food existed, so did tiny invaders. Mike frequently arbitrated his home and yard for them on a consistent basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was his own desire to be thorough, or just fate, Mike happened to lean over and gaze underneath the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, these little guys don't give up!\" He smiled with clement judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, he moved his sneaker to deal with the stubborn invader. It utterly dwarfed the tiny black dot of a life, casting it into shadow before he slammed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mike; that was it. A simple maneuver of his large foot and he was done. He had no reason to think anything else of what he had done. If the tiny creature had survived in the deep, aggressive waffle pattern of his sneakers, or if he even had a right to decide the insect's fate. To him it was nothing more than insignificant and unimportant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud disturbances echoed from above - signaling his giant neighbour's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan swallowed his fears and resumed his efforts. \"<i>M-m-m-mike</i>! Down here...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis instinct for survival nagged at him, as if to tell him that running for cover was his only chance. Bryan ignored it. His neighbour Mike had always been a beacon of help for him. Many, many occasions, the selfless man had gone out of his way to help Bryan with something - regardless of the physical toll or time. Then he would reward Bryan by inviting him to his BBQs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got to help me!\" Assurance seemed to fill his very limbs. Bryan looking up, craning to see even the crest of the gigantic man's knees that loomed so far above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whole mountain of a man seemed to stir and without warning, Bryan was looking at his titanic neighbour's handsome face once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike!\" Bryan squealed, his voice cracking from so much use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond giant's face seemed like always: warm, friendly, welcoming, and willing to help. Huge blue eyes locked directly onto him. His tiny limbs feeling like liquid under their monumental stare. The tiny man's thoughts came to a frozen stop when the giant opened his great maw to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH,\" Mike's planetary lips moved, somewhat out of sync. \"THESE LITTLE GUYS DON'T GIVE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did the intense feeling of both betrayal and fear return. It hit the bug-sized man like a tidal wave, and sent him into a frenzy of gibbering flight. Mixed cries of \"<i>No!</i>\", \"<i>Stop!</i>\", \"<i>Not a bug!</i>\", and \"<i>Mike, please!</i>\" burst from his bloody and chapped lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan spared a wide-eyed look backwards when he heard the gargantuan hi-top sneaker peel off the filthy floor. He had barely covered enough distance to be noteworthy, but it still proved enough to be his downfall. He had completely forgotten about the menace of sticky residue, and in his desperate escape the tiny man blundered right into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet locked into the slime, halting his flight abruptly enough to propel him to the ground. Bryan managed to twist around in time, landing upon his back instead of his face - a mercy which saved him from being smashed blindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the shade of the towering table, Bryan could still see the outline of shadow cast by his gigantic neighbour's oversized shoe. It passed over him, effectively darkening everything while the sky became dominated by the immensity of the sole. \"No, no, no, no... Not this... Mike, no...\" Twisting and turning proved fruitless. Becoming stuck in the residue was superfluous, as Bryan was doomed from the start. Alone, the scale of his neighbour's huge sole was over three football fields long - more than Bryan could ever hope to run before he being crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan just stared, his mouth a wordless scream. If he had thought the Vans hi-tops to be filthy, worn, and terrifying from afar; then he knew the grime-filled underside to be far worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery indentation of tread, all presented high above in looming glory, made up a mass of waffle-comb cells in tan rubber. Each one filled with a new display of pulverized gunk; both organic and inorganic. Tiny shreds of grass, bits of grit, pebbles of various size, smashed crumbs, and varying collections of dirt were visible all over. Most of all, Bryan gasped when he noticed far more organic parts - namely, body parts - smashed all over. He saw the twitching remains of what he knew to be the ants from before; all intermingled with other tiny, unnoticed species that perished under the behemoth's careless step - and all this under only <i>one</i> of a pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Bryan figured, he would be joining them. A scientist of epic proportions would be obliterated into nothing along with many common insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mere second of thoughtful study ended and with stomach turning speed, the enormous tread descended upon him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM</i>.</span></div></div>",

It took a second for that oddity to soak into this mind - if his ears had popped then he was still alive!<br>\r\nJust as he realised that amazing fact the darkness around him lurched and he was slammed by a wall of rubber tread as Mike ground his foot onto what he thought was a bug. Bryan shrieked as he was tumbled around.<br>\r\nLight flooded in as Mike lifted his foot but Bryan's terror was compounded as he felt himself lifted through the air. All the tumbling had pulled him free of the sticky gunk but had also meant he was completely coated in it and had stuck inside one of the hexagonal shaped holes in Mike's tread. <br>\r\nHe was plunged back into darkness as Mike resettled his foot on the floor, oblivious to the tiny neighbour stuck to the sole of his foot. The insignificant act of stomping out an annoying bug was already fading from his mind as he waited for his order to arrive.<br>\r\nFaint music from the kitchen reached his ears and, unconsciously, his foot started tapping in time with the beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggled but the sticky residue had him stuck tight. Then the foot tapping began and Bryan's nightmare escalated.<br>\r\nOver and over again he was pulled up and slammed down. Light invading his rubber prison before darkness slapped at him. He threw up and was pathetically grateful that at least Mike's foot moved enough that he wasn't immediately thrust into his own vomit. The rapid changes in direction, the almost strobe effect of the light and the repeated changes in air pressure were making him delirious and he could feel himself losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his meal finally finished, Mike reached into his pocket and pulled out some cash, leaving it with the bill. As he stood up and thought about heading home he realised his bladder needed some relief. He considered using the diner's rest room but they were often not all that clean. He wondered if he could hold on until he got home.<br>\r\nShrugging his shoulder he headed into the men's room. As he approached one of the urinal's his distaste was confirmed - they definitely needed to get in here with a mop and bucket. Trying to avoid the random pools of dried and fresh urine around the bases of the urinals was almost pointless so he simply walked up to them and unzippered. He breathed a sigh of relief as his piss poured out. He definitely wouldn't have made it home. <br>\r\nZipping himself back up and stepping over to a basin to wash his hands, he made a mental note to give the soles of his shoes a clean before he entered the house.<br>\r\nWalking back through the diner he headed out to the car.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Above him, Bryan could hear the indiscernible thunder of Mike's voice. Bryan padded backwards, distancing himself from his neighbour's enormous shoe and gazing up the tower of denim. His mind swimming with the sound of Mike's booming and callous words only moments ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shuddered as Mike's humongous shoe dragged backwards, causing a calamity of squeaks and grinding dirt from the shoe tread. Bryan noticed the front half of the ant had been separated, still wriggling painfully and trying to crawl away from the huge sole still close by. The suffering ant made barely any progress before falling still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an ant... but, fuck!\" Bryan felt his reassurance draining the more he looked at the mangled creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike would surely give Bryan all the help he needed - if only Bryan could make himself known to the now behemoth of a man. That alone would be nigh impossible! Bryan figured he would be lucky to even get the recognition the ants had received from his giant neighbour. The huge sneaker now rested further back, the toe pressed against the floor while the heel idly shifted and bounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan took another look at the torn ant remains and decided on his previous coarse of action. Get to Tommy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis normally helpful and cordial neighbour was just too fucking big. Standing somewhere between 6' and 6'3, Mike was now a massive behemoth that wouldn't think twice about flattening another pesky ant under his huge feet. <i>Bryan did not want to be that ant!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby had already stomped away, leaving Bryan's exit wide and open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles upon miles of enormous tile flooring stretched out before him. Bits of fallen particles of food, hair, and dirt littered the landscape and the occasional giant customer pounded across at random. Far off - on the other end of the restaurant as fate would have it - sat Tommy and his fellows, eating and joking. Bryan cringed, but on he went; more foolhardy than brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner than he had hoped, Bryan felt himself slowing down from exhaustion. His curiosity prickled, desiring to turn around and inspect his hard-earned progress, but Bryan resisted and continued. Besides the bothersome dirt and crumbs strewn in his path, not a single giant customer bothered him. This made him feel more confident, as he jogged onward counting the remaining tiles that spanned many football fields before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally gazed back, trepidation twisting his face and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only covered six tiles. Six! Mike, still seated at his table, dominated his view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond behemoth with his friendly face was focused on the meal set before him, completely unaware of Bryan's misty gaze. Lifting the massive burger, Mike crunched into it, rending a large chunk and loudly chewing it. The display of eating was impressive, if not unsettling to the tiny man. Bryan only wished his circumstances were not so life-threatening to allow him some voyeuristic pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping at his face, he turned back to his target and continued trekking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck still seemed on his side, as Bryan was only endangered briefly when Corby lumbered nearby. The giant college student's black sneakers slammed against the tiles with such force to almost knock tiny Bryan over. He passed quickly, oblivious and busied himself with another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan meanwhile made slow, but smooth progress. He passed three more tiles - a feat that would be impressive to any athlete given his reduced size. In his path, stood a monumental counter flanking the front door. Bryan was unable to view the top, but already knew this was the check-out counter. He was more than halfway to Tommy and potential rescue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumps of dirt and pebbles seemed concentrated in this area. Customers would enter the establishment, their huge pounding footwear releasing truckloads worth of grime with each step. This was largely unnoticeable to the regular person, but to the bug-sized man, the collections of fallen grime proved irksome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan was to reach the counter base and follow it around on his way towards Tommy. It offered a much needed net of safety and respite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan didn't even think of the danger he placed himself in getting there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cross the restaurant directly or play it safe(er) and keep against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped from his thoughts when the ground began to shudder. Relatively many hundreds of feet away, but still too close for comfort, loomed an enormous customer. Bryan felt his blood pressure increase once more, his body pushing harder against the huge baseboard behind him. Huge black Adidas sneakers crashed upon the tiled floor with concussive blasts before lifting for another step. Bryan noted how each monumental movement caused his tiny bones to jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide eyed, he watched the huge young man approach one of the bar stools. His cosmic attention never turning to the floor as he seated his enormous bulk and proceeded to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is so damn huge!\" Bryan needed Tommy's help, sooner than later, but running out into the open floor simply seemed suicidal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wanted to survive long enough to be rescued, he had to play smart. The door jingled far off, signaling more customer's entry. Bryan decided that sticking to the walls was the safest way to reach Tommy. He eyeballed where the route would take him: past at least half a dozen booths and ultimately past the glass entry door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly realized a downside to this rather safe plan. At his small size, such a journey would realistically take an hour, likely more. Tommy would be well and finished with his meal by then and have left long before Bryan even approached his booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Bryan found himself thoughtlessly sprinting alongside the towering baseboard. Pausing for thought would only ensure his failure. He had to move quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby thundered by, his powerful steps almost tripping the tiny man. The massive black sneakers covered large distances, bringing the gigantic waiter to his destination. He greeted and began conversing with the giant wearing the black Adidas; the two of them interacting like buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan bit his lip. Corby was a smart kid, and would likely be more than willing to offer help to the shrunken man, if only he would notice him. Bryan couldn't afford to even risk a closer encounter with the humongous waiter. Tommy was definitely the safer option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of customers raised from their seats and proceeded towards the exit with pounding steps. This subtraction made Bryan feel slightly safer until moments later the door swung open again. And just to spite the bug-sized man, the new-comers approached one of the empty booths in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not there! Go away!\" He allowed himself to wave his arms uselessly against the gigantic duo. They remained unaware of his lint-sized protests, and proceeded to seat themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, they were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idea of exposing himself out there was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided that he needed to find to a good spot to wait for Corby and possibly get help. Starting to march towards the edge of the table\u2019s shadow, Bryan focused on the spot where Corby had stood. As he got closer he could see an odd black shape twitching. Still in the shadow under the table Bryan stopped, gasping when he realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan could see where Corby\u2019s massive sneakers had crashed down onto an unnoticed bug. A half crushed ant struggled to move, but half its body was flattened and its legs were mangled. It had no chance but to remain in place until it died or was crushed completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m screwed\u201d he muttered automatically.

As he looked around to see if the man was somewhere in the restaurant, his feet shifted, completely flattening the ant from earlier. Corby however didn\u2019t notice the bug smashed under his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby figured Mr. Smith had some sort of emergency and had to leave the restaurant. He glanced out into the parking lot, but had no idea what the man\u2019s car looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby decided that if Mr. Smith wasn\u2019t back by the time he clocked off for his break, it was his duty as a starving college student to keep the meal from going to waste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan slipped down the thread for the second time. \u201cAugh!\u201d he grumbled, his grip slipping.

It had only gotten worse when Corby\u2019s massive shoes had returned and he had witnessed the ant mercilessly obliterated without effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he had slipped back down to the floor. Deciding to take a breather, Bryan tries to ignore the pain starting to radiate all over his body. Just before he starts climbing again, Corby\u2019s massive shoes return once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, slightly used to their place away from under the table gawks at them for only a few seconds before focusing on the thread in front of him.

Corby\u2019s movement stops, his massive shoes planted on either side of Bryan. The wall of the shoe is stained with grease and food, while the fabric and thread holding it together frays from age.

As he begins to climb, a doubt forms in his mind. Sure Corby was the easiest and nearest giant, but did that make him the best choice? Tommy was somewhere in the restaurant, and the teenager was always eager to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bryan reminded himself that sometimes he and Corby would chat about science, since the young college student was going into a science field.

Corby opens the sandwich and adds a squirt of ketchup. Satisfied, Corby grabs a couple fries and pops it into his mouth. As he chews he feels his left foot and reaches down to scratch it. He attempts to rub through his shoe to get to the itch. Finally his foot feels better and he leans back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flits his fingers to shake the bits of salt from the first fries and closes the sandwich.

Determined not to be thwarted, the bug-sized man lurched across the shoe, finally reaching a wall of white cotton. He threw himself toward the wall, finding handholds in the knotted cotton fabric of the socks. Climbing this vertical surface proved even easier than he had hoped. Surrounding him was the interior fabric of Corby's pants that wrapped around the youth's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith surprised himself with the ease of his climb, but eventually the sock ended and he came to a halt near Corby's powerful calf muscles. Fortunately for the little climber, Corby's leg offered plenty of hairs to use to continue his ascent. He worried that this mode of ascent might trigger some sort of reaction from Corby if the gigantic waiter felt an itch as Mr. Smith climbed from hair to hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a risk I've got to take,\" the tiny man decided, reaching for a nearby hair as he kept pulling himself higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the titan moved, the tiny man forced himself to hold securely to a hair and wait for an opportune moment. It made progress slower, but he rose higher on the leg until he passed Corby's knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist didn't look forward to the next stage of his climb. He decided that a quick passage over the titan's thighs and past his underwear would serve him well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just need to get to his shirt,\" Bryan decided and kept climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Corby leaned over one of the food prep bars in the restaurant's kitchen and spoke to one of his fellow waiters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get that table of high school kids?\" Corby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Daniel answered, obviously not thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucks to be you,\" Corby said. \"Those guys never tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to that table of one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean Mr. Smith?\" Corby said. \"He just disappeared.

The bowl didn't look all that clean, either, and he knew that the entire roster of employees had never been keen on the chore of keeping the employee restroom sanitary and clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan felt his grasp on the fabric weakening. \"Help! Please. It's me. Down here!\" Even as he screamed, he knew the giant waiter couldn't hear him, and to make matter worse, Bryan felt the titanic man move again. He tried to brace himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing with his piss, Corby let out a small groan of relief. He looked straight down at his thick cock as he gave it a few last shakes to clear off the last of the piss. Before he tucked himself away again, he groped at his cock, getting an instant response from the testosterone filled muscle. A smile came to his face, and he decided to ignore Daniel's instructions not to jerk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had failed to notice the tiny form that was flung off his underwear when he shook his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have five minutes left on my break,\" Corby said as he took two lumbering steps to his left, bringing himself into view of his bathroom mirror. He flexed his chest muscle as he tugged on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny scientist, gravity won after he was flung into space, down to land with a splash in a sea of stale piss in a filthy, deep bowl. </span></div></div>",

In the process of relieving himself, the gigantic youth had shaken the tiny, hidden man from a fold in his boxers to fall deep into the filthy toilet bowl in the restaurant's restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gnat-sized man surfaced, he didn't dwell on the yellow-tinted water or the sickening smell in the none-too-tidy bowl the size of a small lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared up as Corby fondled a skyscraper-sized cock hanging over his pushed-down boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Corby!\" Mr Smith cried in as loud a voice as he could manage. The curved bowl swallowed his feeble screams, which didn't even reach beyond the rim to Corby's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby groaned as his excitement increased, but a sudden loud knock interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, man,\" Daniel shouted through the door. \"Break's over. It's get busy out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby frowned, but quickly tucked away his enormous cock and pulled up the boxers and his pants. Fastening the front of his pants, he glanced down toward the bowl and realized that someone should really give it a good scrubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think I'll tell Daniel that's his job,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith kept screaming and splashing, hoping Corby would detect him before\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

It was enough to suck down the tiny bug of a man afloat on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist fought with all his strength to break free of the whirlpool. He was fortunate that the toilet had never quite flushed right. Only a little water was sucked down the pipes before a heavy backwash pushed the speck of a man back to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, however, Corby had left, leaving Mr. Smith stranded, only a fourth of an inch tall, inside the enormous, dirty toilet bowl. He swam to the edge and tried to climb the smooth porcelain walls, but the slick surface was made even more difficult to climb from a slimy coating that had formed over the ill-kept toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time he tried to get higher, he slid back into the bowl of water and stale piss. The tiny man spit the foul mixture out of his mouth, but he could not get rid of the reeking smell that now clung to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn despair, he realized he could not possibly escape. He was doomed to eventually tire and drown or, even more likely, get flushed down when the toilet finally did work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed an ironic summary of his life and work, with everything going down the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as things looked their bleakest, however, he heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a huge giant loomed over the bowl.

He used his right hand to give his cock's aim some extra precision, pointing it down directly at the little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insect disappeared under the stream, knocked below the surface. He looked for it and finally found it an inch or two away. He laughed and simply re-directed his cock, hitting the disgusting bug with his stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny man, this was his most humiliating moment yet. The teenager deliberately pissing on him and laughing about his pathetic struggle to get out of his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could not escape. Whenever he managed to swim away from the stream, Tommy simply pointed at him again. Eventually, however, the stream began to falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tommy finished, he shook his cock, dropping a few last drops into the bowl.

He swam toward the curved slope at the edge of the pool of filthy water in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pressed down the handle on the side of the toilet tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager held the handle down instead of simply slapping it quickly and releasing. His actions helped the bowl drain completely this time, grabbing the little bug in a powerful whirlpool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vortex sucked him screaming into the depths, this time without release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen fresh water entered the bowl, it was immediately tainted by the less-than-sanitary conditions of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't worry too much about that.

He had made surprisingly quick progress up Corby\u2019s shoe\u2026 However there was still the rest of the towering giant\u2019s height to scale. Bryan fought the crushing feeling of discouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan looks up Corby\u2019s towering, jean-clad leg and hopes that the material will provide adequate footholds. Corby\u2019s foot starts shifting below him. Grasping the material underneath, a shadow from above gets his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight he\u2019s greeted with elicits a terrified whimper. Corby\u2019s huge hand is stretching down towards him as if to snatch him up. His slender fingers dig into the shoe\u2019s material, shaking Bryan loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan goes crashing into a finger, grains of salt stuck to the fingerprint. Bryan slams into Corby\u2019s finger and sticks fast. Moving with the finger for a moment, Bryan\u2019s breath is sucked out of his lungs as he flies upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finds himself hovering over the plate of food that he had ordered earlier. Before he has the chance to wonder about this, another of Corby\u2019s fingers slams into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain radiates through his body as he free-falls. After a short scream he lands with a splat. Clearing his face he realizes he is surrounded by a sea of ketchup and mayo. The world is then turned upside down, as with a splat Bryan ends up in darkness. Bryan is terrified as a crunch reverberates through the darkness. He is trapped\u2026 in Corby\u2019s sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby munches through his first bite, surprised by how good the sandwich is. He should have tried it, since Mr. Smith bought it so often. As he swallows he replaces the sandwich on the plate and dips his fries in ketchup. Munching on the fries Corby wonders where Mr. Smith had gotten to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately the man had started talking about a new project with huge potential. Maybe he had left for that. \u2018I\u2019ll just have to remember to ask him next time he comes in\u2019 Corby thinks to himself. Deep in thought, Corby eats on auto-pilot. He is barely conscious of the bites of sandwich and fries he pops into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts the sandwich up and takes a large bite. A piece of lettuce, smeared with mayo hangs from his lips. Looking around the diner at the customers, Corby does what comes naturally, and sucks the lettuce between his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is a really good sandwich!\u2019 he thinks to himself as he swallows the bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles in the thick sauce and darkness. He feels the movement every time Corby moves the sandwich or takes a massive bite. He has no sense of direction or even any way to tell if he is actually moving. Bryan tries calling for help, but his cries are muffled by the sauce and bread surrounding him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A nearer crunch lets light stream in and Bryan turns towards it. The lettuce beneath him moves forward taking him with it. Bryan sees a pair of lips grasping the lettuce and screams, frantically trying to avoid Corby\u2019s mouth. His arms flail trying to find an anchor.</span></div></div>",

Looking up he can see Corby's defined nose hovering above, his eyes however are focused elsewhere. Of course, why would he bother staring at his food. Just as Corby opens his mouth with a smack to suck the lettuce in, Bryan feels himself fall backwards. Yet again he is in free fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby swallows his bite. Suddenly he wishes he had a cell phone to distract himself, but he just didn't have the extra money for it. Daniel marches by with a tray of drinks. He pauses and looks at Corby \"You're cleaning the table you're eating at!\" he says seriously, before leaving to deliver the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby glances at the table to see some drops of ketchup and mayo, apparently from eating.

As if in response the giant licks his lips and swallows before returning to his meal. Bryan flinches as the crunch of the latest bite sounds from above.

Mopping up the mess seemed preferable to having to wipe down the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny man saw the massive fries coming toward him, he pushed free and ran toward a silver and white tower on the edge of the horizon. Sparing a quick glance over his shoulder, he saw giant Corby swipe up the mayo/ketchup with the fries, popping them into his mouth. Chewing quickly, he swallowed and got to his feet as the unseen little man continued to run across the tabletop in the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer to the strange tower, he recognized it as a gleaming metal dispenser filled with white paper napkins. He ducked behind the tower, daring to gaze across the vast plain of the tabletop. Corby, feeling full by his stolen meal, rose to his feet and prepared to get back to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, three hungry teenagers from Tommy's high school entered the restaurant. They saw the empty table vacated by Corby. A few blots of ketchup didn't bother them. They just wanted the first available table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan froze in place in the shadow of the towering napkin dispenser. He gazed up at the epic trio of teenagers. The tallest youth had black skin, dark brown eyes and a strong, intimidating face. They all wore their school's blue and gold sports jerseys, which fit tightly over their muscular torsos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shortest youth looked Latino with a warm brown skin and black eyes. He wore a baseball cap on his head, which covered his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last teenager to take a seat at the table had light brown hair and green eyes. He was almost as tall as his black friend, but not quite as well built. Nevertheless, to the tiny, unseen scientist they each looked like colossal titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, he saw Tommy and his friends approaching the table, which meant they were leaving the restaurant. Tommy represented his best hope for rescue, but he could not remain in hiding and try to contact his gigantic neighbor. </span></div></div>",

He cried out, turning his head to and fro and attempting to animate himself while still keeping his break-neck pace. It all seemed pointless as the enormous space around him seemed to swallow all his efforts up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEELP ME!\" His throat began to feel hoarse and dry. \"Look down! Help me, I am down here! Right in front of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous concert of booming rumbles and thooming laughs responded. Bryan couldn't even understand the speech produced by the gigantic teenagers. Their huge lips would move and moments later the explosive thunder would follow. He felt as if he had intruded upon a meeting of gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above loomed the ebony hand and wrist belonging to the tall, intimidating teen. It landed with the concussive force of a falling skyscraper and sent tremendous vibrations through the table. Bryan was flung off balance and onto his rear, flopping painfully against the hard surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's brain suddenly kicked into gear. Huge, thick fingers lifted at random before crashing back to the table with dull thuds. The rest of the dark skinned arm stretched over the immediate horizon like a mountain range. An enormous wrist watch of dull steel wrapped around the titanic hairy bulk that constantly shifted and flexed. He gulped nervously, but relented knowing this was his chance to get their attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate had different plans for the shrunken scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AN ANT? GROSS.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan froze and dumbly gawked at the monumental face high above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already intimidating teenager now looked downright terrifying. His thick brow was coated with a throng of dark, wiry hairs that gave him a powerful look. It moved like surface of a great mountain, knotting together with annoyance. Bryan whimpered, unable to contain himself as warm urine ran down his right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... am n-n-n-not an ant...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis argument went unheard, evidenced by the blank look of annoyance in the huge eyes. They bored down upon his tiny form, as if attempting to extinguish his pesky presence by just staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had never expected nor prepared for such an encounter. His formula was only meant to be used under safe and controlled conditions. He had absolutely no idea what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT an ant!\" He yelled, this time with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, the titanic teenager had remained relatively still. Staring at the tiny man, and briefly turning his planetary head to make a thunderous remark. Bryan began to slowly approach the giant, hoping to make meaningful contact. He knew he had to act fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-skinned titan had other plans. Bryan screamed when the once-resting hand suddenly lifted into the air and loomed overhead. He stared upwards, taking in the enormous palm and craning fingers. A lighter colour than the rest of the dark skin, the palm was wrinkled and creased like landscape seen from a plane. The fingers curled inwards, all except the index. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shifted and seemed to position itself over the tiny man.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bryan slips downwards through sauce before stopping in a melted slice of cheese. This gives him a perfect view of Corby's lips as he chews, occasionally parting with a smack and a flash of chewed food. They clench as he swallows the bite down. Corby uses his other hand to drag some fries through ketchup, still holding the sandwich in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles to move as he has no choice but to watch Corby's massive tongue slither out of his mouth. Mounds of chewed fries, flakes of lettuce, and balls of soggy bread and meat are scattered across the tongue. They are mere remnants of the mountains of food that Corby is easily devouring. A glance upwards confirms that Corby is unaware of the destruction just inside his mouth as his eyes focus elsewhere. As the fries disappear into his mouth and he begins to chew, Bryan tries shouting and waving once more. In spite of his great intellect, no feasible ideas come to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan forces himself to look away as he tries to think of a way out. The sounds of chewing wash over him as he searches fruitlessly for an escape plan. A loud gulp permeates his thoughts, returning Bryan's attention to Corby's massive lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth yawns open, again revealing the shifted piles of chewed food spread across the tongue. Light streams in, reflecting off strands of saliva between jagged molars and a swaying uvula over the darkness of the throat. Corby inhales as he goes in for the bite, the sharp sound of a gale stinging Bryan's tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sandwich enters the cavern, he is finally hit with the stench and humidity inside the giant's mouth. For Bryan this was literally the end game; for Corby it was a single bite in a relaxing but forgettable meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby sinks his teeth through the sandwich, another satisfying crunch sounding across the table. Unaware of his minuscule customer trapped in his mouth, Corby begins to chew. Crunch after crunch fill his ears, making the sandwich more satisfying. Bryan's screams of terror as he is thrown about randomly go completely unheard by Corby. Occasionally the mouth opens to illuminate flying, soggy bits of food and glimpses of sharp teeth, deepening Bryan\u2019s terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith hardly any thought, Corby moves the lump of food to the back of his mouth. Bryan attempts to fight but it is no use as with a simple gulp, Bryan is forced down Corby's throat with the food. Corby, utterly oblivious and dismissive to the workings of his digestive tract, begins to think about his school projects as Bryan enters the stomach with a splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorby easily downs the rest of the sandwich and fries, each bite quickly forgotten as it\u2019s gulped down. Soon a mountain of food forms in his stomach. While continuing to scream for help, Bryan attempts to scale it. With no way to know of the struggle inside his toned torso, Corby lifts the glass of soda to his mouth and drains it. As the last gulp of soda disappears down his throat, Corby doesn\u2019t feel the mountain of food in his stomach leveled by the incoming waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan struggles with anger and disappointment that his genius discovery had led him to the inside of a handsome young man's gut. When Corby returns to work, his movement causes wave after wave to stir the food violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater while taking an order, Corby's stomach groans as acid begins to flood his stomach. Unaware of the shouts of terror echoing around the mounds of food in his gut, Corby smiles and mutters \"excuse me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A seemingly endless terrain of white and brown tiles stretched around him. The floor hadn't been swept that day, as apparent by the boulder sized crumbs and debris covering the floor. Other marks on the floor, likely invisible to the normal eye, looked positively unpleasant to his tiny eyes. One in particular seemed to move. Where Corby's monster-sized footwear previously stood, Bryan was able to discern the half-flattened body of an ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that bug is bigger than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing at the unfortunate ant, his eyes threatened to tear up. Not for the suffering insect, but for himself and his dangerous situation. The ant twitched violently, thrusting its head back and forth and trying to move whatever mangled limbs were still attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to remain calm, the tiny genius returned to formulating a plan. He knew that he above all needed somebody's help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corby. I just need to find him and get his attention. I can count on him!\" The slim hope brought a much needed smile to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping free from the shaded sanctuary offered by his table, Bryan stuck close where the booth met the floor. He scanned the patrons, looking for any sign of Corby. Among them was a few people seated on the bar stools, as well as many occupying booths like Bryan's. His longing gaze went from Tommy and his friends, drifting to some police men that were seated three booths down. The two cops would surely give him the assistance he needed, yet all the same, the thought of them inquiring or possibly reporting Bryan to EDL Labs made him think against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with his long strides, appeared Corby from around the counter. His arms laden with many dirty plates, his eyes anywhere but the ground. Bryan sprinted, waving his arms and leaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis diminutive motions went unnoticed. Corby continued by, his long feet thudding heavily and covering vast distances with each step. Twisting around, he shoved through a tall door that swung noisily shut behind him. Bryan felt dejected. He barely covered what would translate to a foot of space trying to catch up to the gigantic waiter. The busy waiter was always moving and never halted for more than a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get to the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor remained clear: all patrons were seated, and only one other waiter was present. He would be forced to cover a great distance of open tile. On this side of the diner, only Bryan's booth and a few bar stools were available. Besides a young couple seated at the counter, there would be no other obstacles. Bryan nodded and set coarse, speeding clumsily around large crumbs and clods of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe neared the door quickly. It loomed high against the wall, stained from many hands and spills throughout the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the final stretch, Bryan....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This set-back likely meant many days of shuttered solitude as he deciphered the conundrum that halted his entire plan. He needed to restock his fridge, as he had purposely emptied it in preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts proved to be focused on anything but the road as he drove, nearly passing a stop sign and then screeching to a halt when an elderly woman suddenly crossed the street. She shouted ornery cries of anger at him while he sped away, barely bothering to grumble in response. Around the next turn, Bryan caught sight of his destination, \"\"<i>Samson's Super Market</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall steel sign alone spoke volumes of the establishments age. Built in the 1960s, when Bryan had been a child, the market boasted to be the \"<i>largest stop for your modern grocery convenience</i>\". It remained largely unchanged since then, almost to the point of disrepair. Cracked asphalt, weathered paint, and even the shopping carts looked to be at least three decades old. The interior was a similar story, albeit cleaner and with somewhat updated fittings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired, groggy, and on-edge, Bryan parked his car, avoiding stray shopping carts and roughly bumping over an uneven slab of asphalt. His vision blurred a bit when he stepped out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee, I'll need plenty of coffee...\" He noted with a scratch to his head.

Flying or crawling, insects terrified him. His whole body suddenly shuddered, and dizziness swept over him again. He was rubbing his head, leaning against his car when a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" A deep, youthful voice greeted. Bryan looked up to see a teenaged supermarket employee pass by. He wore the usual uniform garb; tan shorts, black button-up work shirt, and black sneakers. The older scientist just stared, slightly smiling as he watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan's failure to reply went unnoticed to the young employee, who strode up to collect abandoned carts. Despite his ill feeling, Bryan couldn't help but leer, something he often did when grocery shopping since the store employed many of the town's high school and college age guys. He had previously hoped Tommy would get a part time job here, effectively completing his menagerie of youthful eye candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis peering was suddenly interrupted when a sharp sensation took hold of him. Bryan sank to the ground, hidden from sight by his car, and felt breathless as the realization hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... Shrinking... I'm shrinking!\" His moan barely escaping his lips. \"Dear God... No... This can't be-...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if a light switch had been flicked off then on, Bryan landed with a thump on the warm asphalt. The sensation left almost instantly, returning his body back to normal. Yet, as the scientist rose, all was not normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... I've shrunken!\" Bryan cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body went numb. Goose pimples coated his body at the thought of his predicament. His formula had obviously had a delayed effect--a very delayed effect! Bryan whimpered, taking in his terrific surroundings. Surprisingly flat, yet covered in ragged boulder larger than him, stretched seemingly endless miles of asphalt. It looked as if he has been transported centuries into a future decimated by lava and boiling heat. It was a complete wasteland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell!\" Yelled the diminutive scientist as he took in the enormous shape looming above, before, and around him. \"My... My... My car! It is fucking massive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was impossibly huge, taking up nearly all of the sky. He rubbed his eyes again and again trying to comprehend the sheer size of his once compact-sized sedan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan began to panic. His formula had been purposely developed to shrink a human being to a size smaller than a grain of rice. This in itself was a fantastic and marvelous discovery, yet only when used in a controlled environment. This was anything but a \"controlled\" environment. \"I need to find help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, hearing a roaring buzz that sounded like a 747 taking flight. A ship-sized bumble bee roared overhead, soaring higher and higher till it vanished from sight. Shortly after, the ground began to shudder. The vibrations became catastrophically violent, sending tiny Bryan to his knees. Boulders of asphalt, each larger than himself shifted and rocked as a thunderous sound filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" An enormous vehicle, far larger than his own exploded by, moving at a dizzying pace despite its impossible size. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huddled in terror until the ground seemed to settle. Only minor vibrations disturbing it, telling of many more monstrous vehicles far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here! Oh god, somebody help!\" He turned, looking for a destination and trying to formulate a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, his mind clung to thoughts of his failed formula. Never had it fizzled like this. He stepped over the curb and headed through the threshold of sliding glass doors, passing into the market's cool interior. \"....Perhaps I miscalculated one of the chemicals, or maybe boiled it too long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan nearly bumped into a pile of boxes, barely halting himself before collision. They were thoughtfully stacked only a few feet before the doors. He frowned at them. They were definitely out of place, he noted and looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther customers walked by, unfazed by the boxes, while a crew of workers were grouped on the other end of the store. It appeared the place was enjoying some major remodeling. The far right side of the building was cleared of most displays and dotted with large machines. Bryan eyed one, looking it over and glancing at the man who approached it. With a thunderous roar of motor, it burst into life and began sluggish animation directed by the worker who pushed it. Customers idly continued their shopping despite this, passing the dust-coated workers with both carts and baskets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures they would be redoing the damn floors right now.

An ice cream shop, various fast foods, gift and sport stores, and lastly, the single coffee shop that occupied the space. The coffee served in the cafe was nothing to write home about, but would serve in a pinch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan glanced around, eyeing one of the teenaged grocery market employees that pushed a line of abandoned shopping carts across the asphalt. The boy returned his look with one of confused curiosity, causing Bryan to redden and hurry across the parking lot.

Only a few customers sat inside the building, chatting or staring blankly at their phones, while others walked in and out with cups in-hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young man sat next to a planter sunken into the cement next to the cafe. He busily preformed a drum solo on a make-shift set of drums, long hair swishing over his face and a plastic lid of money sat near him. He was shirtless, displaying an impressive physique that drew an idle inspection from the passing scientist. The racket produced by his performance was a clangorous mess of noise that somehow remained rhythmic despite itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan passed quickly, preferring to avoid any charity, and hurried to the door. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nearby a bench sat nestled against the coffee shop, offering a respite for the weary man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards it, Bryan began to note a strange tingling sensation running through his body. Unable to make it to the bench, he pressed against a stone column with a grunt. \"W-w-hat....? This feels... -it can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was unmistakable - he was shrinking! The sensation was familiar enough to the brilliant man, who developed the formula and tested it on himself many times. This - unfortunately - was no test, and Bryan felt terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attempted to pull himself away from the supporting column, yet his flimsy muscles failed him. A muttled croak was all he could muster before everything abruptly went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA falling sensation. Then painful impact and Bryan bolted back into consciousness. His head felt as if it had become calcified and his whole body tingled still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM. BOOM. THOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuhhh... Gah.\" He rubbed his face. Breath seemed to come sparingly, but with each intake it became easier. \"God almighty, what the fuck?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrobbing sensations seemed to reverberate not only through his body, but the ground itself. He stood up, without thinking he reached for the nearby column for support and met only empty air. \"Damn!\" Bryan stumbled but managed to regain his balance. \"What is going on...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it became clear to him. Looking around, Bryan rubbed his eyes and felt himself trembling - not from weariness, but fear. He had shrunk! It had seemed almost like a dream, but here Bryan stood; incredibly tiny and vulnerable. Examining his surroundings, he took in the enormous sight of the cement column he leaned against before. Now it stretched high above and looked more like an alien construction from another world. Around him spanned dizzying lengths of concrete landscape. Large chunks of gravel were strewn about, ranging from vehicle size to larger. Tiny black shapes seemed to move through the boulders, yet they were indiscernible at this distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never been reduced anywhere but his own home before. The safe, controlled environment of his clean suburban home. \"This is anything but that...\" Bryan gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath him, the ground began to tremble - almost rhythmically. BOOM. THOOM. THOOM. BOOM. It was the same sensation he felt earlier, yet now it was clearly not in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Bryan looked over a mass expanse of concrete wasteland to view the source. His mouth only hung open in response to the identification. The leering scientist had noticed the young man before. He was seated before a set of make-shift \"drums\" - which appeared to be nothing but overturned plastic buckets - and had a small plate set out for money. A classic musician, who looked the part with his long hair, unshaven chin, and shirtless torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the tiny man viewed the young street drummer in a completely new light. The formula shrank the imbiber to a measly height: barely a centimeter in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fucking gigantic!\" Bryan thought aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic street drummer was much more than \"gigantic\" now. His movements appeared sluggish and extremely powerful. Each time the drum stick met one of the overturned containers, a shuddering vibration traveled through the ground and a dull explosion thundered. Sweat jostled loose with each movement, falling from his muscled arms and chest. The giant man was nothing short of god-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan shook himself from his stupor and returned to the situation at-hand. \"I can't stand here gawking! I've shrunken out in the open without any antidote... I need to get help pronto!\" Voicing his plight aloud made it seem all the more frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he was: shrunken miles away from his home! Bryan had never intended to be in this type of situation. He had no plans or measures to rescue himself with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed help!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some were completely ignorant of the sweat-soaked man, while others looked him over and covertly whispered to their fellows. Bryan ignored all this and finally settled himself onto a wooden bench set near the column. Sitting seemed to help somewhat, giving him use of his regular sight and senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Bryan noticed the familiar mane of slicked white hair that belonged to none other than his boss, Dr. Thompson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what are the fucking odds?\" He rasped, peering with bloodshot eyes across the parking lot. Dr. Thompson closed the door to his sleek Volkswagen and directed himself towards the busy cafe. \"Shit! He can't see me... I am supposed to be on vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body seemed to have stabilized, allowing Bryan to awkwardly slide from the bench and behind the brick column for cover.

By all means, Bryan knew he needed to head back home, but risking contact with Dr. Thompson was far worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the older gentlemen's progress, Bryan frowned.

Bryan could stride away from this awful predicament without his boss ever knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe debated his choices: attempt to return to his car - a path that would take him directly past Dr. Thompson - or, he could hide-out in one of the many other establishments nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It usually took him that long just to purchase the drink before returning to the laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless...\" Bryan immediately felt his body ripple with goose pimples. What if Dr. Thompson had seen him? He was a perceptive old coot. Or... Worse. What if his boss was here in search of Bryan? \"<i>Oh God</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands trembled at the thought and his face ran white. Bryan stumbled on, keeping his eyes on the scuffed maroon and tan linoleum as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he jolted at the sound of a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, welcome to Stronghold Sam's!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned his head to view the employee who stood behind the counter. A stocky guy wearing a Stronghold Sam's shirt stood next to the register and grinned at him. Still weary and bit confused, Bryan merely nodded and passed by the counter. His mind lightly peppering him with memories as to why he used to frequent the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe angled towards one of the tables, but paused. The sensations began returning; but this time, something else... It felt familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan turned himself away from the table and headed in the direction of the restrooms. It would do him a world of good to wash his face off. With each step, the odd rippling grew stronger, as if his muscles were attempting to act on their own. He was passing the arcade games, bothered by their sharp melodies, when it struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exclamation sounded more like a hoarse croak. Bryan failed to notice this loss of volume. His only thoughts sped back and forth in his mind; <i>he was shrinking</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the realization was the trigger, Bryan immediately felt the floor wretch from beneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell for a moment, then his body hit the ground and his head with it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can...\" His superior's gigantic face seemed to warp and stretch. His vision darkened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bryan passed into unconsciousness one more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking his spectacles from the ground and replacing them upon his nose, Dr. Thompson dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan Smith, his employee, quasi-assistant, and trusted associate, was his target. He had been suspicious of the wiry man for many weeks now. Notably, after Mr. Smith had responded to a simple remark about missing chemicals and equipment with a sputtering excuse before exiting the room. This instantly set off finely tuned alarms in his aged brain. He knew something was not right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reviewing the missing supplies, as well as tracking Bryan's habits; he had come to a fairly good conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be pursuing that ridiculous pipe dream of his... To shrink himself!\" The old scientist had explained to his superiors weeks ago. \"Many times he has brought the idea to me: asking for advice and even assistance! I, <i>of course</i>, put him in his place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDL Labs had requested that he investigate further. Equipment had been the first to vanish: measuring cups, glass tubes, and even a pricey burner. Then, the chemicals began to disappear. Small amounts at first, but then more noticeable quantities. Dr. Thompson would not let this wretched behavior continue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back to the coffee shop, he saw no sign of his frantic target. Grumbling, the hawk-eyed scientist scanned the shops; halting his eyes upon one in particular. He noticed Bryan bump against the large door and shove through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as quick as you think you are, eh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swooping motion, Dr. Thompson quickly hobbled in pursuit. He licked his thin lips and clucked haughtily. It would be a pleasure to apprehend Bryan Smith!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for the imitation iron handle, but quickly paused. \"<i>Ick</i>! How filthy!\" Using his handkerchief for protection, he proceeded through the door and into the establishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepulsive smells and tacky music assaulted his keen senses almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stronghold Sam's\", as it was duly called, was in fact everything it seemed to be. Trashy, unclean, and filled with the unsophisticated slobs that were naturally drawn to holes such as this. Walking carefully, he impatiently scanned the interior while wringing his knobby hands. Near the back of the large space, Bryan Smith could be seen shambling away. As Dr. Thompson pursued, the thieving man vanished behind into the \"arcade\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis joints complained of such an excursion. Never one to back down, the scientist followed and rounded the corner just in time to witness an extraordinary event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Gods...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would have called hogwash. Yet, he saw it; Bryan Smith had quite literally lurched from the ground and reduced in size. It happened in only a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly wiping his stupefied expression, Dr. Thompson glanced around for other watchful eyes. None. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, he knew what to do. A small plastic cup sat empty on the control console of a flashing machine, left behind by some careless individual. This repugnant behaviour worked in his favour. The cup would make a perfect holding cell for Bryan Smith! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping it ready, he approached the spot where Bryan had been reduced. As it was, Dr. Thompson had no idea if the remarkable reaction left the user disoriented due to such quick reduction in scale, or if the user could acclimate quickly without side-effects. He scanned the floor. Grimacing at spots of dried gum and sticky stains. A black shape moved, slowly but a consistent pace moving away from him. Gasping, the old man crouched down and prepared to snatch the shrunken Mr. Smith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Just an ant!\" He fumed. Then his eyes drifted to another shape that seemed to twitch. \"...<i>By Jove</i>! There he is... Tinier than even the common ant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to dilly dally, he reached into his pocket and produced a pair of tweezers. It, along with a set of other tools, was something the elderly genius had carried since his youth. Using them, he plucked the shrunken man off the ground. Bryan Smith appeared to be unconscious, limply hanging from the metal tool that far out-sized him. This only made Dr Thompson sneer. This discovery may have been ill-gotten, but it was nothing short of impossible. A gold mine, in fact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed Bryan into his palm. \"Wake up, Mr. Smith!\" He noticed movement from the tiny shape. \"Oh, good. You're up! We're going on a little trip...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he deposited the impossibly tiny human into the cup and swiftly exited the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan woke with a scream. He thrashed as if held by strong hands, moving back and forth violently. Coming to, he steadied himself and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, no</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a dream! He had shrunken and been found by his snooping boss! \"This is not good... What do I do?\" He felt tears scorch their way down his cheeks while looking at his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him, forming a complete circle, loomed tall frosted walls. Plastic, they appeared to be, and coated in dried drops of liquid that far out-sized him. Bryan screamed. A flat surface with large print and images formed a makeshift ceiling. Yelling for mercy and begging to be released. He didn't know quite what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll probably take me to be charged for theft! I'll be thrown into prison!\" Another thought shoved to the front of his mind. \"Or... They'll <i>experiment</i> on me at EDL Labs! Interrogate me, until I tell them the formula...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan gasped girlishly, clutching his mouth. He couldn't let that happen; no matter which it happened to be! There had to be another way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hefty jolt shook his world and threw him over. Clutching his head, he cried and prepared for the worst. Nothing happened. The slight swaying and rumbles continued again. Bryan sigh and looked ahead. His eyes widened and he released a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly ahead of him, not more than 12 feet, was a gaping crack in the cheap plastic. He could easily fit through! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Bryan screamed to the printed sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting another second, he dashed forward and prepared to leap...</span></div></div>",

He suddenly found himself spiraling into nothingness before colliding with a cliffside of wiry fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing onto it, Bryan held on for dear life as the strange mountainside lurched violently. Wind rushed past, buffeting his miniscule body as if he were bracing against a hurricane. A loud crash echoed from below. Bryan followed the noise, peering downwards and screaming as he saw the cause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous leather shoe stood far below, farther than Bryan could properly figure as he stared wide-eyed with realization. Another quaking crash alerted him and he spotted another shoe in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Oh, God, oh man! I'm on Dr. Thompson's pant leg!\" The giant mass lurched again as the huge shoe lifted for another step below. \"This is NOT good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was instantly sucked into oblivion by tidal winds that crashed against the moving leg. Another huge crash and the shoe landed far below. Bryan looked up, spotting the prison he had escape from being held in the gigantic hand of his elderly boss. The tiny crack in the plastic was barely visible, probably how Dr. Thompson failed to notice it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cliffside of tweed fabric jolted violently, causing Bryan to scream as his grip lessened. He slid downwards, screaming for but a moment before he regained his hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Dr. Thompson... Help me!\" Bryan cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of his punishment, he didn't want to meet his end falling to his death from the pant leg of his irksome boss! Any plea proved futile as the gigantic Dr. Thompson continued, utterly unaware that his prisoner had escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll motions halted suddenly, leaving the shrunken scientist a moment to breath and gather his bearings. He looked out, trying to spot where the old man was taking him. Up ahead, at the end of a cavernous hallway stood a door that Bryan recognized. It was an EDL labs door - that he immediately knew - but, the name on it struck him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan mouthed the distant letters printed in bold black upon the metal door. \"Andre Franklin, Security Chief!\" His immediate reaction was that of terror. Dr. Thompson - the cruel fucker - planned on immediately turning him in! To the <i>shoot-first-ask-questions-later</i> security chief, no less! In his hysteria, Bryan snapped out of it when he heard his boss speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WELL! I TOLD YOU, YOU WOULD GET YOURS SOMEDAY, MR. SMITH!\" The oblivious old man thundered towards the empty cup he held. \"TIME FOR A RECKONING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Bryan could do was roll his eyes. The wrinkled geezer sounded like some B-movie villain for godssakes. Without warning, Dr. Thompson resumed his walking and Bryan shrieked as the crease he held onto shifted, threatening to throw him off like the insect he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" He pealed, jolting with every step the giant took. Perhaps staying in the cup was preferable! \"<i>Eeeeeeeek!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use, Bryan felt his grip jerk free and he fell...</span></div></div>",

He was staring into the positively colossal face of an unknown giant, held in a massive palm thousands of feet in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! WAKE UP LITTLE MAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tidal force of air whipped against his tiny, naked form. Bryan whimpered, trying vainly to cover himself. He turned red with humiliation, while his body trembled in terror. He looked at his giant captor with trepidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he gasped. If he wasn't mistaken... He was being held by Tommy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan blinked. The planet-sized face seemed to change again - this time morphing into Corby - a waiter at the local diner. \"<i>What the hell</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and rudely, Bryan lurched out of his dream. He was coated in a sheen of clammy sweat and his body convulsed slightly. Slowly, Bryan calmed himself and tried to figure out his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've shrunk!\" He squeaked. It sounded as if his voice had gone up several decibels, even to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, his nightmare remained just that. Bryan found himself laying on an expanse of faded linoleum, surrounded by bits of dirt and dust. He still felt shock and anxious, but nothing compared to the reality of that dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God! I've shrunken in the damn pizza place! Fuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant drone of barely recognizable music filled the massive amount of space around him. Beyond many hundreds of acres worth of filthy floor loomed humongous arcade machines. All of them larger than anything Bryan had ever seen. He craned his neck, gawking at the nearest one: <i>Street Fighter II</i>. It was beyond imagination in both scale and design. Transforming from a regular, dated video game into something straight out of a Sci-Fi novel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping backwards without thinking, Bryan suddenly bumped against something. Cold, hard, metallic, and freaking huge. He yipped and spun around to face it. A thick wall of worn, ridged metal. It was almost thicker than he was tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, he climbed it and realized what it was. \"A nickel...! A giant piece of change!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding off, Bryan began to finally realize his predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike all his past shrinking experiments, all preformed in the safety of his home, this was frightening. He felt the familiar sensation of wonder and amazement, but along with it an overpowering dose of terror. This was far from a controlled and safe environment. The helpless genius had no back-up plan, nor any method of rescuing himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he was tinier than a grain of rice, afraid, and completely at a loss. What could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huge halogen lamps hung between metal rafters that spanned above, casting a mellow light. Rows of white shelves packed with donated products lined the entirety of his left, while over a dozen racks hung with clothes populated his right. He never liked to admit, but he frequented the place often enough that he knew his way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time, no see Bryan! How's it going?\" Greeted a young employee who pushed a cart laden with used goods. It clunked and squeaked to a halt over the scratched, pitted cement floor that once sported a coat of salmon paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan froze. His body felt clammy and his stomach was churning itself into knotts. This feeling, he feared, was associated with the shrinking formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his pace, he grimaced. \"Doing...just fine, thank you....\" He glanced at the name tag hanging around the young fellow's neck. \"...Mike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded coolly and grinned in response while Bryan quickly headed towards some less populated isles. He stopped under a sign hanging above that read, \"Electronics\", and sighed.

Now he was certain: he was shrinking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp and a weak yelp, Bryan attempted to push off from the shelf and flee to his car.

No! I don't need anything or any help from this...<i>place!</i>\" He said while righting a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.

Unnoticed to him was a pale speck that scampered over the white fabric having barely avoided his careless step. Annoyed at the mess, but not surprised, Mike leaned and grabbed the discarded clothing listlessly feeling a pointed tap on his shoulder as he stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man, I may just need your asinine help after all,\" The elderly asshole started with old-fashioned eloquence. \"Did you see a man enter this establishment not five minutes past?

He flared his nostrils, looking the young employee up and down. His casual clothes: t-shirt, shorts, cap, long socks, and filthy footwear were displays of flagrant delinquency. A skateboarding malefactor, Dr. Thompson surmised. Lazy and impertinent, wasting his precious time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nix, nay, nada...!\" The wrinkled scientist blurted. Thoroughly annoyed, he wanted to leave this filthy establishment. He straightened his glasses, glared once more, then about-faced and hurried away grumbling, but not before finishing with a final \"Nertz!\" directed at Mike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalled up clothes under one arm, Mike watched the old man pass through the sliding doors before shrugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fucking dick!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sniffling and righting his glasses, Dr. Thompson gave the young employee a hard look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see a man enter this establishment not five minutes past?\" He asked rather impatiently, but with a methodical edge. \"...a rather thin and strange looking person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of horn-rimmed glasses rested on his wrinkled face, looking larger than needed and continually sliding down the bridge of his nose.The elderly man seemed to ignore this and continued glaring at the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the attitude irked Mike, he did not show it, but per usual just gave a half grin and responded cooly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we get a bunch of people like that...\" Flat and easy, Mike never missed a beat. He idly scratched his neck and adjusted his hat in the process. \"Gonna have to be more specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thompson's face seemed to harden. He gave Mike an inspecting look, flaring his nostrils. Both the employee's appearance and demeanor spoke volumes of his intellect, the old scientist deemed. Asking such an impertinent and likely lazy youth was a waste of his valuable time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of such harsh judgment, Mike thoughtlessly reached down and straightened the tube sock covering his left leg. Dr. Thompson frowned and sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nix! Nay! Nada!\" He began turning away. Thoroughly annoyed, he wanted to leave this deplorable establishment. Bryan Smith would escape for now, it seemed, but not for long! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying his glasses with one hand, the aged, yet perceptive old scientist caught sight of something on the floor. \"...Dear Lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hearing this in-passing might be led to believe a great discovery was just found, but this was not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An insect! A filthy, dreadful insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike immediately followed the knobby finger pointing downwards, his eyes passing over the fallen clothing and spotting the offender. A single tiny speck. Not black, but a pinkish colour, and so tiny it was difficult to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Dr. Thompson clucked and sniffed in disgust. Had he been younger - and less indignant - then he may have realized this \"insect\" was in fact the subject of his search. Before entering, he had already judged the cleanliness of the building to be inferior. Now - he had his proof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a lil' ant... no worries!\" Mike said as he looked up at the ornery old man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his nearest foot, he stepped down over the bug's location without hesitation. He didn't even bother to grind his shoe, since it was so tiny. With his other foot, Mike swept the clothes into a pile against the shelf and looked back to the offended customer calmly. \"See? No problem. They get in here occasionally, but nothing to worry about.\" Truthfully, the store was home to many an insect and spider. All varieties being brought in by accident with each donation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's effort was for naught, as the man merely responded with a curt sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ick</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen vanished around the shelf and shuffled out the sliding doors, shaking his wrinkled head and muttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... What a dick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the clothes, Mike looked at the old man - still visible through the glass doors - and shrugged..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuddled and loud, their enormous conversation was nothing but thunder to the shrunken man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEEEEEELP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan wailed, hopping and waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down hereeee! Help meee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes made a tumultuous mountain to his side, large hills and dales created from simple folds in the fallen fabric. Bryan would have given more thought to their remarkable appearance if he did not have other sights to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith heavy thuds, Dr. Thompson moved backwards. The usually frail and uninteresting old man now looked positively remarkable. His huge leather dress shoes lifted and pounded at random, each time causing Bryan to jolt with fear. He was now afraid more than ever of his boss, not of the man's usual threats and remarks, but of his intense size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sped away from his clothing. His hope that the more he distanced himself, the better chance he had of being noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Bryan felt frightened to be discovered - by his boss, Dr. Thompson no less. Yet, he knew that his situation was dire and above all, he wanted to be rescued. He passed by an enormous strip of fabric created by the cuff of his shirt. The material sloped to form a cascading knoll of thick, wiry cords. It was difficult to imagine all of it together was nothing more than his familiar white shirt he wore almost daily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet padded against he rough concrete and his voice rang high. \"Look! Look! It's me! Bryyyyyan Smiiiiith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground lurched with a tremendous crash. Bryan was thrown to the ground, allowing him a front row view of the new danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck...!\" Other words seemed to escape his genius brain, reducing the shrunken man to wordless gapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's humongous sneaker rested far ahead, pressed firmly against the ground as it supported the giant's tremendous weight. Seemingly far enough that two football fields could almost fit, Bryan could see every single scrape, scuff, scratch, and particle of grime. It easily outmatched Dr. Thompson's worn shoes, both in size and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had many occasion to talk and \"spy\" upon the young employee. He had surmised that Mike was somewhere in his twenties, gave off a gruff, yet carefree attitude, and stood tall and lean. The scent of smoke also permeated the air around him, which Bryan cattily remarked about often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the scent only made him uneasy and nervous. Mike positively <i>loomed</i> - high enough that his massive face was barely visible. His tanned leg towered from the mountain of stained white rubber and worn black suede followed by a white sock that coated the tremendous calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooming tones echoed from the giant's mouth; impossible for the bug-sized man to understand. An enormous hand reached down, gripping the thick cotton and blindly pulling it. The sock was adamant, and immediately creased again once the huge digits left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan sprang up, breaking from his descriptive trance and began screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeeease.... See meee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt tears begin to moisten his cheeks, slurring his pleas. It was more than pointless! Tiny as a grain of salt; an ant would have better luck being heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...DEAR LORD!\" Came the thunderous reply from his now titanic boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan jumped. The words emitted so far had been difficult to understand, but such an exclamation from the astute Dr. Thompson was clear. He had been seen! Bryan immediately agreed; <i>Thank the Lord!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being plucked from the dangerous floor, Bryan realized he was only being pointed at - and rather accusingly to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey!\" Bryan waved hopefully, slightly unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen more thunder followed from the elderly giant's mouth. Bryan felt both his heart sink and his muscles tense. \"A what? Did he just say ins...-\" He was rudely cut off by a slight tremble, followed a booming response by the giant employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching his tiny fists, Bryan glared up at his boss. He had been denoted as a mere bug! Inhaling, he prepared to right this heinous wrong until a mere second later he was interrupted by a low sticky squelch from behind. Darkness followed shortly and Bryan realized his danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Bryan emitted his explanation as a wordless scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking the foresight of any common bug, Bryan had inadvertently blundered in the path of the thrift store's arbiter: Mike. All he could see was the colossal underside of the titanic employee's shoe. The tan tread was heavily worn from everyday use; the zig zag tread was packed with dark dirt, grime, various pebbles, and the torn pieces of a price tag, stained and jammed into the huge tread. Bits and chunks crumbled off and tumbled to the ground. Bryan shivered as he noticed the distinct remains of a mangled spider in the deep tread next to a large logo that read, \"VOX\". Only a few legs remained with the smeared carapace; the rest having been obliterated by the giant's oblivious step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't even run, his disbelief and fear were so great. Bryan merely stared up at the grimy surface above and continued to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOOOOOOM...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime caught up and his world went black as the sole descended. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It felt as if he had been buried alive. Intense pressure forced itself upon him from all directions, pressing both air and hope from the bug-sized man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan couldn't even scream. His face was pressed mercilessly into unforgiving cold concrete. On his backside, what felt like dirt and sharp gravel attempted to absorb his body. He tried to thrash, but even the slightest movement was impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDull, deep groaning was audible from above. It sounded as if some huge monster was shifting as it searched the tiny man out. Another heavy creak followed shortly and Bryan felt his entire world move, grinding him against the ground slightly. Unable to open his eyes to even see, he could only smell and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dirt. Slimy dirt</i>... and... <i>Rubber</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Bryan could focus on was the terror. He didn't want to die. Most of all, he didn't want to die from being crushed to death - or worse, suffocated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainful tears began to seep into the lines of his squished face, irritating numerous fresh scrapes and cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he felt he could take no more, Bryan heard another deep, dull groaning. Cruel shifting followed, and he was briefly twisted against the ground before the pressure began to increase. It was brief, but painful, before suddenly letting off with a loud, sticky noise as the huge rubber surface lifted off the cement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded in, Bryan's eyes shot open and he emitted a scream. He realized he was being lifted off the ground; watching the rough, painted cement move below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he crumbled free and fell towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaiiiieeeee!\" Contact was painful, but even so his body screamed relief from the immense pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping himself over and Bryan gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny cries were caught in his throat. The worn and filthy tan tread of Mike's sneaker raised off the ground, looming above. Bits of grime and grit falling free from the aggressive zig-zag patterns, like chunks of ice crumbling off a glacier.  Bryan felt vertigo in his spine, thinking about his close call only moments ago. It seemed to move slowly, almost barely at all. The rubber sole easily spanned four or five football fields of mass, each indentation and ridge deep enough to fit Bryan, while the lugs of tread could easily crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared like a frightened deer, looking over the immense surface and still imagining himself caught underneath. His tiny body smashed into the dirt and grime Mike picked up around the store during the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Mike continued his step, utterly and completely oblivious to the torment beneath his shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sailed on. Making contact with the floor and sending an explosive shockwave through it. Now looking at the heel of the tremendous footwear, Bryan felt dumbfounded. With just one step, the sneaker covered miles of ground with little effort. Presented on the faded white rubber heel, the footwear's logo stood out in heavily worn letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound from his right startled him and Bryan realized his mountain of clothing had somehow been removed. In its place stood the huge sneaker's equally enormous mate. Just as worn and dingy, it sported a dusty black lace that hung loosely and cascaded to the floor. The simple string was far larger than any train and draped a hundred feet from the metallic eyelet high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stared at it blankly; both afraid and thoughtful. His mind was concocting a rough plan of scaling the untied lace and getting Mike's attention. Before he could act on it, his chance was taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's monolithic legs shifted and sluggishly leaned down. Two hands that could easily demolish many city blocks appeared along with thick fingers that easily snatched the errant shoe laces. Bryan watched with awe-struck amazement. Every movement was a display of sheer power and magnitude that it left the bug-sized man stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan snapped out of it and jolted himself upright and began screaming. He wasn't so stunned as to let this opportunity fail him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miiiiiiike!\" Each step caused pain. Blood trickled from superficial wounds on his naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth sales associate's face was now visible. Mike's huge eyes were dull and bored as they concentrated on the laces of his large sneaker. A massive dark bill from the hat he always wore shadowed the young man's face. His expression nothing more than ordinary despite such cosmic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here! Pleeeeeeeeeease! Miiike!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shocking motion, the giant hands pulled with impossible strength and tightened the frayed laces into a clumsy knot. Unable to appreciate Bryan's predicament, Mike merely blinked and stood up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmitting the same grimy squelch, Bryan watched the huge sneaker lift off the floor. The sole was packed with similar collections of dirt and organic matter - all completely inconsequential to Mike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stood and watched the giant employee depart. Each step sending duller vibrations than the last. The humongous titan lumbered around the corner, leaving tiny Bryan a lonely speck upon the cement floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his need for rescue, Bryan felt a flush of relief that the now gigantic Mike had left. The towering guy would have smeared the shrunken scientist into paste like a common insect - for all intents and purposes, he nearly did just that. Bryan would have been another nameless, forgotten victim, and his fate would never be discovered. After all, who wastes time studying a bug before stomping it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts made him shiver. Bryan felt very exposed suddenly, standing out in the open floor where he nearly met his end. Worst of all; <i>he was stark naked</i>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to first find safe ground and continue his reflecting later. To his advantage, the store seemed rather slow today. Usually, there would be a decent stream of customers milling about in search for treasures, while the establishment's employees patrolled each isle periodically. Bryan was spared any of these as he jogged towards the nearest shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly ten minutes, but he arrived at the base of the looming metal shelves. Collections of donated electronics loomed on the immediate surface above, thick cords hanging down occasionally. On the ground level with Bryan, collections of dust, dirt, and discarded scraps of rubbish were heaped against the wall. He cringed to see what looked like cobwebs coating an area to his left. An enormous rubberband lay before him, carelessly dropped by a customer as they greedily pulled it off a wrapped cord. The massive rubber strip was easily quadruple his height and emitted a strong, unpleasant smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...! This place is so filthy, I never noticed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a normal perspective, all this rubbish would be nearly unnoticeable. Just bits of dust and dirt that normally lined the underside of any store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan heard nearby tones of thunder and turned his attention down the vast stretch of isle. A customer loomed, paused with an item in-hand as they questioned the towering form of Mike. The words were indiscernible, but whatever Mike said seemed to satisfy the customer's inquiry. The gigantic employee grinned, nodded then turned away with pounding steps and stomped out of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing a sigh, Bryan calmed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed some form of action or plan. If even Dr. Thompson would mistake him for a bug (that heartless bastard!), then Bryan knew anyone else would probably not even regard his diminutive existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, an ant scampered past knocking him over. While Bryan shrieked, the busy insect kept moving without hesitation as it journeyed along the base of the shelving. Bryan merely picked himself up and huffed. \"I've just been knocked aside by a bug! This is humiliating...!\" As he spoke, he trembled. Knowing just how under-sized he was even in comparison to a lowly ant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Bryan considered his options.</span></div></div>",

The ant he met moments ago scampered on, keeping itself near the protective shadow cast by the continental shelving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You hive-minded bastard!\" He called after it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was his turn to find a destination. He had been here many times, and by all means should be able to figure out a decent place for rescue. \"I don't even look like an ant! Just gotta get somebody to realize that.\" It was then Bryan, becoming lost in thought, was forced back to his shrunken reality when the ground began shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long until a man appeared around one of the shelves. Bryan had trouble associating this stranger as a mere \"man\". Like his previous encounter, Bryan found this man; <i>this being</i> - who was many, MANY, thousands of times his tiny size, to resemble something far greater than just a mere human. He was simply to fucking huge to even be anything but a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he was just a normal guy. Wearing a regular baseball cap with some NFL logo, a typical shirt, grey cargo shorts, and thoroughly normal white DC sneakers. A regular guy, by all accounts. Bryan couldn't help but gawk at the towering mountain of a man - watching as he lumbered around the shelving, each sneaker lifting off the grainy floor before crashing down again with a powerful thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the giant opened his mouth, turning his gaze to a young five or six year old that giddily pawed at the items on the shelf. \"...CAREFUL, HONEY. LET'S GO FIND THE TOYS.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like understanding the rolling of thunder or the explosive boom of a volcano. A behemoth force so much greater than himself, that he felt struck dumb by the sensation of understanding such words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic child roared in agreement and pounded off towards the promise of toys. Still looming above the worldspace of littered cement, the gigantic man's strong features were twisted into a warm smile as he watched after his excited child. Looking from his tattered footwear, past thick legs forested with tangles of dark hair, higher than a continental shelf-sized torso, to his planetary face crowned with a green-and-black hat. His godly gaze never wavering downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen with doe-eyed awe, Bryan stared. All he could think was how the frilly fuck was he supposed to get a shred of attention from this guy? Should he even try?</span></div></div>",

Other imperfections dotted the immense landscape, including large patches devoid of paint, hard patches of dried grim, and varying craters left behind when the cement was poured. Some were deep enough that Bryan could easily rollerskate, or even fill with water to create a large pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDispersed among this vast landscape were pieces of grit, dirt, and unidentifiable crumbs. Bryan could see other large objects laying in the distance - the closest he identified as a forlorn price tag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Bryan commented as he walked. \"I never knew it was <i>this</i> filthy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nudged a strange twig laying at his feet. Curious, he crouched and picked it up for closer inspection. \"Yuck! It's a leg!\" Throwing it with disgust, Bryan realized the entire mass of \"gunk\" plastered against the floor was a smeared insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" He groaned. Wiping his hands in revulsion, he backed away and tried to occupy his mind. \"I need to...figure something out,\" Looking around gave him many options of destination. The area seemed quiet besides the occasional buzzing insect, or distant giants idly shopping. Thrift store employees also popped into view, stomping across an aisle and vanishing from sight. All so far away it was difficult to discern their identities - which Bryan was thankful for. He wanted to be prepared next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to be seen for who I am. Dr. Thompson fucked everything up last time, that ornery bastard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over him like an enormous canopy, Bryan continued his plotting under the relative safety offered by the shelf. He might be able to journey around the store and locate somebody he trusted. After all, if he could help it, Bryan did not wish to throw himself in to the arms (or in his case, palm) of the first stranger to discover him. A fine plan in theory, but Bryan knew the vast downside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrekking through the gargantuan thrift store at a size barely comparable to a grain of salt was nothing short of foolhardy. Sitting with arms clutching his legs, Bryan huffed. It would take hours of herculean travel to even make it to the check-out counters. Not to mention the added danger of careless customers or employees - all to absorbed in their own world to care about the one at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered slightly, remembering his encounter with the gigantic store employee, Mike. \"...It wasn't his fault... He didn't know...\" This statement only made him more uncomfortable. If Mike - a friendly, reasonable, helpful person - didn't recognize him, then who would? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling frightened, the tiny man noticed movement out in the grimy wasteland of cement floor. Two black shapes crept from a crater in the floor, many meters away, but close enough to be identified as mere ants. Except these \"mere ants\" were now the size of SUVs and just as powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan watched them. Despite his distaste for the insect world, he felt interested in their minute activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crept from behind, climbing up from the same crater to join his fellows. \"Huh. They must hide in those to keep safe from nearby people,\" Bryan noted, amused. \"Clever little troopers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their almost endearing curiosity, Bryan knew to keep his distance. The common bug was now considerably higher on the food chain than himself. Tiny, soft, and pink; Bryan was no match for the armoured ants. They would make short work of him, being but a bare mouthful for their potentially massive nest. One of them approached a jagged, brown object easily three times its size and attempted to lift it. Not a moment later, one of the other ants offered assistance and the two of them lifted the crumb off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan felt as if he should clap. It was an impressive feat, by any standards. They were gross to him, but rather remarkable in their adaptability. \"If only I could be so versatile!\" He said, and at the same time detecting an audible disturbance in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second later, Bryan felt the ground tremble. Then again and again, increasing in strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe complained dumbly, about to stand up when the floor before him - ants and all - was shrouded in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like the felling of a great monument, landed something so large that Bryan was thrown to the ground. Grime and debris was sent careening wildly by the displaced air caused by the deafening crash. Bryan looked on in frozen awe of the megalith of gray and yellow sneaker looming where the ants had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bright yellow rubber sole to the mass of gray and back suede, he stared in shock. Across the sheer mountain of gray suede upper stretched a large black line of suede curving around to create a familiar logo even at such magnified levels. Higher up, a worn tag the size of a billboard was stitched that read \"VANS\" in stained, yellow font. Just like before, Bryan was stunned. It was huge; fucking bigger than he could imagine. Like an entire mountain designed to be worn by a faceless god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoe suddenly shifted, creaking dully. With grimy appeal, it lifted from the ground. The thick, yellow sole sounding as if it was peeling itself off the dirty floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan didn't even notice the two missing ants, or even the lone survivor, who lay in a mess of half-crushed carapace and legs. The tiny man watched the huge sneaker's flight. As it soared forward, taking but a simple step, but covering a tremendous distance. Bryan's gaze was not only of stupefied awe, but in disbelief. He recognized the giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steadied himself when the ground jolted again, stiffening from the thunderous crash landing. The mega-sized island of a sneaker came to a rest, slightly farther away, but now facing the shelf Bryan was hiding under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...It...\" Bryan babbled, gazing at the titan who began sluggishly crouching.  The giant's face lowering into focus; a face Bryan knew from many meetings and conversations. \"...David! Holy fucking shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that same friendly expression upon his now colossal face, David was barely recognizable. He wore the same baseball hat, covering his reddish-brown hair, and shading a face framed by a thick beard covering only his jaw. Ever since Bryan had grabbed a small radio, garnering David's attention, he had always been willing to shoot the breeze whenever they met. He was a bit younger than Bryan. Already divorced, and die-hard baseball fan - of which Bryan feigned interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he simply appeared otherworldly. David was a tall, stocky man by normal standards, but now by Bryan's comparison he was completely god-like. An arm, bigger than a bridge, hovered high above as it supported an equally ginormous hand that held an object of interest for the gigantic owner. From below, Bryan watched the huge hand deposit the item back onto the shelf with an audible crash. Suddenly, without warning, David stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! I'm down here... <i>me</i>, Bryan Smith!\" Bryan squealed, leaping into motion as he flailed forward without thinking. \"<i>Heeeelp me</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing himself for wasting the opportunity of David's crouch, Bryan vowed not to fail completely. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giant's simple motion of standing up again nearly caused tiny Bryan to collapse. He was so huge that Bryan was overcome with vertigo just watching him move. Unwilling to give up, Bryan ran straight for David's shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, it loomed bigger and larger until the brightly coloured rubber sole was towering many dozens of feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down hereeee! Saaaaave meee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan ignored his squeaky voice, and raced ahead. He reached the sheer wall of bright yellow rubber and flung himself against it. Thumping and racking his thin arms against the hard surface. Never would the now tiny man have imagined himself beating upon his thrift store buddie's sneaker. Bryan had only briefly noticed David's large foot size - what he presumed to be a size thirteen and a half - and the man's eclectic taste in athletic footwear. Now, all he could see was a vast wall of yellow rubber that only made up the sole of the huge skate shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGouges covered the textured surface. Some were smeared with deposits of dark dirt or mud, others packed with various gunk. They were relatively new as far as David was concerned. Higher up, above the toe-cap, large frayed cords jutted forth among frays of dark suede fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was thick with permeating smells of rubber and harsh sweat. Bryan tried to forage on, knowing if only he could get attention, David would rescue him. Yet, the creeping realization of what happened to the ants moments before struck him. The reduced scientist was nothing more than a mere speck; unnoticeable and insignificant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shifted his other foot, slamming it heavily as he turned. Only then did Bryan realize his foolishness. \"No! Waaait! NOOOO!\" Completely detatched from a world so tiny; so far beneath him, David took a step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stumbled back as the huge mountain of rubber creaked and shifted. Then the air was filled with a horrific sound as the deep, grimy treads pulled away from the dirty floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man about-faced and ran. He devolved into high pitched shrieks, feeling the harrowing sensation of something huge soar overhead. It was familiar to Bryan - yet this time, he was merely an observer caught in the front lines of a behemoth's gait. He felt like time had slowed to a crawl, as if fate wanted him to take in all he could from his tiny perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the entire skyline became overtaken with the mass plane of deep, tread. Bryan watched it pass overhead, moving as if in slow motion, yet far faster than he ran. Each cell of the waffle-tread was big enough to house the bug-sized man. Each one another display of unknown grotesqueness. Dirt filled most of them, picked up from all over during the day; huge boulder-sized pebbles of whitish brown colour were jammed at random. Bryan watched as an entire section of the tread passed over, coated in a dark, sticky blotch of gum with bits of crumbs and debris pasted in it. Only when he noticed the twitching remains of two ants crammed into the thick waffle lugs, did he stumble and fall roughly to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, he identified one of the ants as a segmented mess across the gap between two lugs, and the other ant still barely alive as it dangled helplessly from a chunk of grime. As fast as they came into view, they were gone as the sneaker soared overhead. Bryan screeched when a hunk of dirt dislodged and crashed nearby. Large as the pond in the local park was the enormous sneaker logo in yellow and white against the dark tan waffle tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge letters were twice his size, situated into a skateboard design. Bryan mouthed them silently. \"VANS 'OFF THE WALL'.\" The he gasped. Pressed in-between the letters of \"<i>Wall</i>\" were broken chunks of shell once belonging to a snail. David had unknowingly obliterated it when he left home this morning, reducing the tiny life inside into paste and only leaving bits of shell wedged between his treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly moments had passed, but what felt like a lifetime for Bryan and suddenly the heel passed above. The sole came to an end, freeing tiny Bryan as it flew ahead, utterly uninterested in his tiny life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrash landing far ahead, the ground shuddered in response. With similar drama, David carelessly lifted his other foot in-turn, never glancing nor thinking about anything that ended up underneath. Bryan watched from increasing distance as the sneaker he toured lifted and slammed down; taking the giant farther away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, as Bryan pulled himself up, he felt himself change. He could still see his massive friend, looming far off , but something had happened. Bryan no longer saw him as David - no, he now saw him for what he truly was; at least at this size. A humongous force of unstoppable, uncaring, and immeasurable power. An entity that was incapable of caring for anything so tiny as an insect, and in extension: <i>Bryan</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And, all he was doing was shopping.</i><i> Never even knew I was here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No. Fuck, no...\" Bryan shook himself. \"They can't help it. They're just too damn big - but, they will help me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as he verbally convinced himself, Bryan shuddered. Twice now he had almost ended up like a common bug. And, both times he had survived. He couldn't be sure if it was luck or not. Sighing, the coast was clear once again. He wasn't going to wait around like an idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's near disastrous visit had caused one benefit. Bryan looked right at it, dangling not but a couple hundred feet away. It hung from the shelf above, like a train teetering off of the precipice of a cliff, and coiled against the rough ground. A simple electrical cord by any means, but a way up for tiny Bryan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the cord, Bryan could scale the shelf and find shelter among the city of appliances, radios, speakers, and amplifiers. With any luck, he would be near face-to-face with anyone else examining items from the shelf. Instead of scuttling around the store, Bryan could leisurely await rescue upon the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan grinned. He felt as if his first stroke of actual luck had come. This option seemed much safer, not to mention a needed respite, but mostly to keep himself from the dangerous floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogging forward, Bryan aimed for the dangling cord...</span></div></div>",

His balance had been upended when the ground seemed to literally vanish from beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunken before; many times before, in fact. Not one of them had felt like this. Painful sensations jetted from his fingertips to his toes. Bryan tried to curl into a fetal position, but his body denied him even such a small pleasure. It seemed as if he was... changing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain seemed to change into tingling sensations. Rippling over his skin as it went from pale and soft, into something harder and grotesque. Next was his basic shape: that began to bend and twist into something inhuman. Bryan shrieked. A scream that would rival the loudest aria, yet even as he did, it too changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the convulsions ceased and he fell limp.

Skittering about on six legs instead of two, he panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in God's name!\" His voice sounded airy and shrill, as if he was squealing through the spinning blades of a fan. \"What happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attempted to paw at his face, only to find all six of his legs jerk and send him to the ground. It was unbelievable. Somehow - some way - he had transformed! Righting himself once more, he carefully scuttled forward. The feeling of so many limbs was nothing but alien to him and downright confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck... Fuck, fuck, fuck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan then tore his concentration from his new shape to gaze at his surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...FUCK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him, going for miles upon miles, spanned a landscape of cement. At this level, the coat of salmon paint was all he could see, occasionally interrupted by deep craters and gouges in the worn cement. In the distance, shelves of tremendous altitude towered up into the seemingly endless sky. With his new shape, Bryan had trouble craning his gaze to see the tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt panic wash over him. Never had he shrunken anywhere but his home. NEVER. The idea of such an excursion was not only terrifying, but idiotic! Reducing himself to such a minuscule size was never to be done anywhere but controlled environments. Bryan shot his had back and forth, taking in the huge and frightening vistas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his panic, he suddenly felt something flitter upon his backside, causing him to yelp in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, thoughtfully and this time consciously controlled the sensation. Movement once again brushed his back and Bryan gasped. \"Wings!\" Turning his head, he caught sight of them: Glossy, thin, and coated in translucent veins - they were fucking wings! Only then did he realize what he had become. \"I'm some kind of bug...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Bryan, the very formula he had consumed had been inadvertently tainted by a blundering gnat. The confused insect had been drawn to the liquid by the sweetness Bryan imbued it for taste. Landing on the thick mixture, the helpless gnat was caught and slowly absorbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to ruffle his wings, Bryan began to feel slightly elated. This strange, and otherwise frightening side-effect was fascinating. It felt as if he had been transformed via magical spell. This would surely be worth many volumes of notes and observations once he... <i>Oh no!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face went pale and he swore his blood ran cold. He was trapped at this filthy thrift store, tiny as can be and without antidote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He shivered, but felt elated just watching. \"Well, he makes it look so damn easy! If I could fly like that, rescuing myself would be a cake-walk.\" Returning attention to himself, he focused upon the muscles that controlled his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fluttered slightly. His back tingled lightly, and with a sigh, he tried again. This time the wings buzzed into life, as if powered by something other than himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoop! Yes!\" He squealed. \"Holy Christ... I-I'm...flying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting many feet off the rough ground, he whipped forward clumsily. Quicker than he thought, he hurled back to the gritty floor with a hard crash. Bryan slid many feet, bumping against a large crumb before stopping with not an ounce of grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his lip, determined. \"Again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymphonic roar of buzzing wings buffeted his backside and the half gnat, half man glided into glorious flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooooooopeeee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding it difficult to keep himself level, he went forward, able to slow his pace by dulling the beat of his wings. The wind blasted past his face and legs, feeling like he was sky-diving from a plane instead of simply flying mere feet in the magnified isle of a thrift store. Bryan pealed once again. His mind awhirl with the possibilities of his situation. Other fliers passed him; from behind, below, above, and both sides. The gnats ranged from his own size to larger, while the bulky and ornery flies being quite larger - some bigger than most trucks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigher and higher, almost level with the second tier of shelving he glanced down at the floor below. It was already many hundreds of feet down - and he was barely three feet above the ground to the normal viewer. He zipped past a huge cord that dangled from the shelf, marveling at how it no longer appeared mundane but larger than a city street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is freaking amazing,\" Bryan said. \"But, I need to focus and find help!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To Bryan, he was a experiencing the world from not only a different perspective, but in a completely new way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, he zipped along an expanse of cluttered electronics. All of which were now of comparable size to most city skyscrapers. He was able to almost see himself reflecting from the face of a humongous digital clock. \"Hah! It looks like the freaking Sears Tower!\" He yelled despite the air pummeling his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing his flight, the tiny man-turned-gnat hovered thoughtfully. \"I should find help!\" He buzzed. \"All this frolicking can wait till I am out of danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming himself, Bryan prepared to pass around the huge shelf. His tiny position remained only three shelves above the floor, easily over a thousand feet high. The shelf continued much higher, looming above his current view. Looping with increasing skill, he passed underneath a cord that hung over the ledge, dangling a couple hundred feet in length. Another larger insect flew past him, barely whipping into the mess of huge donations as if to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn bugs are so rude, I swear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStilling flying, Bryan had his attention abruptly directed when an enormous moving mountain passed around the corner. He screamed a note of shrill, terrified buzz, looking at the approaching titan who headed straight for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... <i>Aaarccccghhhck</i>!\" His protesting shrieks were immediately absorbed by the seemingly limitless wall of approaching fabric. Looming before him, splashed across the huge cotton surface like a landmass in the ocean, was a towering logo in graphic letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan buzzed with ferocity and attempted to avoid the oblivious titan's path. The giant quickly passed, continuing his path utterly unaware of the danger he posed. For Bryan, in the form of a tiny gnat, it was like trying to avoid a meteor of continental size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dived out of the titan's path only to be suddenly met with tremendous hurricane winds. \"<i>Aaaaaieeeeeeeeee</i>!\" Caught in a nasty gale, Bryan was sent careening and barely normalizing himself in time to land upon the shelf. From there, the tiny gnat-man watched the careless giant stomp away. More importantly, his gaze noticed something else about the huge man; he wore a thrift store vest! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" He wondered, skittering towards the edge. \"Not, uhm, whats-his-name...Mike! No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing, for all intents and purposes, like a curious gnat, Bryan watched the massive employee come to a shuddering halt before a shelf. Crouching down, he began inspecting the shelf full of cups and stemmed glasses while tiny Bryan watched from afar. He recognized the giant's short, slicked hair; as well as the athletic shorts he wore. But, like many times before, the name escaped him. For his brilliant mind, Bryan had an awful time remembering the names of people he met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really caring about names, he prepared to leap into flight. It seemed help had found him - however inadvertently! \"He'll help me - no problem!\" </span></div></div>",

Bryan could barely keep a coherent thought, much less a complete one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wwwhaaaaa izzz haaappeeehhnnninnnng?\" He squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around him was even more confusing. Gigantic surroundings of such immense size were only magnified by a strange filter of crystalline quality. Bryan skittered around, confused and frightened. Each thought seemed to become shorter and more primal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What went wrong, what is happening?</i> He tried to cry out again, but only produced shrill, unintelligible buzzing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next thought came out jumbled. Without him realizing, Bryan's once brilliant mind was slowly degenerating into something simple and primal. If he had been given a chance, the unfortunate man might have identified it as animal instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nooooooooo</i>....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cry was the last noise he made that barely resembled human speech. With that, Bryan Smith effectively turned off and in his place the mind of a simple gnat took over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Mike frowned at a fallen bag laying in the middle of the isle he was in. He thoughtlessly grabbed it and returned it to the shelf already laden with other donated bags and backpacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a common enough occurrence - finding dropped and forlorn merchandise just laying on the ground. Customers apparently never felt inclined to treat the thrift store with any respect. Mike merely turned away and resumed his idle patrolling, passing around a corner shelf and into the electronic isle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately his trained gaze locked upon a heap of discarded clothes. \"Really? In the middle of the damn floor?\" He stomped towards the clothing, failing to notice a tiny gnat take off to avoid his large gait. \"It looks like some fucker took all his clothes off...\" Not that such an act would be of any surprise - loonies seemed attracted to the place like flies to a bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down, reaching for a shirt that lay atop the other pieces. Before his fingers gripped the wrinkled shirt, Mike was distracted by a slight buzz that passed his ear. Without even looking, the culprit displayed itself: a tiny black dot that lazily bobbed through the air. It buzzed right before Mike's face, as if to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bitch...\" Focusing both eyes on the incredibly tiny bug, his face showed little emotion. The gnat's attitude was anything but impressive to Mike who merely poised his hands and brought them together with a clap. \"...too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling them apart, he idly inspected both hands for the remains. Finding none, Mike immediately lost interest in the bothersome life and crouched to grab the clothes. Unnoticed by him, the foolish gnat had been mortally wounded, but remained intact only to tumble from a fold of skin and fall to the floor far below. It lay upon the filthy cement, twitching and suffering with an inaudible noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike scooped the discarded clothes up in his arms. A scent reached his nose, somehow familiar as if he smelt it in passing. Recognition began bubbling to the young man's mind before he carelessly dismissed it for thoughts of lunch and after-work activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lifted his foot to walk; all thoughts of the dispatched gnat had already been forgotten. Mike would have never noticed the tiny black shape twitching pitifully in the shadow of his foot before he slammed it down, pressing the tiny creature into lifeless gore between the worn treads of his shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet upon a shelf was a set of thin glass vials of obviously scientific origin. The young employees eyes immediately noticed them in-passing, which Mike took a mental note. Mike liked to keep friendly with frequent customers by pointing out items of interest - and he knew Bryan would be curious to look at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike deposited the clothes into a bin and set off to locate the customer, never realizing he had unwittingly helped all but erase Bryan Smith's existence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maneuvering his red sedan into the last free parking space, Bryan stepped out of the car. Before him stood the cement building, the once white walls stained from age and weather, one side of it serving as a convenience store and the other as an automotive repair shop. The parking lot was located near the back of the building, with the gas pumps located in the front of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan rubbed his stomach as it growled indignantly, he really hoped they had his favourite orange scone in stock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, a loud clinking sound caught his attention. Looking down he saw a discarded bottlecap roll to a stop before him, not particularly notable since the parking lot was rather litter laden. He continued around the corner, an unpleasant smell tickling his nose causing it to wrinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the young station employees leaned on the wall ahead, a cigarette in one hand and a cellphone in the other. Bryan knew him by sight, the tall 22 year old's name tag read Derrick. He was dressed in the usual Keystone station company shirt, black slacks, and sneakers. The attendant didn't seem to notice Bryan as he passed, too engrossed in his cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan stepped through the threshold into the store, the cool conditioned air washing over him mercifully. \"Hey there, Mr. Smith. Good morning!\" Greeted Paul, the station manager, a burly man in his late thirties. He was dressed in a worn company shirt, black carpenter slacks and work boots. Bryan greeted him back as he continued to the counter where the pastries and coffee resided. His stomach grumbled an impatient reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning shortly to the counter with his scone and coffee, Bryan noticed a group of tiny ants crawling over the counter top. Paul approached the counter, and noticed Bryan's staring. With a grunt he brushed the ants off the counter, sending them to the floor, and looked back at Bryan with a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be everything?\" Paul said as he rung up the items, and Bryan promptly nodded. With a friendly wave, Bryan exited through the sliding glass doors and back outside. He had already almost finished the scone, and drank the warm liquid gratefully as he passed Derrick and back around the corner to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hungry man stopped as he finished the last of the pastry, despite it being packaged and not fresh, it still filled the gap in his stomach. He was almost feeling better despite his perplexing situation in the laboratory, before a familiar feeling became apparent in his gut. His face went pale as the sensation continued through his body, his muscles tingling. This sensation was one he exclusively associated with shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second sooner, then the ground seemed to lurch beneath his feet, his vision blurring as his body seemed to both stretch and condense. He hit the ground roughly moments later, the feeling subsiding quickly as his body recovered. Bryan sat up stiffly and rubbed his head, his face nearly white from shock and panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still in the same location as before, the surrounding landscape appeared vastly different. Towering before him was the cement wall of the gas station, looming many miles in height. All around him spanned an endless landscape of asphalt, dotted with boulder-sized pebbles and gigantic bits of trash. His heart sunk as he took in this whole new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery test Bryan had preformed with the shrinking formula was done under a controlled environment in his laboratory. The little excursion he had planned wouldn't of even seen him leaving the safety of the shipping box, and always with the antidote close at hand. Murphy's Law struck against him now, as the falsely failed formula lay dormant until now, shrinking him to an incredibly tiny size far away from the antidote, which still lay in the cardboard box at his home. This all seemed like some horrible nightmare to the now little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping towards a huge structure, tiny Bryan realized what it was with a lump in his throat. The barely noticeable bottlecap he had kicked earlier now rivaled any building in size, standing almost twice as high as the shrunken man. He approached it, marveling its size and imagining the dozens people it could easily house. A sudden chill went down his spine as he caught sight of a horrid being that appeared around the corner of the bottlecap. Ducking behind cover, Bryan watched an ant the size of a truck meander before him. The disgusting creature appeared shiny with grease and covered in fine hairs crawled along, busily brushing the ground with it's revolting antennae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was never a fan of insects, and before now, had never thought of encountering one at a shrunken size. The huge beast seemed to discover what it was searching for, and speedily raced off, leaving the tiny man behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, Bryan walked away from the spacious bottlecap, his mind clocking at full speed in search of an answer. How could the formula still take effect almost 24-hours later? What caused it to lie dormant in the first place? And, more importantly, how was he going to survive in a world of giant insects? His little feet walked over a massive wad of hardened gum, pressed flat into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him was filth, now unmistakably visible from his new perspective. Ponds of noxious liquid dotted the landscape, along with crushed cigarette butts bigger than metro trains. The foul smells that accompanied such a terrain were also magnified, causing further discomfort to the distraught man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the corner of the massive cement wall, a new, yet very familiar scent assaulted his nose, the smell of cigarette smoke. With timid steps, Bryan walked around the corner, his jaw nearly dislocating as he took in the sight. The previously encountered ant seemed trivial when compared to the now gigantic station employee. Still leaning against the wall, his cigarette nearly spent, the young station attendant looked positively god-like. The tiny man watched as the giant's huge arm lifted the burning cigarette to his lips, and expelled a hurricane-worth of smoke from his massive nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping from his stupefied gawking, Bryan needed to formulate a plan. The titan's gigantic footwear loomed in the distance, the Fallen skate brand logo visible in the dark suede material making up the sneaker. The ground trembled as the sneaker shifted slightly, Bryan swallowed hard as he imagined just how huge it was up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only coarse of action was to try and get the young titan's attention. Unfortunately, Derrick barely noticed him before at normal size, how could Bryan ever hope to get the careless guy's attention at a size smaller than an ant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still hiding, the shrunken scientist considered his options. All of them seemed not only ridiculous, but beyond dangerous and frightening. He shuddered, looking up the tremendous mass the young station employee now stood made Bryan all but pee his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy was fucking huge now - easily bigger than anything Bryan could think to compare, and likely far beyond noticing him as a teeny little speck against the filth-ridden asphalt. The titan animated suddenly, shifting his towering girth; lifting an enormous arm to deposit the nearly spent smoke between his lips and reposition his feet. Bryan watched, wide-eyed and slack-jawed, as the furthest sneaker slide against the gritty asphalt, suddenly lifting off, and swung over the other shoe with sluggish grace. With a dull, but heavy thud, the worn skate shoe settled, positioned on the toe with the exposed sole looming to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan immediately lost all confidence. The motion, a mere shifting of the feet, was so commonplace; so casual; that the busy scientist would never have noticed before - but, now took on almost godly significance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help himself staring - taking in the mind-boggling sight looming far, but close enough to stand above the landscape like an alien monument. The sheer surface of many zig-zagging crevices spanned around the white Fallen logo, which was almost blotted out by a revolting mass of unidentifiable grime. The tread around it was crammed full of various debris. Near the toe, the dark rubber was heavily worn, but spotted with dark splotches of gunk, mud, and oil from around the station. The heel was in similar shape - well-worn from everyday use by the gigantic owner. What looked like smashed M&amp;Ms were jammed into the tread, along with more pebbles and dried oil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all phased the tiny man like a tourist gawking at a new world wonder. Bryan was overwhelmed. He just couldn't believe how huge it was - some stoner-type gas station clerk's sneaker, blown up to become the biggest, most impressive, and utterly intimidating thing ever. All without the owner ever knowing, as he casually spent his break smoking while leaning up against the station wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Bryan didn't write Derrick off as potential help simply because of his colossal size. The tiny man spotted something else wedged and scattered randomly against the massive sole - something more organic and downright disturbing. Tiny black shapes that Bryan recognized to be ants. Most smashed beyond recognition, but more than a few intact enough to be alive and twitching, hopelessly trapped in the cayonesque treads of Derrick's gargantuan skate shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll, Bryan realized, without the young titan even knowing they existed. It seemed Derrick's prefered spot for taking his smokes had become a populated collection of ants attracted to M&amp;Ms dropped the day before. The gigantic station attendant stomped over them without regard, never once thinking of their minuscule lives as he lit up and listlessly poked at his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all the frightened man needed to decide against running out there. He was smaller than those ants - how the hell would he fare any better? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll figure something else out. Something, <i>err</i>, better; that won't be so dangerous.\" Bryan reasoned, never taking his eyes off of the exposed sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud grunt rumbled from above, jolting Bryan from his thoughts. He glanced up to see Derrick holding what looked to be a mere nub of smoldering paper. The behemoth snorted, his expression nothing but tried and bored. Raising one massive arm, he rubbed the forearm against his nostrils, snorting, and then swung it downwards and hurled the cigarette butt towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sailed like a falling meteor, headed far away from Bryan who still squeaked for cover. Crash landing, the garage-sized butt rolled over the filthy ground, spewing smoke and cinders as it went, and reducing a surprised ant to smoldering ruin as it did. That was preferable, as Bryan watched the angled shoe lift away, landing on the asphalt with reverberating crash. Faster than something that huge should move, the other sneaker pulled off from the ground, raining bits of dirt and grit as it sailed towards the glowing cigarette butt. It slammed down, merciless and absolute, as it dragged backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan steeled himself against the intense vibrations. He dared a craned look upwards, realizing the huge guy wasn't even looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violent action stopped abruptly. The gigantic skate shoe creaked as Derrick merely shifted his weight, swinging his impossibly long leg and lifting his other sneaker off the ground. The step ended with a dull boom, shaking Bryan who sat unmoved and gawking. With a thunderous twist, the other sneaker raised and sailed away in the same fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth employee stomped away, utterly unaware of his titanic presence and power. His thick arms swayed at his sides, each hand looking big enough to uproot the city park, and each booming step seeming cataclysmic as the huge skate shoes smashed anything caught underneath. Bryan gazed at the back of the giant's head as he lumbered away, wondering how he ever possibly could have been able to interact with this monster of a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" He spat out, feeling as if it was only now safe to speak. Derrick stomped out of view, his huge form vanishing into the sliding doors set farther down the building. \"Fucking... <i>He was fucking huge</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan immediately thought back to his mixing of the formula and his decision to increase its potency, and in turn, the effective size it reduced him to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs dripped, feeling warm. Patting them, the shrunken man realized he had urinated himself more than a few times by just watching the humongous employee move. Biting his lip, he had a hard time steadying his shaking limbs even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of this nightmare!\" He realized not even an hour had passed and he was nearly fraught with panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stay calm, Bryan said. \"Just need to get help, any help at all, I just need help!\" He was a genius - and, one to be reckoned with once he had his mind to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe padded forwards, approaching the mass of acrid debris that remained of Derrick's cigarette. It was nothing but a mound of ashes and shredded paper, bits of rubbish visible in the devastation. The tiny scientist could still feel the tremendous vibrations caused by the oblivious titan: each step a powerful, bone jarring, boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan realized he needed to get moving. The longer he moved around, looking around the massive environment, the more hope blossomed in between desolation and dismay. His first encounter with a regular-sized person had been memorable - and, oddly exciting in more ways than one. The bug-sized man actually felt excited to continue this accidental adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next destination was to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he inhaled one final puff of smoke, he casually flicked the cigarette butt toward the dirty, greasy asphalt at his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleeting exchange between the two titanic men terrified the tiny man who remained unnoticed at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf their massive bodies and thunderous voices were not enough to instill fear, Derrick's actions directly imperiled the shrunken scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speck of a man shrieked as he saw the incoming missile headed toward him. The cigarette butt landed on the asphalt, still burning with a harsh, orange glow and producing copious amounts of thick, suffocating smoke. If the discarded cigarette butt had landed with slightly more precision, the tiny man would have been instantly crushed or burned to a cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick smoke got into his eyes, blinding him. Choking and coughing, he stumbled across the pavement trying to distance himself from the smoldering paper-wrapped cylinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes blurred, he stopped and looked skyward at Derrick's enormous body. With the smoke still filling his lungs, tiny Bryan's attempt to shout for help ended with racking coughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Derrick lifted his sneaker before heading into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What are you doing?\" Bryan screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, realization dawned. The giant young man was preparing to grind out the discarded cigarette butt beneath the sole of his sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" The tiny man cried in shock. \"I've got to get out of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant sneaker crashed toward him, the desperate shrunken man had only seconds to react.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The aggressive tread was filthy. Mud filled the majority of the thick tread, with bits of grass and food visible throughout, and numerous unlucky insect guts. Bryan even noted a torn price tag wedged near the heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly snapping from his stupor, the little man cried out and dashed to his right. \"I'm not going to die! Not like this!\" His shaking voiced croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunging through the air, he aimed for the nearby safety of the looming cement wall. He landed roughly in a vile pond of noxious water that had collected at the base, barely noticeable to somebody like Derrick. Before he could even get his bearings a thunderous crash sounded behind him, sending a heavy vibration through the ground. Bryan turned around, his body covered in the slimy liquid, to see Derrick's massive skate shoe take up his entire view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole was dirty, covered in grime accumulated by stomping around the gas station day after day, and towered over two stories to the bug-sized scientist. Bryan tensed in fear as the gigantic sneaker began dragging back, causing the ground to tremble and the sound of grinding gravel to fill the air. He was so awe-struck by what proved a simple action to the young titan, but to Bryan struck him as the beginning of the apocalypse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed that his seemingly short break was over, Derrick casually tossed the spent cigarette to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt landed near his left sneaker, smoldering brightly. Barely glancing down, Derrick stomped his skate shoe down and dragged it back roughly. Pulling his phone out again he read a new text message from his buddy, not even remotely aware of the tiny white speck nearly squashed by his huge sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly tapped a reply to the text as he turned to go back to store. His large shoe obliviously stomped down on a few ants, missing only a few of them, as he walked to the sliding door and hoped Paul wouldn't give him flack for his extended break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shocking speed the huge sneaker suddenly lifted causing Bryan to cry out in fear, his immediate assumption that he was next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! No!\" He screamed internally, covering his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant explosive thud caused him to look up again. His entire body was trembling as he watched the mountainous Derrick stomp heavily away towards the sliding doors of the building. Bryan cringed with each step the titanic guy took, weakening tremors reaching his body before disappearing altogether as Derrick lumbered out of sight. Before him, the obliterated remains of the cigarette covered many acres-worth of the ground before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken scientist couldn't believe at this point that he could ever have interacted with such a gargantuan being normally. He was almost stomped out of existence when the giant simply put out his cigarette! Bryan felt horribly helpless and afraid. How could he ever hope to get somebodies attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis self-pitying thoughts were interrupted when he noticed movement ahead. His spine chilled as he took in the sight of a group of terrify ants approaching, he had forgotten the car-sized insects that also threatened his meager existence. His immediate thought was to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he chose his right which proved to be a cavernous crevice in the mountainous cement block that made of the wall of the structure. Bryan couldn't afford to consider what may possibly be inside the darkness as he stumbled blindly into it. His tiny hands groping fruitlessly in the darkness, searching for any handhold. His heart sank and his pace became desperate when he thought he heard the monstrous ants pursuing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before his little heart gave out in terror, a brightness ahead of him gave the little man hope. Bryan dashed towards it, stumbling on the rough ground beneath him, he didn't care where it led, long as it was out of this hellish darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wriggling form burst forth into the light melodramatically. With hurried, grateful gasps, Bryan took in his new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching miles around him was the dirty tile floor of the gas station interior. Each tile was many hundreds of feet in length and width, giving the landscape an alien-like appearance. The nearby wall was made up of mammoth drink fridges that towered many miles high and emitted a loud rumbling electrical hum. A new feeling of awe washed over him as he remembered browsing this very part of the store for coffee over a half hour ago before this all began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He receives no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrick, I need you to watch the front for my break!\" he adds urgently. 'Lazy little shit is probably still smoking' he thinks unhappily to himself. Only taking a couple of steps he notices a pack of two chocolate cupcakes on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he reaches down and snatches it up. Chunks and crumbs rain out of a hole in the packaging onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Paul takes the time to pick them up,unconsciously rolling the crumbs into a ball between his thumb and finger. \"Can't let the fucking ants have it!\" he mutters at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you talking to?\" Paul stands up and glares at Derrick who had just come through the back door. \"Right on time!\" Paul growls sarcastically, eliciting a dismissive grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep an eye on the front while I'm on break\" Paul says gruffly as heads into the back office. Derrick merely grunts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DERRICK!\" roars from behind Bryan. He spins around to see Paul standing near the cashier counter. His mountainous form dwarfs each of the towering displays around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DERRICK I NEED YOU TO WATCH THE FRONT FOR MY BREAK!\" he thunders, taking a large step forwards. His boot squeaks against the dirty linoleum. Fear of the frayed boots, stained with oil and other filth washes over the tiny man. Bryan turns to run, despite knowing it was useless. Two more squeaking thuds end with a confused grunt. Bryan, continuing to run, turns backwards. Paul seems to be staring directly at him, a look of concern on his gruff features. Bryan halts and begins to wave his arms, \"Yess! Right here!\" he cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul reaches down, grease trapped in the fingerprint of his thick, calloused fingers. Bryan whimpers and steps backwards, bracing for impact from the massive hand. However it flies overhead and a loud crinkling sounds as Paul clasps his hand around a fallen pack of two chocolate cupcakes. Bryan is awed by how easily the large package is lifted. As it soars overhead, large chunks rain from a hole in the package. He screams in terror as crumbs many times his size crash down randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan, after discovering he had not been struck, is not given the chance to celebrate his luck. With a gusting sigh, Paul's begins pinching the crumbs between his huge fingers. Bryan shrieks as Paul's thumb smashes into him. The greasy cupcake pushes against his other side and he finds his movement restricted. Bryan moves with the rolling movement between the thumb and cake, but thankfully remains free of the sticky bits of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here he cannot make out any words, but can feel vibrations every time Paul speaks thunderously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul drops into his aged office chair. It creaks in protest of the violent movement. He dismissively flicks the ball of crumbs into the trash. He is about to do the same with the cupcakes when his stomach growls loudly. His eyes flick to the package in hand as his mouth waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had brought a lunch, but the cupcakes sounded pretty good right now!</span></div></div>",

Without considering the filth coating his fingers he opens his mouth wide and stuffs the cupcake in, closing his lips around his fingers. He pulls them free and begins to chew happily, disregarding the film of saliva on his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing away the last of the wrapper, he snatches up the other cream-filled chocolate cupcake, still whole and undamaged. He lifts it to his lips as he smacks his lips trying to chew the dry pastry. After swallowing the bite, Paul pauses, staring at the cake in his hand. At the same time he unconsciously uses his tongue to dig for lumps of food trapped against his gums. Following another gulp, Paul widens his mouth and takes a monstrous bite of the cake. He is unaware of how obnoxiously he is chewing, since he is alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan is flooded with relief as Paul flicks away the massive ball of cake. Thrilled not to have gone with it, he is also happy to have the pressure removed. A resounding growl interrupts his thoughts. Bryan isn't given the chance to ponder its source as the thumb he is stuck to moves quickly into the glistening plastic wrapper of the cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knows it, a large brown cake appears. Bryan is just enough towards the tip of the thumb to be in the clear. The holes in the bread are massive caves to him. He simply cannot see it as a simple snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove he can see Paul's delighted face. However the hungry look in his eyes chills Bryan to his core. He suddenly realizes what is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he shouts as he flies upwards. Paul's wide mouth, framed by thick stubble, stretches open. He is greeted by a line of straight teeth, faded with age. Bryan screams as he joins the cupcake into the mouth. To his side is a pink, slimy wall. Beneath him, a jagged molar glints just before everything goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't eat me!\" he wails. A loud slurping noise assaults his eardrums as he is violently pulled back. He finds himself blinking in the light. Ahead of him are Paul's lips, shifting as he works the cupcake around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan laughs manically. He had escaped! Though he was still stuck to the thumb and was now coated in saliva, he was at least not eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain his celebration is cut short by Paul's movement as the giant tears the other cupcake free coming to a stop in front of the lips. With a smack, they part. Mounds of soggy black cake are easily visible as Paul chews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smack, smack! Gulp!* Bryan hears the passing of the food and shudders. Paul's mouth widens as his huge tongue probes around, confirming the bite was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's pause and another gulp the lips widen and the tongue stretches forward. Bryan is greeted with thick cake mush coating the tongue, the occasional spot of cream easily visible. Strands of thick saliva stretch from the tongue like webs. The jagged molars are now crammed with compacted cake. Bryan wails at the revolting sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more he is pushed into the mouth, more aware of the thick, reeking air within. The teeth come together with a loud crack and then Bryan emerges coughing, with only a small part of the cake remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of him Paul continues to chew with his mouth open. Closing his eyes to avoid seeing the thick piles of cake and excessive saliva, only makes Bryan more aware of the deafening smacking and snorting coming from the mouth ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a loud gulp, Paul pushes the remaining bite of cake into his mouth, savoring its powerful, sweet flavor. He rubs his fingers together for a second before licking them clean. He then reaches across the small desk to grab his beat-up lunchbox to continue his meal.</span></div></div>",

An entire city could easily fit on the spread of linoleum tile floor before him with plenty of room left over. It all was familiar, yet he felt like he arrived on some strange planet of towering coolers, shelves and miles of huge tile. Bryan simply couldn't wrap his mind around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like outside, numerous details became apparent to the tiny man. His persnickety brain couldn't help but note how filthy the floor appeared, as it was littered with dirt and other refuse. The base of a huge cooler nearest him also appeared in similarly distasteful condition, covered with dust and dried soda from spills. Bryan bemusedly considered that health inspectors could make great use of his shrinking formula when evaluating an establishments cleanliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing around, he had almost forgotten his shrunken peril in his awe-struck daze. Murphy's Law decided against this brief complacency as Bryan heard a rough skittering noise from behind, causing him to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart sank in terror when he saw the three ants emerge from the dark crevice he had exited through only minutes ago. Bryan had already been unpleasantly afraid of insects before, but at his current size, this fear had skyrocketed to outright terror as the smallest insect proved to be larger than he was. The ants seemed to be searching for something as they communicated via their antennae to each other, emitting a vile clicking sound from their dangerous mandibles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They haven't seen me... I just need to-\" Bryan's train of thought was cut suddenly as the foremost ant seemed to look directly at him with horrifying black eyes. The ant seemed to signal its fellows with a hurried motion from its antennae, and the three sped towards the tiny scientist at a frightening pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pathetic yelp and tiny Bryan clumsily turned around running away from the horrid creatures. His little legs felt incredibly slow as he sprinted desperately. He wished that he would of decided to go for those morning jogs he had been considering for years but been too \"busy\" to begin. Bryan raced towards the dust bunny ridden base of a mountainous cooler, having no other options other than the open floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground began to shuddered noticeably, and heavy booms were heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick walked around a shelf containing a variety of sweets, his muscular arms bulging as he carried a container of beverages to be stocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped before the cooler that contained the beverages in question and set the weighted box to his side. Fishing out a small utility knife, Derrick prepared to cut the box open when he noticed four tiny bugs slowly moving to the base of the cooler he was stocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little fuckers\" He muttered casually as he stood back up. Lifting his nearest sneaker, he stamped it down on the three insects clustered together that seemed to be following a smaller one. Looking over where the other bug was, he didn't see it. It must have crawled under the cooler, he thought casually. It was all inconsequential to him, as bugs in the station were quite common, especially during summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to his duty, Derrick pulled the cooler door open and began stocking the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Bryan Smith lay paralyzed with fear in his hiding place.

His efforts were not at all helped by the view in front of him. Derrick's enormous sneakers almost filled his vision as the giant young man filled the cooler with soft drinks. Every little movement of the giant man caused his feet to move slightly and Bryan's overactive imagination had no problem at all picturing him being squashed like an ant.<br>\r\n\"Ok. Gotta keep it together,\" Bryan muttered to himself, trying to get a grip on his situation. \"He can't step on me while I'm under here, so I'm safe for the time being. I just have to work out a way to make contact with someone who can help me.\" <br>\r\nJust to prove that the gods really do have a sense of humour, those two thoughts suddenly collided in the real world.<br>\r\n- - - - <br>\r\nDerrick fumbled for his phone as it vibrated in his pocket. He looked around casually to make sure his boss didn't see him answer it - Paul was a stickler for him not using the phone unless he was on a break. Trying to juggle two bottles of drink and his phone Derrick nearly jumped out of his pants when he heard Paul's booming voice, thinking he had been caught. His iphone slipped out of his grasp and dropped to the ground. The phone hit his foot and bounced under the cooler.<br>\r\nMuttering to himself Derrick set the two drinks in the cooler then got down on hands and knees. Slipping his hand under the cooler he probed blindly for his phone.<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\nBryan nearly wet himself when the phone came sliding into his 'safe' space so suddenly. His next thought was elation - he could use it to get help! Then he realised just how absurd that thought was - the phone was bigger than most office blocks. But his rational mind saw a possibility as well.<br>\r\nAlthough he doubted he could climb onto the phone, right in front of his was the ear phone jack and he was small enough to climb into it. <br>\r\nThe tiny scientists frayed nerves took another hammering then when huge fingers slapped down on the floor, searching blindly for the phone.<br>\r\nWith barely any time to consider the consequences Bryan knew he had to make a snap decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A jolting motion told Bryan that the hand had found the phone, pulling it away with lurching force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his tiny hands against the warm metallic surface for stability, he watched the outside view whip around violently. Derrick's mega-sized face appeared momentarily before being blotted out by a giant finger. His pitiful screams were instantly swallowed in the compact space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world went topsy once more. Bryan was sent careening into the curved sides of the jack as the obvious giant carelessly handled the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegret was the dominant feeling as the tiny man endured the violent ride. The huge pink wall suddenly vanished and Bryan felt vertigo as the phone slid down into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick grinned at the errant cell phone in his hand. The damn thing had been dropped many times, yet still remained intact save for a small crack on the corner of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no way of knowing that a very tiny passenger had taken refuge inside the seldom-used ear phone socket. Tapping a quick reply to his girlfriend, he swiftly deposited the smart phone back into the front pocket of his work slacks. Clomping footsteps sounded behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derrick, I need you at the pumps outside.\" Paul appeared around the corner shelves suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" The laid back attendant replied with an agreeable grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the last two bottles in the cooler, he headed out to the gas pumps. A truck driver needed assistance with a loose axle, which proved to be an easy fix. Watching the truck pull away, Derrick inspected his phone again, only to find that the battery had died. He had forgotten to charge it the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me...\" He mumbled and dropped it back into his pocket, unaware of the danger the action caused to an unseen stowaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of his work day was then spent without interruption from his phone. A kid tore open a bag of crisps, spraying them all over the floor. Derrick listlessly swept the crumby mess up, stray chips crunching under his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up an hour later, the clock displayed 5:30 pm in bold font. The end of his shift. He grabbed his flannel over shirt, pulled a frayed baseball cap over his black hair, and hopped into his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranking the beat up jalopy into gear, Derrick drove to...</span></div></div>",

Shadow darkened the ground and the sky was blotted out completely by the titanic footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe how huge it was. The young gas station employee could not fathom his enormity and power, or appreciate the devastation he caused with casual actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening...\" He thought. \"Surely, I don't die like this...\" His wide-eyed stare showed disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole spanned many football fields, gunk and pebbles wedged in the aggressive tread pattern. Bryan was able to discern all of it, clods of mud, boulder-like pebbles, and even a few flattened M&amp;Ms. Gruesomely visible in the heavy tread were ants, flattened by the gargantuan guy without notice as he worked. In the middle of it all, Bryan noted the skate shoe logo, \"FALLEN\", now an off-white colour surrounded by the black rubber tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this spanned only a few seconds, excruciatingly slowed down to the minuscule scientist. He had forgotten the cigarette butt, which had been already so huge to him, pluming noxious fumes nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind raced, unable to accept what was happening, and frozen in utter terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done this many, many times, Derrick didn't even think when he dragged his sneaker back, and twisted. He turned and continued to the sliding door, oblivious to the world around him, especially that of an ant-sized man. A light crunch sounded as he approached the sliding door, his sneaker smashing more spilled M&amp;Ms and tiny ants on the dirty asphalt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe careless young man returned to work, resuming his tasks with the same casual attitude he always employed. Derrick's only concern was how bored he was, and his future plans that night with his buddies and girlfriend. Each thudding step dislodging bits of dirt, chocolate, and many unfortunate insects. The teeny red splotch pressed in further with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan would be reported as missing only a day later. The rushed article detailing his disappearance was only glanced over by Derrick in the morning. Proclaiming that the zany man had stolen experimental supplies from the laboratory he worked at, which may of played a part in his disappearance. It even mentioned that he may of altered himself in some way, and requested information from the public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all unimportant to Derrick. Police retrieved Bryan's car from the station, and questioned Paul and his employees about the missing man. When asked, Derrick only shrugged in response. The fact that Bryan visited the station escaped his memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe idly flipped to the Sunday comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garfield...\" He muttered in amusement, propping his sneakered feet on the table, exposing the filthy soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits of the mashed M&amp;Ms remained, and with closer inspection, one might think they saw impossibly tiny bits of bone and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
