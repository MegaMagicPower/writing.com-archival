Or at least that's what she thinks. She smiles, thinking it'll be safe, sitting on her bed. The rest of the girls had went to camp for two weeks, so Serena thought to herself \"I can just play it off as a growth spurt, and say that's why I always eat so much, is I was building up this incredible growth spurt!\" then she stretches out. And these aren't too bad either. She grasps her larger breasts with a giggle. They had grown a little more than the rest of her.</span></div></div>",

She rushes to Rei's place, just to find the girls having tea, talking about their time, since they were all sitting nobody noticed Serena's new height. Serena smiles as she says \"Notice anything.. Different~?\" then Lita stands up, gasping as she saw Serena standing as tall as her. The other girls were in total shock. Amy grabbed her pocket computer out and ran scans on Serena, trying to make sure that was truly Serena. Serena giggles, saying \"What? Aren't you guys used to a growth spurt?\" then she stretches, making her look taller than Lita, but purely the stretching did it. Amy nods as she looks at the results, saying \"It really is Serena.

She was assigned to be his partner but half the stuff Jack was saying went way over her head. Jack had green eyes and long blonde hair. If his ears were pointy, his friends from America would joke, he would look like Link. (Message to morons: Link is the main character in Legend of Zelda) Jack continued to mix chemicals while Rei sat back and watched.<br>\r\n\"Rei, if this syrum works do you know the possibilities it has?\" Jack asked as he tossed her a pair of goggles.<br>\r\n\"I know that it'll get us an A in science.\" she said sarcasticly as she caught the goggles. \"What are these for?\"<br>\r\n\"Mild chance of either explosion or intensely bright light. Better safe than sorry. After all, I wouldn't want to have to pay any nasty bills for laser eye surgery and I'm sure you wouldn't either.\" Jack never was one for schmoozing or blathering on and on. He was always straight to the point and spoke what was on his mind, whether it was a good idea or not.<br>\r\nRei put on the goggles as Jack lowered the test tube with the strange syrum in it towards an apple. The syrum actually kind of looked like Hersheys Syrup. The only difference was it was more liquidy than the syrup. Just as Jack was about to pour the syrum in Serena and Amy burst into the lab. Actually, Serena tripped and fell through the door then Amy ran in to help her. This distraction gave both Jack, and Rei a heart attack. A drop of the syrum hit the apple Jack was about to pour it onto. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n\"Serena, are you ok?\" asked Amy helping Serena stand up.<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going meatball head! You could've hit me!\" retorted Rei. Serena stood up and then Rei and Serena began arguing. Amy sighed. Jack continued to seem oblivious to all that was going on in the room.<br>\r\n\"That's strange... why didn't it work?\" finally the noise seemed to attract Jack's attention. He looked to see Serena and Rei arguing and shouting at eachother. Finally he had had enough and marched over to them.<br>\r\n\"OK,\" he said. \"Stop fighting in here. This is a lab, if you want some place to fight you could either go to the gym peacfully and then fight. Or, you could answer to me.\" Jack was a good 6'2\" and never had a problem intimidating people. Serena and Rei both shut up. Rei looked to Jack.<br>\r\n\"So what is the syrum supposed to do again?\"<br>\r\n\"It's supposed to increase the mass and size of any object.\" replied Jack still looking at the apple, which was still unchanged in any way.<br>\r\n\"... that's impossible! You can't make things grow.\" said Rei. Amy then walked up to Jack.<br>\r\n\"You increase the amount of empty space in an object right?\" asked Amy even though she already knew that was the answer.<br>\r\n\"Precicely Amy. I've said it before and I'll say it again, you're defanitely the smart one.\" said Jack with a smile.<br>\r\nSerena and Rei were as confused as two people could be. Finally Amy tried to explain but she just made things worse and confused them even more. So then Jack said:<br>\r\n\"Ok, physics for dummies. Basically, your body is made up of thousands and thousands of molecules and atoms. With me so far?\" this was basic junior high stuff so of course they were following. They nodded.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now an atom is made up of three basic parts. The nucleas, which is pretty much the brain, the electron and the neuron. Now between these 3 is empty space. Still following?\" Amy couldn't help but giggle a bit as Jack insulted their intelligence yet still stuck to the point. He was quite good at doing that. Serena and Rei knew all this already and couldn't help but get a little angry at Jack's insulting. They nodded anyway.<br>\r\n\"Very good! Ok, the amount of empty space in an atom is greater then we initially thought it would be. Thanks to new high powered electron microscopes we can see the atom very close up. If you enlarged the Nucleas of an Atom to say... the size of an apple. Then the closest electron or neuron would be.... an estimated... 5 miles away.\" Rei and Serena nodded still following.<br>\r\n\"Now in theory you can increase the size of an object by increasing the amount of empty space in it's atoms. There, physics for dummies.\" Rei and Serena finally got it.<br>\r\n\"Ok why didn't you just say so?\" said Rei.<br>\r\n\"Yeah Amy? Why'd you have to go into all the other stuff. Why didn't you just say that?\" commented Serena.<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Amy said somewhat angrily. Jack simply laughed at these two simpletons. Serena saw the vile of chocolate like substance.<br>\r\n\"Is that... CHOCOLATE!\" she said excitedly. She rushed to the vile...</span></div></div>",

I doubt she's ever used a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued keeping his eye locked on target, the super soaker loaded with his serum. Amy kept her aim steady as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Rei!

My mom never wanted me but, thanks to a defective condem, I was born. She hated me. She would always hit me and yell at me and blame me for her problems. I still loved her though, she was my mom after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was 7 she gave birth to my two younger brothers, Todd and Louis. She would have hit them like she did me, but I wouldn't let her. I took all the beatings. My mother wasn't a good person. She was an alcoholic and she put at least three illegal drugs into her system a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grew up in the Victoria courts. It was the worst neighborhood in all of San Antonio. While there I learned, from an old guy who lived in the dumpster behind the alley we lived in, how to fight. He tought me how to move swift as the wind, strike like a raging fire with all the force of a great typhoon, to be accurate as a lightning bolt with my attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brothers weren't fighters, I wanted them to live the best life they could though so I became sort of their personal body guard. I wanted to make sure that they didn't have to go through the hell of a childhood I went through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent most of my free time playing paintball with the other kids. I learned to shoot while playing paintball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I got a job as a cop, I lied about my age so that I could get the job. That was the first time I held a real gun. It became my best friend and outlaws worst enemies. My life was getting better, but my mom was becomming an even nastier piece of work by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated me and my brothers. But she only ever hit me. I wouldn't let her hit my brothers. She started getting more violent with me though. She gave me a lot of scars. Most of them are still there... forever on my back they'll remain as a reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day mom got more drunk than ever. She tried to strangle Todd... I punched her. I actually punched her!! I was shocked that I hit her and she was too. What really scared me was that, when I hit her, it felt good. She grabbed me by the throat and slammed my face into the pavement. She threw me through the window to a Texas Land and Cattle Steak House. I landed on my back on top of the grill. The burns I recieved were life threatening... if the manager hadn't called the hospital, I'd be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 months later I got out of the critical condition ward. I went to the police station and grabbed my Springfield 03' rifle. The police force had tracked down my mom's supplier, we were to go there and set up positions. Kill him if he tried to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going to kill the son of a bitch that kept supplying my mom with those god damned pills. I knew that my mom was gonna be in the Menger Hotel meeting with Enrique. I set up position in the Crocket Hotel. I looked through the scope and saw my mom buying her pills from Enrique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've seen alot of dirtbags before, but somehow, this was different. I knew Enrique was supplying my mom since before I was born, but I never said a word because my mom needed her pills. This was different, THIS was personal. I didn't just want to arrest this scum ball so he could walk free on the streets the very same day, I wanted to send this bastard to hell where he belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 officers were set up on the other side so that we formed a triangle. Enrique was at the point of the triangle, I was the at the bottom left point and Officer Zepata and Nickson were on the bottom right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur seargent moved in to get Enrique, he ran for it and my mom did too. He gave the orders, shoot to kill, I repeat shoot to kill. I found that bastard in my scope and I fired away!! I shot every ounce of hate I had for that man out in 12 rounds of 8 hot lead bullets. I got him... I got him. But it cost me... and it cost my mom even more. I hit her in the back of the head with 3 of the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone praised me and said great shooting... but I killed my own mother! What had I done... god what had I done?!! With her gone my brothers and I went to an orphanage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to get the blueprints of the place from an old friend from thee force. My brothers and I formed an escape plan from the orphanage. Louis, Todd, 3 of their friends who wanted to leave the orphanage, and myself snuck out of the orphanage via the heating ducts and ventilation system. We used the plumbing system for a little bit since the toilets didn't flush at all, they were just for show. We managed to escape the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to my old job at the police academy. I saved up some money and managed to rent a ratty crap ass appartment for us to live in. The police station got bombed in a terrorist attack though. With our source of income gone, I had to find another way to get the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw an add in the paper about a foriegn exchange student program. Each week you participate in the program you recieve 500 smackers in cash. I took the opportunity so I could support my brothers. When I get the checks I send them to my brothers in the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why I'm here....\" After Jack tells his story there is nothing left but a loooong silence.</span></div></div>",

Unlike the first test of the serum, the second one was going off without a hitch.  <br>\r\nOf course, Serena didn't want to be left out of the fun.

Jack Lupino and Boris Dime are 2 of the highest ranking mobsters in the Riojas crime family. A few years back... around the time my ma died, the leader of the Riojas family, Edward Riojas, started trafficking a new drug; Yah Bah. Also known as the Crazy Drug. Lupino was the one who took care of selling the stuff. 18 months ago, I learned that Enrique had been getting his junk from Lupino....\" said Jack as he thought back to the day he went undercover in the Riojas crime family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to tell them everything... after all, they knew he killed one person and that was bad enough. If they found out he took out more than three fourths of the Riojas crime family... well... I doubt they'd EVER trust him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" said Amy as she stroked Jack with a hand. \"We're your friends Jack. You can tell us.\" Jack nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went undercover, DEEP undercover. It took me half a year to work my way up the ladder of small time mobsters, and gain the trust of Boris Dime, The Finito Brothers, Josh Lupino, all of the most infamous scum of San Antonio. I heard another big deal was gonna go down. I couldn't let it happen, they were running low on Yah Bah and if this ship didn't get the supply in, the Riojas's wouldn't be able to supply Enrique, or anyone else, with those pills.\" The girls stared at Jack waiting to hear the end of the story. They looked like children being read a bed time story.... very.... very large... sexy children.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, I won, they lost. I faked my death so they wouldn't be looking for me and then I came here about a month ago when I couldn't work in the force anymore.\" said Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Lite. Jack thought quickly trying to think up a good excuse without telling them the truth. He got fired because in the process of the Narcotics Arrest, he got a bit trigger happy on all the drug dealers who inadvertendly created him, and made his life a living hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... uh...

Her super team of Negaverse giantesses was getting their asses handed too them by Godzilla and the senshi.

She quickly realized the answer when the crowd gathered by her legs.<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you idiots care about besides panties?!\" Ignoring the perverts, Moon got to her feet and released her Scepter Elimination attack on Beryl.  While not her strongest attack the force was enough to send Beryl flying into a skyscraper, completely smashing it.<br>\r\n\"All right!\" shouted Sailor Moon.  \"We did it!\"<br>\r\n\"It's never that easy,\" responded Sailor Mars.</span></div></div>",

Late Night With Conan O'brian and The Daily Show With John Stewart! Then, out steps John Stewart himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John Stewart here live from paradise. Hawaii? What are you talking about? No... not South America. Japan. Why Japan?\" The camera zoomed out revealing the giant Sailor Scouts. \"That's why Japan is paradise.\" The sound affects guy then cued the whistling cheering crowd noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Stewart, live from Japan where earlier today there was a mafia shoot out... ironically these mobsters were from America. What the hell were they doing here?\" His eyes looked in the general direction of the Sailor Scouts. \"Ah... that's what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConan O'Brian then stepped out of the chopper and stood in front of the Sailor Scout's feet to do his opening monologue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Authorities are unsure wether or not the growth of women is contagious, or wether it was bought on by an experiment.\" Conan began in his newscaster voice. \"In a related story, Sandy Allen, who holds the Guiness world record for being the tallest woman on earth, has been quarantiend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for other reporters to show up so the scouts split up. Rei and Serena would be with Conan O'Brian and John Stewart, while Mina Amy and Lita would be with Oprah, Regis Philmore and Barbara Walters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Mars,\" John began. \"I'm assuming you get news from America every now and then, so tell me: What do YOU think of George Bush's presidency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the biggest threat to world peace and security since the Nazis.\" Rei said firmly. The sound affects guy made crowd laughter come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't have said it better myself. Ladies and gentlemen, Sailor Mars!\" Serena was lounging with Conan O'brian in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, to the few people out there who actually watch my horrible show, we have a very special guest tonight. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Sailor Moon. Give her a round of applause everybody.\" The cameras zoomed out revealing that Conan had his desk in the palm of Serena's hand. A BIG round of applause was followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't remember MY round of applause being that big... what happened to my round of applause? Never mind, never mind. So, Sailor Moon... 115ft tall huh? You don't seem very tall at all?\" The sound affect guy once again played the canned laughter. Serena smiled at Conan's bad comedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Moon, put my desk out for a second, we're going to see just how much taller than me you are.\" Serena put Conan's desk down. Conan got up then walked up to Serena's foot. He stood on his tip-toes to try and seem tall. It wasn't working. \"Hold on, Max, come here and give me a boost.\" Once again, more canned laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Conan, you're on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a true friend Max...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Mercury... what's with the school girl outfit? Mini skirt? Come on now, you're super heroines not prostitutes.\" Oprah began. Amy, despite how offended she was, kept her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a super hero doesn't get you into the Fortune 500, Oprah, so we wear what comes cheap and school uniform type clothing is something we already had.\" Amy answered resisting the urge to do the world a favor and crush Oprah. Damn... and we were soooo close! Meanwhile, Regis was interviewing Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sailor Venus, let's cut to the chase. First and foremost, the one thing I've always wanted to ask you, do you watch my show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if we weren't so swamped with homework.\" Mina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Superheros have to pass school too I guess. So, anyway, hows it feel being so big? You could sit on a building like it was a chair. Wouldn't reccomend you try that though.\" he said, causing Mina to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel any different really. Sure, it's harder to hear people but other than that no difference.\" Mina replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I would have thought that you felt like Godzilla or something. But I guess you don't since everyone runs away from Godzilla while with you, everyone runs towards a view up your skirt.\" Regis said. Mina laughed again. Lita on the other hand, did not have a very courteous interviewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Jupiter, let's be blunt. Is it true that you and Sailor Venus are a lesbian couple and that the Sailor Scouts are actually a lesbian activist group playing hero to gain acceptance from a sexist world?\" asked Barbara Walters. Why is it that women named Barbara are bitches? Oh well, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!! That is NOT true!!\" Lita shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denial, we've seen it before. Just come on and admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a boyfriend!!\" Lita shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you do, hun.\"</span></div></div>",

Just give them to Rei, and tell her to hire me a lawyer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomedude nodded in response as he walked out of the cell, only to see Freak Boy confronting Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you are,\" began Freak Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith just sighed.  \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak Boy looked at Smith confidently, then hit him square in the face, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why did you do that?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's an agent.  Soon, he'll possess another body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Freak Boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not morphing or anything.

He had a brief case, out of it were hanging a string of Vienna Sausages. Following the string were a bunch of Goats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, your attourney has arrived.\" Freak Boy said as he walked up to the defendant's table. He kicked the normal chair aside and replaced it with a reclining chair with built in drink holder and fold out mini flat screen TV, DVD/VHS combo player and a tray to hold his popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!\" Jack asked furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just say, 'doing' as in the sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well you spelled it the same.

Don't worry, with me as your attorney, you can't lose!\" Freak Boy said, giving Jack the thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doomed...\" was all Jack could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All rise for the honorable judge Hirohito.\" the bailiff said. The whole court rose, except Freak Boy who had fallen asleep in his reclining chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order, order in the court.\" Hirohito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have some ham and pastrami on Righ bread.\" Freak Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bailiff, pummel the ignoramos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your honor.\" The bailiff walked up to Freak Boy and pummeled him senslessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?!!\" asked Freak Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Freak Boy, you're out of order!\" Hirohito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!! THE BAILIFF THIS COURT IS OUT OF ORDER, MY CANDY MACHINE IS OUT OF ORDER!!\" Freak Boy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just slammed his head into the desk. The giantesses were watching the events on CourtTV and Rei was about ready to cry. Once again, perverts were gathered by their ankles, claiming to be watching the trial, but really looking up their panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trial was not going well, it looked bleak for Jack. Then, the closing statements began. The Prosecuters didn't even bother to make one, they knew that they had already won. Freak Boy was so stupid, he objected to his own witness! Freak Boy walked up and began his closing statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Jack McCoy cannot be blamed for what has taken place in these last few days. When my client was producing his 'growth serum' he was on the grounds of Tokyo High School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, shouldn't the high school know what all students are doing on their grounds? My client informed the school of his experiment, this was a school science project! Did the school do anything? NO! I think not!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They allowed my client to produce and test his serum ON SCHOOL GROUNDS! This was the responsibility of the Tokyo Public School District to check the science projects of their students, therefore, this incident is a direct result of neglegence on the part of the Tokyo Public School District. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you know what I'm saying is true. So, make the right choice. If the glove does not fit, then you must aquit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, Darien, Ben, Somedude, Mina, Amy, Rei, Serena, and Lita all stared awestruck at Freak Boy's amazing closing statement. It's not clear whether Freak Boy actually went to lawschool or not but, he certainly knows all the things to say in order to make himself sound like an attourney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, the jury, have made our decision.\" said Somedude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... in less than five minutes, huh?\" asked Judge Hirohito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We find the defendant, Jack McCoy, not guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!! Score one for the Freak Boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, there was a big dinner. The girls were given the antidote and were now normal sized... well... maybe a foot and a few inches taller than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I propose a toast,\" Jack began. \"to my life long friend, who bailed me out of trouble when I did nothing but doubt and beliger him, Freak Boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we ever doubted you buddy.\" Somedude said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you. Now, I want to cut the roast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Freak Boy.\" Ben said with a smile as Amy leaned up against his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Freak Boy pulled a chainsaw out of nowhere and cranked it up. The girls stared wide eyed and nervous. Jack sighed, Somedude and Ben smacked themselves in the forehead.</span></div></div>",

She felt so powerful. Jack felt sooo good right about now. And judging by the softness of the ground underneath him, he was on Serena's breast. The thought of this immediately gave him an erection.

You're so tiny, so helpless, so... mine.\" she said as she nuzzled Jack against her cheek. Jack was loving every minute of this. That is, until he saw himself aproaching Serena's lucious lips. He tried to scream in terror but no sound came out. Serena was going to eat him!! Or so he thought. She planted a kiss on Jack's whole body making him feel relaxed again. She continued kissing Jack loving this more and more. She could stay like this forever, and wanted to very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena kept kissing Jack. She got a bit tired of this then started to think of all the things she could do with an action figure Jack.

First and foremost was why didn't he make a plant fertilizer, or a more efficient source of energy as his experiment.  Nooo, he had to go and make a growth serum.  And now he was trapped with two giants who thought he was the cutest thing in the world.  Well, maybe it wasn't ALL bad.<br>\r\nBut before our hero could get comfortable in his new surroundings, Rei pulled him out by the legs, holding both like a stick, softly yet firmly.<br>\r\n\"You wanna know something Jack?  I've had a crush on you since you moved into our school.  And here you are now, mine, all mine.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Rei!\" pouted Serena.  \"I found him first.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought you were in love with Darien,\" replied Rei as she shielded Jack with her body.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I guess.  I can't wait for Darien to see me like this.\"  <br>\r\nAs Serena started rambling on what she was going to do to the unsuspecting Darien, Jack suddenly realized the truth.  Rei and Serena intended to stay gigantic.  But before he could ponder the positives and negatives, Rei took the tiny Jack and starting licking him like a lollipop.  <br>\r\n\"You taste SO good,\" was her reply as Jack was frozen still.  The feeling of Rei's tongue across his body felt incredible to Jack.  Of course, Rei (and fate) couldn't leave well enough alone, so Rei took the tiny Jack and put him in her mouth, and starting to suck on him.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"  Rei sucked on Jack's body for five minutes, and Jack couldn't deal with it.  The feeling of Rei's lips across his entire body made him horny, despite his best efforts to stay focused on escape.  Around the second minute of being Rei's personal lollipop, he simply stopped caring and enjoyed himself.<br>\r\nWhen Rei finally pulled Jack out of her mouth, he was wet with her saliva, and very, very relaxed.  <br>\r\n\"So,\" asked Rei, \"did you enjoy that?\"<br>\r\nJack simply looked at Rei with blushed cheeks. She simply smiled and stroked him with her finger.  <br>\r\nFinally, Jack began to speak.  \"I, uh, wow.\"  (I said speak, not speak coherently)<br>\r\nLooking at her new doll sized boyfriend, Rei simply wondered what to do.

She walked up to Darien's appartment building and looked through his window. There, asleep  on the couch, was her boyfriend. She tapped on the glass lightly with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarien woke up. He thought he heard a noise, like someone knocking on the glass of his window or someone tossed a big pebble.

Serena?\" Darien opened his window. \"Serena what are you-\" suddenly he saw Serena's giant blue eye staring at him through his window. He was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my new size? I thought so! You'll have plenty of time to tell me just how you feel later. Right now we should really be getting back to Rei.\" said Serena happily, excitedly and playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" was all Darien could ask as Serena reached her giant hand in and clasped her fingers around Darien's tiny, to her anyway, form. She made sure he was in a firm hold, but made sure she held him carefully too, and began heading towards where Rei was. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rei went about her day at the temple as she normally did. Meditating or sweeping since her grandfather had neglected to do so this morning. Sometimes it really bothered her how forgetful that old man could be. Oh well, at least he wasn't out chasing women... or at least she hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently dressed in her shrine maiden attire as she finished sweeping the floors out in the hot sun. She may command fire, but the sun was just something that couldn't be tamed. She was frying like an egg out there. Why did the A.C have to break down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, when grandfather gets back I'm going to demand we get a new air conditioner.\" Rei grumbled. Before she could dwell on her thoughts any longer, the sound of bells caught her ear. Someone was at the front gate. She immediately ceased her sweeping before making her way to the front of the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger soon filled her as she saw there was no one present. Where those delinquents from the neighborhood ding dong ditching again? Rei huffed. Those guys would never grow up. Just as she was about to turn and leave something out of place drew her attention. A little brown box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A package!\" she questioned. The shrine wasn't expecting mail today. Just as she was about to pick it up another thought crossed her mind. What if this was some kind of trick?  No doubt those delinquents dropped it off for her to find. They were all probably hiding in the bushes hoping she'd open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes narrowed as she walked over to a nearby shrub and forced it apart. Nobody to be found. Perhaps she was just being paranoid. With no threats in sight, Rei picked up the package. There were no stamps or labels, just a small white note tied to the top with her name on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, but never the less she brought the package inside. Rei sat the box on her bed and began to tear away the brown paper. Underneath was a small white box with a flip open lid. Rei now found her curiosity at an all time  high. What was in there and who sent it to her. Under normal circumstances she would never even consider opening such a package. But she'd already gone this far and may as well see this through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Rei flipped open the box to reveal something that left her feeling puzzled. Really? This was it? A gun? A toy gun at that. \"That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toy, all that curiosity over a toy. A very fancy toy she had to admit but a toy none the less. Her first instinct was to throw it out as she didn't play with toys, but something about this one in particular made her want to take a look. It was a small and silver device with a few dials and buttons with two massive letters on the side... G and S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot fully understanding, Rei aimed the gun at a her trash bin and fired. Much to her shock a small white beam fired from the barrel and struck the target. Her eyes widened as she watched the bin expand in size. This couldn't be real. Her hand immediately eased off the trigger as she stared down the gun in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who in the world sent me this?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">You are having the same dream again. As usual everyone is tiny and you are larger than most buildings around you. Looking at your reflection in a skyscrapper causes you to smile uncontrollably. You stare at your pink hair and bright red eyes amazed that you are so huge. You can see the fog on the glass your breath is causing. You lean in and kiss your reflection and see your lips leave a huge mark on the glass. Some people are standing below you and you can tell where their eyes are fixed. \"Hentai baka desu.\" you say with a mix of amusement and disgust. You casually stomp down and crush several people who refuse to move and feel a deep joy as they crunch under your mary-jane. Without any warning you lean into your hips and fall onto your bottom. <br>\r\nThe ground shakes violently as you impact the street. You giggle and feel a tingle run through you as the tiny forms under your butt stop moving. In a flash you are back in your mom's bed and realize you are no longer dreaming. \"I love having that dream.\" You say to no one and rub your eyes. Your teenage mother is still sleeping deeply and you crawl out of bed. You walk over to a mirror and look at yourself. You normally keep your bright pink hair in bunny-ear shaped pig-tails but having had just woken your hair is unkempt and hanging unbound. You admire your petite figure for a moment and then stick your tongue out at your reflection. The silly face you make causes you to snicker and your mind wanders back to the dream you keep having. \"I bet it would be really cool to be super big like that.\" You say to your reflection and notice your Luna-p ball. You put your finger to your chin and think. \"Luna P become a...size changing gun!\" You decide in the moment and feel a ping of excitement as the ball becomes a plastic gun shape. \"No way no way no way!\" You try to keep quiet as excitement fills you. You hold the gun gently and see two options, one shows something large becoming smaller, and the other is the opposite. You toggle the option to the enlarge and point the gun at yourself. <br>\r\nAs you fire the sound causes your mother to wake up. \"Chiba-usa what is going on?\" Usagi askes and opens her eyes to see you glowing in a bright colorful light. \"Am I dreaming?\" Usagi askes and rubs her eyes while she watches you expand. You were only wearing a light blue night-gown over your frilly white panties and feel the gown press against your torso. You can see everything getting lower to the ground and are amazed at how quickly you appear to be growing. \"I don't think your dreaming. hehehe\" You giggle and watch yourself grow in the mirror. \"What did you do Chiba-usa?\" Your mother asks as you continue to fill out the space around you. \"Oh, I just wished Luna-P become a size changer and it did. Then I shot myself so I can become ultra big, like in the dream I keep having.\" You say very cheerfully despite the look of horror on your mother's face. <br>\r\n\"Oh god your not kidding.\" Usagi said as she fearfully watched you continue to grow. \"I hope I get so big I can sit on skyscappers and crush anything I feel like!\" You say joyfully as you see the top of your mother's head below you, and feel the ceiling against your own. \"You can't just grow like that everyone is going to think your a monster!\" Usagi tried to argue. You sense a bubbly tingle under your skin and love how it feels. \"I don't care if they think I am a monster, cause I think they are all gonna be bugs from my point of view and why should I care about what bugs think?\" You say in a very cheerful tone as your head bumps the ceiling you can feel your body breaking through the second floor and let out a joyful squeel as you fall into the living room under your mother's room. You continue growing all over and soon your head is rising into the second floor and you can see your mother's body is getting smaller than your head. You smile and laugh as you see how panicked your blonde haired teenaged mother looked. You spent so much time being pushed around because she was double your size and now she was smaller than a child to you. You feel your head hit the ceiling and as you go through the roof you grab onto Usagi despite her resistance. <br>\r\nA massive boom of cracking lumber and breaking tile are combined with the echoing laughter of a childish voice that seemed too loud to be natural. \"Bigger bigger!\" You chant as you hold your shrinking mother in one hand. You are standing in only your panties and don't care that anyone can see your bare chest. You are very proud of your body and know from experience that you will become larger and more shapely than your mother when you finally are an adult. As a young girl you are very amused by how tiny everything has become and the cityscape looks like a toy-land to you. As you feel your mother continue to be more doll-like you cup your hands so you can hold her safely. If you dropped her you might change the past and Sailor Pluto would have to intervene. You wonder why she hasn't done anything to stop your actions and hope she will allow you to keep growing and play out your giant fantasy. It is very early morning and practically no one is awake to see the growing child you have become. \"This is so awesome, I'm becoming a super big super-hero!\" You say to your tiny mother and she has a confused but less worried look on her face. The way you are gently holding her makes her feel calm and she keeps reassuring herself that you wouldn't hurt her. Hearing her say this to herself you look down into your hands and she looks up at your massive red eyes. \"If it'd make your feel better I can set you down.\" You suggest and feel the tiny woman shake her head yes. You very carefully set her down and continue to grow higher and higher. It occurs to you that you know where the size gun is and are sure if you commanded it, it would grow to your size so you could use it again. </div></span></div></div>",

Spotting her measurements on her bedroom door she went over and checked it.<br>\r\nShe was now 5 inches taller than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I really grew? I wonder how? I hope I grow more I'm tired of being called shorty, little, runt and short stuff and treated like a little kid by Serena and others! It's weird tho that my PJ's grew with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon got changed into her usual outfit however with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh my school outfit is tighter? I guess what I'm wearing grows with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Rini went to look around the house.<br>\r\nIt was the weekend and apparently everyone had gone out.<br>\r\nThere was a note along with pancakes in the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini grabbed some pancakes and spotted a syrup dish similar to one from a restaurant.<br>\r\nThe syrup was a slightly different color than she was used to but Rini shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the scientist and assistant were spying on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor did you do what I think you did\" asked the assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Thanks to your incessant concerns last night I made a batch of ever grow serum as concentrated as possible. 555x normal strength and concentration and she's about to ingest it and become temporarily addicted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir aside from the dangers and risks 555x concentration would barely be liquid anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the assistant was right.<br>\r\nRini struggled to get the \"syrup\" out.<br>\r\nIt was like rubber cement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this syrup is extra thick\"<br>\r\nFinally she had drenched her pancakes in a good bit of the serum unaware what she was about to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini took a few bites shocked at how amazing it tasted. She then ate about 3/4 of her 1st serving. Suddenly she felt strange.<br>\r\nThe serum was so strong especially in these doses it forced a sudden spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini shot up 6 inches in height.<br>\r\nShe was now nearly 1 foot taller than normal.<br>\r\nOddly her tight school outfit grew with her and didn't get any tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh did I just grow? Whoa this is crazy and amazing! I can't wait to measure myself after I finish this yummy breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what just happened professor? Shouldn't the spurts be slower and different\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a recoil effect likely from so much exposure to so much concentrated serum. Think of it as overflow. You fill up a container too much and it overflows. In this case a brief growth energy buildup between doses or spurts forces an instant spurt. She may have 1 or 2 more over the course of her meal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini sure enough ate the last of the pancakes on her plate then for some reason she couldn't understand was compelled to lick the plate clean of \"syrup\" then drink and lick up every last drop from the syrup container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than Rini had licked the last drop had the strange feeling returned. In an instant she shot up 13 inches this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini was now 2 feet taller than normal and slightly taller than Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa it happened again! This is incredible! I just wish it happened slower so I could enjoy it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Rini realize from here on out the growth or at least any she was awake for would feel different and happen in significantly slower spurts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls had learned recently that Mimete had escaped from her electronic prison in the Convention Center, and was running freely in the city. They were taking this fight very cautiously, since they had learned that Mimete now had the power to change her size at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(sigh) It's just not fair. I'm Sailor Chibi-Moon! How could they just leave me behind like this!?\" Rini shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea came into her head. If she were a little bigger, she could be able to fight alongside the other scouts. So she grabbed her Luna Ball and started bouncing it around the room before throwing it into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty magic! Make me bigger!\" Rini shouted. In an instant, the Luna Ball vanished. Nothing happened for a couple of minutes, but all of a sudden, Rini looked up at the ceiling to see it closing in on her. She quickly determined that her growing spell was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Rini, her clothes were growing with her. So she could just watch as she increased in size. After growing through the roof, Rini had finally stopped growing... at 100 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... this is great. No wonder Amy fantasizes about being big most of the time!\" Rini said. She then set her sights out into the city. She could either help the scouts and find (or even battle) Mimete, or get revenge on the other girls and make them pay for leaving her behind, especially Serena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rini transformed into Sailor Chibi-Moon, she pondered her decision.</span></div></div>",

Rini couldn't wait any longer, so she came out of hiding and started stomping her way towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls turned around and nearly had a heart attack at what they were seeing. They had to back up to avoid nearly being crushed underneath Rini's massive pink boots.<br>\r\n\"Rini!?\" all of them said.<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls. So what do you think of me now?\" Rini said.<br>\r\n\"Rini, you can't stay here. People will panic!\" Mercury said.<br>\r\n\"Why should I go back?

And besides, we wouldn't want the Negaverse to capture you at that size. Who knows what they might try!\" Venus said. Rini had finally had it. She wasn't going to be pushed around by girls older than her, not even if one of them was to be her mother in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmrph... fine. Perhaps I should really show you what I am capable of at this height!\" Rini said. She could decide later on the fates of the girls.

Just then, Rini stopped lowering her foot just inches from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment about what Raye said, and she was right. The sailor scouts had kept her alive for the most part from past evil encounters. Plus, Rini thought that if she crushed the sailor scouts here in the past, she would never be able to return to the future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rini couldn't just let the sailor scouts go.

What's this?\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n\"This is one of our most potent weapons, the Dragon Crystal. It contains the very essence of Emerald's power.\" Wiseman said.<br>\r\n\"Emerald? Then that must mean...\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rubeus. I'll leave you to figure it out for yourself. I'll just say that the sisters can have a big time in the old town tonight! Hahahahahaha!!!\" Wiseman shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then faded away, leaving Rubeus all to himself.

Some of the sisters weren't too thrilled about coming back after each of them had been doing some major shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww... Rubeus! Did you have to call us back? I was in the middle of buying a year's supply of makeup!\" Catsy said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and they had this super cool sale on swimsuits as well. Something to help perk up my already beautiful figure.\" Birdie said.<br>\r\n\"But on the other hand, at least we got away in a dirty fashion. Prisma forgot her wallet again.\" Avery said. Prisma grinned her teeth in frustration.<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrr... at least I didn't supply the bad luck this time! Don't you know how popular those clothes were!?\" Prisma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(sigh) Ladies, they'll be plenty of time to do your shopping AFTER we capture the brat and do away with those sailor scouts!\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n\"Why should we even bother? Those scouts have beaten us before, even after we gave it our best shot!\" Prisma said.<br>\r\n\"But this time, Wiseman and I have developed a plan that's foolproof!\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Probably as foolproof as the store manager setting up that major sale on the makeup!\" Catsy said.<br>\r\n\"Take a look for yourself, ladies!\" Rubeus said. He then flashed the Dragon Crystal out, and naturally, all the girls were quite fascinated. Some of them even gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! That's the legendary Dragon Crystal!\" Birdie said.<br>\r\n\"That thing's more powerful than all five of us combined.\" Avery said.<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't be able to control such power very easily!\" Catsy said.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... so what's up with Emerald's little gizmo, Rubeus?\" Prisma said.<br>\r\n\"If we're going to succeed in our plan and conquer the future, we need to start thinking big. And this Dragon Crystal is just the thing we need.\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n\"You mean we can actually become giants, much like what Emerald does with her energy statues?\" Catsy said.<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" Rubeus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent... there's nothing better than borrowing Emerald's power and going out and acting like Godzilla!\" Prisma said.<br>\r\n\"Actually, Prisma, you're already a Godzilla when it comes to shopping! Perhaps that power should be given to someone more capable, like me.\" Avery said.<br>\r\n\"What!? Are you kidding, Avery? With my sharp claws, I could slice and dice the city into mincemeat while searching for that little brat!\" Catsy said.<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, you don't need any fancy claws to find that little brat. Someone as bright, intelligent, and cool as myself would find those sailor scouts easily!\" Birdie said. Eventually all the girls started to squabble over who should take advantage of the Dragon Crystal's powers. Fortunately, Rubeus stepped in to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now this crystal is strong enough to supersize only one of you. I'm hoping the Wiseman is working on a backup source. But in the meantime, who would like to take the risk and crush those puny sailor scouts once and for all!?\" Rubeus said.</span></div></div>",
