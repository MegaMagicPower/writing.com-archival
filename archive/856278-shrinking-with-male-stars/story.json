So you can go out through that door.<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, you hold your hands behind you and throw yourself forward.

Looking closer you see that the three are people you have seen off television!<br>\r\nTo the right of you is r'n'b star and singer, Romeo! He is wearing jet black pants with a red jacket and white shirt underneath.<br>\r\nIn the middle is actor and heart throb star, Orlando Bloom! He is standing there with dark blue pants and a cream t-shirt on.<br>\r\nBefore you get a chance to see the other giant, he turns and walks down the alley and turns the bend out of sight.<br>\r\nBoth the giants are still chatting and are handing each other pieces of paper. They must be making a movie of some sort.<br>\r\nYou quietly walk besides the huge black bins and look ahead. You see the stars both have bags with them besides their feet. Walking down the alley could take a while, so why not hitch a ride with one of the giants?<br>\r\nYou glance around and they are still in deep conversation.<br>\r\nMake your choice quick!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your flight is waiting\"<br>\r\nYou're at the airport!<br>\r\nYou jump up an manage to stick you head out of the side pocket of the bag and see Romeo passing something to someone else.<br>\r\nYou've got to act fast!<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",
