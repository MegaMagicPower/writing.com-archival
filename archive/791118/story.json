She thinks it would be nice to be able to shrink the dragon balls down to a more convenient travel size would help if they had to get away in a hurry. She has worked on this for weeks and is ready to start testing. She sets the ray to grow and then aimes at an apple on the table.

You know what it is like to be the small warrior that always gets beat up all the time. I invented a device that will make you as tall as Piccolo and as strong as Goku.\" \"Piccolo, Goku?\" said Krillin, \"I'm kinda satisfied of the way I am right now, Bulma, aside from the short jokes. Goku's the real hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Why don't you, Krillin,\" asked 18 crossing her arms, \"Then you could take more of the credit for saving the day! I'll do it!\" \"Well, unfortunately, it hasn't been tested on androids. Not yet anyway,\" said Bulma in a sorrowful tone, \"But, I don't think it would hurt to try.\" Krillin protested, \"18, what if something goes wrong? You could be killed!\" \"Silence, Krillin,\" she snapped, \"If you weren't such a coward.\" Bulma fired up the machine and aimed it at 18, \"I hope this works!\"</span></div></div>",

Wether she would grow again from there was unknown. She looked down at poor little Krillin, scared out of his mind. She couldn't hurt him, no matter how short or weak he was. He was her loving husband after all. And there was Marron, the living proof that love is greater than logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\" Bulma says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma...\" Marron didn't know what to believe, seeing her own mother grow like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?

She also had a rush of power. Not even Goku at his Super Saiyan 3 level could harm her now. The mighty Broly would tremble before her.

Vegeta, who had met up with the Son's was searching for his 'mate', he had once again destroyed the GR and required Bulma to fix it again.

Goten and Trunks looked in silent awe at the now huge 18. Yamcha on the other hand had a look of sheer terror. His last encounter with androids 19 and 20 ended up with him having a section of his chest removed by force. If he had not been the prideful guy he was, he would have pissed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened here Krillin, why is 18 so big?\" inquired Gohan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my fault.\" answered Bulma. \"I was testing a new invetion on 18 and this was the result.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget about the giant robot, woman\" snarled Vegeta. \"I need you to fix the GR\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18 slammed her foot down next to Vegeta, the ground cracking under the force. \" WHAT did you just call me, Vegeta?\" asked 18 in her icy tone.<br>\r\n\"I called you a robot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin knew what was about to happen, grabbing Marron he flew into the sky above 18.<br>\r\nA moment later 18's foot collided with Vegeta, sending him into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding Krillin noticed that Goten and Trunks were still flying around his wife. 'Man, this place is just getting too crowded.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" everyone turned to look at Krillin, 18 just tilted her head to look at her husband, \"Why don't we go somewhere else, somewhere that can fit us all.\" Glancing up at his wife.<br>\r\nMarron, Goten and Trunks instantly screamed the West City Park. Goku, Yamcha and Gohan were in favour of the mountain area surrounding their house. <br>\r\nBulma, and the now very angry, very wet Vegeta decided to head back to CC. Bulma would notify the others when she found the cure for 18's prdicament. After she finished fixing the GR for Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do the others go?</span></div></div>",

The ancient evil one smirked with self-confidence; there was no way this girl would prevent him from entering the Battle City finals. He needed to duel Yugi and Kaiba to retrieve their Egyptian God cards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n However, a new plan ocurred to him...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Hey, you ready to duel, pycho?\" Mai asked impatiently.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Actually,\" Yami Marik replied, grinning. \"I'd like to make things more interesting. How about a wager?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"What kind of wager?\" Mai asked cautiously.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"If I win, you must serve as one of my Rare Hunters, until you can steal Yugi's God Card for me,\" Yami Marki replied.  \"However, if you win, I will use my shadow magic to grant you that desire that I know is buried within your heart...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You'll make me the strongest duelist ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There will be none stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai considered....this guy was a pushover who hid behind his little cronies! No way she could loose to him!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \"Deal!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The duel was over so fast Mai swore she missed something.  Yami Marik played nothing but weak monsters, and all in attack mode.  Her Harpies Ladies and Amazon cards ripped them apart with no trouble.  He didn't even play any traps!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \"Well, looks like I loose,\" Marik said with mock saddness.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \"Remember, we had a deal,\" Mai reminded him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"But...of course!\" Marik grinned evily, then took out his Millenium Item, the Millenium Rod.  A huge shadow engulfed Mai. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n When the shadow faded away, Mai was disoriented and naked.  With a scream, she covered herself with her hands.  Where was she?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n She looked down, and saw...buildings? <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Mai Valentie was 200 feet tall in the middle of battle city.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yami marik had the good sense to be far away when his spell was completed.  He laughed.  \"Let's see Yugi when this tournament when he's got a problem like this on his hands!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"What?!\" Mai shoted, her voice breaking several windows.  \"What did you do?! I wanted to be the strongest duelist ever!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n *And you are* Marik's voice said inside her head.  *There's not a duelist in the world who can match your strength.  Oh...that's not what you meant? I'm sorry; you'll have to specify next time! Hahaha!*<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  \"Creepy little jerk...\" Mai muttered.

Show your face, or I refuse to duel you!\"<br>\r\n\"Show me the Egyptian God cards, Yugi, and I'll show you my face.\"<br>\r\nYugi obliged by showing him both Obelisk and Slifer.

Maybe today wouldn't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Using a combination of drugs and rapid radition treatments, we can seriously disrupt their metabolic functions, enabling us to perfom the shrinking operation permanetly.

Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" asked Kaiba confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may have the exact opposite effect, making the girls larger instead of smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last possible side effect was enough to make Kaiba wet his pants if he hadn't been standing in front of his staff.  What could be worse than a huge Mai?  An even bigger one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, the final decision is up to you on which plan we go ahead with.\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't like Kaiba;s rationalle, or his ego, but at this point, he didn't have much of a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his rant, Kaiba sat down and began thinking.  \"The only question now is where we could find some evidence to prove Pegasus is a fraud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he had found the answer.</span></div></div>",

Yami-Yugi just grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the lab, Mokuba was hanging out with Mai, Tea and Serenity. They became good friends during the period of time when Yugi, Kaiba, Tristen, and Joey were passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the girls were sitting in a triangle like pattern. Tea was sitting on her knees, while Serenity sat indian style. Mai was just lying down with her knees up and her arms folded over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure you three will be back to your old selves in no time.\" Mokuba said, standing in the palm of Tea's hand. They had tried letting him talk from the floor, but he was hurting his neck looking straight up to see their faces so when he asked, they decided to let him talk from the palm of whoever he was talking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so...\" she said grimmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to work Tea!\" Serenity said. \"This story would do horrible in the ratings unless everything turned out back to normal by the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Mokuba continued, as he didn't want the girls to anger the narrators of the story, \"I just wanted to apologize for my brother.\" Mokuba said, as he walked from the palm of Tea's hand into Mai's. \"He's under alot of stress right now, it's not his fault. He's really a nice guy... really, he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mokuba.\" Mai said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Serenity added, \"We know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at about this time, Yami-Yugi and Kaiba were climbing through a window into the rafters. When Kaiba saw the scene below, he was not pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yugi, you're on your own!' was all Yami thought before he ditched Yugi in a new-york-minute and re-appeared in his ghost form right in the center of the triangle the girls formed. He then began staring at Tea up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--AH!\" Yugi immediately panicked and grabbed onto the rafters with all his strength for fear of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's it like being so huge?\" Mokuba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, is it... wierd to be able to hold people in the palm of your hand and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit,\" said Mai. \"but it has it's advantages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo demonstrate their point, the girls began demonstrating the advantages, still not leaving the positions they were in. They held Mokuba, lifted him and passed him around. Mokuba was having the time of his life, this was so cool! Then, as Serenity grabbed him, she accidently grabbed Mokuba by the sides of his stomach, and caused him to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! That tickles!!\" Mokuba shouted, laughing the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it does... does it?\" Serenity asked, thinking this was just about the cutest thing ever. \"Well, how about this?\" she then proceeded to intentionally tickle Mokuba. The girls thought it was cute too, so they soon joined in one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba was watching from the rafters, each thing going on down there building like hot magma in the bowels of an active volcanoe. He was already so mad that he could not hear any of Yugi's crys for help. Finally, when his little brother was being passed around like a toy, and being tickled without mercy... he went into super brother mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S ENOUGH!\" Kaiba shouted as he jumped down and landed on a large computer-type machine. He then jumped down into the center of the triangle the girls formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put my brother down! Quit passing him back and forth like some god-damned toy!!\" Kaiba ordered. Tea, who was currently holding Mokuba, complied and placed him by his older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Kaiba-\" Tea began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE GOING TO TRAUMATIZE HIM!! HE'S NINE YEARS OLD, HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE HELD IN THE PALM OF ANY-ONES HAND!!! HE'S NINE AND ALREADY, THANKS TO YOU THREE, HE'S SEEN EVERY PART OF THE FEMALE BODY!! HE DOESN'T NEED THAT!!\" Kaiba shouted, sounding more like a concerned parent than a brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he was guilting them, he eventually just started shouting and insulting them. Finally, the girls were more angry at Kaiba than ashamed of themselves and getting ready to have Kaiba go on for round two as a human dildo... but first:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mokuba,\" Serenity began. \"The three of us are kind of hungry, could you go tell the cooks to get us as much food as possible and lead them back over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Mokuba shouted in return, as Kaiba's ranting was really loud. Mokuba left, meaning it was just the girls and Kaiba. Yami sat back thinking, 'This should be interesting.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP!!\" Yugi shouted from the rafters, interrupting everything.</span></div></div>",

Quickly standing up, Tea extended her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump Yugi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked down at the space between Tea's hands and himself.  It was at least 50 feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy!  I'm not jumping that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Yugi held his breath and let go of the rafters, landing square in Tea's hands, unharmed.

But I'd rather not have to do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea smiled as she put Yugi down on the floor.

He's all yours, Serenity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his head quickly so no one could see him blush, Kaiba tried to free himself from Serenity's grip to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Serenity began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?  What do you want to know?  Why I'm a protective brother?  Why I don't trust you?  Why does everyone think I blush whenever I see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it feel being used as a dildo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Serenity and Kaiba dumbfounded at that question.

Define 'feel'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I used you as a dildo, did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi sweatdropped while the girls giggled.  No wonder they sent Mokuba on an errand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerenity giggled as she asked again.  \"You remember.  I picked you up and used you because you were being a jerk.  Did you like it?  And why aren't you looking at my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba groaned from the sheer embarassment of the situation.  Finally, he answered, his head not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, maybe just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T SAY THAT!\" angrily shouted Kaiba, his face turning redder and redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were about to,\" interrupted Tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can see it Kaiba,\" added Mai.  \"You like her.  Now be a good boy and admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs entertaining as this all was for Yugi, the greater problem of finding evidence against Pegasus lingered.  He needed to get Kaiba down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Serenity, can you put Kaiba down?  We need to do something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerenity smiled at Yugi as she put Kaiba down.  \"Sure.\"  Yugi breathed a sigh of relief as Kaiba stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she listen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should try being a little nicer Kaiba.

There was a complete lack of anything to accuse Pegasus of being up to no good. As much as he hated to admit it... Pegasus was reformed. Their hacking was interrupted as cheers fo celebration filled the examination room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus's scientists had managed to counter the effects of KaibaCorp's mistake!! The girls were still two hundred feet tall... but this was a start!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they still 200 feet tall?\" Pegasus asked his lead scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I've never seen structures like this. Look at their DNA coding, it's exceeded the possibilities of the genetic level that mankind was intended for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls were glad to be slightly smaller than they were previously. This also meant that there were sheets they could use to cover their private areas... like a bikini kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tea began, \"we're not normal yet, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's a start, Tea.\" Serenity said. Mokuba, who was currently sitting on her shoulder, nodded his head in agreement. Mai remained silent, still lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Yugi-boy. There's nothing else I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!

My sister can't stay like that forever!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, I wish I could, but we've done all we can. The magic of the millenium items is just too powerful, even science can't beat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba was thinking. He did NOT like the idea of 3 200 foot tall giantesses who all disliked him. So, after about 2 seconds of debating with himself, he finally stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pegasus, alone the two of have failed in trying to find a cure. But, together, I think we can do this. Both of us could combine our resources and technological findings, together, we'd have to come up with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I don't see why not! Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba extended a hand for a handshake. Pegasus did the same, only his hand was about half a foot away from Kaiba's hand. Kaiba repositioned himself, adjusting to Pegasus's 0 depth perception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went off to try and find a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls were still in the examination room when the doors opened up and in walked...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't unnoticed by him, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I was...\" this was met by a rather nasty glare from Tea that caused Yugi to shut his mouth.  He may have wanted to see the pics, but he wasn't dumb enough to argue with Tea about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristen, however, was more than ready to argue.  He was annoyed at first when the girls didn't let him speak, annoyed when he saw Yugi get off with a warning, and positively infuriated when he saw Mai stroking Joey mere minutes after she beat him sensless.

It's obvious he likes you, but he has to maintain that whole anti-hero brooding loner image.\"  Tea's remark couldn't help but draw some giggles from Mokuba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not THAT bad.  It's not like he runs around with a cape and a boomerang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe Serenity should go talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?  Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Tea approached Serenity after putting Mokuba on the floor.  \"It's obvious he gets all hot and bothered whenever he's near you.  Besides, it's gonna be at least a day before the antidote is ready.  You might as well do something productive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\"  Being a rather shy girl, Serenity wasn't exactly sure about it, but Mokuba's approval sealed the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll go.  If I can find him.  You sure you'll be okay with Mokuba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not crude.  We'll be just fine.  Just try to avoid Tristen.

Let's see how this goes.\" Pegasus said into the recorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked on his computer. He removed an electron from the electron cloud. the radium began shaking, the structure faltering. It was now that the sodium would have to be bonded, in these crutial few seconds. He did so. The compound glowed and gave off immense light and heat.

He balanced a pencil on his nose as he flicked cards in the air and watched them fall back the the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus was leaning on two legs of his chair, his feet in the air. Pegasus, being basically a big kid, was seeing how long he could balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we be doing something with the antidote?\" Kaiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah... we've still got a few hours of free-time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd reason 2.) If she did see Kaiba, it would probably lead to kissing which would in turn lead to foreplay which would in turn lead to the mommy-daddy-dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she went to go see Tea. The warehouse that the girls were staying in had been fixed up overnight by Industrial Illusions. There were 3 gargantuine beds, 3 gargantuine dressers filled with gargantuine clothes. (I like that word... Gargantuine! Gargantuine, gargantuine, gargantuine, gargantuine...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea was sitting on her bed, talking with Mokuba, who was standing on the bedside dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Serenity said, sitting down on the bed on the otherside of the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Serenity.\" Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Hey, can you answer a question?\" Mokuba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll try.\" Serenity replied, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true that you're going out with Seto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Serenity and Kaiba?! You mean he actually dropped the Batman act?!\" asked Tea, shocked. She looked to Serenity to see if it was true. Serenity was blushing so much she made a chili pepper look pale. \"IT IS TRUE!! Mokuba, you've got a sister in law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Time to collect on overdue birthday presents!\" Mokuba said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now,\" Serenity said, blushing even redder. \"Let's not go that far...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Serenity... how far is it you did get with Kaiba?\" asked Tea, inching closer in typical Anime gossip fashion. Serenity blushed again then looked at Mokuba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Mokuba? Why don't you go see if Kaiba needs help in the lab. Tell him I said hi, K?\" she said as she placed Mokuba on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" said Mokuba to Serenity as he left, completely unaware that this was a ruse to get him out of the room.</span></div></div>",

Dr. Doom is gonna kill me if this dimension starts merging...\" Freak Boy said nervously, running a hand through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======IN LATVERIA======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The foolish author still has not learned. You can only vex Doom so many times before he is forced to take drastic measures, Freak Boy. If you do not manage to ceace this, then I swear I shall reign fury and doom upon your mortal soul!\" Dr. Doom shouted, throwing his wine goblet at the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Lord Doom... He can't hear you... you know that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======BACK ON DUELIST KINGDOM======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you know what? Crossing dimensions is bad for a number of reasons - SERIOUSLY!! Enough! DBZ was once a good show, but it was ruined when the writers got too cocky and messed everything up with the different levels of Super Saiyan. It was once 'Super Saiyan! AH! The most unachievable level of Saiyan power! Oh god! Everybody run!' THEN EVERYONE COULD BE SUPER SAIYAN AND IT WAS ALL 'Oh god!

A portal to the DBZ world opened up. \"All those who wish to return to your own dimensions, do so or face the wrath of Stalinist Gulags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the DBZ characters were more than willing to go into their own dimension and duke it out, especially after seeing what happened with that really wierd story with Neo, Trinity, Dr. Doom, the Authors and those video game GTS.

With no hotel in sight, the group set up a camp with the various giantesses standing guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far away, a small Cessna propeller airplane was flying between parts of upstate New York, delivering mail to farms and other such regions that were out of the way of the big cities.  That was before the call came in though.  Pressing a button on the plane console, a voice came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Somedude Mail Courier, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somedude.  It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Nanbu!

A bizzare crossover of anime and videogame giantesses along with authors had threatened the very fabric of time and space, along with the sanity of everyone involved in the incident.  With the combined force of the God Phoenix and Doomship, the giantesses were returned to their own dimensions, albeit with a warning from Doom.  If Freak Boy pulled a stunt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something missing.  Does it involve unusually large women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The universe itself is at risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I assumed.  Somedude, this insanity has to stop.  You are to meet up with the rest of the Science Ninja Team aboard the God Phoenix and meet up with Freak Boy before Doom or those giantesses do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"  Turning the plane off the course he was taking, Somedude hit the throttle.  When he was safely away from anyone who could see him, he revealed the bracelet that was on his wrist, and placed it in front of his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIRD GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a series of flashy lights and sound effects surrounding the plane that wouldn't be out of place in an anime series.  When the lights faded, the single engine propeller plane had turned into a futuristic looking jet aircraft.  Somedude, dressed in a delivery boy outfit, was wearing a distinct birdlike outfit, complete with cape, helmet, and suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Authors.  They never learn,\" thought Somedude as he pushed the plane towards its destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is G-1.

We have the leaders, we have the Marxists... all we need now is cooperation amongst the upper ranks. Remember, that's one of the reasons Capitalism will fail--nobody has the good of the people in mind, only their own cause in mind.

Unlike most military systems, Freak Boy had made sure all leaders were equal in status and position, as well as all soldiers were the same.

Members of the 4th Internationale are mainly Trotskyites, but sometimes are referred to as Marxist-Leninists, Radical Socialists, Revolutionary Socialists and Communists.)</span></div></div>",

Doom, on the other hand, was not afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Onboard the Doomship======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doomsman!\" he barked at the pilot. \"Concentrate this ship's firepower on Kentenko... we shall teach him the meaning of humility. He shall never forget that I AM DOOM!!\" he shouted, clenching a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Targeting the Saiyan, Lord Doom.\" said the Doomsman. He typed at his consol for a moment or two then the ship began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Outside======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKentenko saw the glow and immediatly began flying towards the Doomship. Unfortunately, blind rage isn't a good thing. The Doomship fired it's primary weapon, knocking Kentenko back and out of sight. He'd be back, of that there was no doubt, but the Doomship never intended to destroy him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Onboard the Doomship======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target is still alive, Lord Doom. He's heading towards our position at 700mph.\" said a Doomsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is. It was never my intention to kill him, or he'd be dead. You underestimate Doom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not, Lord Doom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, for it is my plan to make him so angry that he will be blinded by rage. When you are angry, you make mistakes... His Ki will be enough to power my armies for a millenium! If he attacks the Doomship, I will harness all of his energy! Doom shall be unstoppable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant, Lord Doom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! You should know that Doom does nothing in haste, every one of my actions are carefully planned and calculated so as to benefit my ultimate goal of world domination.\" he said, standing and going to the observation deck. \"Soon... all too soon, global domination will be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Outside======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen rushed towards the ship, a ki ball charging in his hand as his golden Saiyan hair lengthened. He reached level 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HYAAH!!\" Ken shouted, sending his energy to the Doomship. The Doomship began to glow as the blast hit it, absorbing his energy. Ken screamed as he couldn't shut off his ki blast. The energy was being sucked from him forcfully. (Doom did this before, but I can't remember in what issue...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes of constant energy being ripped from Ken, it stopped. He was drained and down to normal Saiyan level. He collapsed to his knees, Doom's laughter penetrating the hull of the Doomship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Onboard the Doomship======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, we see that no mere monkey is a match for the superior intelligence of Doom.\" he said, turning his chair to face the power core of the Doomship, now glowing with energy. Doom took so much energy, the Doomsmen had to keep taking it from the core and storing it in Energy Packs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not disturb me. I shall be in my quarters.\" Doom said, standing and marching off to his privat living quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... Freak Boy and Somedude were sneaking around the Doomship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somedude, the Freak Boy Armor just ran the calculations, and the two of us combined are no match for Doom.\" Freak Boy said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I've got a plan.\" Somedude said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope it's good enough to work against Doom.\" Freak Boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began sneaking across the Doomship, knocking out a Doomsman or two and hiding them as they moved along. Finally, they reached Doom's private quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the count of three...\" Freak Boy said. \"One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two burst into the room on \"Three\", only to find Doom already waiting, gun in hand. Freak Boy ducked just in time to avoid the bullet from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Somedude said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare invade the sanctity of the Doomship, and order Doom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be worth your while, Lord Doom.\" Somedude said, bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Very well. You have Doom's attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to propose a truce. I am willing to negotiate the following terms; you leave US Airspace and we give you Freak Boy.\" Somedude said, grabbing his partner by the shoulder and pushing him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU JUDAS!!\" Freak Boy shouted, ready to strangle him.</span></div></div>",

Somedude and Freak Boy made it inside the Doomship,\" began Jun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" grinned Joe sadistically, \"it's time for me to have some fun.\"  Reaching for a joystick, Joe began moving the cursor on the screen towards the giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai, Tea, and Serenity weren't about to take being blown to pieces sitting down though.  They quickly resorted to throwing whatever they could find at the God Phoenix, including Drez and Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incoming authors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see them Jinpei!\" shouted Ryu.  Quickly moving the jet, Ryu dodged the debries and authors.  \"Joe, if you're gonna take a shot, do it soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe nodded.  \"OK.\"  Pressing the button on the joystic, a single Bird Missile was fired at the giantesses.  The resulting explosion knocked the three girls to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" shouted Jinpei.  \"That was too easy!  And to think, Somedude's having all the fun on the Doomship...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, Yugi, Joey, Tristen, and Kaiba all stood next to where the girls were felled by the Bird Missle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" began Joey, \"anyone got a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristen just stood there furious.  \"Alright you ninja freaks!  I'm sick of being made fun of by everyone!  Come down here and I'll kick all your asses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he kidding?\" asked Jun.  Joe, Jinpei, and Ryu were already heading for the elevator to the hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not waste Bird Missles that we might need against the Doomship.  Besides, it might be fun.\"  Reluctantly, Jun followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi and Joey both looked on at the angry Tristen, who was also joined by Kaiba.  \"Tristen,\" began Yugi, \"are you sure this is a good idea, pissing off a bunch of ninjas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.  How bad can they GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristen was quickly interrupted by a hail of feather shaped shurikens as they hit various parts of his body, sending him to the floor.  Soon afterwards, the four Science Ninjas landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" began Jun.  \"You boys really want to fight us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba smirked.  \"Please.  I'm not afraid of a bunch of Power Rangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe utterance of the word \"Power Rangers\" caused silence in the area.  Standing up, the four ninjas looked infuriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power Rangers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked on worried as Tristen stood up again, bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE DEAD!\" shouted Joe as he charged forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so much a fight as it was a massacre.  Yugi, realizing that violence wouldn't work, went back to where Tea was and tried to make sure she was OK.  It was about the only smart thing any of them did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba moved in first to attack when he found his neck wrapped around by an odd yo-yo.  The second he touched it, a powerful electric jolt rendered him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristen was next on the list, as he began to punch Ryu in the chest.  \"Bring it on Green Ranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five punches, none of which seemed to move the heavyset warrior, he lifted Tristen into the air with two hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are three things I hate.  Not having enough food, world-dominating psychos, and being called a power ranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you gonna do about it?\"  Ryu responded by throwing Tristen into a nearby building, knocking him out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one hurts Tristen!\" shouted Joey as he began to run for Ryu, fists ready.  Before he could do anything though, a bolo wrapped around his legs, tripping him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Jinpei,\" began Jun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shouldn't have called us Power Rangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the battle now over, Yugi walked out towards where he unconscious friends were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to fight too?\" asked Joe as he readied several feather shurikens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I think this is all the result of a big screwup, with things not going the way they were supposed to.  I'd be willing to help you get things back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the ninjas all lowered their weapons as they went up to Yugi.  \"So, you have a plan?\" asked Jinpei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  We just need to find where the girls threw those other authors off to.  They started it, maybe they can stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun smiled.  \"Sounds like a plan.\"</span></div></div>",

He begins running down the hall, then aims his hand back at the Doomsmen. He pulls his arm in then puts it out, as if cocking it, then the back of the suits hand opened up, revealing a sort of miniature lazer turret. Freak Boy cocked it again and it fired. He did this several times, firing plasma right back at them. (think super battle droids from Episode 2, as much as I hated that movie...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We're going to get back to the 4th Internationale. The Air-Force and artillery will still be out there, but the soldiers are still going to need words of encouragement.\" Freak Boy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We have to find Drez!\" Wizard said, stopping Freak Boy. Freak Boy turned and glared at him through the visor of his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You listen to me, until we're out of this mess, you listen to me! I am a General in the 4th Internationale and outrank you by a longshot, not to mention I'm the veteran author here, so you do as I say. Got it?\" Freak Boy demanded. Wizard nodded, as Freak Boy was squeezing his throat rather tightly. The Doomsmen rounded the corner and began firing. \"Good -- RUN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Meanwhile...======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Somedude felt bad about betraying his partner, but Freak Boy was resourceful. He'd find a way out of this mess. Right now their search for Drez was important, since Ken was only going to doom this fight even further if he took on the Doomship again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======In the Bridge of the Doomship======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoom watched as Ken powered up, accompanied by the giantesses who assaulted his planes. He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saiyan's... they'll never learn. I suppose I shall have to show him the meaning of true power.\" Doom said, heading down to get one of the battery packs. He loaded it into his suit and his eyes widened as the power coursed through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes... I am once again a God!\" Doom shouted. He walked to the exit of the ship and appeared on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kentenko... I am Victor Von Doom. If you are feeling bold, or are just very stupid, then you may attack. You should know, though, that Super Saiyan Four or not... you don't stand a chance against Doom.\" he said. As much a braggart as Doom was, he could back up his smack talk and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled and the two became locked in a ferocious battle. SS4 was powerful, but had a downside; Saiyans have never been smart creatures and in SS1, 2 &amp; 3, they can still be relatively intelligent. SS4 was much more a primitive state of destruction. Doom, on the otherhand, while retaining that same power, could still contemplate rational thought and formulate strategies which would work to his advantage--in this case, distract Ken long enough for the Doomship to begin extracting his energy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======Meanwhile... again======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" Tea shouted, smacking a red plane down to the ground and away from Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are everywhere! Why can't the madness just end?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giantesses fought off the 4th Internationale's planes and Doom's planes, an explosion from the hull of the Doomship went un-noticed. Out of the hole in the ship propelled two authors, one of which was zooming off with jet-boots while the other clung to him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands off my visor! I can't see!\" Freak Boy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull up! Pull up!\" was all Wizard shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak Boy spiraled around befor crashing into someone's cleavage. He groaned and opened his eyes to reveal his visor was cracked in the explosion and his left arm sustained adequate damage to prevent him from moving it for a while. Wizard was lucky, as Freak Boy took most of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand reached in and pulled them out. Freak Boy looked up weakly to see the face of...</span></div></div>",

He shouted many expelatives and curses, but it was all muffled by Jean's giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Mr...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWizard looked up and saw the face of everyone's favorite X-Man--er...

Why is everything so small and - how did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm not sure myself. This has happened before, but I think the guy in your hand can explain it better than I can,\" Wizard said, gesturing to her closed fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean nodded and opened her hand.  Freak Boy was there in his sparking suit. He had removed the helmet to prevent his hair from catching on fire. He looked up at Jean and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lenin, not again,\" Freak Boy said with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm sorry,\" Jean said, sitting down on a hill and looking at the two authors inquisitively. \"But Mr. Wizard said you would be able to tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not Mr. Wizard, just Wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak Boy sighed. He thought for a few seconds, then stood up. \"I'll explain it, but I warn you it will be very lengthy and almost no one will understand a word of it, since the readers are all uneducated sex pervs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it goes like this--\" because Freak Boy was right, I will not bother going into detail on his speech. You just need to know that it took up 25 pages of him discussing the theory of the space time continuum, the fact that when you crossover stories then you need to open a rift. When rifts are opened too often, it becomes increasingly difficult to permanently close them. This means that it will close for a while, but then tear itself open. He went into great detail about how the rifts get bigger and cause merges in dimensions which lead to disfigurations (such as Jean's size alteration) when people come out of dimensions when it happens enough and eventually leads to the destruction of the universe as we know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--so then when dimensions merge with such violent results, it leads to a contest on the molecular level as to which dimensional structure will be accepted. When this begins to take place atoms split as they wage war, and as we all know splitting the atom leads to nuclear explosions. This means the universe would destroy itself in a matter of hours. That make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean sat, dumbfounded. If what he said was true then she was contributing to the destruction of the universe. She wouldn't let that happen. It was then she noticed Dr. Doom fighting someone from DBZ. This was strange for her, as Dr. Doom is one of the X-Men's sworn enemies, yet here he was fighting to keep the peace... most strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Freak Boy interrupted her thoughts. \"Jean? Earth to Jean? Come on, will you help us or not?\"</span></div></div>",

She had taken up the role of the nurse, getting things from the nearest hospital with th help of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marijuana should sufficiently sedate the patient for operation.\" Freak Boy said, dropping the professional air he had held about him. Jean, Wizard and Drez all stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and... get it in a big bag.

Deciding that whatever Yugi and Tea were doing wasn't worth wasting time over, they rushed back to the mansion.  Tea, not willing to go naked, stayed behind for a bit and put her clothes on before catching up with Yugi in tow.  Reaching for a cell phone, Kaiba began to tell Pegasus that he had the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful Kaiba.  Now get back to the castle and we'll be done with this nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound so easy.

It'd be way too awkward.  Speaking of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop it, OK?  I feel stupid enough as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be!\" replied Mai as she put her arm over Tea's shoulder.  \"I've been wondering just exactly when you and Yugi were gonna hook up.  Sure you picked the wrong time to have sex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai sighed.  \"OK.

I can't tell him how to live it, or who to date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could debat the issue, Pegasus quickly got in front of them.  \"Well, this has all been very lovely, but you all have a plane to catch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plane?\" asked Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I arranged it so my private jet brings you back to Tokyo by tonight.

Hurry, run!\"  The door quickly closed as the car sped towards the runway, preventing anyone else from asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Later that evening...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba and Pegasus were in the dining room of the Duelist Kingdom castle, exchanging a meal of wine, bread, and cheese.  Despite the seeming relaxed atmosphere such a meal would present, the mood in the room was anything but relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kaiba, as promised, the one and only copy of you and the giantess engaging in lewd acts.\"  Motioning to a servant, Pegasus handed the tape to him.  The servant then quickly handed it over to Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no other copies exist?\" asked Kaiba between sips of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all.  I'm not going to go back on my promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba smirked.  \"I have just one question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you help me come up with an antidote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus laughed at the question.  \"Two reasons Mr. Kaiba.  The first is that now and forever, you will need to admit that you needed my help.  The second, is that you unwittingly gave me a very powerful agricultural tool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba winced.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse engineering a shrink formula and studying abnormal growth has given me the tools necessary for an agricutulral revolution.  Thanks to you, Industrial Illusions now has a revoltuionary product, one bound to make the patent holder a great deal of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus continued to laugh as he stood up.  \"Well Kaiba, it's been fun, but I have a financial empire to rebuild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Pegasus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pretty much ended the main portion of our story.  Everyone got off the island safely, though their opinions of the events vary from person to person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea and Yugi are still dating, almost inseperable now. Go figure, right? Mai and Joey are... experiencing some trouble in their relationship. Both of them are, once again, too pig headed to admit that it's supposed to be an equal partnership. As for Kaiba and Serenity... Yeah right. That was never gonna happen, even in the most strange of fan fictions. Kaiba is way too much of a jackass for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE END.\" Somedude read aloud as he finished typing the last chapter in he and Freak Boy's latest story. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it... we're finally done.\" he said, standing up and heading towards his bed. He opened the door and climbed in bed, only to hear a knock at the door.  He groaned. \"Figures, they wait till you get all nice and comfortable, then knock on the door...\" he said grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the door and opened it to see Freak Boy standing there with two slices of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Somedude... you got any sandwich meat?\" he asked, holding out the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You showed up at my house... at 2:30 in the morning to ask for sandwich meat?\"  Somedude asked, somehow not surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well--go check the fridge!\" Somedude said, heading for the bed again. Before he could, however, there was a loud crashing noise. Somedude turned around and where his fridge once was, there was nothing but a hole in the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomedude just shouted.  \"Dammit Lita, It's 3 in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreak Boy backed up a bit.  \"What in the hell was big enough to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend,\" replied Somedude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomedude just groaned.  \"I need to write real fiction for a change.\"</span></div></div>",

That Clefairy used Growth on Misty!\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"Growth?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"It's normally used to slightly increase the Pokemon's size so that it can both intimidate its opponent and use stronger attack power. It was never meant to be used on humans!\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"So you're trying to tell me that this Clefairy was responsible for Misty growing to that big of a size?\" Ash said.<br>\r\n\"We might be able to reverse the effect if we command the Clefairy to use minimize.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"All right! Let's try it! Clefairy, use Minimize attack!\" Ash shouted. But instead of Misty, it was Clefairy who instead shrunk down to tiny size and ran off. Ash, Brock, and Pikachu all collapsed of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GREAT. JUST GREAT. NOW HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SHRINK BACK TO MY NORMAL SIZE?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, look on the bright side, Misty! At least your Pokemon grew with you!\" Ash shouted.<br>\r\n\"And your clothes too, though I personally would've preferred...\" Before Brock could finish, Pikachu thundershocked him.<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas, Brock...\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TWO BETTER THINK OF A WAY TO RESTORE ME TO NORMAL, OR I'LL LITERALLY MAKE MINCEMEAT OUT OF YOU!\" Misty shouted.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Misty! Just take it easy. We'll think of something! Any ideas, Brock?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, Ecruteak City isn't too far from here. Maybe we can find some assistance there.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"Good idea, Brock! Let's try that.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n\"You better wait here for now, Misty.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n\"HUH? WHY!?\" Misty said.<br>\r\n\"Well... we wouldn't want anybody to mistake you for an Onix. Even if you are bigger than one.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n\"Ash is right, Misty. We can't risk you causing any trouble.\" Brock said. So with that, Ash, Brock, and Pikachu all proceeded towards Ecruteak City, leaving the 100-foot-tall Misty all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHEESH... WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SO PICKY? MAYBE THIS I'M THIS BIG NOW, I CAN TAKE MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS...\" Misty said. She picked herself up from the ground and pondered where she could do next.</span></div></div>",

She ducked underneath and balloon and crawled. Then, as soon as she felt the balloon was inches away from her face, she leapt up to a standing stance. Of course, all Team Rocket could see was the face of a giant Misty.<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!!!\" Misty shouted.<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!\" They all screamed in shock. Meowth was so stunned, he was sent flying back with his claws puncturing a hole in the balloon. It was sent careening out of control before it totally crashed to the ground about 60 yards away from Misty's position. She walked slowly over to the downed balloon to see the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh... what hit me?\" James asked, holding his head in pain.<br>\r\n\"It feels like a Haunter just jumped up and attacked us!\" Meowth shouted.<br>\r\n\"Only this time it didn't involve any Pokemon that we had known about. What was that thing!?\" Jessie shouted. Just then, the team jumped when a huge booming sound could be heard. That's when they looked up to see the giant Misty looking down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team shook in fear as they wondered what Misty would try at such a huge size.</span></div></div>",

In a moment, he cried out--even though nobody could hear him from inside of May--and proceeded to channel all of his strength into his orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flush went throughout his body as a massive ball of cum came spurting out of his engorged member and splatted on top of him.  And it just kept squirting.  Ash began to shake violently as he continued to ejaculate all over May.  In a few seconds he was sopped with white sticky semen, and his penis hadn't even begin to let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay noticed Ash's climax with the hot wetness dropping onto her tongue.  She moaned, shivering her body and causing Ash to move around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing it did was cause Ash to come again--and he wasn't even finished with his first orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the spurting was almost as a stream, being spit out in gushes of cups, gallons at a time.  He was covered in his milk, licking himself.  A minute or two went by and he still hadn't stopped producing his white goop from his stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When is this gonna end?  I've jacked before, and gotten a good 10 seconds but it's been almost two and a half minutes and I haven't stopped yet.  Am I ever going to stop?' He couldn't say this because he was starting to drown in his own muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay opened her mouth and pulled Ash out--still ejaculating.  She swallowed his cum, and moaned vivacously.  \"MMMM!!!  YOU SURE TASTE GOOD, ASH!\"  She kept an eye on him, noting that he still hadn't finished with his climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMM...WHAT TO DO WITH YOU NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of ideas went through her mind.  She could make his penis grow even more--perhaps big enough to fit inside her cavernous pussy...or she could stick him on her tits and enjoy the biggest milkgush she had ever encountered.</span></div></div>",

But...I just want to make sure you're okay with what I'm going to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was confused.  \"Ash, what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you willing to make an earthquake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay paused a second.  \"That'll affect a lot of people...but it's not like me 2000 feet tall isn't doing that.  So, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh giggled.  \"Just smash your tits into the ground as hard as you can.  Might be easier if you kneel first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the people in Lilycove...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will be just fine.

If it's an earthquake you want, it's an earthquake they'll get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay then knelt down to the ground, creating a small impact crater with her knees.  She then smiled and slammed her body into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed aloud as she felt the earth quiver from her impact. \"Ash, I did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep doing it!  I love this feeling of being bounced around your boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay grinned widely, lifting her massive body up from the earth, admiring the two massive globe-shaped craters from her gigantic tits, and then did it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking was measured at a 8.5 for May's first impact, and then a 9.1 for her second.  Lilycove City shook; buildings were toppled from their foundations, and general chaos ensued. May stayed in the second impact for a second, enjoying the pulsing of the planet and liking that she was the one to bring it about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, that was fun! What do you want to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh paused, dealing with a massive erection that he wasn't even bothering trying to hide anymore.  \"Hmm...let's go...\"</span></div></div>",

She watched as her perspective of Goldenrod City began to slowly fall downward, like she was going up in an elevator. Eventually, when her growing stopped, she found herself standing as a 50-foot-tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I guess this stuff really works!

The words were written in blue ink<br>\r\n\"hmph what have we got here...\" She inspected closer and noticed the title was, Gigantic.

As Lina crossed her arms across her chest she noticed her arms were moving farther away from her main body but was still touching her chest, her yellow cloth that covered her chest was starting to rip to shreads and soon there was nothing left of it, just 2ft long breasts stood out.\"OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT WORKS IT WORKS WORKS\" She wanted to jump high but her new chest weighed her down and then she took a look at the bottom of the paper that read the same spell but with ft.Which meant on height,\"OMG I wanna fucking grow huge too! MOVE OUT UNIVERSE LINA GIANT INVERSE IS COMING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then casted the spell, but how tall did she wanted to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly they reached each other and embraced. \"I love you Sakura!\" Sasuke said as he kissed and embracer her with a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke puts both knees on the ground,seemingly like he was begging \"Sakura,will you marry me?\" She then screamed, \"YESS!!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: Fyi I detest writing this crud its all to much for me to handle i'm twitching now....but believable no?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then looked around wondering why she was still there,right at the moment she says yes she is suppose to wake up shooting halfway up thinking sasuke was there  while perking up her lips getting ready to give a kiss...but yet she's still here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly dark clouds appeared above in the sunny sky.

Within a minute a presence was in front of her. Sakura gave him a thorough look, some red spiked hair, he didnt wear a shirt just showing off his musuclar chest and 12-pack a little droll slipped her mouth. She shook her head to regain some composure, \"So....\" She looked down at his dark blue pants that has a eye emblem on the right knee and also saw him wearing boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Sakura asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer her, so she called again. Still he did not answer. He continued to walk over to Sakura and finally stopped before her. \"You must be Sakura oi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood shocked not expecting that particular reply, \"Um yes i am...now why are you in my dream I was about to move onto the wedding part!!!!\"   She became furious and started flailing her arms wildly while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweatdrop of the man appeared ,'Uh-oh Rant Mode...The deep Fan-girl type doesnt<br>\r\nmake it a softer headahce either...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also then after that we were going to move onto the honeymoon episode!

He just talked,finally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sooooo who are you and what are you doing in my dream!!!\" She screamed and pointed at him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed and rubbed his forehead,'bah i'm getting a headache..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Raiza....the Dream-Fairy where i invade people's personal and private fantasy worlds...\" There was a hint of sarcasm in the voice put Sakura didn't pick it up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream fairy????\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaiza just stared at the girl. \" I was kiddin about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was just about to say something but then Raiza began walking closer to her and held out his hand to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm here...is because I'm suppose to give you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe revealed his hand to her revealing a scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This  scroll is of an ancient jutsu duiring a era of battle of gods. The power held within them shall grant you power over size, beauty, and muscle. For you..Either be a Amazon size lady or ...be a Goddess or  however big you wish to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...that sounds neato but this is still just a dream!\" Sakura told the shadowy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defying all laws of physics,this jutsu scroll shall be in your hand when you wake up.\" He placed the scroll in Sakura's hand who which was confused as hell. \"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time is up. Use your Godly jutsu with care Sakura\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to walk away slowly diappearing from sight 'bullshit that's gonna happen.....sometimes i question the Gods actions....maybe this is just from the God of Destruction or Goddess Athena hoping for her to be a peace-kepper or something...I dunno,don't care'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Sakura's room~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shot up from her bed. \"That was...just a dream..thats all!\" Disbelieving the whole ordeal but then she noticed she was holding something in her hand. It was the scroll that Raiza gave her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stared blanky at it.And began to wonder what to do next....</span></div></div>",

She sat down and opened the scroll.  It read, \"<i>For those who seek to invoke my power, you shall see it with in the hour.  Blessed unto you from me shall be a power for all to see. In five sun rises, this scroll is gone.  It's powers all, in you alone.  To make others like yourself, if you need.  But the following warning, do take heed:  Open the gates to far, and you shall quickly touch your farthest star.  Upon coming to this line, it has begun, the power transfer to you from mine.  Lying within you, a power awaits.  To feel it more, open the gates.</i>\"  Sakura finished reading the scroll and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had never read something that intensely before,\" she thought.  She saw she had placed her hands on the scroll.  When she removed them, they felt warm.  \"But what that scroll said can't be true,\" she thought getting up and walking back to bed.  \" But then how did I get the scroll anyway?  If it was, then I'm still dreaming now.  If not, I would like to be a bit taller.  Being one of the weakest of the Rookie 9 sucks.\"  She sighed sitting on her bed.  As she did, she closed her eyes and saw a giant gate before her.  A silver mist emitted from between the bars and enveloped Sakura.  When Sakura opened her eyes in fright, she saw that her shirt was tighter on her and her legs were showing more from the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be,\" she thought, walking to the window sill.  She had always used it as a measuring benchmark for her.  Not two minutes before, she was even with her old mark.  Now she was a head over it.  \"This is too much to handle,\" she thought before collapsing on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould her desire make her grow more through the night?</span></div></div>",

Her arms slowly expanded, adding good size muscles all around.  Her abs became a six pack without flexing.  Her clothes however, were not able to change with her and ripped around her chest, arms, and legs.  But Sakura still slept on, finally getting to the wedding and honeymoon she has missed out before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn broke on Konoha and like many others, Sakura woke up to the sun on her face.  She opened her eyes and looked at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What strange dreams I had,\" she thought, sitting up, \"Like anyone could  . . .get . . .taller.\"  In mid thought, Sakura saw that what happened the previous.  Her clothes were ripped and her muscles had grown greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" she said quietly, touching her arms together.  She pulled them away, realizing they too had grown.  \"This can't be real,\" she thought pinching her arm with one hand.  It hurt.  Sakura stood up and walked to her full length mirror to better see her new self.  She knew she was no longer the weakest member of her squad or any genin squad for that matter.  In truth, despite being shocked at this event, she only had one regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame my bust didn't increase,\" she muttered, \"It would be nice to be bigger than Hinata as well.\"  She closed her eyes again and as before, saw the gate and the same mist come from it, enveloping her.  She opened her eyes and smiled.  Where before her shirt was merely ripped from her muscular chest, now it was destroyed by rising breasts on her body.  Sakura turned to the side and was ecstatic.  \"If Sasuke wants a powerful woman to be his wife, I think I can accommodate that now,\" Sakura said before looking at the scroll.  \"You, I'll keep with me to keep safe, but first, I need some new clothes. Or do I?\"</span></div></div>",

She took a second garment and made a similar loincloth around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully my belt still fits,\" Sakura thought putting it on, so she could take her side pouch with her.

Soon she reached Ino's flower shop and looked into it.  Ino was there, alone.  <br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Sakura thought, opening the door and walking in.  \"Morning Ino-pig,\" she said happily as she walked forward.  Ino stared at Sakura and couldn't believe it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Ino demanded, \"How could you go from that short nothing to this overnight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a really good dream,\" Sakura said, towering over Ino.

She opened her eyes and Sakura laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no joke Ino,\" Sakura said, lifting Ino up with one hand to eye-level, \"This is the real deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be,\" Ino said, \"There's no possible way for this to be.\"  But as she spoke, she saw the wall move behind Sakura.  Ino glanced down and saw tha the floor was getting father away, but she remained at eye-level with Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it was real,\" Sakura said, \"Now that we both know it is, remember this:  Sasuke is mine.  Actually, let me add something to that:  Sasuke is mine and you can't have any guy without my say so.\"  With her leg, Sakura smashed the counter Ino was working at like cardboard paper.  \"Are we clear?\"  Ino gave a silent nod and was dropped to the floor.  She looked up at Sakura and quivered in fear as her head was just inches away from touching the ceiling.  \"Later, Ino-chan,\" Sakura said before leaving.  \"Now to find Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere at Tsunade's office, Tsunade was told of Sakura.  \"I see, send for her immediately,\" Tsunade said to one ANBU, \"Let's see what's causing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere still, Naruto and Sasuke were training in a field, unaware of what was going on with their teammate.  \"Is that all you got?\" Sasuke asked, \"You get me up at dawn and force me to fight with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're out of breath too,\" Naruto said, \"Besides it's not like we have anything better to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Sasuke conceded, \"One more round?\"  Naruto eagerly got up in his fighting stance.</span></div></div>",

But as she was about to lose hope, she saw someone who might be of some help.  Behind the corner of a building, Sakura saw Hinata Hyuuga looking around.  Smiling, Sakura approached Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura?\" Hinata thought, \"How did she get like that?  Naruto will be all over her now.  Why is my life so unfair?\"  Sakura reached the young Hyuuga and kneeled down so she could better talk with her in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata, have you seen my teammates around?  I want to show Sasuke my new body,\" Sakura said.  Hnata, just a bit intimidated by Sakura's size, decided it was best not to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sasuke and Naruto-kun were in the training field this morning, I just happened to pass by them,\" Hinata said, blushing and severing eye contact when she mentioned Naruto's name.

Sakura just stared down Hinata until she answered timidly, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would you like to be stronger than Neji?\" Sakura whispered into Hinata's ear.  Hinata looked at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she offering what happened to her, to be done to me?\" She thought, \"With that size, Neji and my father would be nothing.  Sakura's always been after Sasuke, so even if Naruto likes the new her, he'll still be free for me.\"  \"Yes,\" she replied more confidently than before.  Sakura smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said, placing the small girl on her shoulder, \"We have some talking to do before getting to that field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Sakura was walking up the path to the training field.  As she approached, she heard a voice cry, \"Fireball jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Sasuke's voice,\" Sakura thought, running up the path.  In the field, near the tree line, Sasuke and Naruto stood, both looking exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, for a fool,\" Sasuke said.  Naruto shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you accept ---- SAKURA!\" Naruto said, before seeing Sakura coming from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, what are you blathering about?\" Sasuke asked, before Naruto just pointed his finger behind the young Uchiha and he saw the tremendous pink haired girl approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sasuke,\" Sakura said, squatting down, \"How do I look?\"  Sasuke was at a lose for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" Naruto said, hoping that would earn him some points with the new Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Naruto,\" Sakura said truthfully, \"But you and I are just friends.  There is someone more deserving of you.  Just go to the tree line and find them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Naruto started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, either you'll walk over there or I'll throw you over there,\" Sakura said, smiling and flexing her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Naruto said, before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at Sasuke and smiled.  \"You never answered my question,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

But it took her more time than normal as Naruto saw.  Hinata had become much like Sakura: taller, more muscular, and well endowed.   Her outfit was like Sakura's.

Hinata quickly squatted down.  \"Do you like me this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she squatted, Naruto was looking right at her breasts  and from shock, moved backwards.  Naruto looked over Hinata.  In the back of his mind, Naruto had planned out that if Sakura was meant for Sasuke, Hinata would make a good second.  He did find her cute before.  Now, she was still cute and then some.  Naruto looked Hinata in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do,\" Naruto said.  Hinata, forgetting all shyness, forgetting her new size and strength,  reached out and hugged Naruto.  Had it not been for her hugging him into her breasts, this would of been a different sort of pain.  He quickly came to like this position and didn't complain.</span></div></div>",

The new couple was stared at by varying stares, some of anger some of fear, and some had a twinge of secret desire to serve the new Goddess and gain some power like that.  Those with the twinge were mostly women.  \"So, how has your vision been altered?\" Naruto asked as Hinata walked slowly down the street.  She didn't want to hurt anyone seeing as the deal was still on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's increased a lot,\" Hinata said, \"I can see over 1,000 yards away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" Naruto said, \"So, uh, did you use your byakugan on Sakura at all today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I did, before I joined with her,\" Hinata said, \"Inside, her chakra was a brilliant gold not of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very cool,\" Naruto said.  Soon they reached the Hokage's Headquarters and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you to bring her in,\" Tsunade said to the ANBU Captain, \"Now she's proclaiming to be a Goddess.  This may not end well.\"  Tsunade had just heard Sakura's command.  She was staring out the window, watching the 20 foot tall Hinata coming in.  \"So that Hyuuga girl is her acolyte?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lady Hokage, but she must of sensed us coming after her and she vanished with the Hyuuga girl,\" the Captain explained, \"We couldn't follow her.\"  Tsunade looked back from the window at those present.  The Jounin-sensei's Kakashi, Asuma, Guy, and Kurenai were there along with Jiraiya, and Utatane Koharu and Mitokado Homura from the Leaf's council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know her best Kakashi, what do you say?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura's one to sometimes over react when angry,\" Kakashi said, \"But this time I doubt even if she was, would that change her power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you suggest we surrender?\" Koharu asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly,\" Kakashi said.  The other Jounin were a bit taken back by the clam nature Kakashi spoke in.  \"Look at it this way, if Sakura can grow not just herself but others, then all she'd need is a few women to join her and her acolytes would probably destroy a greater part of this village quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really bad,\" Asuma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only bad if she wants the extreme from us,\" Jiraiya said, \"If the deal's good, the Leaf Village could really grow from it.  We're still low on funds after the invasion, so if having a few giantesses around to defend our boarders or do missions brings in more money, is it really a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just like it because the women who grow would be easier to be peeked at,\" Tsunade said when there was a sudden shaking of the building.  \"I guess Hinata's here,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade walked out of the office and to the main doors and opened them.  Seeing the 20 foot tall giantess from a distance was one thing.  Seeing her up front was a little shocking.  But what got Tsunade most shocked was Naruto sitting on Hinata's shoulder.  Hinata then sat down, so they would talk move evenly.  The others soon joined Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto,\" Tsunade growled a little angry.  \"I see you chose what side to work on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade, I'm on the side that best helps the village I care about,\" Naruto said, \"I was with Hinata when she went from 7 feet tall to this height.  And we were a good distance away.  With that in mind, I don't see how anyone could really defeat her if she could grow herself that big. I doubt even the Kyuubi could win against her.\" Naruto said, stroking his belly.  Tsunde and Jiraiya knew exactly what Naruto was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sly kid, he's suggesting that the Death God jutsu might beat her,\" Jiraiya thought, \"And no one but Tsunade, the council members and I know the jutsu's activation procedures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying we should give in?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lady Hokage,\" Hinata said, \"What we're saying is it would be wise to listen to my Goddess' proposal.  Truthfully, she was going to approach this matter in a calmer manner, but something happened to anger her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke said the wrong thing to her,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not surprised?\" Kakashi thought, while Tsunade was weighing the situation's new info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll come with you to see Sakura,\" Tsunade said.  \"Kakashi and Jiraiya will accompany me.  The rest of you, stay on alert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade, are you sure this is wise?\" Homura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might try something,\" Koharu added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hokage.  This is my decision,\" Tsunade said before she was suddenly picked up by the Giantess Hinata and placed on her other shoulder.  \"Hey!  Ask first!\" Tsunade said, striking Hinata's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice punch Lady Hokage, I might bruise from it,\" Hinata said smiling.  Tsunade was shocked.  Even if it wouldn't break the arm, it should of done more than a possible bruise.  Those present felt even more worried about not taking the offer.  Hinata then started walking off, back to the Goddess Sakura.</span></div></div>",

Kakashi and Jiraiya exchanged worried glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Byakugan,\" Tsunade thought, \"Of all the people to ally first,  Hiashi why didn't you treat your daughter better?\"  Tsunade and Naruto looked around for Sakura, but she was no where to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here,\" Sakura said.  All eyes went down to a tree and from behind it was Sakura, still nude, but only 9 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Goddess, why did you shrink?\" Hinata asked, kneeling before Sakura to honor her and to let her passengers off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier to be reasonable when you're talking with someone close to your size.  The giant form was just to get my message heard,\" Sakura answered.  She turned to Tsunade.  \"Thank you for coming,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Tsunade said, \"Just before we start, where's Sasuke Uchiha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tied upside down to a tree using my hair as rope,\" Sakura said, \"He called me a steroid freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Tsunade said, \"Will you release him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending on how this meeting goes,\" Sakura said, sitting on the ground.  Now she was about as tall at Tsunade standing.  They looked into the others' eyes.  \"So have you thought on this proposal?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I first want to know some things,\" Tsunade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get this new power?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and would you want to conquer the other villages to spread your influence?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the second one I'm not sure on,\" Sakura said, \"But as for this, it came to me in a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a dream where a dream fairy came and interrupted my dream where I marry Sasuke and he bestowed upon me a gift that granted me this Godly power,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Tsunade said, \"Now for the proposal at hand, what exactly do you mean when you said those things?  To worship you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just being nice to me, nice to my friends, no insulting me, and a once a week prayer for me to protect the village,\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything but the last sounds decent,\" Tsunade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so, I won't force the last one, but it would be nice, since I can chance size at will or anyone's size for that matter,\" Sakura said. smiling.  In her mind, the gates opened.  But It wasn't Sakura or Hinata who grew.  Jiraiya and Kakashi stood behind Tsunade as the meeting went on.  They were shocked and jumped back when Tsunade literally busted out of her clothes, her body grew to eight feet tall and body was restored  what it would of been had she never used the Creation Rebirth Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the transformation, Tsunade was in a trance.  When she awoke, she felt her permanent illusion was gone.  She touched her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tsunade said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift from me,\" Sakura said, \"For coming back and becoming a really great Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Sakura may of violated Tsunade for growing without asking, but this will probably play a huge favor for Tsunade taking the deal.  Sakura never even showed any signs of it, just smiling and then Tsunade grew,\" Jiraiya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be wise to take Sakura's deal, excluding the weekly prayer clause,\" Tsunade said.  Sakura giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, only if things get bad will I demand that,\" Sakura said.  Tsunade nodded and turned around.  \"Let's go back to the village,\" she said.  She and Jiraiya left the group, Jiraiya having to keep up with Tsunade's longer strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sakura, mind if I retrieve Sasuke?\" Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sakura said, \"I'm still mad at him, so tell him to keep away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kakashi said before disappearing.  Hinata smiled and started to bend down to pick up Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Hinata,\" Sakura said.  She looked at her first acolyte.  She cared about her and wanted her to be happy.  But being the Goddess, she had the higher right to be happy.  She wanted to talk with Naruto and see how he felt about moving up in the world.  Now I can go about it directly or indirectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, my goddess?\" Hinata asked.</span></div></div>",

She knelt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, would you mind telling me why you were an outcast?\" Sakura asked.  Naruto turned around, realizing Sakura stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not many are supposed to know this, but I think you could be an exception,\" Naruto said, raising his shirt and focusing his chakra.  The seal of the Kyuubi appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, what's that?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seal that contains the Kyuubi within my body,\" Naruto said, \"I'm its container.  People, however, only saw me as the mini version of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no one ever.  . .\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Third forbade any one to speak of it, but that didn't stop them from hating me,\" Naruto said.  Naruto looked away to hide some tears.  Sakura also felt sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, before any of this happened, who did you like better, Hinata or me?\" Sakura asked.  \"And I want you to be honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Naruto said, \"Because, well, both of you are cute.  Hinata had the bigger top, but you were still very good looking.  But you would also punish me for doing stupid things.  Looking back, I needed that those times.  Looking back, I didn't see Hinata having the same outwardness to stopping me from doing stupid things.  It would of been nice, but I wouldn't of grown half as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, thanks for those kind words,\" Sakura said, reaching out and hugging the little man.  When she stopped, she looked Naruto in the eyes.  \"Tell me, would you like to still have me over Hinata?\"  Naruto's eyes went wide.  Then narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, am I just the rebound from Sasuke?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How could y-y-y-you. . .\" Sakura said startled, but a glare from Naruto made her honest.  \"You were going to be.  But after this talk, I think I could grow to like you on a much deeper level than Sasuke and I would of ever gone.\"  Naruto blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would of just taken me from Hinata?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Sakura said, \"Oh all right, yes.\"  Naruto sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, if you want people to like you and enjoy your rule, such selfish acts would only hurt you,\" Naruto said, \"Why don't we see how things go between Hinata and me.  We may just end up being really good friends.  Maybe not.  Wouldn't it be fairer to do it that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Sakura said, \"Geez Naruto, how could you get even me to bow to your ethics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a gift for it,\" Naruto said.

She couldn't even remember where she was going because of how thirsty she was.<br>\r\n     Suddenly she looked up and saw a shape rising from the desert. <br>\r\n     \"what is that?\", she thought to herself. \"I may as well find out since there isn't much else for me to do.\"<br>\r\n     With a sigh, she trudged toward the protruding shape.<br>\r\n     As she got closer she realized \"Gasp! Its a well!\", she bolted towards at full speed.<br>\r\n     When she reached the well, she droped a stone from the sand down to see if she could hear it hit water.<br>\r\n     She heard nothing and all hope escaped her. But just for the heck of it she turned the crank until the bucket reached the surface of the well. Junko cried out with joy as she saw that it was filled to the brim with sparkling clear water.<br>\r\n     Without any hesitation she grabed the bucket and downed its entire contents.<br>\r\n     Suddenly she felt very dizzy and collapsed into the sand. She was engulfed in tremendous pain and then she blacked out.<br>\r\n     When she awoke she stood to her full hight. \"What happened\" she said dazed.<br>\r\n     She noticed something resting against her foot. It was the well! But then. how did it get so tiny. When she looked she realized that the well had not shrunk, but she had grown! Junko estimated that she was at least 50 feet tall!<br>\r\n     She noticed that her suit seemed very tight (it probably should have been torn to pieces). She realized that her bust was an entire cup size  bigger! Hard to imagine with the melons she already had!<br>\r\n     Suddenly Junko felt very horny, she began to message her breasts. Then she thought \"I wonder what Desert Punk is up to. Hmm, it could be a lot of fun teasing him with these babies.\" She shook her hips as she said this and it made her tremendous breasts violently jiggle.<br>\r\n     \"But then, there's so much other fun I could have to.

Suddenly she stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Junko hasn't seen the Punk yet, and she wasn't expecting to find him so soon out here either. \"Ugh, its so hot in this suit, and tight too.

She takes off her boots and then her socks revealing her silky smooth and surprising fresh smelling feet.

The warm sand felt good between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Meanwhile Desert Punk is having the time of his life watching this. He has striped down to just his boxers for maximum effect.

Then you cam to the right place my friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Notes while adding chapter~<br>\r\n*Try not to let any guys grow,Female GTS for da win,no?<br>\r\n*REALISTIC perspective of height!!!!!! Seriously  a 800 ft tall Giantess wouldnt destroy just one block of housing...more like a destroy  a suburbia with one step. Get the picture? Good because realistic perspecive means a clearer picture :)<br>\r\n*Storyline,if *by luck* there is one, and you wish to add the next chapter please progress/continue it within your chapter! Also dont be a dead-end stopper leave something for the next adder something to continue.If you dont....well stories just end that way -_-<br>\r\n*No 2 words to 3 sentence chapters. Exceptions are Anime,or Girl list choosing. Other wise if you do post a short, incomplete and nooblet chapter I shall hit you with a freaking bat and mail you calling you a tard.<br>\r\n*Easy with the graphics is all i gotta say...A little bang here and a little there is cool. but I dont want no extreme,xXx stuff here, The last thing i want to do is increase the content rating.<br>\r\n*NO furyness,shrinking(cept the girls returning to their normal height NO SHORTER) ,inflation, Age Regression,(the only exception to this rule is Tsunade from Naruto XD) . If spotted I shall delete on sight.  I will allow Age Progression and Breasts Expansion.,its forms of growing =)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This Story has reached over 10,000 views o_o; Thank you all. Readers &amp; Authors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, reader and/or author. please excuse some poor terrible chapters. The outline for is pretty big and.....well its takin me forever to moderate all of 'em X_X <br>\r\n</td>",
