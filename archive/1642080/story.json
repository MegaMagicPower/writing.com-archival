But then one day, her stomach growled and she gave Link's ear a gental Nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna; hang on a second Link. I'm getting kinda hungry, maybe we should go into to town and get something to eat, I mean you're a wolf so everyone will be too scared to stop you, and everyone seems to ignore me (seriously, I'm not the only one who noticed that right?). So lets go and get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink growled, not a big fan of Midna's idea, he had his principles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna; Whats the big deal? you saw how expensive the food is at town, and you need your Rupees for weapons. Besides, you don't need to eat anything yourself, just scare people away from the food stalls. And whats the rush? the barriers not going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pouted and decided to just let Midna have her fill. He wasn't sure why, but he felt like they would never see each other again after this adventure was done. So Link went into town and scared everyone away.

Hmm, it looks like there isn't any more food in this part of town. Let's look somewhere else.\" They traveled to the south part of town where Telma's bar was. Link realized that everyone there was gone too and felt pretty bad for scaring them all off. Midna, on the other hand, only felt more hungry as she smelled all the meals that were left there for the customers. \"Well, if they don't want this food, I'll eat it for them.\" Midna said with a greedy smile.

She recalled that only the chosen hero could open these doors. So she told Link about the door and told him there would be a great treasure inside. So Midna teleported them to the door at Death Mountain. Between Link and her twili powers, the door opens. The dungeon is full of enemies and traps they have to fight through. As they defeat enemies Midna claims what meat and food she can from them and sends it into the Twili realm to later place in Link's chest. As they near the end Midna spots a sign that reads \"Great Goron treasure lies ahead, but those who wish to wield Goron treasure must prove they hold the strength of a Goron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna and Link go into the next room to see two sumo rings, each with a large Goron sitting in a throne at the end of each.

The map shows a detailed description of a back entrance into Hyrule Castles food storage catacombs, that lead to multiple food storage rooms. Midna tells Link she wants all the food in the storage rooms, so they teleport to the location the entrance should be at. As this area is still covered by the Twili Link is in his wolf form. Midna finds no door but only a howling stone. She looks at link with sad eyes and she asked, \"Link, will you please use this howling stone for me to show the hidden entrance to the catacombs. I'm sure there will be access to the palace from inside allowing you to go save Princess Zelda.\" Link realizes Midna is correct and inside he could transform back to human. Link howls the notes on the stone and a door hidden on the castle wall opens and behind the door is a gate that has a master lock on it. Midna sees the lock and places the key in hoping it will work. At this point Midna is excited, one, because it means she is the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, but mostly because she can access all the royal food storage rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna proceeds to unlock all the storage rooms. Each room is at least double the size of Link's house, and all are stocked full of fatty sweets super tempting to Midna, while Midna is drooling over all the food Link runs ahead to save the Princess.

She then decided the best way to multiply it would be to place it all into a Twili chest, (they hold as much as needed), and then multiply the chest creating another chest with the same amount of food as the original. The multiply device also holds a number off small crystals, each with a number on them, that number represents how many times an item is multiplied. She then opened one chest and tossed in a times 3 crystal, another grew back in it's place. The crystal then made the amount of food in the chest 3 times more. Midna used her hair hand to lift the chest up. Midna then opened her mouth wide and dumped all the food into her mouth, and without chewing, Midna began swallowing large amounts of food, and each time she swallowed her stomach expanded in size. And as a Twili she has the ability to choose when to digest her food. Midna is watching her belly grow, her eyes wide and mouth watering as she sees how big she is becoming, she has no real need for all this food, other than the fact that she enjoys being large. Midna continues to watch herself grow larger and larger as she swallows more and more food. After about and hour she swallows the last bite that was in the chest. Midna looks in almost disbelief over how large her stomach has become. Midna decides to see if she can still float at such a large size, discovering she can she believes there is no limit to her powers. Meanwhile Link had just defeated Puppet Zelda, Midna uses her powers to hide her large stomach. She arrives at the palace just as Ganondorf takes form of the dark beast, once fully formed Midna who already had a plan, used a spell to lock him into that form, Ganondorf charged as Midna dodged and he then teleported into the Twili realm, he set up multiple portals to come out of, Midna predicted he would choose the one behind Link, as he began to charge out Midna opened up a Twili chest trapping him inside. She then takes Link and herself inside the chest to defeat him. Once in the chest Midna reveal her gigantic belly. Link looks over at Midna in shock, and then focuses on beating Ganondorf. Midna charged Link's sword with the power to take down Ganondorf with one strike. Midna then tossed link into the air and then taunted Ganondorf causing him to charge, he came at Midna with all his speed and when he hit her stomach she giggled and then held him down with her hair hand, Link them came down and hit Ganondorf with a finishing blow. Ganondorf then laid there lifeless. Midna decide that she would use his body as extra food. As the chests can hold unlimited amounts, she and Link exited the chest and she tossed in an infinity crystal, causing his body to multiply infinitely. Her and Link then parted ways. Midna then returns to the Twili realm with all her chest to do some research. </span></div></div>",
