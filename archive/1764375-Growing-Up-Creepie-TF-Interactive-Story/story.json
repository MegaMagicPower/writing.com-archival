She hopped down from her bed, stretching her arms. She just couldn't put her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skittered down the halls, getting weird glances from her insect siblings. \"What are you guys LOOKING at?\" she said, furrowing her brow.

Her butt had grown out into  giant, bouncy abdomen, bigger than the rest of her entire body! \"Great... THIS is gonna be fun to carry around,\" she sneered. Even the slightest movement caused her new bug booty to jiggle around behind her. She wasn't sure how she hadn't noticed it beforehand, since it  bounced off the ground like a basketball with every step she took. She turned around, her big bug badonkadonk knocking the mirror down to the ground, shattering loudly. \"Uhhh.... oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CREEPIE?!\" Her mom stared in bewilderment. Huge abdomens were nothing new to the house, but Creepie was sporting the biggest she had ever seen!  \"Are..... are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mom, I feel GREAT,\" Creepie said, rolling her eyes, \"Just have a giant BUTT to carry around is all. OoOoOhhhh...\" she shivered. A gentle breeze blew against the back of her abdomen, where a giant, pink, puffy anus sat for all to see. It slowly puckered, open and shut, open and shut. It was the strangest feeling to her, one she hadn't felt before. Her eyelids shut, a goofy grin crossed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PFFFRRRRAAAPPT!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks turned a bright red. A thick, fog of smelly gas swirled around behind her. \"Uhh... heh, heh, excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh, Creepella!

She was definitely going to get some looks at school today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned as people stared at her tentacles as she walked by them, waving back to them with her slimy tentacles. She wasn't exactly sure WHY or HOW this happened to her, but she didn't really mind. Creepie was always pretty weird, she had no problem being a little weirder. When she finally reached her school, she saw Chris-Alice waiting for her. \"Heheh, this is gonna be good...\" she snickered, sneaking up on her from behind. \"Hey Chris-Alice,\" Creepie said, tapping her shoulder with one of her slimy tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Creep-AAAAGHHH!!! WHAT HAPPENED!?\" Chris-Alice shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like? Figured I'd do something different with my hair,\" the goth joked, gently caressing two of her appendages. The bell rang out. \"Guess it's time to show these babies off to the rest of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tentacles were only the FIRST of Creepie's strange mutation... </span></div></div>",

Just trying something new.\" Creepie spoke to her friend as calm as she normally speaks. Usually, Creepie's lifestyle doesn't panic Budge. After all, he was the only friend who knows the Goth was raised by insects rather than humans. \"Oh man, this is exactly like that movie: When Squids and People Merge.\" Budge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real life seems to be the perfect inspiration for horror movies, isn't it?\" Creepie said as she stroked her tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, class, take your seats.\" Dr. Pappas said as he walked, \"We have much to go over before....GOOD MOTHER OF GOD!!!\" he screamed as he glanced at Creepie's squid-like head. His reaction caused everyone except Creepie and Budge to scream! \"This is something I'd expect from a H.P. Lovecraft novel.\" Dr. Pappas whimpered as he cowered behind his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And good morning to you too, Dr. Pappas.\" Creepie joked. \"Miss. Creecher; might I suggest you go see the nurse?\" he said as he showed only his eyes. \"Why not? I could use a walk anyway.\" Creepie said as she walked out the door. Making her way to the nurse's office, she heard some tearing happening right below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants and shoes were soon destroyed as her legs became fatter. \"Mmm. This is weird.\" Creepie said, \"Then again, it fits since I have a squid head.\" As she watched her legs multiplied in size, she then noticed they fused together to become a giant limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.

Everyone ducked except for Creepie. Before she could move, the unstable concoction exploded into her face! Destroying her goggles, her eyes got a full blast of chemicals! The rest of her body was just as lucky. Her hands were covered in the nasty gas while some of it seeped into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Creecher!\" Dr. Pappas said, \"Budge, take her to the nurse's office at once!\" \"Right away, sir!\" Budge said. \"Oh man.\" Budge said as he lifted back Creepie, \"This is what I was talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her into the hallway, Budge heard Creepie say, \"I don't feel so good.\" Suddenly, she burped out loud!

She was a bit nervous about being in the house, but it was Creepie's home. There couldn't be anything dangerous, right? Creepie! Chris-Alice called. Hmm, now where could she be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wandered into what looked like a kitchen. She noticed a bowl sitting on a table. It was filled with an odd substance. The substance seemed like jelly, or jam, but was a greenish-blue color. What's this? Chris-Alice wondered. She stuck a finger into the stuff and brought it to her mouth for a taste. Normally, Chris-Alice would never have considered doing such a thing, but she hadn't had lunch yet and was getting a bit peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it was just one taste. She rationalized. I'm sure no one would mind.  The stuff was sweet, but not like jam or jelly. It tasted almost like honey. Just then, the girl heard a voice, Chris-Alice? Creepie walked in. What are you doing here? She said. Chris-Alice giggled, absentminded to herself. Oh, come on, silly. She said. You know we have a study sleepover today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that. Creepie replied. I meant why are you back here? I asked you to wait in the living room. Oh, I'm sorry. Chris-Alice said. I was just trying to find you. She giggled to herself again. Creepie arched an eyebrow, looking at the girl. Are...you feeling alright? She asked. I do seem to be a bit more giggly than usual today. Chris-Alice replied. But, don't worry, I'm fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh-kay. Creepie said. I'll just get some snacks for us and we can go straight to my room..l mean we can go up to my room and study. Okie-dokey. Chris-Alice replied. She sat down at the table and stared off into space. She seemed very odd today, but Creepie shrugged it off and started rummaging through the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nO.k. let's see. Creepie said. This should be enough to tide us over for a while, at least until... Creepie gasped as she turned around and nearly dropped the food she was holding. Chris-Alice was still sitting at the table, but something was definitely off about her. She...</span></div></div>",
