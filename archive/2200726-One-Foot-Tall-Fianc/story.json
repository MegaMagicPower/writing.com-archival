Part of me feels terrible about asking you to marry me before doing this but I just couldn't wait. I've never been more sure of anything in my life, now all that's left is getting the family's blessing and we can start talking about the wedding!\" You exclaimed up to your fianc\u00e9, taking a moment to stare at her gorgeous profile as she kept her eyes forward looking over the steering wheel. She smiled in return before responding,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope they like you as much as I do. My sisters I'm not worried about but my mom can occasionally come off a bit cold towards outsiders especially boys. I mean, you're the first boyfriend I've ever even shown to her and we're already engaged!\" You sensed a bit of worry in Cassie's voice and responded quickly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah there Cassie it's alright, I can charm the pants off of anyone, you know this! I mean I won over you didn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow look who seems so sure of himself!\" You got Cassie laughing and could hear the shift in her tone immediately as she continued, \"alright alright you little stud I believe you. I'm sure they're all going to love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded, \"You're damn right they will.\" in a fake arrogant tone before the two of you laughed at how macho you attempted to sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out you two were near the end of your long drive as Cassie turned onto a rather long driveway headed towards a large yet humble looking house. You climbed out of your seat onto the dashboard nimbly to get a better look and you noticed the house really was lovely. It wasn't a mansion by any means but it wasn't small either, sporting multiple rooms, two floors, a swimming pool and half of a basketball court around the back. Impressed you shot a look of overemphasized surprise to Cassie and she rolled her eyes at you in response. Parking her car near another one she quickly opened her driver's side door and stepped out of the car. You climbed down quickly following her. Even the jump from the floor of the car to the ground was significant for someone of your height, but you had learned over the years to be able to handle small feats of athleticism like this or else you would need assistance for far too much from others. Landing on the ground Cassie shot a look behind her and down, flashing you a gorgeous smile before walking to the rear door and opening it to remove both of your bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but stare at your beautiful fianc\u00e9 as she leaned into the car, her tanned legs extending far above your head before ending in a pair of jean shorts. From your perspective you could always see just the slightest bit of her ass sticking out the bottom, a sight that consistently drove you wild. Leaning back out and closing the door, Cassie tossed you your bag, covered in army print, and you caught it. Sadly at your size any clothing or accessories that were usable by you were more often than not made for large G.I. Joe toys, a fact that used to bother you but now you've grown accustomed to. Swinging it over your shoulder you trotted along side Cassie's long strides as the two of you headed towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the door mat now you began to feel the slightest bit nervous. Cassie had never had an issue for even a second with your height, but all of the sudden you began to stress over the possibility that it might not go as smoothly with the rest of her family. Before you had a chance to ask Cassie she reached out her hand and rung the doorbell. Immediately you heard footsteps slamming across hardwood floor getting closer and closer to the door. You couldn't help but get increasingly nervous, something in the back of your mind telling you that something was about to go terribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door swung open and you took half a second to appreciate the source of your fianc\u00e9's radiant beauty. Immediately after you shouted up, \"It's a pleas...\" your mouth was silenced as an enormous flip flop, nearly as big as your entire body cast a shadow over you for a split second before slamming down on you. The crushing weight of a woman quite a bit heavier than Cassie completely flattened your body, leaving only your head visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Cassie! It's so good to see you! Now where is that man of yours!?\" Pulling Cassie into a tight hug for nearly ten seconds, Kimberly Smalls thought she felt something peculiar under her foot but was far too caught up in the joy of seeing her daughter to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie pulled away from the hug, smiling and unaware of the torment you were feeling at that exact moment before peering downwards. Her eyes shot open in fear yet she saw your predicament, and as badly as she wanted to yell at her mother to lift her foot she also didn't want her first interaction with you to be one of panic and alarm. So calming herself down a bit she looked back up and nonchalantly said, \"Take a look beneath your left foot, mom.\" Cassie even added a smile to feign like nothing at all was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overbearing weight was suddenly removed from your form and you saw the faces of two beauties looking down upon you. Cassie's face portrayed a mixture of apologetic and \"we'll talk about this later\" while her mother's face expressed only shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. Goodness.\" Kimberly said, completely stunned at what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly five minutes later the three of you were sitting in the living room. Cassie and Kimberly were sitting in chairs while you were standing on a coffee table in between them. Kimberly was giving you a slightly uneasy look, as if she was analyzing every aspect of your being.  Cassie had helped you brush off the fair bit of dirt that transferred from the sole of her mom's flip flop onto your clothes, hair, and face, but you still didn't feel truly clean. You had actually put in a lot of effort to look as nice as possible to meet Cassie's family, and her mother had undone all of it with one step. It seemed your fears were coming true, but you were resolved to not let things continue to go this poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie, Maddie, come say hi to your sister and her new fianc\u00e9, Jake!\" Cassie's mom shouted up and you heard the familiar sound of footsteps coming down a hallway then downstairs towards you three. You then saw two more stunning girls round the corner heading straight towards you. One, who you assumed to be Sophie due to her blonde hair, was wearing an incredibly revealing swimsuit leaving nearly nothing to the imagination. The other, which must have been Maddie, had her hair up in a tight ponytail accompanied by a tight sports bra and compression shorts. While not as gorgeous as Cassie to you, all three of the other women in this house were certified stunners by any man's standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooooaaaaaahhhhh you're so little, dude! How in the world are you so short but so normal looking otherwise?\" Before introducing herself or anything Sophie asked the question you've answered millions of times in the most blunt way possible. As you prepped your answer, Maddie spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore my rude stupid sister, I'm Maddie that's Sophie, it's a pleasure to meet you, Jake.\" Your nerves eased up slightly, at the very least Maddie seemed to have a level head on her shoulders, something you appreciated greatly compared to the rigid gaze of Kimberly and the blank, stupefied smile of Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's no problem at all, I would be happy to answer any of your questions about my size honestly. It's almost always the first thing people notice about me so I'm used to it.\" You announced to the room. In reality you didn't enjoy talking much about your stature, because it usually lead to further demeaning questions from girls, but you knew you had to make a solid impression so you had to tough it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I have one,\" Kimberly said out loud, \"forgive me if this is rude but how exactly did you survive when I stepped on you at the front door? When I looked down and saw your tiny head peeking out from under my flip flop I expected the rest of your body to be nothing but a large stain when I lifted it up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah wait mom stepped on your entire body?! That's crazy!\" Sophie blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's vocabulary seemed downright bone chilling as she referred to you as tiny and a stain, but you shook it off and offered the most genuine response you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually my body is for some reason or another malleable! I can withstand many times my weight without suffering any serious injuries!\" You failed to mention in your response that it still hurt like hell to be crushed but you didn't want to linger on the subject more than you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting, how did you first discover this quality might I ask?\" Kimberly added, her mouth forming what appeared to be a masked smile as she anticipated your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh well I was 7 years old at the time. Up until that point in my life my family had been incredibly protective of me, keeping eyes on my safety at every second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*commence flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day you were helping your mom clean up some holiday decorations inside the house. By help you mean she would do almost everything and then occasionally float down pieces of colored tissue paper your family hung on the ceiling. You would collect these pieces of paper and carry them to a nearby bag of trash. Honestly it was all you capable of, standing at only around 6 inches tall at the time. Your mom was at the top of a ladder, reaching for something attached to the ceiling when her foot slipped... You had no time to react as her ass came plummeting down nearly ten feet straight towards you. *whump* she hit the ground with a meaty smack, immediately grabbing her lower back and ass in pain from the fall. The pressure on your body was immeasurable and honestly in that split second you assumed you were going to die as well, squished flat by your mom's own ass. But nearly a minute passed by until the pain subsided in your mom's butt enough for her to feel a tiny form compressed into her meaty cheek. At that moment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stood up in a snap and peered over her shoulder seeing you spread eagle across her right ass cheek, plastered face first into yoga-pants clad ass. Pure terror crept into her heart as she honestly believed she may have crushed the life out of her own son. Pinching your arm between her hands she peeled you off of her, but at that exact moment you groaned, \"Ughhhhh mom what just happened?\" A wave of relief washed over her as she clasped your body to her chest in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*end flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And from that moment on I knew I had something special about my body that prevented me from being hurt too badly!\" You finished your story to the group. Cassie had heard this story many times before but the other three had their mouths agape at your retelling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's good to know you aren't as fragile as you look, Jake.\" Kimberly responded. You could still feel the scrutiny in her voice but you could also tell at least ever so slightly that you had earned some respect in her eyes. Somehow this eased your mind slightly as you now knew that you had a chance at winning over your fianc\u00e9's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, \"Kimberly then announced, \"Cassie and Jake have driven a long way so we'll give you a rest from the Q&amp;A if you want to unwind a bit and unpack your stuff. I'm sure the girls have their own stuff they want to do as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Cassie now you thought about what you wanted to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the hand you somewhat wanted to take a nap with Cassie and relax. <br>\r\nOn another hand you were sure that Sophie or even the other two must have had more questions about your life/past/body that they wanted to ask. <br>\r\nAlso certainly each of Kimberly, Sophie, and Maddie had their own plans for the day and you figured it would be a great idea to see if you could either help them out or try to bond with them individually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at Cassie you two pondered your next move. Before you could make a decision, however, Kimberly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few chores I need to take care of myself so if you two need some time to unpack then go ahead. We may have an old shoe box that you can use for your clothes, Jake, or even as a bed if you desire.\" You were caught off guard, the other girls assumed this was a genuine suggestion from their matriarch but you knew even that was a dig at your stature. She then stood up and sashayed out of the room, her form straining the material of the sundress that she wore while simultaneously reminding you where your fiance got her looks from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after Sophie said, \"Well it was nice to meet you, I'll be by the pool if you want to hang out some more!\" before standing up and literally skipping out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we're all splitting up so I'm gonna go practice, good to meet you dude I'm looking forward to getting to know you better.\" Maddie said to you next before tightening her shoe laces and exiting the room as well. You felt good about your first encounters with each of her sisters, but Cassie's mom was a different story. Turning to Cassie you said up to her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp I'd say that went pretty well! Except for the whole getting squashed flat by your mom but hey all I need is a change of clothes and maybe a shower then it's like that never happened!\" You decided to ignore the somewhat cold tone of the interactions with Kimberly, knowing from your years with Cassie that their relationship was very important to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think it really did! And sorry about that, Jake, they just aren't used to someone of your size yet but don't worry they will be! Except for maybe Sophie, I'd say be careful around her when she's barreling through the house because she isn't exactly the most observant of us.\" Cassie continued, \"Now I'm pooped how about we unload our stuff and relax a bit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of getting time alone with Cassie sounded ideal as it always did to you, but you knew if you had a chance to win over her mom you would need to go the extra mile. So sadly you responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, do you mind taking my stuff to the room for me? I'm going to go see if your mom needs any help with those chores she was talking about?\" You said, feigning confidence but in reality sweating with nervousness at the prospect of being alone with Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really are the sweetest guy in the world, Jake. I'm sure she would love that. I'm gonna go take a nap for a bit then, feel  free to come join me if you finish helping out my mom\" Cassie said to you before concluding with a wink. Your heart skipped a beat again at the opportunity, but you steeled your focus and simply smiled back. Cassie then stood up and grabbed your tiny backpack as well as her stuff, walking out of the room. You took the moment to stare at her backside bouncing up and down in her jean shorts until she reached the top of the stairs and was out of eyesight. Now taking a deep breath, you hopped off the coffee table and landed on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the house you followed the path you saw Kimberly take, passing through a hallway and taking note of the multiple rooms you passed by. Cassie's family wasn't extravagantly wealthy by any means but the quality of this house wouldn't have suggested that. After a minute of walking you reached what appeared to be an office and saw Kimberly sitting at a desk. You took a few steps into the room before speaking up, \"Ahem, uhh excuse me Ms. Smalls?\" Kimberly turned her head from the computer in front of her and scanned the room before finding your one foot tall form on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Jake, hello... is Cassie with you?\" The tone of her voice seemed slightly ominous and you were almost hesitant to respond. Mustering up the courage you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no she's actually taking a nap, I was just coming to see if you needed any help with the chores you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly responded only by standing up and beginning to walk around her desk. Within a few steps you started to notice her stride was headed straight towards you, yet here eyes were on the entryway behind you. A few more steps passed by and eventually her right foot raised up, exposing you to the same sandal that pinned you effortlessly earlier. Absolutely shocked, your mind ran a million miles a sec, figuring that Kimberly must really hate you and was about to crush you once again. However, just as Kimberly planned it her foot merely hovered over your head for a brief second before moving past your body and landing on the ground behind you. As you breathed a sigh of relief she continued her gait towards the doorway you came in, reaching out with one hand and closing both you and her in the room. She then turned and stared straight at you. You had never been more nervous at any moment in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, I'm going to give it to you straight, alright? I don't dislike you... but I'm worried about how well you match up with my daughter. I mean you seem nice, you really do, but you need to prove to me that you are capable of taking care of my daughter if the need be.\" Kimberly's matter of fact way of speaking didn't assuage your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing your words carefully, you responded, \"I understand your concern, Miss Smalls, but I assure you that I am more than ready to take care of any of your daughter's needs!\" The confidence you forced yourself to put on with that response elicited a nod of approval at the very least from Kimberly before she continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear. I do suppose what you lack in physical stature you can make up for in other ways, yes? After all, being one foot tall and malleable, as you put it earlier, means you may have some unique uses. If you can prove this to me then I will surely give you my blessing to be with my daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conclusion Kimberly came to was disheartening for you to hear. Over the course of your life you had run into your fair share of people who wished to use your special qualities for their own gain. Each and every time you had been able to escape these people and distance yourself from them in order to avoid situations like this, but at this moment that wasn't an option. You couldn't simply tell Cassie about this dark side of her mother, either, as you knew she loved her family more than anything in the world and throwing a wrench in her relationships with them was something you would never do. You steeled your resolve and tried to look on the bright side of this fate. At the very least Kimberly didn't seem outright malicious or sadistic, as certain captors in your past had been, rather just very critical with high standards to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can certainly do. Whatever you or your family needs that I can provide I'll be on it in a heartbeat.\" Your response for the first time elicited a smile from your future mother in law, something you were rather proud of. Even if that smile seemed to show a feeling of victory in her as opposed to affection for you, a smile was a smile nonetheless and better than you had received thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear, Jake. Well for starters...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well for starters the internet keeps cutting out. You're a young guy you should be pretty good with computers, right?\" Kimberly asked you. You breathed a sigh of relief as your mind was spinning with possibilities as to what she was about to ask you. As far as favors go this essentially was as good as it could get for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I can fix that no sweat!\" You responded happily up to your future mother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, the modem and router are under my desk over there.\" Kimberly pointed to the workstation she was previously seated at when you walked in the room. Only then did you notice that this wasn't merely a table, but a large ornately crafted wooden desk. Taking a moment to admire the craftsmanship you noticed Kimberly begin to walk around to the other side, motioning with her hand for you to follow her. You jogged slightly to keep up with her walking pace and made it around the desk. From this side you could see that where were two large drawers with cabinets on the sides and one rather small opening for what you assumed to be Kimberly's legs as she worked. Kimberly continued, \"the modem and router are on a shelf on the back in there if you want to head in and start fixing it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped slightly as you looked at Kimberly's massive legs then back to the space you would be entering. For you the area was more than big enough to fit in, but you wondered how she even managed to work at that desk considering her quite tall and curvaceous stature. But you had no time to voice any questions as you saw Kimberly's face begin to appear impatient. Immediately you walked under the desk and surveyed your surroundings. The thick wood went from the floor to the ceiling, leaving not a single smidge of an opening other than where Kimberly's chair would go. On the back wall ahead of you you saw the equipment on a small shelf elevated off the ground and began analyzing them. Taking a quick glance backwards you saw Kimberly's toes absent-mindedly drum one after another in her flip flops, a terrifying sight to behold. Turning back you began to check out the router, looking at the display as well as the wires connecting to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly ten minutes had past and you had failed to see the light that indicated \"ethernet connection\" light up, frustrating you greatly. However as annoyed as you were it seemed Kimberly was even more so, as a few minutes before she had plopped her ass down in her desk chair and audibly groaned. Thankfully the chair was rolled away from the desk, but even seeing her massive lower body sat into it scared you in your current situation. At that moment you heard her phone begin to ring. *ring* *ring*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Kimberly said, picking up the phone. She listened for a moment before continuing, \"Sure, I can send you an email with the specifications right away.\" You couldn't tell by the tone of her voice whether this email was for business or pleasure, but either way you were uneasy about how she was going to send this email with no internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake? I hope you have room for some friends down there because I have to type up an email. I know my feet are as big as you are but just try to ignore them and keep working, I want the internet working by the time I have to hit send, got it?\" Kimberly said down to you, not even making the effort to bend down and look at you as she said this, she simply wheeled her chair forward toward the desk. You could hear the visible smile she had on her face without even seeing it, realizing that she must have been loving causing this uncomfortable situation for you. You looked back just in time to see her kick her dirty flip flops off before scooting the rest of the way in. The combination of her chair as well as her thick calves and thighs filled up nearly every inch of remaining space left behind you in the cutout area of the desk. Kimberly plopped each of her heels down on the ground behind you, holding her soles and toes up in the air facing you. You gulped, noting that Kimberly must have had some relatively large feet as her toes were nearly at the same height as your head was. Not wanting to show the tremendous discomfort you felt, you shouted back up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Ms. Smalls, there's plenty of room for me to keep working. I'll have this fixed in a jiff.\" You feigned confidence but the toes nearly touching your face as you said that were putting you on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, you really might be a useful little guy after all.\" Kimberly said with a smirk as she began typing away. You attempted to resume your work as well, unplugging and replugging various switches in hopes that something would finally click into place. A few more minutes passed by and you were beginning to feel quite hot and claustrophobic. While Kimberly had yet to actually make contact with your body with her feet, the fact that they were mere inches away from your entire body mean that you could feel the heat emanating from them. At that moment you made a fatal error, leaning backwards to wipe some sweat off your brow you felt your head smack softly into the underside of Kimberly's left big toe. Before you could even recover Kimberly seemed to seize the opportunity and began rubbing this toe all over your head, thoroughly messing up your hair and also seemingly transferring some of her foot sweat to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jake how did you know my foot itched in that exact spot!\" Kimberly said, clearly lying but not wanting to waste an opportunity to mess with you. \"I mean, you must have done that on purpose, right? I assume you did because you said you were willing to do, and I quote, whatever me or my family needs earlier. I assume that's still true or else you would be a bit of a liar, wouldn't you, Jake? And I certainly wouldn't want a liar as a son in law.\" Kimberly's manipulative wordplay absolutely crushed you. She had essentially locked in your role as a slave for her own use and you had to put up with it. As bad as this seemed, Cassie was and is the love of your life, and you would put up with anything if it meant staying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yep! All on purpose, I just had a feeling you could use a good scratch and I'm always here to help!\" You responded with a forced happy tone. Kimberly smiled deeply, entrenching you further in her trap as she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so wonderful, Jake. I hope you don't mind but the other foot itches as well.\" Kimberly lifted her right foot off the ground and rubbed it all up and down the right side of your body. Now with her left foot rubbing your head and her right foot rubbing your body, you felt overwhelmingly claustrophobic. The one thing you were grateful for was the fact that she had not yet applied enough pressure to squash you flat, rather content with only rubbing her sweaty soles all over you instead. You figured she really did want you to complete your task of fixing the internet connection, so despite the horrific circumstances you pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you fare with completing the rest of your favor?</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure at this point if it was your own or Kimberly's as your hair was slick with her sweat. You couldn't figure out why no connection was getting through as all the power and provider lights were showing green, only the ethernet node was a blank black. The pressure of the situation wasn't helping one bit, as not only were Kimberly's thick legs and large feet burning you up with their body heat, but her soles were constantly stroking you, knocking you to and fro between them like you were some kind of toy. Put these two things together and you had a real mess, a totally unproductive work space for you to operate under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly stifled her snickers above, genuinely surprised she had gotten you to agree to this much and relishing in the uncomfortable situation she was putting you through. Wanting to keep pushing  the envelope, and really enjoying the feeling your squishy body gave against her aching soles, Kimberly began pressing her soles closer together bit by bit. Feeling you take a step forward, Kimberly simply hovered her soles along with you, not wanting to miss out on your incredibly entertaining squirms as you attempted to wiggle your way away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get a closer look at the reset instructions, you nudged her big toe out of your face, thankfully giving you a chance to breath some air that wasn't directly from the underside of this mother's dirty foot. Feeling your rude push against her rubbing, Kimberly took this chance to scrunch your head with her toes, shouting down to you, \"Ohh I'm not <i>bothering </i>you am I, Jake? My feet are still kinda itchy and you just feel <i>sooo </i>good down there I can't help myself from scratching!\" She continuously began wiggling her toes playfully causing them to dance against your face dropping light pearls of sweat and dirt onto you. You gulped, wondering if this was some kind of punishing taunt for pushing her toe and decided you needed to double down on sucking up to her if you were going to get her to come around to considering you family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to imagine Cassie's motivating face as you managed to sputter out, \"Bothered? N-no way! I hardly even remembered you were there!\" Ironically, right as you said this a huge sweat droplet dribbled off her toe into your hair, which you were forced to ignore as you finished, \"Whatever feels good, keep doing!\"   You winced, cursing yourself for always going over the top when you didn't need to. Kimberly smirked overhead as she had essentially just been giving permission to have free reign with your body. \"Oooookay, if you insist, Jakey. Feel free to stop whenever you want; I'll only be a <i>little </i>disappointed in you if you fail but I'm sure that's whatever to you...\" Kimberly squeezed you between her soles gently as she emphasized 'little', giving you the message clear as day you'd never hear the end of it if you stopped now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fifteen minutes passed with you unable to work properly, Kimberly had essentially turned your head into a toe toy and your body had become some kind of sole scratching post. Realizing she was nearing the end of her email, Kimberly bit her lip as she glanced into the corner of her screen and saw her internet was still not up. Knowing she was mostly at fault for her problem at this point, Kimberly began searching around for her own solution. Seeing a small yellow wire laying limply against the table, Kimberly leaned forward, analyzing where it had fallen out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware what she was even doing, Kimberly clicked the small wire back into place, at the back of the desktop and to her surprise and enjoyment, she saw the internet symbol on her computer flip to it's 'connected' symbol! Your eyes had been squinted close, to prevent the onslaught of moist sweat from dripping into them, but you immediately made out the flashing green light for ethernet as it came to life before your face! You mentally cheered, almost crying tears of joy as you realized your torment in this hot and sweaty compartment was finally over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming your way out from between her still playing soles, you shouted out \"Looks like my work here is done! It really wasn't all that hard for a smart guy like me!\" before you headed towards the light marking the exit. Catching you easily, Kimberly simply extended her legs, pressing her right foot into you, squashing you between it and the hard wooden desk wall across from her. Leaning over to feign a glare at you, Kimberly stated, \"Oh no you don't. Not only did I have to fix this problem all on my own, but you just lied to me!\" You went deep red in embarrassment, stumbling over your words looking for a good excuse before Kimberly interrupted you continuing, \"I can't believe my daughter is engaged to a little liar! You promised me a favor, and I got nothing in return! What am I supposed to do with you now?\" Your heart dropped into your stomach as you felt you'd really gotten yourself into hot water now. Willing to do whatever it took to salvage this relationship, you cried out, \"I'm so sorry, Ms. Smalls! I'll do anything if it means you'll find it in your heart to forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly drummed her meaty toes against your face, clearly deep in thought about what she wanted to make you do now. Glancing down at her dirty flip flops, Kimberly briefly considered putting you to work on cleaning them. Seeing the dark imprint of her foot on the sole, she wondered if your tongue was just what was needed to scrub out the years of collected dirt and grime. Feeling you squirm against her foot however, Kimberly decided she wasn't quite done with using you in a more <i>hands-on</i> approach. Pretending to huff disappointedly Kimberly pressed you into her foot intimidatingly before speaking out, \"Alright, Jake. I'll give you another chance. I think my feet were so itchy because they were in deep need of some tender loving care and you might be just the right size to accomplish that. You think even you can handle that?\" You whimpered, nodding yes sheepishly before she smirked responding, \"Good. Now I'd better feel a few thousand kisses down there if you expect me to forgive you for lying to me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly scooted her chair back in, pressing her feet painfully into your body before opening up a new email to write. You nervously pressed your face forward against her crushing embrace, running your lips into the moist ball of her foot. You continued to pelt her sole with your kisses, unfortunately gagging as you felt a trace of her dank sweat leak it's way into your mouth. Kimberly kneaded her soles against you, feeling you squish like putty beneath her tired feet. Using you as some kind of foot stress toy, Kimberly decided she wanted to push you just a bit further. Seeing her gorgeous face once again slip beneath her desk into your view, you almost hallucinated she was Cassie before you snapped back into this painful reality. \"Ummm. yea that's cute and all, Jake, but those aren't exactly the types of <i>kisses </i>I meant.\" You swore you saw her wink at you before she swooped her head away back into the normal world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed for salvation as you let your tongue hang out before loosely running it into Kimberly's dripping sole. You swore you felt your tongue seize up as the salty, stinky residue coating her foot tainted your entire mouth in it's overwhelming power. Sighing in satisfaction, Kimberly belted out, \"That's more like it! It really is the least you could do for being so bad...\" You silently cried as she pressed her foot deeper into your face, causing your limp tongue to squish flat against her sole before she began swiping it up and down her foot. You pleaded with the gods for mercy as it donned on you that you had spent the entire time you had known Kimberly so far trying to act as sweet as possible, only for you to spend more time under her feet than talking with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching her other foot up to your face, and letting her previous foot mash against your waist, Kimberly eagerly teased her fresh sole along your mouth, eager to get her other foot in on this passionate make-out scene. All of this was of course happening simultaneously with Kimberly humming melodically while typing away at her desktop, and you wondered if anyone would ever think this totally kind and loving mother of three was simultaneously mashing a tiny man under her feet while she corresponded with them. You had resounding doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping you would score some kind of brownie points with Kimberly, you prayed hoping she would at least forgive you. You had spent less than three hours in the Smalls household and you cringed wondering how you'd survive another thirty days of this kind of servitude. Lapping away dutifully against Kimberly's dirty soles, you thought warmly of your slumbering fianc\u00e9e as she slept peacefully just a few rooms over; totally unaware the lengths you were going to in order to secure a foothold in her and her mother's hearts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you heard a *wooosh* as Kimberly hit send on her final email. Smearing you with a bit of finality into her smelly feet before teasing her toes along your face, Kimberly pushed herself out of the desk before deciding....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's what I like to hear, Jake. Well for starters I have something stuck deep in my boots and I just can't seem to get it out. You wouldn't mind helping me out would you?\" Kimberly said down to you. She leaned forward as she finished her sentence, almost blocking out the light coming from the lights in the ceiling. Kimberly's mannerisms combined with her incredibly tall stature and threatening confidence terrified you. As much as you wanted to say no to this task you knew that would only lead to more trouble. And as you thought back to how dirty the soles of her flip flops were earlier, you had a bad feeling about the boots that you would need to deal with now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat at all, Miss Smalls, I'm sure I can feel around there and pull out whatever has been bothering you!\" You attempted to feign both confidence and enthusiasm. Kimberly clearly didn't buy it but your agreement was good enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, stay here I'll go get it\" Kimberly said with a wicked smile. She exited the room, closing the door behind her before coming back momentarily with the aforementioned boot. For some reason when she mentioned this pair of footwear you first assumed it would be a simple pair of short boots that the average person would wear. However what you saw in her hands induced much more anxiety than you had before. The boots must have reached at least her knees, perhaps even her massive thighs, as the scuffed, worn brown leather seemed to go on for miles. Shutting the door once again and locking you two in her office, her flip flops slapped closer and closer to you as her right foot briefly hovered right where your body was. You gave out a scream, \"WAIT\" and dove out of the way as she stomped down in the exact moment you were a brief second before. Kimberly paused on that step and looked down to see your body lying flat on the ground, safe for the time being, but mere inches away from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I assumed you would have climbed up on the desk to wait for me at least. You know it's very dangerous for someone of your stature to simply stand around on the ground while us normal sized girls in the house are walking. You should be more careful next time.\" Kimberly didn't even attempt to sound apologetic as she criticized your position after nearly squashing you flat for the second time today. Before you could muster a response she dropped the boot down on the other side of you. Its sole stamped down into the floor roughly and she grabbed the leather at the top, holding the boot up to its maximum height. It towered over your one foot tall frame, dwarfing you by over double your height. Your ego took a hit to see how much taller this boot was than you, but once again Kimberly spoke before you could even have a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you ready? I figured I could just hold you by your legs and lower you in while you grab whatever is in there. It's somewhere near the toes of the insole.\" Kimberly lined out your tasks as if she was simply asking you to do a simple task like take out the trash, not even pretending to care that she was asking you to go cave spelunking in her massive, clearly worn out boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I guess that makes sen...\" you were cut off as Kimberly bent over, flashing you the briefest view of her cleavage before grabbing both of your feet together in one massive hand. Immediately you felt your world turn upside down as she swung you into the air and hovered you over the boot opening like some sort of portal to hell. Without saying another word, Kimberly lowered your body into her shoe as carelessly as one would lower a plunger into a toilet. Sadly at this point you felt like you were nothing more than a tool to your (hopefully) future mother-in-law and you were too worried about winning her approval to say otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon entering the boot you felt the warmth of its leather walls emanating powerfully. And as you were lowered deeper and deeper it only continued to heat up. Even worse, along with the heat came an awful odor coming up from the depths. It smelled like the natural nice scent of the shoe's leather was actively battling against years of built up foot sweat, and the leather was losing badly. As you got lower and lower the space you were filling got tighter as well. Even though you were incredibly small by normal human standards, you were still big enough to feel cramped being shoved into a woman's boot. Luckily, or you might say unluckily, thanks to the myriad of previous situations in your life similar to this you had overcome any feelings of claustrophobia from these tight spaces. A second later you felt your head hit the bottom, a slight warm and damp insole that had clearly seen years of use. You paused momentarily before Kimberly began to shimmy your body now forwards into the toe section of the shoe. At this point the smell was practically unbearable, and almost all of the light had been blocked out as well. You couldn't believe that she would ask you to do something like this, but there was no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't smell bad, Jake. I was just wearing them for hours before you and Cassie arrived. I probably should have told you that beforehand but I'm sure you don't mind.\" Kimberly said, then continued, \"Just tell me when you're deep enough in and I'll stop pushing.\" In reality you could barely hear her voice, and she couldn't hear yours at all. The thick walls of leather muffled any sound you attempted to make. As your head hit the toe end of the shoe you felt Kimberly continue to press your legs forward. With nowhere else to go your body's squishy characteristics started to kick in and you already start to feel yourself become compressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this rate Kimberly was going to just squash you flat into the front end of her boot and you would be incapable of even completing your task. You could only pray that this wouldn't happen as the only thing you feared more than being in this dank, sweaty cave of a boot was failing to complete Kimberly's task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why don't you have a seat at my desk?\" Kimberly sauntered past you, pulling out her swiveling desk chair by grabbing it from the top, gesturing with her hand for you to get on. You grimaced as you hopped on, feeling the rough plastic underneath the seemingly absent stuffing harshly press back against you. \"See the problem?\" Kimberly asked bluntly, her massive chest hanging just over your head as she peered down at you. You nodded meekly, anything but enthusiastic about where this seemed to be going. \"You want me to b-buy you a new chair?\" you feebly muttered out only eliciting a disregarding eye roll from Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years of being the family computer chair have really <i>flattened </i>out any comfort it used to provide...\" Kimberly mused. Looking down at the surface of the chair, it really did seem like it had seen some rough days. The chair was lined in some kind of faux tan leather, which you mentally took note had a striking match with your own complexion, that had minor rips and scuffs sprawled over it. Not to mention a deep, unmissable imprint where the Small family girls had been sitting over the years. \"To be a good husband, you're going to need to be able to <i>comfort </i>my daughter through thick and thin. Is someone of your stature really capable of doing that for my little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a nervous bead of sweat roll down your forehead. You stammered out, \"Well y-yes, but what did you really have in mind?\". Kimberly simply explained, \"I have some reports that I need to finish within the next couple hours.\" she leaned in close to your face to finish her request, her hot breath suffocating you as she concluded, \"Do you think I could...<i>sit in your lap</i> while I finish them? You know, to see if you're a good fit for my daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously laughing, you tried to play off Kimberly's request as some kind of funny joke, \"Very funny, Ms. Smalls! You really had me going...heh...heh\" Kimberly's smile changed to a stern glare as she raised her tone looking down at you, \"You did say you wanted to help, didn't you Jake? Backing out now really is a sign you lack any integrity!\" Kim huffed, turning up her nose at you, making your heart sink as you felt your chance to prove yourself slipping away. Trying your best to act compliant, you faked a smile and said, \"Oh, you were serious? In that case, I'm more than happy to do <i>anything </i>to make you or your daughter's a bit more comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot needing to hear 'yes' twice, Kimberly walked in front of the chair, letting out a nonchalant \"Thanks, Jake\" before lifting her sundress up preparing to sit. Your vision was blocked out by the sight of her massive curvy ass as her shadow overtook you, only giving you a second to see her practically painted on tan panties before they met with your body, rolling over you painfully. You peered up along her back, seeing her long brown hair draped over her shoulders as she swung her head to look back at you. \"Comfortable?\" Kimberly asked mockingly testing what she could get away with doing to you. Your head still poking out from her crack, you managed to squeeze out, \"Feeling...great!\" from your crushed lungs before she turned her gaze away to her computer. Truthfully, you might be able to make it through this so long as Kimberly didn't antagonize you any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to hear that; In that case, I'll get started.\" Kimberly grabbed the base of the seat in her hand, scooting in forward as she settled in properly to begin her work. With that simple movement, her monolithic butt steam rolled over you, finally claiming your head which immediately flattened under the considerable mass. Shimmying her hips back and forth atop you, Kimberly mumbled out pleasurably, \"Not bad...at the very least it's a decent improvement,\" before she began typing away on the family desktop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's tiny act of getting comfy proved to be hell for you, as you were smeared left and right across the butt pad of the desk chair. You cursed silently for jinxing yourself before you were hit with the realization you had been slathered into an unrecognizable glob of tan goop under this giantess's  impressive booty. You let out a whimper, realizing you had passed up on cuddling with your gorgeous, kind-hearted fianc\u00e9e, to serve as a seat cushion for her uncaring, ungrateful mother. This whimper seemed to bother Kimberly who raised and lowered her rear forcefully down onto your face before barking out, \"Please don't interrupt me while I'm working, Jake. These are <b>very </b>important documents I'm handling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized any attempts to get out of this from now on would only be met with more painful crushing, and resigned yourself to the service of Kimberly. She took notice of your silence and grinded atop you playfully before saying, \"That's much better; keep this type of behavior up during your stay and I'm sure you'll make a useful--I mean, a fine addition to the family!\" Laughing at her minor Freudian slip, Kimberly clacked away on her keyboard, paying no more mind to her butt toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the pain of being flattened beneath a titanic booty was the worst, but breathing quickly became another problem. Feeling your face completely pressed against Kimberly's backside, you were only able to take shallow breaths filtered against her panties in order to prevent from suffocating. Imagine breathing through a pillow, and that was pretty close. The grime that coated the family chair didn't help either, probably having absorbed gallons of the Small's sweat whenever they used the computer. You tried to imagine the smell was coming from your goddess, Cassie, but that only brought back sad memories of her accidentally crushing you before apologizing profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you thought you had a suitable breathing pattern going, Kimberly's body flung you a curveball about an hour in as her skin became slick with sweat, super heated against the hot leather. Feeling her thighs beginning to stick to the faux leather, Kimberly stood up, wincing at the feeling of her flesh peeling away from the chair. Sticking her tongue out at the gross feeling, Kimberly peered back at you, seeing your squashed body only taking up the very center of the cushion, where her crack had been. Crudely grabbing you up in her grip, Kimberly began stretching you out into a wider rectangle before draping you over the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a sliver of your mouth operable, you groaned out, \"Umm, Miss Smalls? Do you think I could take some kind of break?\" Squatting down, Kimberly hovered her face right over you dauntingly before booming out, \"A break? Don't tell me you want to quit when we're already half way done?! What are you some kind of lowlife quitter? And to think I was just beginning to come around to you...\" Kimberly crossed her arms disapprovingly before turning her back to you, only allowing you to look up at her rear from below her dress. Figuring you had come this far already, and not wanting to let all this effort go to waste, you doubled down saying, \"Who me? I was just joking! I'm happy to handle whatever you can dish out; it's nothing for a superman like me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning as her trap had worked, Kimberly didn't even address your boast as she plopped back down into the chair below. Her wide hips easily coated the whole chair, and you, in her jiggly flesh, even having a small curve of it spill over. Enjoying your smooth body coating her thighs and butt instead of sticky leather, Kimberly couldn't help but think, 'God I probably should've done this from the start...' as she slid back into place over you. Unfortunately, this new widened form meant you had to dutifully absorb every droplet of sweat that ran down Kimberly's thighs and back before splashing onto you. Kimberly took note of this, savoring feeling how her panties stayed drier than they normally became while she sat for hours in her office. Being stretched so wide also had another unintended side effect, pulling your mouth wide open. This gave a whole new degree of...interactivity with your role, as you now had the misfortune of tasting the bottom's of Kimberly's thighs, ass, and panties. You wanted to cry out for mercy, but remembered that would only be met with a rough grinding of her ass onto you, and you restrained yourself, not wanting to experience that sensation with your <i>mouth</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought an eternity had passed, and honestly Kimberly was finally finishing up with her reports, only for her to feel a deep pressure brewing in her gut. Seeing this as just another casual opportunity to test your devotion to her, Kimberly allowed herself to blow one out onto you. Practically shaking the chair and certainly causing some jiggles to ripple through her behind; you took the impact full force. Gagging against the harsh smell, you couldn't help but tremble underneath Kimberly as you gasped for any kind of fresh air. Still typing, Kimberly merely shouted down, \"I thought I said stay quiet!\" before she accidentally let loose on you again. Feeling a minor tickle of regret, Kimberly considered getting up. That was until she saw the clock and realized her deadline was fast approaching. Content with putting you out of her mind, Kimberly simply sighed as she picked up the pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the reports ended up taking twice your original promised time to complete, something Kimberly had suspected from the start. You lay a squishy mess beneath Kimberly as she hit send before tossing her hands behind her head in satisfaction. \"Well that's a wrap, Jake. Good job today, I look forward to working with you again <i>real </i>soon!\" You lay motionless beneath her, completely conditioned to stay silent under her plump buns as she raised an eyebrow thinking, 'What is he, asleep? Or maybe the poor guy passed out...' Snickering and feeling her guilty pleasure overwhelm her remorse, Kimberly finally arose before walking out of the computer room, swaying her hips sensually as she left, flicking the light off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were battered, beaten, and still coated in a sheen of sweat from Kimberly\u2019s ass as the curvaceous giantess stood from the chair and walked away. You heard her talk aloud about you having passed out, and you tried your hardest to speak up and call out to her, but you were quite thoroughly smashed flat, and hadn\u2019t yet reformed your mouth. You could only watch as she sauntered out of the room, leaving you behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still weren\u2019t entirely sure exactly what the past few hours had been all about. You were more than eager to prove yourself to Kimberly, but how did suffering under her heavy rear end benefit your relationship in any way. Was she testing your determination, your durability? Also, why hadn\u2019t she peeled you free from the chair when she left. Was this still a test? You didn\u2019t have a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why, five minutes later, you heard the door opening and instantly assumed it was Kimberly coming back to get you. You hadn\u2019t made a dent in reforming yet, still not much more than a thin rectangular form glued to the chair\u2019s cushion. Your comically widened face was pulled into a shocked expression, though your human features were starting to smear and fade a bit. Hopefully Kimberly was able to pick your body off easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart shattered into a million pieces when a towering form walked into your view after a moment, and it was decidedly not Kimberly. Smooth pale skin, shining blonde hair, and curvy but much less thick than her mother, Sophie strolled in front of you. You caught the briefest look at the eager smile on her face, and your blood ran cold as her innocent face turned away, eyes not once looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling in front of the chair, Sophie\u2019s bikini-clad bubble butt jiggled a bit as she stopped moving and turned the computer back on. For a second that lasted an eternity she stood above you, the shadow her body cast washing over you. With every fiber of your being you mentally screamed at yourself to reform, and right as your lips twitched just a bit, Sophie sat down with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt pounded into you, smashing your almost reformed lips back down, and totally burying you beneath her. Her adorably revealing bikini left most of her ass bare, and you felt the brunt of her whole weight squeezing into your full body. Kimberly had reduced you to nothing more than a sticker, and Sophie continuing the torment was even more flattening you out. You couldn\u2019t even dream of squirming or twitching with the giggly blonde on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie immediately worsened everything by wiggling her butt as she sat down, rubbing her ass back and forth into the chair, squashing you further down into the cushion of the seat. Her soft, supple flesh spread out across the chair, and then Sophie proceeded to demonstrate her flexibility by pulling up her legs and sitting with her feet tucked under her knees, crisscross style. This put all her weight centered and straight down onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly the temperature seemingly rose by twenty degrees, and the sweat you\u2019d accumulated from the hours under Kimberly reappeared, along with a fresh new coating from Sophie\u2019s own skin. Fresh air evaporated in less than a minute, and trapped in the sweltering darkness, you fought to hold onto your consciousness, knowing if you passed out you\u2019d truly miss any slight chance to get noticed and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly oblivious and happy as could be, Sophie finished starting up the computer and opened up a wed browser, logging into her new favorite game. Her own computer in her room was downloading some big updates, so she\u2019d asked Kimberly is she could borrow the family computer for a few hours. Though she normally only played relaxing and peaceful games, a good friend of hers had just got her hooked on her first RPG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer file loaded up, and Sophie found herself looking at her player avatar, an attractive elf girl who wore the prettiest dresses Sophie could find in town shops, and slayed orcs and goblins with her starlight bow and arrows. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s youngest sister grinned eagerly as she began marching her little elf avatar out of the town and into the woods to hunt some monsters for a troubled townsperson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thirty minutes hidden away under Sophie\u2019s derriere was far from enjoyable, but not as bad as it could\u2019ve been. The heat was hard to bear, sweat soon soaked you to the bone, and a faint stench was building. However, the worst was yet to come, as Sophie encountered a surprise monster boss in the woods, and let out a startled yelp, jumping in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde\u2019s bodacious booty lifted three inches into the air, granting you a split-second release of light and fresh air before gravity took hold. Slamming down hard, her butt slapped against the chair and jiggled as it impacted, her hot flesh dancing across your body as it rippled. The impact was like a meteor, knocking the metaphorical wind out of your stretched and mangled body. Somehow, though you hadn\u2019t thought it possible, you felt yourself being ironed out even more into the chair cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie just barely managed to fight off the boss, and each time it hit her she let out an adorable shriek. Her cute cries of terror fell on deaf ears, as all noises and words were muffled and distorted beyond recognize. What you did notice quite acutely were the shakes and quivers that accompanied the shrieks, Sophie literally reacting to each hit by wiggling her rump in her chair, grinding back and forth across you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her ass flesh steamrolled over your face time and time again, you could feel your squishy body being scraped away, your visible human features deteriorating into an unrecognizable tan blur. Unaware of what she was doing, each of Sophie\u2019s reactionary movements smeared you away beneath her, your body gluing itself to the chair and slowly losing its recognizable shape. All the energetic giantess did was keep on grinning and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, the door to the room swung open again, and your fianc\u00e9e walked in. Cassie was a bit winded, and as her eyes nervously scanned the room, she eventually caught Sophie\u2019s attention. Pausing her game, the younger girl eyed her older sister inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Cass? Like, do you need something?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \u201cNo, Soph. Well, sorta. Mom said Jake was in here helping her with something, but then he ran off. She said she couldn\u2019t find him again.\u201d Cassie blushed faintly. \u201cOn instinct, I checked if she\u2019d sat on him or something, but she was clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh!\u201d Sophie exclaimed, hand to her mouth. \u201cI can help you look, then! I\u2019d hate for something to happen to the poor little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie waved her sister off. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, really. I\u2019ll check for him for a minute or two, but I bet he\u2019s in the bathroom or outside with Maddie. Maybe my mom just didn\u2019t see him leave.\u201d She walked closer, and Sophie moved to stand, her sweaty booty peeling off the chair an inch. \u201cNah, Soph, you can stay seated. If he\u2019s not stuck to mom\u2019s butt, he wasn\u2019t on her chair. I mean, she\u2019d notice if he was, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie shrugged. \u201cHee hee. Guess that makes sense.\u201d She giggled, then settled back into her chair, her ass consuming you entirely once more. Through a blurry and mangled eye, you saw the top of Cassie\u2019s head for one moment, but she wasn\u2019t looking at you at all. In fact, Cassie wasn\u2019t looking anywhere near the chair, already deciding you couldn\u2019t be there. Even if she had checked, you were fully enveloped beneath Sophie\u2019s sizable butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s search was obviously fruitless, and she left after five minutes. Sophie resumed gaming as happily as before, still grinding her butt constantly and jumping up and down in her seat in excitement and surprise. You felt your gummy-like body pound into the fibers of the chair cushion\u2019s fabric, your body being engrained into the entire cushion like a thin, nearly undetectable covering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo and a half long hours passed before Maddie called Sophie down to dinner. Answering with a heavenly smile and cheery voice, Sophie logged out of her game and shut down the computer, through living in a fantasy world for the day. Hopping out of her chair, the bouncy girl barely paid heed to the moist sweat she left behind, nor the trace of stench, nor the butt-shaped imprint. She merely skipped out of the room and headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft behind again, you weakly tried to focus your exhausted and rattled mind, hoping to reform. With horror, you felt your body simply refuse to budge, no part of you compiling in your efforts to reform. The cushion of the seat felt uncomfortably connected with your own body, as if you had bonded to it from the sweat and crushing pressure Kimberly and Sophie had inflicted in tandem. Were you truly just a part of the cushion now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept fighting to reform for the next two hours. You made not a single bit of progress, and came to the unsettling understanding that you may be permanently stuck without Cassie or one of her family members helping to pry you free. Alone in the dark room, you were on the verge of crying in despair before the door opened, the lights flicked on, and Cassie walked into your field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly had asked her to grab the well-worn chair cushion and run it through the wash, so Cassie had dutifully replied. Now that she was here doing it, she grimaced a bit at the dried sweat coating the cushion, and the slight smell. Scrunching up her face, Cassie lifted the cushion, and her warm fingers pressed into your body lightly. As you rose up to her face, you internally screamed out to her, begging her to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she looked you right in the eye, and frowned, opening her mouth to speak. Your heart leapt for joy at being discovered! Because, of course, you had been discovered, right? You had to still be mostly visible, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cassie say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow! Sophie did a number to this, huh? Better wash it real good!\u201d Cassie declared with a wry smile on her face. Not a trace of recognition shone in her brilliant eyes, nor did Cassie spare you a second look as she tucked the cushion under her arm. Your body was pressed into her stomach as she strolled from the room, wholly oblivious to just how close she was to her poor, squashed fianc\u00e9. Still flattened and crushed, you couldn\u2019t call out to her no matter how hard you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bounced up and down as Cassie descended the stairs and headed for the washroom. She passed the rest of her family along the way, and each Smalls woman was totally unaware of who Cassie was escorting to the washing machine. Sophie just sat on her chair giggling at her social media feed, the picture of perfect innocence and joy. Never in a million years would she, on her own, guess what she had done to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the washroom, Cassie flipped open the lid to the washing machine and dropped the cushion in. It landed flat, with you facing outward and up, allowing you a few more fleeting seconds to gaze up at your beloved giantess fianc\u00e9e and beg her to notice you. Sadly, Sophie\u2019s ass had smeared you a good deal into the cushion, obscuring your recognizable features, which resulted in you failing to stand out to Cassie during her quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you could only watch your fianc\u00e9e turn on the freezing water, pour in some detergent, then slam the lid shut. Soon, only the roaring of the water and the rumbling of the spinning bin filled your senses, and quickly you and the entire cushion were submerged and lost in the churning sea of the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for some inexplicable reason, fate was shining down on you that day, as only a minute into the wash, your face caught on a miniscule, sharp protrusion in the side of the bin. Presumably some chip in the metallic surface, it dug into your squishy chest like a knife, generating excruciating pain. At the same time, the metal chip digging into your body held you in place, even while the spinning bin and rushing waters pushed the cushion along its rotation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, your body, unable to be in two places at once, was ripped cleanly (albeit painfully) from the cushion, freeing you from the imprisonment Sophie\u2019s bubble butt had forced upon you. With less holding you down, you too popped free from the clutches of the metallic, jagged point, and started blowing around in the water like a little weightless feather helplessly adrift. Still, it beat being glued to the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could truly celebrate, however, the spinning bin slowed down as the lid to the washing machine was opened once more. Under the water, you couldn\u2019t hear or see anything, but up above, Cassie had an armful of sweaty workout clothes, courtesy of Maddie, who had recently finished an intense exercise routine out in the yard. Seeing as how the wash was already going, she\u2019d asked Cassie to add her stuff in with the cushion, and Cassie graciously obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompression shorts, panties, a sports bra, and socks splashed down into the bin, which Cassie then closed again. The bin picked up its speed of rotation and water flow once more, and soon your body was smacking and crashing against the wet fabric of Maddie\u2019s clothes at a breakneck pace. Each impact slightly squished you into whatever you hit, before the flow of water inevitably pulled you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the washing finally subsided and Cassie returned once more, you had just been thrown into an impact against the pair of blazing red panties Maddie had apparently been wearing while exercising. You splatted into the back of the panties, near the middle-left, facing out. While tumbling aimlessly around the bin, you\u2019d partially reformed, and now mostly resembled your old self, albeit cartoonishly squashed into a spread-eagle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting out the panties, Cassie unfortunately held them away from her, and was thusly unable to see you once more. She merely tossed them into the dryer along with everything else from the wash. Starting up the drying cycle, you and the rest of the wet clothes, along with the seat cushion, started to be blasted by hot air and tumbled about. The entire process lasted another hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dryer wound down, you noticed with no small amount of worry that you were still quite stuck to the panties. You hadn\u2019t reformed in the slightest, and in fact felt even more glued to the fabric. Every attempt to so much as twitch was futile, and you were similarly incapable of speaking. All you could do was shift your eyes from side-to-side, and just barely managed to blink. You could only hope that was enough to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, fate was apparently finished throwing you a bone, as it wasn\u2019t Cassie who opened the dryer, but Kimberly. The older woman grabbed the panties you were stuck to, along with the other clothes, and brought you out into the light of the washroom. She folded and laid the sports bra, compression shorts, and socks in a basket filled with other similar articles of clothing, clearly destined for Maddie\u2019s room. For some reason though, she kept you in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purpose dawned on you a second later, and you began internally screaming. Against the wall of the washroom, Kimberly had set up an ironing board, where a red-hot iron was already plugged in and heating up. You fought with every last ounce of your strength, even as Kimberly laid the panties out on the ironing board, with you facing up at her towering figure above you. You blinked furiously, and shifted your eyes around so much it\u2019d be comical in a less dire situation.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your utter amazement, Kimberly\u2019s gaze shifted to you, and she paused in reaching for the iron. Her mouth quirked to the side, then deepened into a frown. You didn\u2019t stop blinking as she traced a smooth finger across your body, her eyes slowly widening at your cartoonish appearance, looking for all the world like a sticker on the bright red panties in the shape of a flattened man\u2026which was exactly what you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, recognition shone in Kimberly\u2019s eyes, and her jaw dropped open for one short second, before she quickly clamped it shut. A sense of foreboding hung in the air for a few agonizing seconds, before Kimberly\u2019s alluring lips curled into a soft but devious smile. Mischief danced in her eyes, along with something else. Satisfaction? You couldn\u2019t tell from your position, and could only wonder when she\u2019d actually start prying you free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour horror and surprise as immeasurable as Kimberly merely picked up the iron and spoke aloud. \u201cHm\u2026it sure does get tiring having to constantly iron these panties for Maddie.\u201d Kimberly sighed theatrically. \u201cSomething about them being special order and made for elasticity and comfort while exercising? Who knows?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leaned down over you, her massive body casting a shadow over your whole being. \u201cStill, I never noticed this cute little design before. Like a little cartoon guy!\u201d Kimberly laughed lightly, but a hint of darker intentions shone through. \u201cBetter iron these panties nice and good this time, wouldn\u2019t want that design fading, or tearing off the fabric. That\u2019d be heartbreaking. These are Maddie\u2019s favorite panties after all, and she wears them twice a week or more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kimberly pulled the iron over your body, and the last thing you saw before it filled your whole vision was a smirk on the gargantuan woman\u2019s face. Hadn\u2019t she seen you? She\u2019d seen you, right? This wasn\u2019t a cruel, intentional act, right? Still blinking and looking around like a deranged person, you tried to rip and tear at the bonds that held you flat, but it was no use. The iron descended, unimpeded, until at last it touched down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became apparent that you had never experienced true pain before this moment. No words on earth could describe the feeling of the boiling iron slamming down onto your body. Your shrill but depressingly silent cries rang out, even as tears formed in your eyes and instantly evaporated. The iron hissed and burned, steam springing out from the sides and singing every inch of your exposed body. It was a blessing that you passed out from the torment of it all, face still locked in a terrified expression and eyes wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly dutifully steamed every last fiber of the panties, front and back, with the iron. She made sure to press hard and thoroughly apply pressure all across the panties, particularly that little \u201cdesign\u201d she\u2019d noted. She could hardly keep her smile off her face, even as her mind wondered if perhaps, she was taking things too far. No\u2026no. These were all just tests, challenges for a clearly ill-fit squishy man. If he dealt with them, great. If not\u2026she wouldn\u2019t be particularly bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the iron away after ten minutes, Kimberly rubbed some sweat off her brow and beheld her handiwork. The panties hardly looked different, but rubbing her fingers on them revealed the heavenly soft fabric and delicate but supportive stretchiness that Maddie had lauded when she first bought them. Kimberly was almost a little envious at just how divine they felt to the touch, but knew she\u2019d need to order her own if she wanted a pair that would fit her hefty rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little \u201cdesign\u201d was perfect too, and her plan had worked flawlessly. Pressing her palm down on the flattened man was just as smooth and soft as the rest of the panties. He felt no different from the fabric around him, like he belonged there. She was unable to smear or smudge his face or body, nor pick him off with her fingernails. She\u2019d essentially burned the design in place, fusing it to the fabric. If she was lucky, she thought with a smile, it\u2019d be permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting away the iron and ironing board, Kimberly folded up the panties, consciously leaving the design facing out, and placed them in the basket destined for Maddie\u2019s room. She then left the room, and alerted her daughter\u2019s that they each had clothes to pick up from the washroom. With that finished, she settled into her favorite chair and turned on a good movie, letting out a deep sigh. She felt really, really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maddie was the first to enter the washroom, and she walked right over to her clothes basket. Her eyes instantly fell on you, and she frowned slightly. Leaning down, she peered closely at your engrained body, rubbing her finger across your face and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this exact time was when you finally woke up from your bout of unconsciousness. The bright lights stunned you, and you realized you couldn\u2019t blink away the blurriness. Your eyes were frozen in a wide-open state, and your mouth was similarly frozen in a gasp of shock. In fact, you couldn\u2019t move any part of your body. You could barely even feel your body, and as you tried to reform, it was as if a heavy load was weighing down on you. Some invisible bonds keeping you from twitching, speaking, or reforming in the slightest. All the memories of Kimberly ironing you into the panties flooded back into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Maddie delicately touched your eyes and stomach. \u201cHuh. I\u2019ve been wearing these for a month, and never noticed this funky design?\u201d The brown-haired giantess smirked and laughed. \u201cGeez, I really do get zoned out.\u201d She ran her fingers along the edges of your body. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s totally not a sticker either. Weird. But it\u2019s cute, I guess. Kinda funny!\u201d She laughed, and stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHosting her basket up, Maddie strolled from the washroom and towards her bedroom. You mentally begged and pleaded with the girl to look closer, to notice that it was you and not a design, but it was obviously no use. You couldn\u2019t even fully blame her either. You\u2019d only just met her this day, and had hardly interacted with her. On top of that, because of Kimberly\u2019s actions, you really were fused to the fabric of the panties, and felt just as smooth and soft. It\u2019d be nearly impossible to know you weren\u2019t just a design from her perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her bedroom, Maddie sorted all of her clothes into their proper places, ending with the panties you\u2019d been ironed into. With another short laugh at the silly design on the back of her panties, Maddie tucked you into a drawer filled with the rest of her lingerie, then slid the door closed, locking you away in darkness. You could barely hear her leave the room, too preoccupied with trying to reform, not yet realizing how useless it was. Without outside help, your chances of escape were practically incalculable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed by, and the evening turned to night, which turned to morning. You slept fitfully, your panty prison infuriatingly comfortable, but your mind too panicked to fully relax. Only the sound of footsteps dragged your attention out of a deep depression, and you soon felt the underwear drawer being pulled back, and light shining in.</span></div></div>",

She thought he was still affixed to the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to do anything to separate yourself from Kimberly\u2019s panties, but being crushed as long as you had been made movement impossible. To make matters worse, your skin tone was the exact same tan as her panties. With you being squashed face first, it was not very likely that anyone would be able to tell that there was anything extra on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie, your fianc\u00e9 was trying to help me in the office but after pulling my chair out I lost sight of him. Is he out here with you?\u201d Kimberly asked her daughter, trying her best to hide her smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd, he never just disappears unless...\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice trailed off as she suddenly put the situation together. \u201cMom you must have accidentally sat on him!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie ran to the office to look for you as Kimberly chuckled and continued upstairs. She felt like having a shower after sweating so much in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still trying desperately to move and separate yourself from this woman\u2019s gigantic ass. Every step she took pulled your body one way and then the next step pulled it the other way. Any progress you had made while she stopped to talk to your girlfriend had been undone. You may have to wait until she stopped moving or takes the panties off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kimberly makes it to her bedroom and starts getting clothes ready for her shower. She takes out a bra, tank top, socks, and yoga pants. Then she stops to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got out this pair of panties this morning. I really haven\u2019t got a full use of them yet...\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cMaybe I should just reuse this pair.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I, um, I think he might be stuck to you.\u201d Cassie stammered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly has a small smile for a second but quickly turned it into a look of contemplation. \u201cAre you sure dear? Why would he be stuck to me surely I would feel that right?\u201d  Kimberly asked her daughter. At the same time she reached a hand back to rub her butt just to see if she could feel you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it has happened with me before, um not often but a few times. I have usually found him stuck to my panties when I take them off for a shower\u201d Cassie said with some embarrassment. \u201cWould you mind if I checked Mom?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly raised an eyebrow. \u201cI think I am perfectly capable of checking for him dear, I am getting my clothes for a shower. I will check for him as soon as I undress, ok?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at her mom and then stared at her butt. It was honestly bigger than her own. She wondered if her boyfriend was back there if he was even more squashed than the times he had been when she had accidentally sat on him. She pondered if she should let her mother check, or sneak in while she was in the shower to make sure. </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t see anything but she had squashed and stretched you so maybe you were still there? Wanting to be thorough, she used her nails and tried to pick at the back of her panties. Sure enough, she managed to peel a very flat Jake off of the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, aren\u2019t you helpful! Not only did you help cushion the old desk chair, you came along to give me comfort wherever I went! That is actually very impressive,\u201d Kimberly said with a smile, \u201cMaybe you can continue to help me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still not able to talk yet, but you were trying your best to reform so that you could talk to her.  You needed to clear up what had actually happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie dear, he was there just like you said. I have gotten him free. You don\u2019t have to worry now.\u201d Kimberly said through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie breathed a sigh of relief. She was glad her mom was able to find him so easily! Maybe she wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much about you with her very observant mom around. \u201cOk Mom! I am gonna go down to the living room and watch some T.V. then. Tell Jake he can join me if he wants too\u201d and with that Cassie went back downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were able to sit up. Your legs and arms were still very deflated, but you now looked a lot more human. \u201cUm, Ms. Smalls, about helping you out more I just want to say that I...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould love to help you!\u201d Kimberly interjected. \u201cYou are definitely one very helpful little man. I was going to go take a shower though so I am not sure what you can help me with right now, hmmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly puzzled over this for a moment before smiling at you. You were not able to say no, maybe because of her piercing eyes and big smile, maybe because you were trying hard to impress her, but you didn\u2019t disagree with helping. \u201cIf you are not sure, you could give me a few options. That way I can play to my strengths,\u201d you managed to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly gave you another smile. Her smiles were so warm and alarming. You are not sure but have a feeling that all the choices were going to be something very hard for you to do. \u201cWell, dear little man you can either,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not sure if my body heat will heat up everything but I am glad to give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly gave you another one of her smiles. \u201cExcellent Jake, and yes you may be a little small to heat up all my clothes. The main thing is to make sure my underwear is good and preheated. I used to toss my clothes into the dryer so they would be warm but we moved the laundry room out of the bathroom and down into the basement. How I have missed warm underwear,\u201d Kimberly signed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously looked at her and the new pair of panties she was holding. They were a nice silky looking pair with that same tan color. It filled you with worry that you would be in the pair while she was showering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Jake let\u2019s go!\u201d Kimberly said as she picked you up and headed to the bathroom. As she walked she made sure to carry you next to her massive hip. The natural swinging of her hands made you see her butt as well. You already knew it was massive, however you couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving in the bathroom, Kimberly Laos you down on the sink counter. She placed her panties next to you, \u201cGet in!\u201d she commanded. Wasting no time you walked forward and crawled into the silky article of clothing. Kimberly made sure to tuck the panties tight around you. You think you could get out but it was definitely confined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you stay there and warm these up. I do not want you getting out of these is that clear?\u201d she boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \u201cYes ma\u2019am! I will stay right here until you let me know I can leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly chuckles, \u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. Maybe you will be useful around here after all.\u201d She then proceeded to strip and enter the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did nothing but patiently wait for her to finish. You had to admit, the panties were definitely warming up. It was like being in a sleeping bag and zipping it up and slipping inside. You had a nagging fear though that Kimberly was planning on keeping you in the panties when she put them on. It just seemed like a possibility after being treated as a chair cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the shower Kimberly was considering what to do with you next. She smiled as the possibilities seemed endless. She soon finished cleaning up and stepped out of the shower to dry off. \u201cI do hope you have stayed put Jake,\u201d she said to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \u201cYes Ms. Smalls! Everything feels good and toasty in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly just smiled as she has decided what to do next with her little future son-in-law. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were quite a few possibilities as to what to do now that you were finally meeting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family. However, what mattered to you most at this moment in time was making a good first impression with her siblings and mother. The key step to that was establishing relationships, so you knew you needed to spend time getting to know each of the Smalls women. As much as you wanted to roll around in bed with Cassie, getting her family\u2019s approval for marriage came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to who you wanted to hang out with first, your mind immediately jumped to Sophie, Cassie\u2019s younger sister. Something about her bubbly and energetic personality really refreshed you after hours driving in the car. That, and you were intrigued by what little Cassie had said about her. She was apparently some sort of \u201cInstagram influencer\u201d, though you had no idea what that meant. They didn\u2019t exactly make cell phones for foot tall people, so you were a bit behind the times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t able to catch Sophie in time though, as she was already heading out of the living room and towards the staircase. You made a mental note of how entirely revealing her swimsuit was as she swayed up the stairs, but purely for academic purposes. You had eyes of love only for Cassie. That didn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t acknowledge the beauty of her sisters and mother, but you weren\u2019t going to perv out and spy on any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping off from the table, you caught a wry smile from your fianc\u00e9e. Wordlessly, you gestured around the room, signaling your desire to explore the house. Catching your silent meaning, Cassie nodded, blew you a kiss, and turned back to talking with her mother. You walked along the carpet, farther from the two women and closer to the staircase to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the stairs, Maddie came bounding through the hallway, basketball tucked under her arm, and her other hand grasping a sports drink. You gave her a quick wave, but her eyes were locked squarely ahead of her, towards the front door. It took your last second reflexes to throw yourself to the side and just barely avoid her well-worn sneaker slamming you flat as she ran past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit harrowing, to be honest, but the moment passed in a second. Resuming your slow but methodical climb up the stairs, you realized that it wasn\u2019t entirely fair to expect Cassie\u2019s family to adapt to your one-foot tall presence. A person like you wasn\u2019t exactly common place, and the giantesses of this house had lived their whole lives not paying mind to what lie beneath them. Quietly though, you did hope that accidents involving you and them would grow few and far between as time passed, if fate was kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second floor was still a mystery to you, just a hallway and a line of doors. Thankfully, the door covered in bright pink posters and a small strip of neon lights clearly signified Sophie\u2019s bedroom. Better still, the door was slightly ajar, so after crossing the hallway and wiping some sweat from your brow, you slipped into her room quietly, hoping to not disturb her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you cursed yourself for not knocking, and felt like a foolish, inconsiderate clod. Sophie, still clad in only her swimsuit, was posing by her computer on her desk. She was leaning over her desk chair, accentuating her breasts and highlighting the shape of her ass. From the reflection in her monitor, you could see a happy-go-lucky smile on her face as she snapped a picture of herself with her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit awestruck, a mix of confusion over the strange situation, appreciation for how stunning she really was, and embarrassment at her flirty photo shoot. You couldn\u2019t wrangle out a greeting\u2026at least until Sophie backed further up for another picture, dainty feet sliding across the carpet and threatening to steamroll over you. Your words came back to you in an instant, and you nearly screamed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOPHIE! HEY, HELLO, WATCH OUT!\u201d You blurted out. Predictably, Sophie let out a cute squeal and spun around, glancing about in confusion before looking down and spotting you. Her fear morphed instantly into flustered happiness, and she spared you a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh, hi Jake! You scared me, little guy!\u201d Sophie grinned. She bent over at the waist, lowering herself to your level. The shadow her body cast over you gave you a slight shiver, even though you chastised yourself for being afraid of your future sister-in-law. You also chastised yourself for your wandering eyes, but her flimsy bikini just accentuated her curves so much, and her boobs were nearly dangling right over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to see the family resemblance between Cassie and Sophie. Though dyed blonde, her silky, wavy hair had the exact same consistency as your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s, as did her fair skin and attractive face. Younger than Cassie, Sophie was a bit less developed than her older sister and mother, but more than well on her way. As previously noted, her chest was still nothing to scoff at, nor were her legs and butt. The pink sparkly bikini, though not a G-string, still left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry for scaring you, Sophie.\u201d You replied meekly. \u201cJust wanted to\u2026see what you were up to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie beamed. \u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s super nice of you! You\u2019re just the cutest, friendliest little guy I\u2019ve ever seen. Also, I guess, the only! Hee hee!\u201d The giggly blonde paused to laugh for a second, and you couldn\u2019t help but smile at her infectious attitude, even if her word usage was a little bit concerning. It was almost as if she was viewing you like a little kid, but maybe she was just struggling to fully cope with your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced around her stylishly pink and pop music influenced room. \u201cSo, uh, Cassie tells me you\u2019re a\u2026influencer, or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cYeah yeah yeah! That\u2019s me! Basically, I spend my days snapping pics of myself and chatting online with my followers. I\u2019ve got a lot of fans.\u201d Sophie gushed. \u201cThat\u2019s what this outfit is for. Some cute lil pics before my stream.\u201d Your giantess sister-in-law tugged at her bikini for emphasis, slightly jostling her perky breasts.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A brief moment passed, and Sophie suddenly appeared lost in thought. Almost sheepishly, she stared down at you. \u201cHope this bikini isn\u2019t too weird, or anything. Sorry. I just met you, and all. I basically wear adorable outfits like this all the time around the house\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \u201cNo, of course not. Don\u2019t apologize. I won\u2019t impose on your hobbies. Besides, I think it really suits you.\u201d You added, wanting to genuinely compliment her. Something about seeing such a cheery girl look down, even for a second, tore you up inside, and made you want to do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you sure earned that smile. Sophie flashed you a huge, warm smile, and you noticed a faint flush of pink in her cheeks. \u201cGee Jake, that\u2019s really nice of you. You\u2019re a charmer, little guy!\u201d Sophie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning quickly on her heel, Sophie angled her phone over her shoulder, and snapped a picture of her beaming face and you standing on the floor. Effortlessly, the blonde giantess tapped away on her phone before looking back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah, most pictures go on my Instagram story, but the best ones stay forever on my page.\u201d Sophie explained. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m letting my fans know I\u2019m about to start a livestream in a few minutes. That way, they can\u2026pfft! Hee hee hee!\u201d Sophie broke into laughter. \u201cJake! You look like a little dolly on the floor like that! Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged off that remark, figuring Sophie was probably right. Her camera angle hadn\u2019t done you any favors. You posed a question. \u201cSo wait, you do livestreams too? What are those about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, those are tons of fun!\u201d Sophie exclaimed, before bending down and scooping you up into her arms. You couldn\u2019t hold back a small gasp of surprise at her unexpected show of intimacy, then realized she was merely lifting you up onto her bed. Still, you were acutely aware of how, even just for a few seconds, Sophie\u2019s hold on you squished your head against her boobs a bit. You were beginning to get the feeling Sophie wasn\u2019t a fully attentive girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on her bed, Sophie continued. \u201cI pretty much just sit around all day and stream, when I\u2019m not doing a little photo shoot. Sometimes I react to videos, other times I just talk. I\u2019ve played a few games before, but only the really easy, relaxing ones. Like the ones where you just take care of dogs and stuff. My audience likes those. Or that game with the adorable little animals. Like\u2026Animal Street, or something. Animal\u2026Cross\u2026something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in spite of yourself at Sophie\u2019s excitable rambling, you pointed to her computer. \u201cSo those streams earn you money, or are they just for fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, loads of money!\u201d Sophie clapped her hands together, and turned back to her computer. \u201cI get money from ads and likes and stuff on my Instagram, and my stream viewers donate to see my do things. Nothing, like, super gross or anything. I\u2019m not a pervy streamer, or a cam girl or something. Just little poses and stuff.\u201d She checked her phone. \u201cSpeaking of, almost time to stream! One last pic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie raised her phone and tried to strike a confident pose, but her foot slipped on a pink fuzzy sock by her desk. Squealing in an almost over-the-top fashion, Sophie pinwheeled her arms and toppled backwards. You laughed for exactly one second at her clumsiness, until you realized with a start that your position on her bed put you squarely in her landing zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even granted a second to cry out, Sophie\u2019s well-rounded derriere slammed down into her plush bed, burying you beneath her right cheek. Your legs buckled and flattened beneath you as she feel, crushing you into a lumpy misshapen circle a few inches in diameter. Sophie\u2019s pink bikini was wedged so much into her butt that you were entirely stuck to her bare creamy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it seemed to last an eternity, it was only seconds before Sophie stood back up and smiled in embarrassment. She brushed herself off, brain just barely registering a slightly off feeling on her butt, though she thought nothing more of it. That feeling was, of course, you. Though the impact only lasted a few seconds, it was enough to temporarily stick you to Sophie\u2019s rear end like a squishy bumper sticker. Sophie glanced around for you for a second, noting your disappearance, before shrugging and reasoning that you\u2019d wanted to leave before her stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m such a klutz.\u201d Sophie giggled, snapping her final pic and strutting over to her desk. You could feel your body bounce and sway along with the bodacious blonde\u2019s booty, and you fought to peel yourself off and flutter back to the floor. You definitely didn\u2019t want to still be stuck before she sat down for her stream. How could such an incident first meeting with Sophie come to this in seconds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Sophie was, and always was going to be, pretty forgetful. She\u2019d been that way since she was born. She obviously hadn\u2019t forgotten her whole conversation with you, but had totally missed the connection between you being on her bed before her fall, and now suddenly gone. As it was, the happy-go-lucky girl didn\u2019t have a clue you were so tightly hugging her own fine ass. Fortunately for you though, her Instagram followers spotted you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OMG! Did you just sit and crush that little doll?</i> Read the first comment on her picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie frowned at the comment, quirking her mouth to the side. She had no idea what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I barely even saw the squishy thing until I looked in the mirror.</i> Read another comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Sophie\u2019s ditzy brain a second, but she finally noted the squishy lump on her rump that was barely noticeable in the reflection of her full-size mirror in the photo. Craning her neck behind her, Sophie peered at her right butt cheek and gasped, spotting your plastered body immediately. Frantically, she scraped you free with her nails, until she had you resting as a flat little disc in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, oh my gosh! I\u2019m super sorry Jake!\u201d Sophie cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m so dumb sometimes! I didn\u2019t even feel you under my butt!\u201d The frazzled girl ran her hands through her hair and glanced at the clock. Two minutes left until showtime. Just then, her phone binged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019d pay twenty dollars to see you sit on it when the livestream starts.</i> The comment read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Twenty? How about fifty for some stomping? I bet it\u2019d feel good on your soft carpet.</i> Was the next comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does that doll stretch and squish? What do I have to pay to see a cutie like you try to, like, wear the doll? Ya know, like a wrap-around top or something.</i> Was the third comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jeebus guys, you\u2019re all on the ball. How\u2019s two hundred sound to do all of it, Sophie? You\u2019re our queen, after all!</i> Was the fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more requests began piling in, and Sophie\u2019s face went slack with stunned awe. Her hands fell to her side, and her grip on you loosened. You slipped from her hand and slid down into the butt-shaped imprint of her desk chair. A powerful strawberry aroma from her perfume nearly overwhelmed you, but you weren\u2019t an idiot. Her chair was the last place you wanted to be after that bed incident, so you continued trying to pop back into your one-foot shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s eyes flicked over the comments eagerly, and she noted her livestream was beginning in one minute. Her brain already began imaging all the new outfits and cute shoes she could buy with the insane money her fans were offering. On the other hand, she chastised herself for even considering treating her sister\u2019s tiny little fianc\u00e9 as a prop for her show. Would she really stoop to that? Of course, Jake had seemed like a friendly and willing guy. Maybe he\u2019d be up to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Pain flooded through you, but there was nothing you could do to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped, picking your flat and limp form off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the top,\" Sophie said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to stretch you out. You were in a tremendous amount of pain as every fiber of your body was stretched out. Sophie eventually got you to a good size, before wrapping you around herself. It was just your luck that your face was the part that fell across her boobs. You were skintight to Sophie now, not leaving much to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie clapped with glee as she saw the donations flooding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was important to you to establish a basis for a friendly relationship with each of the three giantesses gathered before you. Befriending them was your best chance at proving you were worthy of becoming the newest member of their family by marrying Cassie. In this instance, Maddie caught your eye above the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably due mostly to how similar she was to Cassie. She seemed easygoing, nice, attentive, and possessed a good sense of humor. Not to insult her, but Sophie seemed the type to set you down on the couch beside her to watch a movie, stand up to grab the TV remote, and plop her butt right back down on you. Worse, she also seemed the type to not even notice said humiliating blunder, keeping you pinned beneath her for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d get around to hanging out with her, but Maddie seemed like easy entry into befriending the Smalls women. On a very minor scale, it helped that she was so beautiful. Her tanned and toned but still curvy body was accentuated wonderfully by her sports bra and compression shorts. You took note of all this impassively, as you only had eyes for Cassie, but you still noted it nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning Maddie\u2019s smile, you spoke up. \u201cCassie told me you love exercising and sports, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie smirked, and Sophie giggled. The blonde elbowed her big sister and grinned at you. \u201cLove might be putting it too lightly, little cutie!\u201d Sophie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to curb her enthusiasm, that\u2019s for sure. She just kept playing one sport after the other, and visits the gym almost every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly crossed her arms under her abundant chest in a display of pride. \u201cShe wins almost every tournament and competition she enters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie threw up her hands. \u201cI AM right here, and can answer his question.\u201d She pushed the still giggling Sophie off of her and addressed you. \u201cYeah, Jake, I like sports. Why did ya ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struck a confident pose. \u201cWell, I was thinking we could play something out back right now, if you aren\u2019t busy. I\u2019d love the chance to stretch my legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s eyes widened, and you could tell she was very intrigued in your offer. Sophie bit her lip and grinned, clearly imagining the logistics of someone of your size playing with a towering girl like Maddie. Cassie thought of that too, and flashed you an uncertain frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if\u2013\u201d Cassie began, but Kimberly cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now dear. Jake issued the challenge.\u201d Kimberly explained, eyeing you closely. It was as if she was judging whether or not you backed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s eyes lit up at the word \u2018challenge\u2019, and she hopped to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Jake. Show me what you can do, little guy.\u201d<br>\r\nYour cocky smile wavered under her intense aura. \u201cUh\u2026I never really said \u2018challenge\u2019, but I guess\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Maddie turned on her heel. \u201cFollow me then!\u201d She motioned to you and then strolled out of the room. Taking one last second to glance at your fianc\u00e9e, you leapt from the table and followed your future sister-in-law out of the living room and towards the back door. You thought you caught a glimpse of Kimberly smirking from the corner of your eye, but couldn\u2019t double check to be sure that\u2019s what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie set a fast pace on the way to the backdoor, and it was hard for your tiny legs to keep up. Harder still was focusing in front of you and not on her tight butt swaying as her powerful legs carried her forward. It was a sobering thought to realize that a simple misstep could cause her to trip and fall backwards, her butt pulverizing you into paste in an instant. You\u2019d gotten used to your size difference in comparison with Cassie, but three new giantesses in the mix were reminding you how tiny you really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing through the backdoor as it swung shut behind Maddie, you slid through at the last second and entered the back yard. As Cassie had described, it was pretty huge. There was half a basketball court, sizable inground swimming pool, and a decently lengthy stretch of flat, grassy lawn, perfect for playing various games and sports on. Maddie surely thought the same, as she walked right off the back porch and into the grass, with you following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired giantess approached a lone soccer ball resting in the grass, and used her toe to flick it up into her hands. You came up beside her, and fought valiantly to mask your exhaustion from sprinting through the house to keep up with her. Meanwhile, she hadn\u2019t broken a single drop of sweat yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Jake. Down for some soccer?\u201d Maddie inquired. \u201cWay I see it, it\u2019s the closest thing to fair we can manage. In a foot race, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. I doubt you could throw a football very far, or even lift a basketball. Wrestling would be a hilariously embarrassing fiasco for you, and I think the ripples from my breaststroke in a swimming race could drown you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026uh\u2026probably right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie smirked. \u201cBut soccer? That could be interesting. You\u2019re tall enough to push and kick the ball, and small enough to move around my feet and steal it from me.\u201d She pointed to a far tree, and then behind you to a tall trash can back by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goal will be to hit the trash can.\u201d Maddie explained. \u201cThat gives me a point. Two if I get it IN the trash can.\u201d She joked, indicating the open lid to the trash can. \u201cYour goal will be the tree behind me. That gives you a point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped up and down and shook your hands. \u201cAlright, gotcha! I\u2019m good to go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDon\u2019t kick the ball into Miss Hilda\u2019s yard though, she doesn\u2019t like us.\u201d Maddie added. Following her finger, you noticed the adjacent house\u2019s backyard was right near the tree. A ten-foot-tall fence blocked in Miss Hilda\u2019s house from all sides, and there were two \u2018NO TRESSPASSING\u2019 signs hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Miss Hilda?\u201d You wondered aloud. Maddie sighed as she set the soccer ball down and backed up ten feet from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur neighbor. She\u2019s a teacher at the local high school, which is weird because I\u2019m pretty sure she hates kids. She\u2019s only, like 30 years old, but she keeps to herself all the time. I\u2026uh\u2026frequently kick things over her fence and into her pool on accident. I always apologize, but she keeps yelling all the same. Told me the next time I do it that she wouldn\u2019t give whatever I kick over back. Which would SUCK.\u201d Maddie cracked her knuckles and rolled her neck. \u201cBasically, she's a jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her prepare to charge, you lowered yourself into a running stance, squaring up with the ball. Maddie had to stop herself from laughing, as you weren\u2019t even visible from her perspective, entirely hidden behind the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start on three, Jake.\u201d She announced loudly. \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as her countdown ended, you dashed head on for the ball, running as fast as your legs could handle. This proved to be a hilariously bad mistake. By the time you were within a foot of the ball, Maddie had reached it AND kicked it, and the unyielding white and black checkered ball bowled you over, pressing your body flat and down into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie was next, the titanic girl leaping forward to keep her momentum going as she guided the ball to the trash can. Her left foot rose above you, and her entire alluring body blocked out the sun momentarily, before her foot slammed down on you, crushing your head and sticking you into the grass and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain only lasted a second before she stepped off, but by the time you reformed and sat up, Maddie had already scored and was walking back with the ball in her hand, smiling down at you with a look of amusement and pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiving up yet?\u201d She taunted. Thinking it appropriate considering her competitive nature, your answer was simply sticking out your tongue at her. Her eyes widened in surprise at your action, before her face broke into a genuine smile. It was that moment that you knew you\u2019d officially been welcomed into the Smalls family by Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squared up with Maddie again, but the second round went just as poorly as the first. You tried to catch the ball after Maddie\u2019s kick, and succeeded in doing so to your surprise, but you hadn\u2019t recovered before Maddie kicked it again, sending the ball and you crashing back into the trash can, squashing you flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reformed and began round three, you knew you needed a different tactic. Thinking quickly, you waited for Maddie\u2019s signal and then stepped gracefully to the side. When she kicked the soccer ball, you leapt at it from the side, grabbing onto it and pushing it off towards the left. This messed up Maddie\u2019s plan, and the brown-haired giantess actually slipped on the grass and fell behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t hold back a victorious laugh as you began furiously pushing the ball down towards the tree. At least, until you heard the ground shake as Maddie flipped onto her feet and came pounding back in your direction. Hearing her but not seeing her was a whole new level of terror, but there was no way you could quit with the tree in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s right leg came swinging at you from the side, and in a moment of genius, you ducked low, grabbed the ball from underneath, and jumped in the air. Her foot passed right under you, thankfully, and her missed kick gave you time to land back on the grass again and throw the ball, letting it roll the last few feet and tap the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour future sister-in-law was suitably impressed, but kept up the tireless pace. Resetting for round four, she held back this time, allowing you to approach the ball first for a change. Running up to the soccer ball, you started pushing it to the left, then curved around in the direction of the tree. Maddie casually walked forward to block your path, confident in her ability to halt your progress if she was really trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got close enough to her, she merely stepped down onto the soccer ball, fulling halting its movement by just her one foot alone. However, you\u2019d been planning for this, and so rolled out from behind the ball, scooped up the longest tree stick you could find in the grass, and poked it up into Maddie\u2019s glistening right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scraped gently at her toned thigh, just enough to elicit exactly the response you hoped for. Maddie gasped and fought down a laugh, a tickle attack the absolute last thing she\u2019d possible expected. With her focus uneven, you shoved the ball out from under her foot, and rushed forward as Maddie lost her balance and fell onto her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing out from behind her, the tree was in sight and so was your second point. Kicking the soccer ball as hard as you could, it sailed right to the tree. Maddie threw herself backwards in an attempt to stop it, but missed, succeeding only in squashing you under her lean stomach. Thankfully, she noticed her mistake right away, though it did take her a moment to scratch your flattened squishy form off of her smooth, sweaty skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResetting the ball, Maddie shook her head at you. \u201cDirty tactics, Jake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m at a huge disadvantage here. I\u2019d say it was a creative decision, not cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie rolled her eyes. \u201cCreative decision huh? Well, regardless\u2026this is the last point. The winner is decided here. In three, two, one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maddie counted down, the backdoor swung open, and Kimberly walked out onto the porch. She was carrying a hefty bag of trash and leftover food garbage and was about to drop it into the trash can when she noticed your competition with Maddie heating up. Intrigued, she walked a little closer to view the action better, still holding the garbage bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Maddie finished counting, you sprinted for the ball, getting it in your hands and veering right. Maddie jogged into your field of view, and you saw her prepare to head you off with a kick. Expecting this, you grabbed the ball tightly and stopped it in place, hoping Maddie would miss her kick and trip herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. As soon as you stopped, you saw the smirk on Maddie\u2019s face and realized you\u2019d fallen into her trap. Stood still, you made an easy target, and Maddie wasted no more time in stomping down onto your body right her right foot, crushing you flat in an instant. On the porch, Kimberly nodded approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her foot, Maddie gave your mashed body a sympathetic smile. \u201cSorry, dude, but I don\u2019t give anyone anything for free. You put up a hell of a good match, honestly. It\u2019s been fun, but I\u2019m competitive through and through, and I do what I need to to win. Call it\u2026a creative decision!\u201d She grinned and winked at you, before pulling back her leg for the mother of all kicks. From her stance, it was clear she was trying to hit the ball to the trash can in one move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last ounce of your stamina, you let out a defiant cry and popped back into shape just in time to push the ball out of the way, hoping your last-ditch effort would mess up Maddie\u2019s kick and buy you a few extra seconds. Or, that was the plan in your head. In reality, you failed to consider the horrible ramifications of moving the ball after the athletic giantess had already begun her kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t even have time to blink, and Maddie only had a fraction of a second to cry out in surprise as you moved the ball right as she kicked. Her foot impacted like a bullet the size of a boulder, slamming into your one-foot-tall body and propelling you into the air. You nearly passed out from the impact alone as you flew through the air, pinwheeling uncontrollably. Maddie had no time to react to her target changing from the ball to you, and had not held back one bit on her thunderous kick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hurdling through the air at supersonic speeds with a large shoe-shaped dent running along your entire torso, you could barely even tell what was up and what was down. You caught a flew glimpses among your hundred of tumbles of Maddie holding both hands over her mouth and staring up at you, but she was getting increasingly further away. As you reached the apex of your flight you finally started to stabilize and looked down to see that you had soared clean over the imposing fence you saw earlier. Thankfully from what you could see you were aimed for a pool as opposed to any other surface which you would have certainly squished flat against. After plummeting for a few seconds you finally landed in the water with a loud splash. You sank beneath the water for a few seconds but thanks to one of the few benefits of being so light and small you quickly rose to the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your entire chest still caved in from Maddie's cannon of a kick, you didn't quite have control over your body yet. This being the case, you stared up into the blistering mid day sky for a few moments before a surprisingly large shadow was cast over you. Opening your eyes widely you saw the outline of a woman leaning over you from the edge of a pool. Gulping with fear from what little you had heard about Miss Hilda, you tried desperately to get any words out, but with your whole torso still decimated by Maddie your lungs just wouldn't push the air up through your vocal chords quite yet. Suddenly a hand reached down and grabbed your body, shaking some of the water off of you before holding you up to face this mystery woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the woman staring at you inquisitively was bizarre to say the least. First and foremost her body was impressive. While not cut from the same outrageously curvy cloth as the Smalls family, she still had shapely breasts and rather wide hips that led to a large ass that you even begin to see from the front. All this was hidden behind a relatively modest white t-shirt and denim shorts, but nonetheless you could tell she was an attractive woman.  However, contrasting the youthful look of her body was a mess of what looked like short hair dyed grey? She had a rather angular, pretty face as well, complemented by a pair of large, circular glasses. If you had to guess you would have said that it seemed like this woman was trying and failing to achieve the mad scientist look, but her natural youth and beauty still won out in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking you out of your trance, the voice of the woman rung out in front of you, \"What the hell, is this seriously a doll? All of the Smalls daughters have to be way too old to be playing with dolls at this point. Is that pain in the ass Maddie trying to mess with me or something? I swear that girl needs to stop throwing her shit into my yard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by the tone of her voice that this woman was not a friendly person to be around. The disdain in her voice when she even said the names of the Smalls was evident, and now you felt twice as terrified to be where you were. She quickly dropped her arm down to her side and began to walk briskly towards her house. Swinging you unconsciously as she walked, she bumped your body into the side of her hip multiple times, slamming your still deformed body into her soft skin. You couldn't even take in your surroundings due to the repeated contact you kept making with her, as she quickly walked through her house and out her front door. Stepping out into her front yard she stopped suddenly, holding you still long enough to see none other than Maddie standing a few feet ahead of you both! It seemed like Maddie had ran all the way from the Smalls' backyard up to the front of this Miss Hilda's house as soon as she realized what she had done to you. You smiled at least knowing that the sister of your fiance seemed like she genuinely cared about your well being. But that didn't change the tension in the air at that exact moment. It was clear that Miss Hilda did not like Maddie one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing this is yours, then?\" Miss Hilda said, her voice dripping with annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am so sorry it was a complete accident! I'll never even play a sport in my backyard again if you just give it ba...\" Maddie pleaded but Miss Hilda cut her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I told you last time this DOLL or whatever I am holding will not be returning to you! In fact, maybe this will teach you to be more considerate of personal space!\" With her final word she threw you aggressively onto the concrete step down in front of her, before immediately raising a large, pale, bare foot above your body. You could only whimper with fear as she brought the ball of her foot down hard onto your face, before immediately lifting it up and repeating the process with the rest of your body. She stomped for nearly ten seconds straight, concluding the beatdown by twisting her heel over your now totally flattened body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie was speechless at the violent display that her neighbor displayed. She always knew that she was a grumpy woman, but this was outrageous. Shaking herself out of shock she yelled back, \"Miss Hilda that isn't a doll that is a real person he has a special condition that makes him that size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow just standing with her foot planted firmly over your entire body, this woman furrowed her brows in curiosity. She removed her foot and peered down at your now completely flattened body. Bits of dirt and other grime from the bottom of her soles had rubbed off all over your body during the stomping, smearing some of your features slightly, but for the most part you still maintained your features. She bent down and used a nail to scrape your head free from the ground, peeling your body up like a human pancake. She took one more look at you and waved your flattened form around before responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right I'm sure you just said that to get me to give it back. Not a chance! Better think twice before launching something in my yard again, unless you just like giving me gifts!\" Miss Hilda then immediately spun around and walked the few steps back into her house. Maddie tried to plead more and chase her to the door, but the woman slammed and locked the front door shut before Maddie could reach. Now holding you in her hands she gave you an inquisitive look once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way you're a real person... right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miss Hilda\u2019s inquisitive look, quickly faded, replaced by a bemused smile and a roll of her eyes. Whatever small kernel of curiosity she\u2019d felt at Maddie\u2019s emotional plea was squashed within her by common sense and reason. There was no scientifically possible way in which a one-foot tall squishy person could ever exist. Maddie was clearly playing an elaborate prank, though Hilda had to admit, she was a gifted actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders, Hilda walked over to a sling bag she kept near the front door, zipped it open, and slammed your squishy body inside. Instantly, you slipped under a few books and other knickknacks in the bag, the heavy weights pressing you down and ensuring your reformation was impossible. You tried twitching and squirming, but to no avail. Worse, your head was pinned under a thick textbook, keeping your mouth squashed flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda zipped her bag back up and sighed, glancing out the window. Maddie was still fruitlessly pacing back and forth, and Miss Hilda almost thought she saw tears spring to the girl\u2019s eyes. A twang of guilt pierced her frozen heart, but Hilda shook it off, content in believing she was in the right holding onto the Smalls girl\u2019s weird doll. She\u2019d given her plenty of warning, and this was only fair recompense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hilda made sure to position the bag in a way in which she\u2019d remember it the next morning, as she planned to take it to school the next day. Hilda taught Math and Science, and was already wondering if there were any unique ways to test and experiment with the odd gummy-like doll\u2019s special properties. Her intellectual side was thrilled at the prospect, and she hoped her students shared her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling over to her comfortable fireplace recliner, Hilda settled in for the evening. She\u2019d heated up a scrumptious casserole dinner earlier, so she flicked the TV to an ambient music channel and lost herself in an enjoyable book. Hours passed by in relaxing peace and quiet. The front door rang three times, and her house phone buzzed twice, but Hilda didn\u2019t spare any thought to Maddie\u2019s desperate attempts to contact her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maddie was simultaneously doing everything she could to rescue you, and also doomed you to your fate. She knocked and rang at the front door, looked up Hilda\u2019s number in an old phonebook and called her, and contemplated sneaking in through an open window or unlocked door, before being dismayed by Hilda\u2019s state-of-the-art security system installed all over her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crucial thing that Maddie did NOT do was run back over to her house and tell Cassie about what had happened. She didn\u2019t even tell Kimberly or Sophie. She was wracked with guilt and embarrassment, and could already picture Cassie snapping and screaming at her. Instead, as night fell, she put on her best performance as an excited sister and managed to successfully distract Cassie from thinking about you by talking and watching a movie. She promised herself to continue trying to save you first thing in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble meanwhile, you could do nothing but waste away in Miss Hilda\u2019s bag, impatiently waiting for her to return for you. Trapped under books in the bag\u2019s tight confines, you couldn\u2019t move or reform from your crumpled-up shape. Night came and went, and eventually you were able to find a bit of sleep, as uncomfortable as it was. All told, it was over twelve hours in Miss Hilda\u2019s bag, before morning came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Miss Hilda awoke bright and early, freshened up in the bathroom, helped herself to some wake-up coffee, and dressed in her typical outfit. Her outfit consisted of a modest white blouse and black skirt, topped off by her trademark scientist\u2019s overcoat. Of course, her blouse and skirt could only be so modest taking her beauty into consideration, as her top strained to hold her chest in, and her skirt\u2019s seams stretched taut around her derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling downstairs, Hilda enjoyed a quiet breakfast with some juice and a bagel, then slipped into her heels and approached the front door. Smirking a bit upon seeing her sling bag, she was reminded of the squishy doll inside, and the plans she had in store for it. She gathered up her belongings, sliding the bag over her shoulder, and walked outside to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel yourself jostled around inside the bag as Hilda moved to her car, but you weren\u2019t shaken enough to escape being pinned by the books holding you flat. All you could do was listen to the muffled sounds of her humming, and the engine of her car starting. You could feel the rumbling vibrations of her car pulling away from the driveway and down the road, off towards the direction of the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in her bed back at the Smalls house, Maddie shifted. She was deeply asleep, and the low rumble of a car engine stirred her slightly. The brown-haired girl groaned quietly, turned over, and buried her head in her pillow. The annoying sound soon faded, and Maddie sleepily grinned, falling into her deep, uninterrupted slumber again. Any conceivable thought of you was the farthest thing from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the high school, Miss Hilda parked in the teacher\u2019s lot and headed into the building. Her school, Carson High, was a modestly sized and reasonably advanced school consisting of a large central building, a self-contained gym, track, and pool building, and a third building for the large auditorium. In the center of the three-building complex was a pretty and relaxing garden yard, where activities were frequently held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason that no one could really explain, the student body was almost entirely female, to a staggering degree. This had the side effect of making any male presence a huge deal, and Miss Hilda had witnessed firsthand the torrent of pent-up feminine desires being unleashed. Perhaps that was why males were so scarce on the campus, but none could say. Hilda almost had small shred of sympathy for a man who found himself here. Most of the staff were females too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no qualms with her fully female students though. They were attentive, thoughtful, invested in the classwork, and enjoyable to be around. As she lugged her belongings up to the third floor of the main building, Miss Hilda shoved open her class door and turned on the lights, eagerly awaiting her student\u2019s arrival so she could show them the odd doll\u2026thing\u2026she\u2019d been so graciously gifted by Maddie Smalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in what seemed like forever, you were released from your confines in the bag as Hilda dumped out her books onto her front desk. You were a crumpled lump at this point, but happy to be free to reform once more. That happiness faded in an instant though, as Hilda grabbed you up and absentmindedly toyed with you in one hand while she straightened her desk space, using you like a stretchy stress toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more time passed, and students began milling into the room. Miss Hilda greeted each one with a curt \u201cgood morning\u201d, but her eyes betrayed her sense of excitement. The students, in turn, waved happily and answered her back, even the more sullen and quiet students. Girls of all types poured into the room: outgoing and extroverted, studious and introverted, flirty, goths, pranksters, and everything in between. All told, twenty teenaged girls comprised Miss Hilda\u2019s class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rung, and Hilda shut her classroom door. She tapped the whiteboard behind her to command attention, and then cleared her throat. Twenty sets of eyes looked at her expectantly, more than a few drifting to the odd tan lump in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning students.\u201d Miss Hilda addressed the class. \u201cI\u2019ve got something exciting today, so I won\u2019t delay any longer.\u201d Unceremoniously, she dropped you from her hand onto the desk, letting you rest in a misshapen blob. You wasted no time beginning to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide-eyed girl in the front of the class titled her head. \u201cWhat is that, Miss Hilda?\u201d She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what is so exciting. I\u2019ve no idea!\u201d Miss Hilda\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2026found it\u2026just yesterday. It\u2019s a strange, squishy substance that forms into a doll when allowed to rest. Observe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls leaned forward in their seats, craning their necks to get a better view of you as your body\u2019s natural processes kicked in, reinflating your crushed limbs and chest. As you popped back into your normal shape, gasps and small laughs echoed around the room. Your cheeks flared up at the humiliation of being presented as something to marvel at, but as soon as your face reformed, you could cry out and clear up this whole mess. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrouble was, right before your head finished reforming, Miss Hilda grabbed your body to hold you in place, palm clenching around your head and keeping it flat, unable to talk. Your limbs were still free though, so you thrashed against her grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl shrieked. \u201cWhy is the doll moving?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hilda clicked her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s another odd property of the gummy-like substance. It reacts to touch in strange ways.\u201d Her scientifically focused brain rationalized each and every little thing you did to a maddening degree. Though still pinned in her grasp, you had no doubt that even if you leapt to your feet and screamed at her that you were a real person, she\u2019d find some way to still rationalize you as a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third girl\u2019s eyes gleamed as she beheld you. \u201cSo, what can it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hilda met the girl\u2019s eager stare. \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. In theory, its squishiness should work in reverse. As in, it should be quite stretchy. Shall we see just how much it can stress and squash?\u201d Hilda proposed, and a chorus of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cyeah\u201d responded to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour struggles ceased upon hearing twenty teenage girls loudly declare their malicious, if also na\u00efve and innocent, intentions for you. Your blood ran cold, and you paled. What on earth were you about to be subjected to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cassie's family left the room, you collapsed backward into the couch. Even if you could have felt your legs, you wouldn't have had the strength to lift yourself up. You knew that you were probably going to be okay, having survived many close calls in the past, but positive thinking didn't really help while your arms and legs felt like they were about to fall off. There was something especially traumatic about being underneath Kimberly's flip flops. Being pinned and trapped as they ground you into the floor and the dirt and stones were stamped into your helpless body. A feeling of helplessness which you haven't truly felt since the beginning when you first learned of your strength. It didn't help with the pain though. You would do anything for Cassie, but you weren't feeling particularly attached to her family right now.  Suddenly a gentle whisper could be heard from the deep, dark chasm of your suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing your eyes open, you could see Cassie there, kneeling at the edge of the couch, watching over you with tears about to trickle down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty beat up\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What me? Nooooo.\" You tried your best to lighten the mood and it worked. It brought a brief smile to Cassie's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here you. Let's get some rest.\"  Being extra careful, she lifted you off the couch and cradled you in her arms like a baby as she began to walk. You were barely conscious as she lay you down on another soft surface. You could tell she was right next to you as the warmth of her body made you you feel cozy and comfortable and not to mention, safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Jake. Now get some sleep okay?\" The last thing you heard before drifting off to was the beautiful and comforting voice of your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                     -------- Some time passes --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awakened with an immense yawn, and soon after, your jaw completely dropped. On the far side of the bed was Kimberly, standing on her knees, towering over you. That wasn't all. On your right was Sophie was standing at the side with one foot raised onto the bed. On your left was Maddie who also stood on the side with on knee resting on the bed, disturbingly close to you. The three giant women each smirked as you panicked and fell on your back. Without warning or hesitation, Sophie stood up on the bed, followed by Maddie and lastly, Kimberly also rose to her feet and the three women surrounded you. All you could see were three gigantic pairs on feet blocking your way in every direction and if you craned your neck upwards, you could see the trio laughing while looking down at you. <br>\r\nIn an instant, they began jumping on the bed around you, causing violent earthquakes all around which threw you off balance and cause you to begin bouncing uncontrollably all around. Amid the chaos, you could hear the three girls laughing hysterically and then you understood. You were nothing but dirt to them. A toy to be made fun off. Why did you expect anything else?<br>\r\nSophie's feet smashed onto the bed right next to you, sending you flying off in the opposite direction. Your body was smacked against the wooden floor as you heard one of them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do think you're running off too tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Maddie who walked over you before you could even gather your thoughts. Her shadow loomed overhead as she lifted her giant feet and smashed down on you without hesitation. You were pummeled into the ground mercilessly by Maddie's powerful feet with no chance to beg for mercy or even catch your breath. She ground down on your completely flattened body until you were stuck to her sole. Your were barely conscious as she lifted her foot and peeled you off and onto the bed again. Tears gushed all over your face. What did you do to deserve this? \"Why was I cursed to be this small? To be tortured, stomped and mutilated?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie's voice loomed overhead. \"Now I know why Cassie likes you so much!\" The three girls were kneeling directly over you before they each turned around, and all you saw were three gigantic asses hovering over you as you lay helplessly in the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready little guy?\" They descended rapidly, crushing your body like a thousand cushiony skyscrapers .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fluttered open, dazzled and you quickly rubbed your eyes and deliriously looked all around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart slammed against your chest with such force that it instantly lifted you to your feet. Maddie was across the bed, sitting with both her legs on one side. She appeared to be somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat just happened??? Was that all just a...A DREAM?!? WHAT IS GOING ON???</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could think of what to do next, Sophie leapt onto the couch between Cassie and Kimberly\u2019s chairs. She leaned forward in her seat and looked at you expectantly, childlike glee radiating off of her face (and contrasting quite sharply with the very kid-unfriendly cleavage spilling from her revealing bikini top). Her eyes glimmered with happiness, and you couldn\u2019t help basking in her infectious cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell more stories Jake!\u201d Sophie exclaimed. \u201cI want to hear all about you, little guy! You\u2019re just so tiny and cute, life\u2019s gotta be hard, right? What kinda things happen to you? Tell me!\u201d Sophie paused. \u201cEr\u2026tell us\u2026\u201d She glanced around the room, and her cheeks flushed. \u201cUh\u2026please? Pretty please?\u201d Her voice quieted down, her exuberant attitude sheepishly retreating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie rolled her eyes like it was a habitual reaction to Sophie\u2019s hectic energy, and Kimberly frowned. Your future mother-in-law sighed as she spoke. \u201cSophie, dear, I just finished explaining about how tired your sister and her fianc\u00e9 must be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s fine. She just put me on the spot a bit. I can tell more stories, if you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie beamed, her gorgeous smile warming your heart. \u201cReally? You\u2019d do that? Oh, awesome! This is super-duper cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndulging her sister\u2019s antics, Maddie slid onto the couch beside her. All four women looked at you expectantly, their expressions varying. Sophie was the perfect picture of barely contained enthusiasm, Maddie was feigning a neutral face but was clearly just as intrigued as her sister, and Kimberly looked thoughtful, no doubt still weighing your marriage potential. Cassie had a concerned expression but was still smiling. She was more than well aware of how\u2026embarrassing\u2026many of your childhood stories were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat. \u201cUh, well, where to begin? I\u2019ve got loads of stories\u2026some a little less appropriate than others\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie giggled at that, and Maddie playfully knocked the blonde\u2019s shoulder to quiet her. Looking at you, Maddie spoke. \u201cHow about a story involving sports? I think we\u2019d all like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie laughed and shot her sister a wry smile. \u201cI think YOU\u2019D like that, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie stuck out her tongue at Cassie, but you actually liked her suggestion. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d You agreed. \u201cI can do that. Hm\u2026let\u2019s see. Oh! Yeah, so, okay\u2026this one time when I was about eleven\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grew older, your mother wanted to give you more and more experience with the outside world. She still kept a careful watch over you, but wasn\u2019t above taking you out on little day trips in an attempt to give you a healthier and more \u201cnormal\u201d childhood. That being said, a trip didn\u2019t go by without a least one accident (or ten), but that didn\u2019t halt your mom\u2019s loving attempts to help you socialize and have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular trip led you and her to the local state park, which was centered around a big lake called Lake Fernwood. The lake was of a large enough size for their to be a sandy beachside, which the state park officials had turned into a tourist beach. It was actually a pretty popular spot back where you grew up. On the day that you and your mom arrived, there were nearly fifty people already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dressed in just a pair of swim shorts which weren\u2019t entirely comfortable, seeing as how they\u2019d come from a store-bought Ken doll. Your height was still about six to seven inches by this point in time. You rode comfortably on your mom\u2019s shoulder as she walked. Though you were much too young to pay close attention at the time, your fairly curvy mother was clad in an eye-catching black two-piece bikini that accentuated her feminine charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one on the beach paid any attention to you, as you looked more like an adorable little doll than anything else. Your mom straightened out her towel, doused herself in sunscreen, gave you a big kiss, and then laid out to sun tan. She\u2019d also remarked to you that you needed to stay close and not wander too far, but your preteen excitement couldn\u2019t be contained. As soon as you knew she had slipped asleep, you raced off across the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your diminutive size, the sandy dunes were a veritable nightmare to run across, and you consistently tripped and fell. To make matters worse, you were even less visible against the thick sand, and your natural skin complexion blended in quite well with the ground to the normal person\u2019s eye. Beach goer after beach goer stepped on your legs or hands, or accidentally kicked you. In minutes you were caked in sand and on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to your sleeping mother, who was now a good thirty feet away, you locked eyes with a toddling three-year-old happily building a sand castle. Her eyes lit up and a huge smile grew as she spotted you, and she hopped to her feet and rushed towards you. Screaming, you ran back without looking, having experienced the sensation of being played with like a doll countless times by then in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning blind, you soon felt the powerful forward momentum of a college girl\u2019s foot slam into your stomach, and send you flying backwards. You slid harshly across the sand and came to a stop, but not without your cheap little Ken shorts ripping away, leaving you naked. Groaning, you had no time to sit up before that same college girl walked into view and planted her feet squarely down on your chest and legs, pinning you beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was still free, and so you weakly cried up to her, your voice muffled by some sand in your throat. Your only response was several large sweat drops glistening off her tanned body and splattering into your eyes, the sweat stinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright girls, best of five, right?\u201d The college girl above you said loudly, eyes locked on people outside of your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re buying dinner once you lose!\u201d A second voice taunted, and the girl above you grinned. From outside your view, a volleyball flew over to the girl, who caught it expertly, held it steadily in her palm, and served it. Through some nonsensical series of painful coincidences, you\u2019d ended up right in the middle of a group of girls playing volleyball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the girl above you stepped off as she moved to return a volley from the opposing team. The bright sun burned down on you for a second, before being replaced by the shadowy silhouette of another girl leaping into the air for a spike. Something about that moment of the girl\u2019s shapely figure against the sun was the first time you\u2019d ever felt stirrings of attraction to the female race. Those feelings were, of course, squashed quite literally a second later as the girl landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the first girl, the second girl\u2019s feet absolutely pulverized your entire body. Every part of you was squished flat and pounded in sweat and dirt. It grew worse as the girl reflexively scrunched her toes, her dainty digits pinching and grasping your head, squeezing your face into clumps of sand between her toes. You tried in vain to wiggle free, but were ultimately powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot crushing went on for another ten minutes, as each of the four girls on your side of the field rotated around, equally smushing you underfoot. Finally, near the end of game two, one of the girls tripped and sprawled backwards, shapely rear end smashing down onto the sand right on your body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wearing only a skimpy thong, the girl\u2019s full bare ass clapped against your body, ramming your face into the hot flesh of her left butt cheek. As the girl\u2019s friend helped her to her feet, your body went with her, the sweat and dirt from your battered body adhering to the girl\u2019s own glistening body. As she brushed herself off, your body jiggled and shook along with her meaty ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hold up.\u201d A girl called out, halting the game before it could resume. The girl whose butt you were a sticker on looked at her in confusion. That confusion grew even more as this new girl strolled up and ripped you from her butt. The new girl held you in her palm, but unfortunately face down. As such, she and her friends were only looking at your backside, which was already mostly concealed by a layer of damp sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I sit on that?\u201d The girl who\u2019d butt crushed you smirked. \u201cWhat even is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl holding you shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Feels like\u2026a towel, or something. Your sweaty ass glued it to you!\u201d The two girls giggled, and the girl holding you crumpled you in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll hold onto this for now. Feelin\u2019 a bit sweaty myself actually.\u201d She grinned as she balled you up and stuffed half of your body between her sizable breasts, until only a portion of you stuck out from her cleavage. Her friends all laughed, and the game resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another fifteen minutes of play, you found yourself struggling to remain conscious. The temperature between the girl\u2019s tits was even hotter than the burning sun, and it was a veritable swamp of sweat between those fleshy orbs. To make matters worse, your slowly growing attraction to girls was overwhelming your preteen mind. Being manhandled by the college girls was an overflowing mix of terrifying and arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the unmistakable voice of your mother called out, halting the game. Her voice was garbled through the thick boobs all around you, but you still knew her tone of voice anywhere. You were filled with hope, doubly so as the girl who had captured you retrieved you from her cleavage, letting you breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught a brief glimpse of your mother before the girl swished you behind her back and began rubbing your face up and down her butt crack, no doubt trying to get the full use out of her new \u2018towel\u2019. You grimaced in disgust at both the smell and the wet, sticky sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? You okay?\u201d The girl holding you asked. Your mother approached the girls in a hurry, out of breath and clearly panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy s-son! I can\u2019t find my son anywhere!\u201d Your mother cried in desperation. \u201cHe\u2019s only eleven! I told him to stay by my side, but he ran off when I fell asleep tanning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl holding you flinched and looked at her friends with worry. \u201cGeez, that\u2019s horrible. God, we should probably help, right?\u201d Her friends all nodded. The girl stopped mopping up her sweat and moved you back to her chest, much to your horror. You struggled in her hands, but your slight movements went unnoticed. Helpless, you sighed in defeat as the girl wedged you back between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, it was your panic-stricken face that was left visible from her cleavage. Staring out at an upside-down angle, you spotted your mother, and tried screaming for her attention. Flattened and crushed as you were, you were actually incapable of speech, and could only beg her to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, she did, and your mother\u2019s eyes locked right onto your own. Confusion filled her features for a second, before all the pieces finally clicked into place. Her expression morphed into pure awe, which then became abject horror at what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl\u2019s friend \u2018helpfully\u2019 leaned over and jabbed her fingers into your eyes, jamming you even deeper into the girl\u2019s cleavage. In the blink of an eye, you were totally hidden from sight, completely swallowed up by the monumentally sized tits of the girl. Everything around you was darkness, save for the steady thrum of the girl\u2019s heartbeat. It was almost surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friend gestured to your mom. \u201cCan\u2019t have your towel falling out if you\u2019re running around looking for her kid. Good thing your tits can handle it!\u201d She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed. \u201cWon\u2019t argue with that!\u201d Switching to a more earnest look, she eyed your mom. \u201cSo where do you think he went? We\u2019ll comb this whole beach to help you find him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom stared slack jawed for another minute before finally scrambling together enough mental thought to respond. \u201cUh, well\u2026actually\u2026this might sound weird. My son is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cSuffice it to say, after ten minutes of convincing, the girl let me out, laid me out on the ground, and I reformed after another five minutes. Then I had to deal with eight college girls fussing over me, apologizing for stomping and crushing me, and\u2026other\u2026stuff.\u201d You trailed off, recalling how fervently that girl who\u2019d dominated you with her breasts had kissed you as her \u2018apology\u2019. That experience had been burned in your preteen brain years afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute of silence fell, and then Sophie giggled uncontrollably. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d She wheezed, trying to get a handle on herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026you\u2019re so little\u2026and they all just\u2026\u201d Sophie fell onto Maddie, who sighed loudly. \u201cBut you were hurt, and so young\u2026so I shouldn\u2019t l-laugh\u2026but I just can\u2019t! Even!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie rolled her eyes and ignored Sophie. \u201cYikes dude, that\u2019s pretty rough. At least your mom showed how much she can take care of you by saving you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll always love her for all the countless times she\u2019s saved me. She never took me to the beach again though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at you in surprise. \u201cYou never told me this, Jake. Is this story the reason you never wanted to go to the beach with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled sadly. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s dumb, isn\u2019t it? I should get over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e looked directly into your very soul. \u201cIt\u2019s NOT dumb, Jake. We\u2019ll go the beach someday and help you conquer this fear, but I won\u2019t rush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kimberly looked deep in thought. \u201cYou put up a fight, I\u2019ll give you that Jake.\u201d She admitted. \u201cHandling college girls isn\u2019t easy.\u201d Her stern gaze fell on Maddie and Sophie, and lightened up a bit. Maddie flashed her a cocky thumbs up, and Sophie managed to wrangle in her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute of silence passed, until\u2026</span></div></div>",

Cassie\u2019s always treated me like an equal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie practically cooed with joy at you and your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shared love, Maddie nodded appreciatively, but Kimberly still looked curious about something. Catching her eye, you noticed the faint shadow of a smile as she leaned forward and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026that\u2019s sweet for you two.\u201d She said. \u201cBut nothing went wrong on that first encounter? That\u2019s impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was about to respond, but you were hit by a sudden memory, long buried. Cutting your fianc\u00e9e off, you replied. \u201cActually, Ms. Smalls, our first meeting was great\u2026but our first date wasn\u2019t quite as nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s cheeks flared to life and she looked away, prompting excited giggles from Sophie. Realizing you had perhaps walked into yet another embarrassing story, you cleared your throat and began. As you spoke, you failed to notice the triumphant glint in Kimberly\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your first meeting with Cassie, she\u2019d given you her room number and told you that you could come over for lunch and a study session the next afternoon. As she walked away, it dawned on you that you\u2019d need to climb four flights of stairs to reach the floor her room was on, but you figured that was hardly a price to pay for another chance to spend time with such a gorgeous, perfect girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hardly able to sleep that night, and when morning came around, you paced anxiously until lunchtime drew near. Racing down the hall from your own dorm room on the first floor, you reached the stairs and began the admittedly laborious chore of scaling four flights to reach Cassie\u2019s floor. You were a bit sore and certainly sweaty when you reached the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the numbers on the doors, you finally spotted Cassie\u2019s room, and knocked politely. No one answered, but you noticed the door was slightly ajar. You assumed this was on purpose, as Cassie had told you she\u2019d meet you for lunch, so you pushed the door open gently and slipped into her dorm room. Unfortunately, your assumption was a bit erroneous. The door was ajar completely by accident, a result of Cassie\u2019s roommate\u2019s carefree nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room, you took in the quaint common area, with a large TV, comfy couch, refrigerator, and microwave. Three doors led out of the room. One was locked, one was open a bit with a light on, and the other was closed but you could hear the sounds of a shower. Once more you made a terrible assumption, and figured Cassie\u2019s room was the open door with the light, and that her roommate was showering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy as could be, you crossed the room and slipped through the open door, only to freeze immediately. Inside the room was a tall, pale girl walking around and picking up discarded clothes and lingerie from the floor. She was beautiful, to be sure, but not Cassie. You\u2019d walked into the wrong room, and this was made all the more horrible because the girl was stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d seen girls naked before, hundreds of times and never on purpose. But it was always a shock, and you froze up, trying and failing to avert your eyes from her. You nearly petrified as the girl turned towards you, but instead of looking at you she merely kept her gaze on her phone. At the same time, she tossed a bunched-up bundle of clothes at you, and you were way too frozen in fear to even think about moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes fell on you, knocking you onto your back and burying you. The wind shot out of you when your head smacked the floor, and you had no idea what had fallen on top of you, other than that it was soft and silky. The powerful aromatic fragrance of scented perfume almost knocked you out, and your attempts to wiggle out from under the clothes you\u2019d been trapped under were pitiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard the muffled sound of the door behind you swinging open. Your curiosity as to who was coming into the room left when the powerful force of a foot slammed down onto the clothing pile you were under, squashing the clothes. Your body squished immediately, unable to escape in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.\u201d Cassie exclaimed, stepping off the pile of her roommate\u2019s clothes. She was still a bit wet from her shower, and was wrapped in only a tight towel. Her sudden entrance drew her roommate\u2019s attention, causing the tall girl to spare her friend a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Cass.\u201d The girl grinned. \u201cI\u2019m just doing a bit of cleaning. It\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that, Mira.\u201d Cassie laughed, her melodic voice reaching you even under the pile of clothes. \u201cI was just wondering if you had any clean clothes I could borrow. Totally forgot I\u2019m due for a wash cycle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah! That pile you just stood on is clean.\u201d Mira winced. \u201cIf your dainty little foot stepping on it still classifies it as clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shrugged. \u201cYeah, guess it\u2019s fine. Thanks!\u201d She bent down, her towel struggling to stay on her slick body, and scooped the clothes up into her arms. Giving her dormmate another smile, she slipped back into the common area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your terrible luck struck once more for the umpteenth time in your life, and your fianc\u00e9e-to-be scooped you up too. In fact, as you felt her warm arms press into you, you felt as if your flattened form was actually sticking just a bit to the article of clothing on top of you. The pressure of Cassie\u2019s foot hadn\u2019t lasted long, but it had apparently been enough, and if you didn\u2019t get free soon, you didn\u2019t even want to consider what would occur next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie dropped the clothes onto the couch, hiding you from view again, and grabbed a bra from the pile. She let her towel fall and then slid the bra into place. Her body was close in size to Mira\u2019s, and they\u2019d shared clothes frequently in the past, so she knew it would fit. Next went a comfy blouse that displayed a tasteful bit of cleavage, not enough to intimidate or distract the cute small guy Cassie still believed hadn\u2019t arrived yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally picked up the clothing you were stuck to, and your heart dropped as you realized it was a silky pair of panties your body had flattened to. Of course it would be something as humiliating as that. You tried wiggling and squirming a bit, but you\u2019d need to reform more before you could manage that, and it seemed Cassie was not giving you that chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the panties low to the ground and then yanked them up her luscious legs, squeezing a bit to get the tight lingerie around her hips and in place at her ass. You found your body stretched taut, but thankfully on the outside of her panties. This meant that you were facing outwards and still visible, though not much more than a goofy, cartoon looking pattern. At least you weren\u2019t inward and hugging her bare flesh. You wanted to know Cassie more, but not like this yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Cassie had no reason to check out her own killer rear, and began picking up the last piece of clothing in Mira\u2019s pile, an attractive skirt. As she dropped it to the ground, Mira herself appeared, having finally dressed into some semblance of an outfit, and sauntered towards the fridge. Her gaze rested on Cassie, Cassie\u2019s butt, and you. She paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRocking those panties, girl!\u201d Mira teased, eliciting a blush from Cassie. \u201cDon\u2019t remember that pattern design though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie finally looked over her shoulder and spotted you. Frowning, she ran her hands along your body, and you squirmed and vibrated as much as possible. Sadly, your tiny movements didn\u2019t get her attention, so she shrugged and looked back at Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s kinda unique, I guess.\u201d Cassie admitted, pulling the skirt up her legs. You mentally screamed out, managing to twitch your squashed body slightly, but unfortunately right as Mira looked away to turn to the fridge. Your vision vanished into darkness as Cassie pulled up the skirt and adjusted it, and the extra layer of tightness kept you pinned and unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but in treating me like a normal person, Cassie had never found out about my squishy and stretchy nature during our talk in class. As such, she had no reason to suspect I could do anything like be reduced to a flat, squashed sticker on a pair of panties. I spent the next eight hours trapped as she waited for me to show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stammered out an interjection. \u201cB-but I eventually figured it out. It only took until\u2026that night, when I took the panties off and you reformed.\u201d Your fianc\u00e9e blushed again. \u201cA-and then\u2026Mira came stumbling over, drunk, tripped and fell on you, crushing you under her boobs. It took another ten minutes to peel you away from her. She\u2019s a handful while plastered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced, but couldn\u2019t help but share a small smile with Cassie. No matter the incident, each misadventure brought you closer to her. From the contented and amused gazes of her family members, you could tell they had enjoyed the story too (perhaps too much on Sophie\u2019s end).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While reliving some of these past blunders may have been slightly painful for you, at least you could tell you were entertaining your soon-to-be inlaws with them. And after all, you were still alive to tell the tale so weren\u2019t too traumatized by any of these admittedly funny events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating, Jake, really. I\u2019m relieved to hear that you can at least survive all of these random accidents that happen to you. After all if you\u2019re going to be staying with the four of us we can\u2019t guarantee that things like that won\u2019t happen\u201d Kimberly shot you a subtle look as she said that, but simultaneously you could tell by the tone of her voice that you were inch by inch changing her opinion on you. Feeling confident that your story telling method was working well you figured you would sit here all day and answer the Smalls\u2019 questions until they were satisfied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping that either Sophie or Maddie would ask you a more lighthearted question next, but sadly Kimberly\u2019s commanding voice rang out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Jake, you\u2019ve really piqued my interest with these stories I must admit. Hearing about how you must be constantly vigilant and clever to escape situations that would just be everyday events for us normal-sized women is quite intriguing. That being said, I must ask, have you ever been willing to stand up for yourself and even engage in any sort of conflict? Or do you just try to stay out of everyone\u2019s way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by the tone shift of Kimberly\u2019s question that this was yet another important matter to address. It made sense after all, to a woman as imposing as Kimberly it must be important to be able to fight when the situation calls for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for the most part you\u2019re right I try to avoid conflict in general. I\u2019m generally a pretty even-tempered and relaxed guy\u2026 but when push comes to shove I\u2019m not afraid of standing up for myself either! Let me tell you a story about my Aunt Tara\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you said your Aunt\u2019s name you saw Cassie\u2019s face turn from blushing and smiling due to the previous story into immediate annoyance. You\u2019ve told Cassie about your Aunt Tara numerous times in the past, almost none of the stories about her were positive. To put it bluntly, Tara was the most horrific combination of boisterous, conceited, and selfish that you could imagine. While she was rarely outwardly cruel to you, she would constantly belittle you or make rude jokes at your expense whenever you had a family gathering. You had definitely known giantesses in your life who wished to physically harm you more than Tara, but never have you met a woman who gave you less respect than your absolute jerk of an Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGINS)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Fourth of July, 2010, you were 14 years old. Ironically, you would hit a \u201cgrowth spurt\u201d two years later, if you could even call it that. But at this point you stood at an outright laughable 8 inches tall. Your mom was hosting a pool party and barbeque that day, and had invited a number of your relatives and neighbors to join. Since discovering your squishy abilities seven years prior, your mom had been slowly relaxing her vigilant gaze over you with each passing day. While this inevitably led to more and more accidents between the two of you, as well as you and countless other women, you were grateful to at least feel some semblance of freedom as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with this increased freedom came the requirement of being able to handle yourself in big gatherings such as this party since she wouldn\u2019t be around constantly to keep track of your wellbeing. For the most part this was no sweat, you knew practically everyone at the party to be nice enough to you. Unfortunately for you though, there was exactly one person you did have to worry about, your Aunt Tara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently perched on a nearby short wall, doing your best to stay at least a few feet off the ground to avoid any errant steps from party goers. But as you scanned the party and saw your Aunt sitting happily at a folding table, burger in one hand and beer in the other, you couldn\u2019t help but feel your blood boil. Deep down you knew that if you just avoided her that your day would turn out infinitely better, but the sheer level of disrespect that your Aunt gave you inspired this incessant need to argue with her at any given opportunity. Being the most arrogant and stubborn woman you had ever known, she was likely the absolute worst person to argue with. But something inside of you had you convinced that if you could ever win an argument against this woman that she would be forced to give you some semblance of respect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off of the little wall you were on you began your trek towards Tara, taking your time to dodge a few flip flops and bare feet along the way. As you reached the base of the table you noticed a few loose table cloth threads that you would be able to climb up and reach her. After all, starting an argument off at foot level just sounded like a terrible idea overall. Before beginning your ascent you pulled out a few talking points that you had written on notecards in your back pocket. Today you were going to confront Tara about the environment, and more specifically her carbon footprint. You knew that your Aunt couldn\u2019t care less about the environment, hell she showed up to the party today in a literal Hummer! But to you it was the most important topic in the world. You figured that combining your genuine passion for the subject with a fair amount of research prepared meant that there was no way you would lose the argument today! You reviewed your notecards for another minute before putting them away, steeling your nerves, and climbing up the tablecloth onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes but you soon reached the tabletop and got your first look at Tara that day. Involuntarily you rolled your eyes so hard that you thought they might just roll into the back of your head. Her hair was bleached blonde, but clearly not recently as you could see her true brown roots growing in at the same time. Her face was covered almost completely by an enormous pair of gaudy sunglasses. Practically the only part of her face that was visible was her mouth, at least it was visible in between massive bites of her burger and chugs on her can of beer. Now looking at her body, it pissed you off even more so that this woman was somehow still quite attractive. Her gluttonous habits that she was currently displaying somehow only sent the weight towards her hips and bust, leaving her with a small amount of extra weight, but distributed in the most fortunate way possible. Her skin was an unnatural shade of tan that was no doubt due to a spray or tanning bed. And to top it all off, her sizable assets were being covered by an inappropriately small American flag patterned bikini. Regardless of the scandalous way she showed herself off, she was your Aunt after all so you felt no actual attraction towards this woman. Walking across the table, at 9 inches tall it wasn\u2019t like you were bug-sized so Tara took notice of you immediately. She took her sunglasses off and popped the last bite of her burger into her mouth, immediately beginning to speak while chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey pipsqueak!\u201d She muffled out disgustingly over her full mouth, before thankfully swallowing and continuing, \u201cNot gonna lie I fully expected you to be squashed flat by this time during the party so good job I guess!\u201d Tara laughed heartily and reached out with her hand to give you what she thought would be a noogie. Immediately her massive hand knocked you over effortlessly, vastly overpowering your standing position without her even trying. She luckily saw this and didn\u2019t press down further, recoiling her hand and continuing to talk, \u201cWhoops sorry short-stuff, you\u2019re just like light as a feather! I mean damn you sure you ain\u2019t shrinking nowadays? I swear even my boob is twice the size of you!\u201d She promptly cupped one massive, bikini clad breast in her hand and hoisted it in the air briefly before breaking into another round of laughter. You took the moment to stand yourself back up and brush yourself off. In reality you had grown roughly an inch since she had last seen you, the only thing was that so had she. Her ridiculously lucky genetics meant that the weight she had gained had gone straight to her breasts and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your mind back on track you steeled yourself and began talking, albeit in a fairly nervous manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Aunt Tara. I have actually grown an inch since we last saw each other. It seems like you have gained a few inches\u2026 in other areas besides height though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Aunt narrowed her eyes and smirked before responding, \u201cHeh good one shrimp, but when I gain an inch I just get hotter and hotter, if you ever gained an inch it would practically double your height.\u201d Tara laughed at her own joke again before taking a large triumphant swig of her beer. Immediately her demeaning insult stung you much worse than you did to her, so deciding personal attacks wasn\u2019t going to get you anywhere you began to talk about the points you had prepared.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEhem, well Tara, I wanted to talk to you today about climate change and what we can do about it.\u201d As you talked, Tara leaned back in her chair and chugged the rest of her beer quickly, finishing it off with a powerful burp. Nevertheless you attempted to press on. \u201cAunt Tara, I believe you are making too big of a carbon footprint\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Oh uhh sure.\u201d Tara talked over you, clearly not listening to a single word that you were saying already. She then scooted her chair back a foot and lifted her legs up, slamming her feet onto the table mere inches away from you. In reality she wasn\u2019t looking where she was putting her legs one bit, and it was just coincidence that she didn\u2019t pulverize you under her heels. Now, each of Tara\u2019s feet, slightly dirty from the backyard, stood an inch or so taller than you did. She continued speaking, \u201cYou said something about my footprint, right? I figured you would get enough interaction with feet enough in your life but if you\u2019re interested check em out!\u201d Immediately you were frustrated beyond belief. Like usual, she wasn\u2019t giving you an ounce of respect, and was more preoccupied with drinking her beer and relaxing than listening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Tara! Please will you move your feet! I was talking about a CARBON footprint, not your literal gross footprint. You know, as in like pollution?\u201d Exasperated you tried to get through to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah I\u2019m way too comfortable now like this, little guy. Just pretend they aren\u2019t even there and keep saying whatever you\u2019re saying. Did you say pollution though? I heard that\u2019s all just a myth and the world is gonna cool down again eventually.\u201d Tara concluded her idiotic statement as if it was fact before wiggling her toes in the breeze. You saw small bits of dirt and grass fall off of them as she did this and you stepped further away from them, sufficiently grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true! 99% of scientists are saying that we need to cut down on our emissions, and cars like that Hummer of yours are a big part of the problem! You should look into selling it and getting an electric vehicle in my opinio\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh hold up one sec, tiny, I\u2019ll be back in a jiff. I need a beer if you\u2019re gonna keep annoying me like this.\u201d Tara talked completely over you once more before standing up from her chair and walking a short distance towards the cooler. You saw her matching American flag bikini bottoms get slowly swallowed up between her enormous, jiggly ass cheeks and grimaced. A couple more months of eating the way that she did and those wouldn\u2019t fit at all anymore. You were fed up, none of your talking points were making any progress with this obstinate woman. Moreover, if she came back and plopped her feet up next to you again you knew there was no way she would start listening to you at all. Looking into her empty chair you came up with a brilliant idea! If she was so selfish that she believed she was entitled to do whatever she wanted then you would show her some selfishness by claiming her chair as your own too! Surely when she came back from getting a beer she would be forced to see the irony of the situation and maybe even listen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off of the table you landed a foot below, squishing your feet slightly but nothing you couldn\u2019t handle. Looking outwards you saw that Tara had turned around and began walking back towards you. As she approached you swore you locked eyes for the briefest moment before she grinned smugly and began scanning the rest of the party. Finally she reached you and you had already begun rubbing what you thought was such a clever plan in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it when someone takes something of your\u2026\u201d In a split second before you could even get a sentence out, Tara grabbed the back of her chair with one hand before spinning 180 degrees around and presenting her enormous, American flag covered ass to your body. You didn\u2019t even have a second to process what was happening before the mountain of butt looming above you began to rapidly descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*plop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s ass hit the chair with the force of what felt like a meteor striking the Earth. Her warm, slightly sweaty flesh on her left butt cheek flattened and expanded as she put more and more weight onto the chair, easily enveloping the entire plastic surface. The pressure she put onto your body by simply sitting down was tremendous. Now cracking open a fresh beer, your Aunt Tara smirked before placing her feet back up on the table. Feigning total innocence she spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I\u2019m all ears, Jake! I very much want to hear what you have to say about the environment! The weight on my conscience is just *crushing* and I feel like I\u2019m really making an *ass* out of myself by not knowing more about the topic!\u201d With every keyword she spoke you could just barely make out what she was saying beneath mounds of ass flesh. But from what you could hear she was clearly mocking your serious argument. She continued, \u201cSeriously, Jake, I feel like you\u2019re so knowledgeable about the subject that you teaching me would be even better than finding a pirate\u2019s *booty*... alright that one wasn\u2019t great I\u2019ll admit but I\u2019m not even sure if you can hear me right now anyway!\u201d Tara laughed uproariously at how easily she \u201cwon\u201d the argument in her mind, taking a moment to relax further and take a victory sip of her beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(END FLASHBACK)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeedless to say I don\u2019t involve myself in conflicts often, but trust me I will put myself in harm\u2019s way if and when I need to! Even if it doesn\u2019t always end up well for me. For those still interested, my mom luckily noticed me around a half hour later when my Aunt laid down to tan. With some doing she peeled me off, but deep down in my heart I feel like I at least reached her a little bit with my words!\u201d You finished your story to another round of amused Smalls\u2019 faces, all except for Chelsea\u2019s of course. Her naturally empathetic nature meant that she hated hearing about how terrible your Aunt Tara was to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kimberly, Sophie, and Maddie seemed to all enjoy the story! Maddie appreciated your determination even in the face of great odds, Sophie mostly giggled at the physical things that happened to you, and Kimberly was interested to hear that you could at least survive dealing with more imposing women in your life.</span></div></div>",

Each one taking an interest in another facet of your story. It seemed evident that they all wanted to ask you specific questions about your past, and you figured you didn't have much of a choice other than to just sit there and listen to them. If it meant that you were slowly but surely winning them over then you would tell these tales til the end of time. Or at least, until everyone figured out something else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to ask you another question was actually Sophie! Speaking up in her chipper voice she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I can't believe all the crazy stuff that's happened to you! Your stories are so cool!\" Sophie said with a giggle before continuing, \"I gotta know, have you ever been like used as an object or something like that!? I'm sorry if that's too personal but I always find it so funny in old cartoons when a character would transform into something entirely different! It was just so wacky and fun, I loved it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced internally but hid the feeling on the outside. Sophie\u2019s near childlike wonder and happiness with which she asked the question hid did not match the terrible times in which you were used more like an inanimate object than a human being. In reality, it was one of the most humiliating types of experiences that you had been subjected to in your life. After all, being squashed in one way or another was tough on its own, but quite literally serving the purpose of a random item was one of the most dehumanizing aspects of your life. Like the rest of the quirks that came along with your bizarre life, you had sadly grown accustomed to it over the years, but by no means did you ever come near enjoying it. Despite these true feelings boiling up inside of you from just hearing the question, you knew that satiating Sophie's interest would be a much better option than awkwardly avoiding the topic entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah Sophie, I actually do have quite a few of those stories as well. Lots of women over the years have kind of used me as you put it, some of the times being worse than others. In fact... the entire reason that I went to the same college as Cassie despite it being so far away from my hometown was due to this very thing.\" Gauging the room briefly it seemed you once again had the Smalls women entranced. Maybe becoming some sort of motivational speaker would be a solid career choice for you. All jokes aside you continued, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, over the years that I grew up my mom began to worry less and less about me. Part of this was due to my Aunt Tara's influence, but part of it was just the natural progression of her recognizing me growing up. By no means did she ever start to treat me like Tara did, but it was safe to say that she eased up on the paranoia about my well being as time passed. Accidents between us became increasingly more common, and as a result, her reactions to finding me in these predicaments mellowed out as well. All of this came to a critical point right around when I was 16 years old... when she started to use me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for Cassie, who had heard this from you before, the rest of the Smalls women's mouths opened in shock. Even Kimberly's normally calm and collected demeanor had shifted to being stunned. You knew that opening yourself up to further questioning would only complicate the matter so you decided to jump right into the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From age 16 up until I was 18 and leaving for college, her using me as replacements for everyday items became terrifyingly common. Again I need to stress that she never did it malevolently, more like she never understood quite how tough the whole process was on me. And sadly on my part, I never really had the guts to tell her no. I felt like I love and respected my mom too much to deny any of her requests... as any family should!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's face contorted ever so slightly into a contented smile, one which you were elated to witness even though your attempt at flattery was a bit heavy handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess the place that I should start would be the very first time she ever asked to use me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Begins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly 8 years ago, you were 16 years old and not quite full height at 10 inches tall. It was a Saturday sometime in the Spring and you were out in the backyard planting some vegetables as a hobby to do with you and your mom. Well to be honest she was doing most of the work, your job was to stand by and hold the seeds and saplings that would be dumped into the soil. The various trowels and shovels that she was using to dig holes with were many times bigger and heavier than you were, so using them in any efficient way would be impossible. As your mom dug away and prepared each plant to be planted, you naturally were bored out of your mind. Looking up at your mom in what would be your 5th attempt now at asking if you could leave, you noticed how exhausted she looked. Sweat poured down her face and began to darken her white tank top, even beginning to show on parts of the old blue jeans that she was wearing. However the most noticeable thing of all was the fact that her long brown hair fell all over her face every time she bent over. Taking this as an opportunity to poke fun at your mom and perhaps alleviate some of the monotonous boredom you had been feeling you spoke up to her in the most theatric voice you could,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom cracked a smile while striking the dirt beside you two with a shovel, \"Very funny, Jake. I get it I need a haircut, it's so annoyingly long right now and I couldn't find a single hair tie in the house. I feel like I could work 10 times faster if I could just tie my stupid hair up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that you could be done with this boring task quicker, your mind came quickly to the idea of you sitting on top of her head holding her hair up like some snake charmer. \"Put me up there maybe I can keep that wild mane in check while you work! After all I'm not doing much down here anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom looked down at you stopped what she was doing, her eyes opening wide with more surprise than you had initially expected. \"Uhh really, Jake? I mean I know you can do some incredible things with your unique characteristics, but I wouldn't want you to put yourself through all of that just to help me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot understanding your mom's apparent apprehension, you doubled down, \"It's not a big deal at all! Get me up there and that way we can finish all this quicker too so I can go back to playing games inside. It's a win-win for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom took another second to process what you were saying, and you began to wonder what was holding her up so much about literally placing you on top of her head. Sure it was a bit strange, but based on the amount of time you've underneath, attached to, or worst of all inside of your mom over the years it really wasn't all that ridiculous. She finally responded, \"Well, okay! This is really helpful, Jake! I appreciate that you are willing to do things like this for me now!\" As she continued talking she dropped the shovel and bent over to pick you up. \"To be completely honest I've had a few times in the past where you would have come in quite handy but I never knew how you would react if I just up and asked! But know I know and I just have to say it's great to have this as an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom finished her lengthy diatribe, you were carried not towards the top of her head, but right in front of her instead. Utterly confused about what was happening, you looked up at your mom just long enough to see her smiling face be replaced by her massive hands. It was at that exact moment that you realized that there must have been a critical misunderstanding between what you were signing up for and what your mom wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately your gummy legs were bent backwards and you felt your body be rolled up into a hooplike shape. Then, still silently your mom pinched her fingers together forcefully, sealing your limbs together in this position. It was a rather quick transformation, but effective handiwork on the part of your mom. She had coiled your body into itself and in a matter of seconds had turned you from human into a makeshift hair tie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again, Jake! This is so nice of you, I'll be done in a jiff!\" Your mom said cheerily, giving you one last look before swinging you up behind her head. You couldn't believe what was happening. Somehow you had given your mom the impression that you had offered to be used as her personal hair tie. You had of course been used in the past by some of the less kind women in your life, but this time was different. If even your mom could now use you as an item instead of treating you like a person, what hope did you have of living a normal life? In a cosmically twisted way of answering your question, your mom deftly stretched you out slightly before looping her long brown hair through your new form. Perhaps you really were cursed to a life of torture from each and every giantess in your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback End)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make the rest of the story short, she used me as a hair tie for the rest of the gardening, which ended up taking two excruciatingly long hours. Then she went to the grocery store... and book club with her friends... then got something to eat all with me up there. I could see clear as day but from the position I was in my mouth never reformed. Luckily when she took me off to get in the shower she placed me on the counter, and as she stepped out she finally saw my still visible and frankly sunburnt face looking up at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie somehow giggled the entire way through your story, Kimberly looked evidently like her brain was racing with ideas, and Maddie looked nearly as shocked as Cassie was the first time you told her this. This was only the precursor to the story you meant to tell Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale you wished to tell of your mom using you was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOkay, this next story is a doozy, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to build up to.\u201d You explained to the four giantesses sitting before you, hanging off your every word. A faint blush of embarrassment in your cheeks, you cleared your throat. \u201cThis was only a few months later from that gardening incident, and though it was awful at the time, it very well changed my life for the better, in every way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, you knew that this moment was coming. Still, watching your nearly nude mother walk over towards you, one hand trying and mostly failing to keep her bath towel modestly wrapped around her, the other hand curled nervously against her chin, a sense of impending dread welled up within you. A bit unconsciously, you took a step back, and soon had to crane your neck higher and higher as your mom came to a stop beside you, towering over you and looking down with a conflicted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d been helping your mom pick up the laundry all morning, and it had been fairly uneventful. Truthfully, you weren\u2019t helping much due to your size, but you were able to shout up to her if you noticed something she wouldn\u2019t, lick underwear stuck under her bed, or a loose sock left over in a drawer. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was honest work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could be perfect for you for long, unfortunately, and your mom soon bumped her butt into her bedside table while retrieving one final piece of dirty clothes from the floor. Instantly, a few bottles of expensive perfume tipped over, lids snapping open, and the liquidy contents dumped all over the basket of lingerie lying below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perfume had also fell onto your mother herself, who had been dressed in simple jeans and a blouse. She\u2019d screamed in surprise, then shouted angrily at her soaked and most likely ruined lingerie, stained unsightly colors and already beginning to stink of an unholy mix of several different types of perfume. She\u2019d left you on her bed as she retreated from the room and took a quick shower. At the time, you merely laughed at your mom\u2019s clumsiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she returned from the bathroom, still a bit wet and only wearing a bathrobe that left little to the imagination (much to your dismay, as her son), that the nightmare you were in began taking a clearer shape. The entire basket of lingerie was ruined and needed to be thrown out. Heading over to her underwear drawer, your mom discovered with a sinking feeling that all she had left in terms of clean underwear was a simple pair of tan panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned back to face you on her bed, that conflicted look in her eyes and the panties in her hand, that was when you had known what was about to transpire. You mentally grimaced at the very idea, and began to psyche yourself up for a steadfast denial, but seeing your mom creep closer until she towered above you, biting her lip anxiously, and a genuinely upset look in her eyes, your resolve caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake\u2026honey\u2026\u201d Your mom said softly, her voice tentative. \u201cD-do you\u2026do you th-think that maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d You cut her off, crossing your arms. \u201cBut this is the only time. Ever!\u201d You had, of course, guessed that she needed to use your special squishy properties and mold you into a replacement bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, your mom\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly, and she smiled wide with relief. \u201cOh, thank you so much, honey! I\u2019d never ask this of you in any other circumstance, never in a million years!\u201d Her smile faded a bit as a light blush of awkward embarrassment lit up her cheeks. \u201cUh\u2026this will be uncomfortable, but I swear it won\u2019t last any longer than it has to. Once my trip is over and done with, you\u2019ll be free. I\u2019ll definitely do something great to reward you, maybe buy that new video game for you, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to offer a witty response to your mom\u2019s offer, but your words failed you as your mom let her bathrobe fall off her shoulders and onto the floor. Instantly, you burned a blazing red, and you squeezed your eyes shut tight, listening only to the sounds of your mom sliding the panties up her legs and settling them in place around her butt. Finally, you felt her pick you up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo sorry, sweetie, but you\u2019ll need to be nude for this too.\u201d Your mom looked at you sheepishly. \u201cOtherwise, someone might know what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your mom an incredulous look. How would any normal person possibly suspect that mother would ever turn her son into a bra and then wear him around outside. Before you could voice your criticism of your mother\u2019s questionable judgement, she\u2019d ripped your clothes clean off with her manicured fingernails, and then smashed you flat between her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gummy-like body had been molded into a bra, but only once before. Other shapes had taken precedence. You\u2019d been panties and thongs several times each, usually at the hands of Tara. The only time you\u2019d ever been formed into a bra was when a particularly spiteful girl a few years back had wanted to torment you for spying on her while she was in the bathroom (while in actuality, you\u2019d only ended up in her bathroom because she\u2019d been too consumed by her phone to notice squashing you under her foot, carrying you off the street and into her home, and then finally noticing you in her bathroom).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, you knew what to expect, but it made it no less horrible because it was your mother handling you. She squashed you flat and stretched your head, chest, and back to their limits. She took your arms and legs, pulled them out to a ridiculous length, forming makeshift straps with with to tie around her back. She then balled up her fists and jammed them down onto your face and lower torso, indenting mounds into your malleable frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know more-or-less resembled a bra, and your mother knew that she\u2019d get the full look only after putting you on. Sparing you one more cringe of shared uncomfortableness, she flipped your body and held you in front of her bare chest. Moving you forward, she carefully slipped one breast at a time into the curved cups that had been imprinted into your body. Her movements were delicate, but there was only so much she could do to make it pleasant for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were quite large (not Tara-sized, but bigger than average), and it was all your squishy body could do to withstand them. Her right breasts slid into the cup formed out of your head and upper torso, smooth jiggly flesh spilling into every available crevice. Her hot flesh pressed against you tightly, sticking to every inch of you. Her nipple rested right onto your face, and sweat already began to coat your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other breast was perhaps even worse, as her left boob settled into place in the cup made from your lower torso and waist. It was equally as tight and stuffy, your entire body pulled as taut as could be to support your mother\u2019s mammaries. Her left nipple also jabbed lightly into your flattened crotch, an indescribably horrific experience, both from the discomfort and from the sheer abysmal humiliation of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother bit down on a small smile as she firmly fit her breasts into your bra-shaped body. She hated every fiber of her being for thinking so, but you genuinely were a very comfortable bra, perhaps more so than any she\u2019d worn before. As she dragged your stringy arms and legs over her shoulders and around her back, tying them into tight triple knots, so completely released hold on you, and marveled at how perfectly you supported the weight of her chest. Frankly, it was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was much less amazing for you, who felt the crushing weight of your new lot in life as soon as your mother released her hold on you. Your body sagged just slightly, but otherwise held. Your arms and legs screamed with pain at the tension of holding your mom\u2019s boobs, but her triple knots were far too tight to snap easily, and you knew your squishy body wouldn\u2019t leave this shape unless otherwise forced to. Your mom\u2019s tits squeezed into you, her soft flesh pushing into your own body, enveloping it. You hardly covered much of her breasts, just about half of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring herself in the mirror, your mom rubbed an affection finger down your back. \u201cAgain, so sorry for this Jake, sweetie, but I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you right as I get home from my trip. I\u2019ll take you off, let you reform, and then buy you anything you want.\u201d Your mom reached into her closet for a replacement outfit. \u201cOh! And I swear I won\u2019t forget you, either. I promise, honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely hear her words, muffled as they were, and knew deep down that your fate was wholly in her hands. All you could do was be a good bra and do your supportive job...wherever her trip was. You didn't even know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK CONTINUES\u2026)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mother pulled new clothes out of the closet, form-fitting but comfy black leggings and a tasteful yet appealing purple blouse. Shimming the leggings up her hips was one thing, but dragging the blouse down over her head and around her chest was another. It wasn\u2019t tight, but it was certainly snug, and the extra layer of purple fabric pressed firmly in on your body, squishing you against your mother\u2019s plump breasts just a bit more than before. Of course, you were also completely hidden from the outside world now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the bit of cleavage exposed by her blouse, your mother offered a small smile, forgetting that you couldn\u2019t quite see her face with your own eyes jamming into her right nipple. \u201cOkay, Jake, this is the last time I can talk to you until I get home later. Just hang in there, and\u2026oh, oops!\u201d Your mom giggled at her unintentional jab at your situation. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2026thank you again for doing this. I promise it won\u2019t be a second longer than it needs to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother slipped into some flip-flops, gathered up her purse, and started downstairs. Though you were a very supportive bra-molded man, even you couldn\u2019t quite stop your mother\u2019s large breasts from quaking and bouncing as she descended the stairs from the second floor. Her fleshy globes smacked into you, quivering like a bowl of jello. Still more sweat dripped onto you, and the temperature seemed to have risen by ten degrees ever since she\u2019d slipped into the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the front door, your mother paused for a second. \u201cOh, and in case you were wondering, I\u2019m visiting the Eagleton University community fair! You know that I never like this miss those fairs!\u201d Smiling brightly, your mother left the house, strolled out to her car, and slid into the driver\u2019s seat. Starting up the car, she took off down the road, switching the radio onto a pleasant little tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were mostly garbled, crushed as you were into her tits and covered up by her blouse, but you did hear her say \u201cEagleton University\u201d. Instantly, you remembered that their community fair was today. Eagleton was the local college for your area, only twenty minutes away, and was a popular destination for graduating high school seniors who didn\u2019t want to head out too far from home so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a modest university, but big enough to offer a multitude of degrees and four-year programs should students choose to stay instead of transferring. There were several large class buildings and lecture halls, a wide spacious yard, and also a gym and indoor pool. Eagleton was well-known for miles around for hosting annual community fairs that offered games, music, food, prizes, and other free experiences. Your mom attend each year faithfully (occasionally with you in tow, usually crushed to her butt or shoe).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver wasn\u2019t too long, all things considered, but you still suffered immensely. You could acutely feel every turn and bump in the road, your mother\u2019s boobs jostling with the slightest of movements. Her flesh pressed down on you heavily, your strained and taut body groaning with agony at supporting the hefty weight of her chest. Her sweat was also beginning to cloud up your eyes, and you were too stretched flat to blink the droplets away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagleton University was already quite crowded by the time your mother arrived, but parking was plentiful. Once she found a space, your mother wasted no time sprinting towards the wide yard on the campus, which was filled to the brim with food stalls, carnival games, and students from the music program performing concerts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother drew looks from all passerbys as she ran, though she was too caught up in the excitement to notice. After all, her gratuitously sized chest heaved and jiggled as she ran, perfectly round breasts bouncing methodically side-to-side. One poor boy was so caught up in staring that he tripped and fell flat on the concrete, cutting his nose open. Still your mother dashed forward energetically, her gaze having already glued itself on the closest funnel cake stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too noticed the effects of your mother\u2019s running, but in an entirely different sense. Your whole body was shaken up and down vigorously and violently, your mother\u2019s boobs squeezing the life out of you. Your backside was smeared up and down against her tight blouse, and the heavy weight of her tits pulled at your limp arms and legs, threatening to rip them apart. You let out a mute whimper, begging your mom to slow down, all while her breast flesh pushed harder still into the squishy confines of your cup-indented body. She was nearly suffocating you to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo preoccupied with running, your mother didn\u2019t notice a woman knelt down and lacing up her sneakers, directly in your mom\u2019s path. It was only as the woman stood back to her full height that your mother gasped and tried to screech to a stop, but too late. The other woman cried out, and then both giantesses collided, their equally abundant chests crashing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one horribly hellish moment, two immovable objects collided with unstoppable force. The twin mounds of your mother squeezed into the squishy, fleshy globes of the other woman, flesh rippling from the impact. Your body was decimated between them, and you let out a muffled cry, which tormented you even further. Your squashed mouth opening slightly from the pain, your mother\u2019s breast slid in instead, forcing a mouthful of her hot, sweat-coated flesh right into your mouth. Her breast flesh kept your mouth held tightly, and uncomfortably, open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom pulled back after a second, blushing intensely at her mistake. \u201cI am so, so sorry. Please forgive me.\u201d She stammered, avoiding eye contact with the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt ain\u2019t no worry, honey. Shoot, mah boys can dish \u2018em out AND take \u2018em.\u201d The woman laughed heartily, indicating the fully developed swell of her chest. The curvature of each breast was highly noticeable, even under an adorable blue sweater. The woman, who had platinum blonde hair, deeply tanned skin, and dark eyes, was also wearing ripped jeans and the aforementioned sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother took a second to brush back her hair before replying. \u201cWell, I still should\u2019ve been watching where I was going.\u201d She took a deep breath and then offered the woman a smile. \u201cDreams of funnel cake were getting to my brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed again, rich and infectious. \u201cAin\u2019t that the truth, darlin\u2019. Why, I\u2019ve done eaten about three of the dang things just in the past hour!\u201d She grinned. \u201cAin\u2019t sayin\u2019 I\u2019ll deny a fourth, if you wanna tag along?\u201d Her soothing, Southern twang accentuated each word, and her dazzling smile was irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother shrugged. \u201cSure, why not? Fairs like this one are much more enjoyable with a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s big grin somehow spread even wider. \u201cTha\u2019s what I like to hear, darlin\u2019.\u201d She grabbed up your mother\u2019s hand, and began leading her to the funnel cake stall. \u201cMah name is Rosie May Culverfield, but ya can just call me Rosie, sweetie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Rosie!\u201d Your mother basked in Rosie\u2019s energetic light of life, and flashed her a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the two women immediately became friends. They stuffed their faces with funnel cake, sat and listened to a few student performers, and Rosie won a big stuffed unicorn for your mom by acing the bottle ring toss game. The two women hardly went a minute without giggling like school children, and soon began swapping stories about their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom explained how she spent most of her days at home, but still went in to work at least a few times a week. She touched on you, but only briefly, and avoided mentioning your squishy traits, or even that you were less than a foot tall. Rosie, in turn, shared that she was a farm owner who lived a few hours away, and she\u2019d driven up for a day of rest while her daughters stayed home to tend to the farm work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter polishing off a scrumptious chocolate parfait, your mother rubbed her tummy affectionately. Simultaneously, she flapped the bottom of her blouse, letting some cool breezes flow up her stomach to her chest. Her breasts were thoroughly soaked in sweat, and by extension, so were you. It was causing your mom a good deal of discomfort, but not enough to distract from the amazing day she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, ya know what I reckon we oughta do?\u201d Rosie said, leaning back in her chair to stretch. \u201cI heard down the grapevine that there\u2019s a swim contest of some kind or other. It\u2019s bein\u2019 held at the indoor pool. \u2018Parently, anyone can enter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom eyed Rosie suspiciously. \u201cSo\u2026you want to go watch?\u201d She inquired, and Rosie huffed out a laugh and looked at her intently. Your mom blinked, and then paled. \u201cWhat? You want me to enter? Goodness, I don\u2019t even have a swimsuit with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie laughed brightly. \u201cAh want both of us to enter, silly thang.\u201d She pushed herself up from the table. \u201c \u2018Sides, the school provides swimsuits for all participants to borrow. That may, we\u2019re all on equal ground\u2026or water, as it were.\u201d The energetic giantess helped your still unsure mother to her feet, and gazed intently at her. \u201cI swear on my life it\u2019ll be fun. Whaddya say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your mother caved. \u201cOkay, fine. Only because we\u2019re doing it together.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosie winked at her. \u201cThere\u2019s a good sport, honey.\u201d She then ran off towards the pool area, dragging your mother along behind her. Once more, you found yourself pounding over and over by hot, slick flesh as your mother ran. You\u2019d barely heard anything all day because of your muffled position, but you knew enough about the situation to dislike this Rosie woman for dragging your mom into situations that kept tormenting you. You knew it wasn\u2019t really her fault, but there wasn\u2019t much you could do while clinging tightly to your mother\u2019s massive mammaries besides entertain grudges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the women\u2019s locker room by the indoor pool, your mom and Rosie found it mostly empty. A glance at the clock let them know that they were nearly late for the competition. Thusly, they wasted no time in stripping out of their clothes, though your mother pointedly avoided looking at Rosie\u2019s gorgeously tanned and nude body, as the platinum blonde wandered over to the stack of swimsuits to borrow, and returned with suitable choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom took you off, your bra-shaped body peeled away from her with a wet \u201cslurp\u201d, your whole being caked in a sheen of sweat. Every bit of you felt weak and faint, and you internally sagged with relief as your mother untied your straps behind her back and let your body go limp. Moving you away from her chest, your mother\u2019s gaze locked onto you, and her eyes widened. Something like recognition flashed in her eyes, and as you gazed blurrily up at her, you realized that she truly had forgotten all about you up until this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother spared you a sheepish smile, faintly blushing at her own forgetfulness. She knew she hadn\u2019t been treating you with care at all over the past few hours. The moment she\u2019d bumped into Rosie, she\u2019d totally forgotten about her son-turned-bra, all thoughts of keeping her movements restrained and easing the pressure from you slipped from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, in her moment of recognition, she hesitated, and Rosie turned to spot her. \u201cHey, honey, why are ya\u2019ll starin\u2019 at your bra? Somethin\u2019 funny \u2018bout it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom froze, the familial look in her eye turning into one of panic. Before she could react, Rosie shuffled next to her, the still fully nude woman peering down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang, that might be the weirdest design I ever did see.\u201d Rosie shook her head and laughed. \u201cLittle squished guy, huh? Feel bad for \u2018em, a bit. Holdin\u2019 up your nice ol\u2019 chest all day must get mighty tirin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom burned beet red at Rosie\u2019s unintentionally ironic statements. \u201cU-uh huh, yep. Weird design\u2026right. It\u2019s an old g-gift\u2026from a friend.\u201d She tried to smile inconspicuously at Rosie, all while she walked over to the sprawling row of lockers, flung one open, and tossed you inside. \u201cA-anyway\u2026let\u2019s get changed. We only have a minute or two left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, darlin\u2019.\u201d Rosie nodded, handing your mother the school swimsuit sized for her. Even still, your mom and Rosie barely fit into their respective swimsuits, the elastic fabric of the one-piece bikinis clinging to them like a second skin. Deep cleavage was revealed on both of their bodies, along with nearly all of their eye-catchingly huge derrieres. Still, they fit, and thus rushed out of the locker room without a second thought, just barely managing to join the swim competition before it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft behind in the dark locker, only one thought concerned you, and it filled you to the core with fear. In her embarrassed haste to push you out of sight, your mom had thrown you into the first locker she\u2019d blindly reached for\u2026and had completely failed to notice that it was already taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes of quiet passed inside the dark locker, only a few strains of light slipping in from the holes. You couldn\u2019t see much, but you could tell that you were resting atop some sort of fabric, maybe more than one piece of fabric. It was probably an article of clothing or two, but as for what specifically, you had no idea. You were lying with your cups facing down; therefore your face was looking out and up at the empty locker\u2019s ceiling, and the light slipping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d thought about trying to reform over the past thirty minutes, but you quickly abandoned the idea. It was most likely impossible for you to reverse the damage your mother had done and reform to normal in the time it\u2019d take her to return from the swim competition with Rosie. Also, you\u2019d been skimping out on the job she\u2019d tasked you with, and be leaving her without a top for the rest of the day. Not to mention that she\u2019d be quite upset, and your mom never shied away from punishing you when you misbehaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you\u2019d sat and done nothing but dwell with your thoughts. More specifically, you fought desperately to shove aside the images of your naked mom, or the feeling of her fully developed breast crushing down on you, nipple jabbing into your face. It was horribly intimate and gross, and nothing you ever wanted to experience with your own mom after this day was done. In fact, you considered asking for an apology from her once this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, you heard a faint clicking sound, then a much louder slam. From what you inferred, it was the door to the female locker room opening and then closing, presumably since someone was entering. You could also hear a feminine voice talking and laughing. Figuring that this was your mom and her newfound best friend, you mentally psyched yourself up to be worn again, and pushed the stirrings of potential disaster from your mind. Everything would work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least you told yourself that up until the locker door swung wide, light flooded in, and the silhouette of a girl filled your vision. As your eyes cleared, you realized that she was distinctly NOT your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer more youthful appearance suggested she was about twenty, and her smooth skin was a shade paler than your mother\u2019s. This was to say nothing of her wavy black hair, dyed with bright blue streaks. As your vision materialized more still, you noticed her head was tilted, pressing a phone between her ear and her shoulder. As the girl laughed, her voice surprisingly lower pitched than you expected, you realized she was on the phone with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly looking at you at all, the girl grabbed your body and yanked you from the locker, as well as the rest of her clothes. In her haste, she didn\u2019t even notice as a tan bra, which had been wedged under all of her other clothes, fluttered to the ground by the locker, and the girl walked ten feet away to a spacious bench. The bra left behind was her old one, the one she\u2019d worn here, and she\u2019d confused you for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping everything onto the bench, you tried to respectfully avert your gaze from the fully naked college girl, but were too crushed to do anything but look straight at her instead. She towered over you, and you tensed with fear as she casually and one-handedly slid a tan thong up her long legs and over her toned buttocks, then pulled up a pair of fairly immodest short shorts over top. All the while, she talked with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, those two ladies were damned beasts out there.\u201d The girl laughed huskily. \u201cCrazy fast swimmers. I got knocked out in the semi-final race.\u201d She paused to adjust her short shorts. \u201cHuh? Yeah, I\u2019m done, and changing now. I\u2019ll be over in a hot sec.\u201d The girl smirked. \u201cOh, just because I lost at swimming doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t beat your ass in whatever dumb video game we\u2019re playing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, the girl bent down and picked you up, lifting you up to her chest. You fought and struggled with every fiber of your being, but your mother had decimated you far too thoroughly to even think of moving or speaking. You were hopeless, powerless to stop this oblivious college girl from having her way with you. Still, she did lock eyes with you, and her cute smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, don\u2019t remember this bra having such a gross design. Super weird.\u201d The girl snorted, her glimmering eyes peering closely at you. \u201cLooks like a cartoony perverted all crushed up in each cup. And\u2026oh my god! His dick is the left cup!\u201d She laughed loudly. \u201cHey, why did you let me borrow this kinky underwear? I\u2019m giving this right back to you when I get over there.\u201d The girl paused, and the lightest hint of red blossomed in her cheeks after a second. \u201cYou think you can rip the bra off of me, huh? Alright, give me twenty minutes, then I\u2019ll teach you about talking dirty to Vanessa Weatherston!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed again, husky and deep, and shut off her phone, setting it aside. Without another thought, she slammed you into her chest, and put you on. You internally screamed the whole time, but it was useless. Vanessa squeezed her sizable breasts into your left cup and your right, her boobs squashing into your face and crotch just like your mother\u2019s had all day. Vanessa\u2019s breasts were a bit smaller than your mother\u2019s, but not by much. She still easily filled the space your bra-molded body provided, her plush boobs sinking into you, and you into them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While this was going on, your mother and Rosie finally re-entered the locker room, laughing and smiling brightly at their win. Upon noticing Vanessa, your mother sobered up a bit, and gave her a smile. \u201cGood job out there, Vanessa. You did amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa turned over her shoulder to give them a knowing smirk. \u201cFourth place doesn\u2019t get a prize, though. Still, thanks. You two were hella fast! I take it you won.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom blushed at the compliment. \u201cY-yes, actually. Frankly, I don\u2019t know how. I mean, I used to be fast when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t swum seriously in years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie bumped your mom with her butt. \u201cYa tore it up out there, darlin\u2019. No need to be shy. Ah consider mahself fast, but you still beat me through n\u2019 through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back around, Vanessa finished adjusting your body around her tits, and tied your arms and legs into tight knots behind her back. She bounced once to ensure you held, and your body cried out at the agony of her breasts heaving down onto you. Unlike your mother, Vanessa had tied you on lower, so you cupped more of her underboob than straight in front. As such, double the sweaty weight squeezed down on you battered, beaten body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa then moved to put on her top, your mother strolled over to the locker she\u2019d thrown you in earlier, finding it empty. But then she noted the bra lying on the ground, smiled, and bent down to pick it up. Brushing it off, she stripped out of her borrowed swimsuit, dried off a bit, and began to put Vanessa\u2019s actual bra on. Right as she started, her eyes locked onto the cups of the bra, and she frowned. The plain tan coloring was\u2026wrong\u2026for some reason, but she couldn\u2019t immediately think of why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, Vanessa wiggled her top over her head and shoulders. It was a low-cut, midriff bearing crop-top that was incredibly revealing. It settled over her breasts loosely, which thankfully allowed you breathing space, relatively speaking, and partially exposed your body. Not that you thought about it too long, as you were too preoccupied with internally screaming and crying, miniscule tears dripping from your eyes and onto Vanessa\u2019s breasts, but being quickly consumed by her much larger sweat droplets. You were seconds away from being whisked off by this oblivious girl, and a future of constant use as a bra seemed horribly possible, if not inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom\u2019s frown deepened as she stared at the plain tan bra in her hands, and her gaze shifted over to Vanessa, who had just finished slipping into her crop top. The tan bra Vanessa wore, with its occasional discoloration spot and seemingly stretchy nature, almost called to her. The synapses in her brain clicked and sparked, but right before they fully connected, Rosie placed her arm around your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, sweetie!\u201d Rosie smiled warmly. \u201cLet\u2019s get movin\u2019! There\u2019s so much more fun at this fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She shook her head, looked away from Vanessa, and smiled at Rosie. She then began putting on the tan bra in her hands, only to find that it was slightly smaller than expected. In fact, she couldn\u2019t quite fit her gargantuan breasts into the cups, no matter how hard she tried. It was just too tight and painful, which was strange, as the bra she\u2019d worn all day had been heavenly in terms of comfort and support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Vanessa glanced down at her phone as she strolled towards the exit door. Her boobs shook rhythmically as she walked, nauseatingly shaking you around, but wonderfully supporting Vanessa. From her perspective, you were damned near amazing, and she wondered why she hadn\u2019t felt it this morning. Actually, as she thought about it more, she debated keeping you instead of returning you. As pervy as she found the design, this bra was excellent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand on the door, Vanessa was just starting to push it open as Rosie loudly spoke up, looking at your mother. \u201cSay, sweetheart, you said you had a son, right? What age is that little fella?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, your mom\u2019s eyes snapped open, the bra in her hands fell down to the floor, and she cried out shrilly. The synapses had connected, and she whipped her head to Vanessa, eyes wild with panic. The college girl merely looked at her in vague confusion, while absentmindedly adjusting one of your arm-straps a bit more snugly, smooshing your face deeper into her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026something up?\u201d Vanessa inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some explaining, and about ten minutes, but you soon found yourself back against your mother\u2019s chest, squeezed tightly into her warm, soothing bosom. She and Vanessa had traded bras after your mom explained the mix-up, while still refraining from mentioning you. Vanessa was loathe to abandon you, but it was obviously stealing if she refused, so she gave you back. Your mom hastily put you on right away, stealthily rubbing a finger along your back in what you guessed was a caring display of affection\u2026as well as apology for letting things go so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Vanessa headed back out, Rosie glanced at your mom, who was finishing pulling up her leggings. \u201cWhat a quaint lil\u2019 mix-up! Ya\u2019ll almost switched up yer underwear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom winced. \u201cY-yep\u2026uh\u2026anyway! What were you asking about my son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I was just wonderin\u2019 what age the fella was.\u201d Rosie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s just turned sixteen. His name is Jake, and he\u2019ll be ready to finish high school soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then college?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom hesitated, reaching for her purple blouse. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2026maybe. He\u2019s got a unique condition, and I\u2019m scared to let him out of the house for so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie rubbed your mother\u2019s shoulders affectionately. \u201cAh get it, darlin\u2019, I do. My baby girls left me feelin\u2019 empty inside when they left, but it\u2019s a part of \u2018em growin\u2019 up. They came back much better people. Heck, mah oldest came back married!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother thought about this for a bit, and then grinned. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. Thanks, Rosie. I think when I get home, I\u2019ll have a nice long talk with my son about college. He could even attend right here at Eagleton!\u201d She started pulling down her blouse over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie looked thoughtful. \u201cYa know, another friend of mine has a daughter about the age of yer son. I think the pretty thang\u2019s name is\u2026Cassie? Somethin\u2019 like that. She\u2019s an angel, that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom had finished adjusting her blouse by this point, hiding you from the world once more. She smiled at Rosie\u2019s words. \u201cWho knows? Maybe the two of them will meet and be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie laughed, her hearty and uplifting Southern lilt on full display. \u201cHeh, that\u2019d be somethin\u2019 sugar. That\u2019d be somethin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried under your mother\u2019s blouse and firmly adhered to her breasts, you hadn\u2019t heard much of that conversation. Muffled words and phrases about college, something or other about a girl named Cassie. However, you distinctly heard your mother declare her desire to grant you the independence and freedom to adventure off to college by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because you\u2019d spent all day suffering because of your mother\u2019s actions, being used like an object by her. Maybe it was the adventurous and harrowing experiences you\u2019d endured today, suffering torment and unlikely rescues in equal measure. Maybe it was something else entirely, but this moment in time changed you. You began to feel bolder, more empowered. Your overbearing mom was finally, truly coming to terms with you growing up and gaining independence, and you swore right then to take this chance and never look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagleton University, or someone on the other side of the world, it didn\u2019t matter. After high school, you\u2019d leave home behind and find your future out at college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s how it all went down.\u201d You explained, taking a deep breath and coughing a bit to clear your throat. \u201cA crazy, and ridiculous day came to an end. The rest of the day was more of the same, my mom and Rosie playing games and eating food. When my mom got home, she took me off, coaxed my squishy body into reforming, then bought me the newest game console. Well\u2026after crying and cooing over me for her forgetfulness almost turning tragic. I forgave her, and spoke up right then and there about my college plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for Rosie, she had to head back home after the fair. But, a few weeks later, she came back to visit my mom, and the two continued to hang out frequently. Rosie got her first introduction to me\u2026and that was an experience, I\u2019ll tell you. Also, my mom and I went to her farm to visit her family once, which was also crazy, but that isn\u2019t here or there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo end my story, I just want to tell Cassie\u2026I love you.\u201d You looked at your fianc\u00e9e, and fat tears were welling up in her eyes. Her cheeks were red, and her luscious lips quivered. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that Cassie girl Rosie was talking about was you\u2026but I still like to think it was. That we were always going to find each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcluding, Cassie broke into sobs, and leaned down over you, showering you with kisses. Sophie cooed excitedly, and even Maddie and Kimberly were moved and intrigued by your story. Overwhelmed, Cassie excused herself after one more kiss and headed upstairs to cool down. After a minute, you found each of the Smalls women still looking at you intently. You had no idea that your stories could ever have this much effect on someone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All eyes were locked squarely on you as the Smalls women sat around eagerly waiting to hear the next round of wild adventures you\u2019d had with your unique body. Sophie in particular had the widest, goofiest grin of all the girls as she clearly perceived these stories as entirely comical and not like the monumental torture you had to endure. \u201cOoooh! More, more! No offense, Jake but your mom seems like a bit of an airhead...\u201d. Sophie\u2019s family members all rolled their eyes in harmony at the proclamation of this dumb, admittedly dyed, blonde. The irony of the statement washed over you leading you to simply blow out a sigh and respond, \u201cYea...I love her and all but over time she really did become more and more carefree with me. Not to mention she\u2019d quickly jump to her own conclusions to justify using me in whatever way pleased her more and more as I grew up\u201d. Kimberly perked an eyebrow inquisitively before retorting, \u201cCare to elaborate on that more? Your mother sounds like a woman I\u2019d really get along with!\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlossing over Kimberly\u2019s suspicious comment with internal cheer that your mother and potential mother-in-law would be good friends, you decided to dive right into another memory that this time showcased your mom jumping right into action without even asking you! \u201cOf course, Ms. Smalls! In fact this happened just a mere couple weeks after that unfortunate hair tie incident...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Start!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a peaceful Sunday afternoon in your childhood home. At the mature age of 16 your mother was finally comfortable leaving you unattended at home, her overprotective nature peeling away week after week, or as it felt lately with her nonchalant usage of you, day after day. Your mother had left to attend some serene meditation/yoga class at your family friend Jolene\u2019s gym studio, which despite her sweetest pleads, you firmly declined. You wouldn\u2019t be going back there if you could help it; not after you were forced to <i>share</i> a mat with your mom during a particularly crowded class. With the serene music playing and your mom\u2019s eyes consistently shut in deep focus, it didn\u2019t take long before you were nothing more than a smear on your mother\u2019s body...but that was an awful story for another time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you were simply enjoying some nice cartoons while the warm afternoon sun shined in through the window. Without any worry of some curvy broad dropping her ass on you, you were finally free to relax a bit and take advantage of your size. The TV was like a movie theater size and you were able to comfortably fit on a couch throw-pillow like it was a massive bean bag chair! Your pillow was a bit flat if only due to your moms heavy weight consistently squashing it, but to you it was just right. You had finished a half of a Twinkie, which at your size might as well have been five of them, and were saving the rest for later since they were hard to come by with your mom having a particularly ravenous sweet tooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sugar high had long passed you and now the food coma was setting in fast. You suddenly felt the warm sun and comfy pillow you were using start to affect you as your eyelids got heavier and heavier. Usually you\u2019d snap yourself out of it, due to the <i>obvious</i> danger of falling asleep on the couch in the same house as your mom and often Tara, but today you felt you truly had nothing to worry about. Casting your worries aside, you let your eyes shut for what you perceived as nothing more than an innocent afternoon nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere hour later and your mom was already finished with her class. Clad in a loose(at least everywhere but her chest) purple tank top and her signature uniform-black yoga pants, your mom swung open the front door and blew out a content sigh, satisfied with her relaxing but mildly strenuous class. Her face was still a bit red and her hair was slightly damp with sweat despite being tied back in a, thank the lord, <i>*non-human*</i> hair tie. Lazily dropping her yoga mat besides the door, she kicked off her shoes in equal fashion before her ears picked up the sound of the TV droning on in the distance. Usually you\u2019d be grateful your mom removed her shoes at the front door, something she quite often neglected doing, as it meant if she dropped a heavy foot onto you she\u2019d at least be able to feel it(most of the time). Today it worked against you however as her feet stepped towards the living room with unbeknownst stealth, allowing you to stay in your blissful dream land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine times out of ten this story would progress as anyone, the Smalls included, would expect. The clumsy mother absentmindedly crushing her tiny son underneath her powerful rear. But that\u2019s not exactly the story you were telling. Today was special, if only in intention alone. Your mom made her way into the living room and instead of being enraptured by the bright television, she actually noticed you lying on the couch pillow fast asleep! She couldn\u2019t help but clutch her heart in cuteness overload as she saw her only son looking all curled up and peaceful! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly withdrew her phone from her moist cleavage and snapped a quick couple pictures of you before managing a selfie as she planted her giant and glossy lips right onto your entire face. Somehow, despite being coated in a thin layer of your own mother\u2019s fresh salvia, you merely let out a deep breath and rolled onto your back, staying fast asleep! \u201cOoooooo, he is just so damn cute!\u201d your mom whispered before deciding it would be best to let you get some well deserved rest; she was in need of a shower anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until she saw the clock....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was exactly five o\u2019clock! \u201cRight in time for Judge Judith! Yesss! That shower will have to wait...!\u201d your mom spoke before clutching her mouth in realization of her volume. Carefully grabbing the remote, your mom flipped on her show before hovering her ass right over your helpless body! She squatted down and her booty must\u2019ve been a mere centimeter from you when she froze and facepalmed at what she was about to do! She rose up and peered backwards; only to let out a small whine as she saw you were taking her favorite pillow! Carefully sliding a hand under you, your mom slid you over to a free space on the couch before sitting down right where you were a minute prior; her landing on the couch bouncing you softly as the weight distributed to accommodate her heavier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom shimmied her hips back and forth <i>relentlessly</i> into her pillow trying to get nice and comfy to enjoy her show, but unfortunately this pillow had really had a number done on it over the years. It was practically flat under a heavy force such as your moms wide butt! Your mom crossed her arms in discontent with a huff before her eyes slowly swam their way back over at you. \u201cJake sure is knocked out...I wonder if he\u2019d mind...\u201d your mom shook herself from her crazy thought before it could go any further. As if Jake would voluntarily let her sit her sweaty butt on top of him and use him as some kind of cushion! She giggled to herself before trying to focus back on her show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even thirty seconds later though the gears were still turning in your moms head. \u201cHe sure has been such a sweetie lately, I mean he loves to help his mommy with whatever she needs! I bet he\u2019d be so happy if I found <i>yet another</i> way for him to be useful!\u201d Your mom was starting to slowly nod her head as her mind went on, \u201cand honestly he probably wouldn\u2019t even wake up! I\u2019d just be, like, sitting on his lap all nice and casually! He\u2019d get to be a <i>huge</i> help AND It\u2019ll keep him all nice and warm! I\u2019d be doing <b>us both</b> a disservice by not making use of his hidden talents!\u201d Totally content with her reasoning, your mom with the same care and stealth as before lifted you up and deposited you right back onto the freshly flattened pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring her cute and drowsy son one last time, your mom heard the show click back on and hastily turned her back on the couch and with reckless abandon dropped her ass down onto you, <b>hard</b>. She winced only a moment at how hard she fell onto you in carefree excitement before she felt the results of her handiwork. Letting out a blissful moan, your mom couldn\u2019t help but grind her ass back and forth a bit as she relished how soft and cushiony you felt against her tired booty. Feeling no protest or response at all, your mom flashed a shining grin at her perfect solution for the both of you before letting herself forget all about it as she was immersed right into her show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, had your eyes immediately shoot open as you felt like a truck just hit you and stole the air right out of your lungs! The first thing you saw of course was none-other than your mother\u2019s world encompassing backside that had your head wedged nice and firmly in her crack while your body was flattened down as if one hundred times gravity just kicked in. Your eyes looked further up past her long back to see her luscious brown hair swishing in her pony tail to and fro and she wiggled into place. You wanted to cry out but your mouth produced zero sound as you hadn\u2019t an ounce of air to expend with your mother\u2019s dense ass on top of you. It was now you were able to notice the horrid feeling of her warm sweat coating you and also took in the awful salty smell that of course accompanied it. At this point you figured this was all another typical accident! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom laughed heartily at her show above, you slowly felt her jiggly bottom creeping it\u2019s way over your face. You prayed you wouldn\u2019t be entirely buried, forced to breath in each bit of air you could manage filtered through the backside of your moms pants, but at this point you were totally helpless. The only thing you were hoping for at this point was that her butt would dry up a bit, but with how much heat you felt blasting onto you, you weren\u2019t optimistic. As each minute crawled along, you felt her ass shaking it\u2019s way slowly until it reached your mouth, and you whimpered to yourself as you got a taste of everything your moms pants had soaked up during her little yoga class retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the show went on and on, you finally felt the titanic weight lift off of you as your mom jumped up and swiftly departed into the bathroom during a commercial break. Racing back so she didn\u2019t miss a second, your mom looked down at your wide-open eyes and flattened body with nothing but affection as she shouted down to you, \u201cOh, honey, you\u2019re awake! Phew I\u2019m glad you stayed put!\u201d Your mom said pretending to wipe some nervous sweat from her forehead and then placing her hands on her hips as she went on, \u201cI <b>know</b> you don\u2019t mind being <i>used</i>, but as you can tell I went ahead and decided you\u2019d make such a perfect little <i>addition</i> to that pillow!\u201d Your mom couldn\u2019t contain a couple giggles as she continued, \u201cYou really are the best son in the world! Mommy\u2019s little man is a real trooper! Oh, but sorry if I\u2019m a teeny, tiny bit <b>sweaty</b>, Mommy ran out of time to shower before her show came on, hehe! But I know that doesn\u2019t bother you, right Jakey?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even take a breath to respond, your mom quickly spun around as the TV went to black signaling the end of the commercial break, \u201cOh, it\u2019s back on! Thanks for volunteering, Jake!\u201d Without another peep your mom let her jiggly rump fall atop you even more carefree than ever, this time you weren\u2019t nearly lucky enough as you felt your face get buried under her thick ass as well, now subject to a point blank sensual assault as your face was flattened under your moms carefree act of getting comfortable. Your face was lightly burned as the harsh spandex material rubbed you down, leaving you damp and smelly with your own mother\u2019s salty emissions. You wanted to be upset with your mother dooming you to bear her entire weight and crushing you with such little concern, but you felt a small twinge of guilt at wanting to take away her newfound comfort. As long as she continued to praise you as the best son ever, you worried you\u2019d never be able to break it to your mom you\u2019re not just some tool for her convenience; you just loved her too much. Her ridiculously large booty pouring it\u2019s juices on you and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach comical moment sent your mom into a laughing fit which entirely consisted of her ass lifting up just a tiny bit before falling back down over and over. After what felt like an eternity but was a mere half hour for you mother you whimpered as your mom let out a pleased coo when the television announcer belted out they were going to be showing a Judge Judith marathon into the evening...and the icing of torment on the torture cake was your moms booming voice reverberating through to your muffled prison as she exclaimed, \u201c<i>Ooooo</i>, Twinkie!\u201d before tossing <i>your</i> last piece into her mouth in one mere bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback Fin)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was how I became my Mother\u2019s favorite cushion; At least every single damn Sunday when Judge Judith was on! At least some days she showered first...although some days she wore skirts...\u201d A shiver ran down your spine before you let out a forced laugh to try and mask the pain of the situation, to which Sophie and Kimberly immediately joined in, except with clear genuineness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m a huge fan of Judge Judith myself! I\u2019m sure we could help you get back into your old habit, you know, for nostalgias sake!\u201d Kimberlys playful taunting was overridden by an embarrassed cry of \u201cMom!!\u201d from Cassie as she tossed a pillow at her mom in your pitiful defense. You merely nervously laughed as the matriarch went on, \u201cOnly joking, only joking!\u201d and continued to giggle with Sophie before finishing, \u201cBut in all serious, how about you elaborate on...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimberly leaned forward in her chair, an impressed expression on her face. \u201cYou handled that situation quite well, all things considered.\u201d She admitted, which felt really good to hear her say. That good feeling didn\u2019t last long though, as she continued. \u201cIn fact, if you\u2019d oblige me, do you have any more stories related to your aunt? I\u2019d love to hear how you handled someone like her on multiple occasions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, but quickly recovered. \u201cUm\u2026uh\u2026yeah. Just give me a second to think.\u201d You paused. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to sift through with Tara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her chair, Cassie gave you a sympathetic, pitting smile. You could still see the flash of annoyance in her eyes every time you said Tara\u2019s name, and you morbidly wondered how THAT encounter would go down if she ever met Aunt Tara face-to-face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you thought of a few good stories to tell. Well, they were hardly good from your perspective, but you knew it was what Kimberly wanted you to say. She wanted to hear of your exploits in handling stubborn and selfish Tara, so you\u2019d give it to her. As a plus, Sophie and Maddie her still thoroughly entertained, so you cleared your throat and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around the time when you were still only eight inches in height (about thirteen years old), and Tara was visiting for a few days. Minutes after arriving, she\u2019d managed to \u201caccidentally\u201d kick you across the room, \u201cunknowingly\u201d roll her suitcase over your body, and \u201cmistake\u201d you for a stress toy for thirty minutes. She\u2019d apologized after each incident, but you caught the frustratingly coy glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom remained oblivious to her sister\u2019s mean-streak, viewing Tara as a nice (if frequently tipsy and a bit slovenly) woman. More worryingly, whenever your mom and Tara hung out, it was as if your mom regressed back to when she was a kid growing up and hanging out with her sister. They\u2019d always been best friends, and when the two of them came together as adults, it was like seeing them as giggly and fun-loving teenagers all over again. You seemed to be very far from your mom\u2019s mind when Tara was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFed up with Tara\u2019s antics after only two hours, you impatiently waited outside the bathroom that your mom was using. You wanted to confront her about Tara\u2019s constant messing with you, and thankfully Tara herself wasn\u2019t currently around. Your mom took longer in the bathroom than usual, but she finally emerged, and you coughed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at the exact moment you coughed to notify your mom, Tara called from down the stairs. Her obnoxious voice drowned out your own sounds, and also grabbed your mom\u2019s full attention. Her gaze, which had actually been about to glance down and spot you, whipped up as she angled her head towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a sec!\u201d Your mom yelled back, taking a step out of the bathroom as she did so. Too thrown off by your cough not getting your mom\u2019s focus, you stood still like a fool as your mom\u2019s foot slammed down onto your body, crunching up your squishy form like an accordion and flattening you to her heel. Normally, your mom would notice such a thing, but she was in a rush to attend to whatever Tara was calling her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to you, your mom thundered down the stairs, pounding you flatter and flatter each time her foot slammed into the carpet. You winced and mentally exclaimed with pain after each powerful stomp, unable to wiggle free with your mom\u2019s constant moving. Your mom simply strolled into the living room where Tara was waiting, and plopped onto the couch beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s up, Tara?\u201d Your mom inquired. Tara shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to know if you wanted to watch \u2018Hangman\u2019s Gambit\u2019.\u201d Tara replied. Your mom rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe watch that movie, like, three times a year! Why are you so obsessed with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara grinned. \u201cYou know how I love mindless action flicks!\u201d Your mom sighed, and Tara  leaned back, knowing she\u2019d convinced your mom. Truthfully, she was also a huge fan of a small scene where the main character had a nightmare where he was shrunk by the evil villainess, who proceeded to stomp him flat with her heels. The scene reminded her so much of her favorite little squishy nephew, and even better, your mom never seemed to pay attention to that scene at all, letting Tara easily keep this secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom, without warning, hefted up her legs and plopped them down onto Tara\u2019s lap, letting her feet rest on her sister\u2019s thighs. \u201cI agree to watch the film, but only if you give me a foot massage. My feet are killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was a bit taken aback, and before she answered, her gaze rested on your now visible body. You\u2019d been beaten quite a bit by your mom walking around, and weren\u2019t much more than a sticker on her soft skin, but you were still very much visible. Tara noticed you immediately, frowned, and looked her sister in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026are you sure, sis?\u201d She asked. Your mom smiled triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve named my price! Prepared to pay it?\u201d Your mom giggled innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally dawned on Tara that your mom had no idea she\u2019d stepped on you. Smirking from ear-to-ear, Tara rolled her shoulders. \u201cAbsolutely. Get ready for the best massage of your life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in a panic as you heard her say that, but there was nothing you could do as your mom started up the movie, and Tara placed her warm hands against your mom\u2019s foot. With the ease of an expert, Tara began pushing her fingers into your mom\u2019s flesh, working her hands up and down your mom\u2019s heel and sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, her thumbs pinched at your squished body and stretched you out, pulling on your squashed body. Tara fought down her triumphant smile as she kneaded her sister\u2019s foot while simultaneously smearing your body across the entire length of your mom\u2019s foot. Your mom, known the wiser, wiggled with pleasure and just about drifted off to sleep as your aunt worked on her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought tooth and nail to wiggle or squirm and be noticed by your mom, or to reform and escape from Tara\u2019s mean plan for you, but to no avail. With each passing second, she rubbed your body harder and harder, flattening you down and sticking your own sweaty skin to the crevices and pores in your mom\u2019s foot. On top of that, her constant rubbing in circular motions was smudging away your recognizable human features, reducing you to naught by a tan smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I could go on, but you get the picture.\u201d You said, addressing the Smalls women. \u201cBy the time the movie was over, and Tara finished her massage, not even the world\u2019s strongest microscope could tell me apart from my mom\u2019s foot. Not that my mom spared a thought to look at her foot. She just thanked her sister and spent the rest of the day hanging out with her. I stayed crushed the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, I was able to break free that night, all by myself. It took over seven hours of patience and strength of will, but as my mom slept in her bed, I managed to pry myself free and finish reforming. I ran out of her room and over into Tara\u2019s room, where I wrote her a message on some small scrap paper about how her actions hurt me, and set it on her bedside table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cVery mature of you, Jake. Did she take your message well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cThe next morning I saw her blowing her nose into the paper and throw it away, like it was just a Kleenex. I don\u2019t have proof, but I believe she saw it, read it, then waited for me to walk by to make a show out of ignoring it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gasped. \u201cWow dude, she sounds like a bi\u2013\u201d She caught her mom\u2019s eye. \u201c\u2026bad person. That sucks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie shook her head. \u201cI would\u2019ve pranked her back, or something. Ya know! Get some silly revenge.\u201d She giggled. \u201cThough I guess that\u2019s hard at your height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s disposition had darkened considerably. You were pretty sure her distaste for Aunt Tara grew into hate with each passing story, but Kimberly cut her off before you could speak.</span></div></div>",

Literally.\u201d Sophie and Maddie looked confused, as did Cassie, and Kimberly motioned for you to continue. Bracing yourself, you began the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about fifteen, and your growth spurt was just kicking in (you were roughly eight and a half inches). You were enjoying a nice and relaxing summer at home with your mom in between school years. Hardly a day went by without some small accident, usually because of your mom, but she almost immediately noticed and apologized after rescuing you. Generally speaking, you were having a great time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom shattered that happiness one morning by announcing that Aunt Tara would be back for another weekend. You loudly protested, trying to argue about how mean Tara was to you, but your mom was having none of it. Admittedly, you crossed a line in calling Tara an asshole, but you were a livid teenager, and you needed to let out this pent-up anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirmly on Tara\u2019s side, your mom flipped out, berating you for your foul mouth and sentencing you to your room for the weekend, effectively grounding you. She said if you left your room, she\u2019d punish you much more severely, and you knew better than to cross her. Sullenly, you climbed the stairs and went into your room, where you spent the next two and a half days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright side was that you completely avoided Aunt Tara. She poked her head in for a second to say hello, and make a crack about your height, then was out of your hair for the whole weekend. The downside was that you could do nothing but re-read the same book, lounge on your bed, and count the tiles on the ceiling. It was mind-numbingly boring, especially for a fifteen-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weekend went on, you realized that this didn\u2019t set right with you. Why were you being punished for trying to speak up against a woman who had bullied you incessantly for years? She was a mean-spirited and taunting giantess who had her way with you for your entire life, and your mom took HER side? Nearly seething, you vowed to sneak out of your room sometime before Tara left to give her a piece of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday afternoon rolled around, and it was a hot and incredibly sunny day out. You were wearing nothing but simple red swim trunks. Waiting patiently by your door, you heard your mom enter the bathroom for her typical Sunday bath. She\u2019d be in there for at least an hour, giving you plenty of time to sneak out of your room. Utilizing the nearby trash can, you leapt onto the door handle, just barely pulling down with enough weight to shift the door open, and slipped out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara wasn\u2019t in the hall, nor in the guest room she usually slept in. Creeping downstairs, you didn\u2019t find her in the living room or kitchen either. You nearly gave up before you noticed the kitchen screen door was slid open a crack. Walking over and into the backyard, you finally found Tara in the yard, sprawled out on a towel by the pool and basking in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it technically could\u2019ve been anyone, as all you could really see at first was an utterly humongous ass jutting up. It was like a fleshy mountain peak, each cheek more than twice your size. Almost in a trance, you walked across the yard until you were beside your Aunt, barely able to peel your eyes away from her alluring derriere. Yes, she was your aunt, but it was also the largest ass you\u2019d seen in your life, by a mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding beside Tara, you noted her similarly gargantuan breasts pressing down onto her towel, copious flesh almost comically spilling out from under her. Her arms were splayed out in front of her, one hand resting on the towel and the other vaguely fumbling for a bottle of sunscreen a foot away. After another second of looking at her, you gasped loudly. There were no visible strings around her back near or chest, or around her hips. Tara was well and truly stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gasp also drew Tara\u2019s attention, and the dyed blonde giantess lazily shifted her head over to look at you. Eyes widening just a bit, a slow smile spread on her face. \u201cOh\u2026hey there Jake! My favorite little nephew. Nice red trunks. Say, have you grown an inch? You\u2019re almost as tall as a barbie doll!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough still embarrassed by this whole situation, your aunt\u2019s abrasiveness instantly triggered you. \u201cI\u2019ve nearly grown two inches, thank you! I was just coming to say hello\u2026and a few other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded vaguely. \u201cUh huh, yeah. Listen, squirt, I need you for something real quick.\u201d Tara was clearly not listening to you. \u201cI was just about to lie down for a tan. As you can tell, my skin is growing a bit pale again. Anyway, totally forgot to lather up in sunscreen. Now that I\u2019m laying down, think you could do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically did a double take. \u201cDo what? You want me to\u2026what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShort stuff, this isn\u2019t rocket science. Just rub me down, give me a nice coat of sunscreen.\u201d Tara smirked. \u201cUnless you think you\u2019re too small for something this easy. I might make fun of you for years if that was the case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blood broiled at her obvious taunting, but you still took the bait like an idiot. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it. Where should I start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara grinned with the slightest hint of mischief. \u201cI\u2019d say my ass is as good a place as any. Climb on up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou balked at her bluntness, but were too prideful to back down now. Tara had manipulated you into a corner, so you\u2019d play her game. Although, climbing her was harder than you would\u2019ve like to admit. Her skin, slick with a sheen of sweat, was far too jiggly and doughy to offer good handholds, so you ended up leaping from the ground onto the small of her back and scrambling into a standing position. You then carefully walked up her left butt cheek, trying not to think about how weird this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh!\u201d Tara laughed. \u201cYou feel kinda good, itty bitty Jake. Like a tiny masseuse!\u201d She laughed again, her body shaking as she did so. Her ass bounded like a bowl of jelly, quivering flesh knocking you flat onto your face. You slid forward an inch, catching yourself with a startled scream right before you nearly plunged headfirst into her ass crack. Standing up, you calmed your nerves and crossed your arms impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. What now Aunt Tara?\u201d You had to yell for her to here you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a second, little guy.\u201d Was her only answer, before she whipped her arm backwards, the hand holding the bottle of sunscreen now directly above you. She popped the cap with her thumb, tilted the bottle upside-down, and let the gooey lotion pour out. However, whether by accident or intentionally, it was coming out directly on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out, you adapted on the fly and leapt across the cavernous canyon of her butt crack to her right cheek, amazingly sticking the landing, though not without sinking slightly into her impressionably plush flesh. Behind you, Tara dumped a sizable pile of sunscreen lotion onto her cheek before setting the bottle aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward towards Tara\u2019s head, which was now resting in her arms. \u201cOkay, so just start rubbing it all in\u2026I guess?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you thought you heard her swear softly before answering. \u201cUh, yeah, yep. You got it, Jake. And don\u2019t take too long, squirt! I don\u2019t want to burn, I want a sexy, even tan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \u201cWell, it might take a bit, but I\u2019ll try to\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up, Jake! I feel something crawling on me! A bug!\u201d Tara exclaimed, suspiciously loud. You glanced around, unable to see what she could be referring to. As you looked, you didn\u2019t catch the shadow washing over you until it was too late, nor did you look up in time to see Tara\u2019s hand hovering above you. But you certainly felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara slapped her right butt cheek, her powerful hand squashing you flat. The sound of the smack reverberated across the entire yard. Your body was knocked forward, and your face slammed firmly into your aunt\u2019s smooth, sweaty flesh. The rest of your body folded underneath you as you compressed into little more than a misshapen sticker. Your legs buckled, and your arms flailed in as you pancaked into her rear, resulting in you looking like a weird blob and not a human-shaped imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before Tara pulled her hand away, she scratched briefly at your body with her sharp nails, before hooking your red swim trunks. Taking her hand back, your trunks came off with a decisive, ripping snap, then fluttered down, discarded, into the grass beside Tara\u2019s towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had quickly become disastrous. You were, of course, smushed flat on your aunt\u2019s butt cheek, and now stark naked with your trunks ripped off. Also, with your head buried into her fleshy cheek and the rest of your body crushed on top of you, like an accordion, your hair wasn\u2019t visible either. Frankly, you looked like nothing more than a slightly more tanned and vaguely human-ish sticker of sorts on your aunt\u2019s otherwise pristine and perfect booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s voice came slightly muffled as she spoke up. \u201cOkay, you were saying, Jake? I think I took care of that small little bug.\u201d She waited for your reply, which you were obviously incapable of making. \u201cUh, hello? Small stuff? You didn\u2019t flake on me, did you?\u201d Tara snorted, which gave you all the confirmation you needed that she had slapped you onto her butt on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger poured into every fiber of your being, and you focused all of your will and determination into reforming. Tara had played you like a damn fiddle, and you\u2019d eat your foot before you let her get away with it. Quicker than usual, you began slowly reinflating, popping back into three dimensions starting with your feet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner had you done that, though, than Tara\u2019s hand slammed back down onto you again, recrushing your feet. She rubbed her meaty butt cheek, digging her fingers into your body as she did so, pressing you firmly into her skin. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t crush you, did I? No, that\u2019d be silly. You\u2019re so big now, right? Always growing? I\u2019d have felt you stuck to my big ol\u2019 ass, surely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara snorted again, her feigned attempts at rescue easily keeping you flat and unable to reform. Truthfully, she had no idea where she was going with this specific little tirade, but she never wasted a chance to mess with you. After missing you all weekend, it was only fair recompense that she milked this encounter for all it was worth. Oh, how she loved spending time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, fate smiled upon Tara, and blessed her with the ultimate opportunity for small, squishy nephew humiliation. From the kitchen door, your mom walked out of the house, dressed in a revealing swimsuit and carrying some freshly washed clothes. She\u2019d finished her shower, changed, gathered clothes from the washing machine, and had come outside to hang up the clothes and take a swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pinning her lingerie to the line, she sauntered over to her sister and knelt down beside her. \u201cHey, Tara. Soaking up some rays this afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it!\u201d Tara replied happily. \u201cJust need to lather up in sunscreen first, but I\u2019m having a bit of trouble. Gosh, sis, you wouldn\u2019t mind coating me up, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom beamed innocently. \u201cSure thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Tara flashed her a thumbs up, and removed her hand which was covering you. She bit her lip, as the moment of truth was now approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom\u2019s gaze immediately locked onto you, and she frowned. \u201cUh\u2026what is that on your butt, sis? Looks like\u2026half a person? No\u2026it\u2019s too weird shaped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara chose her words carefully. \u201cWhat, my tattoo? Yeah, I actually just discovered that a few days ago!\u201d She fake laughed, but quite convincingly. \u201cYou know how I get when drunk. Just another weird drunk tattoo. Remember the heart-shaped pizza tattoo I got on my tits after graduation, before mom made me get it lasered off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom almost doubled over in laughter. \u201cOh god! I totally forgot that silly thing!\u201d She giggled, and Tara laughed in turn, a genuine, heart laugh this time. When she had calmed down, your mom looked away from you and at the pile of sunscreen. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll get started. Won\u2019t take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, sis!\u201d Tara smiled as she let her head rest in her arms, and she closed her eyes. It took all her effort to not grin victoriously, or otherwise give herself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara\u2019s plan had worked, and your mom had bought the tattoo lie completely. She couldn\u2019t be blamed either, not fully. It was absolutely in character for her sister to get a drunk tattoo, your weirdly lumpy body looked nothing like it normally did, nor even remotely human, and your mom also firmly believed you to still be upstairs in your room, where you were supposed to be grounded until Tara left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to work, your mom daintily dipped her hands into the sunscreen oil, and then began rubbing her sister\u2019s butt cheeks, grabbing her meaty cheeks and thoroughly covering them. Her smooth hands decimated your body, smearing and smudging your squishy self as she rubbed you in constant circles. The pressure she applied squeezed you firmly into Tara\u2019s plush skin, and her repetitive kneading motions evened out your body\u2019s squished state, flattening you more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body, through a combination of sweat, pressure, and the sticky sunscreen, began bonding with Tara\u2019s, much more than normal squishiness. You felt your skin actually glue itself to your aunt\u2019s pores, flesh binding tightly with flesh. The sunscreen dried on top of you in the hot sun, forming a constricting sealant that restricted your movements and reformation even after your mom finally moved onto a different area of your aunt\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in darkness, you tried to wiggle or squirm, but it was useless. You\u2019d been superglued to your aunt\u2019s thick booty, bound by the sweat and sunscreen. All you could smell was the overwhelming aroma of the lavender sunscreen mixed with a slight sweat stench. Even the sunscreen drying on top of your body muffled the sounds of the outside world, and you barely heard your mother announce she needed to coat Tara\u2019s front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shifted and shook, Tara\u2019s butt cheeks jiggly like crazy as she lazily rolled over onto her back. Settling into place, her heavy cheeks slammed into the towel, flesh pouring out over the sides as her butt squeezed down. You were crushed under what felt like a hundred tons of pressure, hot and heavy ass flesh surrounding you from all sides. The rough towel didn\u2019t do much but press against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stayed like this for two hours, and you suffered ceaselessly through it all, toiling in the sweltering and slowly growing swamp of sweat trapped between her butt and the towel. Every minute that passed, and you felt your body sticking just a bit more than it had before to Tara\u2019s own skin. You prayed for a miracle, only to be granted even worse torment as Tara rolled back onto her stomach, and subjected you to the burning heat of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body practically sizzled and broiled, right alongside Tara\u2019s own sexy body. The sun softened up Tara\u2019s pores, resulting in your body adhering to her even more, as if she was sucking your gummy-like body into her flesh. Your mother had perfectly coated her in lotion, and as the hours marched on, she bronzed beautifully, and you right alongside her. All the while, nothing and no one saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hours later, and Tara woke up, sleepily rubbing her eyes and yawning. She stretched and stood up, wiping sleep out of her eyes as she bundled up her towel. Walking back inside the house, she headed straight for the bathroom. With every step she took, you jostled and shook with her butt cheek, and, horrifyingly, you nearly felt as if you were a PART of that cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as soon as Tara splashed a bit of water in her face, she turned her attention to her eye-catchingly beautiful body, and admired her perfectly tanned skin. She wasn\u2019t as forgetful as her sister, so she looked straight at her ass, which was a smooth and even deep tan, no sign of any weird spots of imperfections. As she hoped, you\u2019d been fully tattooed into her cheek, no sign of you at visible. Even upon close inspection, you were truly invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Jake, this is honestly the funniest thing that\u2019s happened all week! How are you this small and unnoticeable that I can tan you into my butt like THAT!\u201d Tara snapped her fingers and laughed. \u201cSorry squirt, but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let you out anytime soon. Maybe a week\u2026or a month stuck where you are now will teach you to be nicer to me. I love ya, short stuff, but I have to lay down the law now and then. You don\u2019t get away with calling me an asshole, little guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara snickered as she slipped into some comfy pajamas, the tight cotton pants snapping around her waist and against her butt. Admiring herself briefly in the mirror, she walked back out into the kitchen, where your mom gushed over her stunning appearance. The two sisters enjoyed a lovely evening, your mom never once having a single thought about you, or even recalling her sister's strange tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a second to collect your thoughts, and the Smalls women waited with bated breath. \u201cShe stayed true to her word, mostly. I was stuck the rest of the day, that night, and then the next day when she got on an airplane and flew back home. Then for three days after that. Sitting at her kitchen table, lying on her couch, sleeping in bed, and plopped on the ground doing stretches. I had to experience it all, every second of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was wide-eyed and semi-speechless. \u201cWh-what happened to you? You were, like, a tattoo on her butt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom eventually called, delirious and crying. She, obviously, couldn\u2019t find me anywhere at home, and was on the verge of a breakdown. Feeling awful, Tara took a suction vacuum to her butt that night and sucked me off and into a tiny cup. She sealed the cup, texted my mom some lie about finding me in her luggage, then shipped me home. My mom actually punished me when I got home for \u2018sneaking\u2019 into Tara\u2019s luggage. Three weeks of cleaning the bathroom daily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie looked taken aback. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026I mean\u2026what?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think even Tara realized just how bad it was, honestly. The hours of pressure and baking from the sun really had plastered me to her flesh. Engrained, if I\u2019m being honest. I genuinely don\u2019t know if time would\u2019ve freed me or not. I might\u2019ve been stuck without her help, and a few more days or weeks of constant crushing could very well have permanently absorbed me into her ass cheek. I was already mostly fused to her skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s hands clenched the arms of her chair so hard her fingers turned white. \u201cBut. At. Least. You\u2019re. Safe. Now.\u201d She feigned a smile and spoke in a clip. You had a feeling Tara would take a swift punch to the face if she was here now. Maybe a kick or two as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was quiet when she spoke. \u201cYou stood up to her even knowing the dangers. You were both willing to confront her, and appease her, even when she always beat you down.\u201d She looked you directly in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019ve quite impressed me, Jake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her. \u201cThank you, Ms. Smalls.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few seconds of quiet passed, and then Sophie began tapping her chin, and exaggeratedly cute frown on her face. \u201cSo, like\u2026you haven\u2019t ever really been around girls? Like, outside of your mom and that meanie aunt? And Cassie, of course.\u201d<br>\r\nMaddie shared a similar sentiment. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good point. How sheltered were you, dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you pause. \u201cHuh. Well, you\u2019re pretty much right. My mom was the only woman I encountered on a daily basis. Tara was around a lot, and I had a few cousins I could talk about later if you wanted me to. My mom\u2019s neighbors were good friends, so they\u2019d be around from time to time. But yeah, any other experience was purely accidental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccidental?\u201d Maddie inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hands through your air. \u201cYeah\u2026accidental. Like my mom stepping on me and taking me with her to work, where I end up under her boss\u2019s butt. Or when her neighbor doesn\u2019t notice me when she sits, I end up stuck to her as she walks back to her house. Twice I\u2019ve been stomped on by a girl jogging by while helping my mom with her garden outside, carried for a few miles in her treads before peeling off onto the sidewalk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly leaned back in her chair. \u201cTough situations, but hard work pays off. I can see how resilient you are today.\u201d She paused. \u201cStrange how small your circle of true relationships is. Your mom coddled you quite a bit, it seems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \u201cWell, only when I was very little. By the time I was around ten, she actually\u2026\u201d You trailed off, and long vanished memories bubbled back up the surface of your mind. Bright blue eyes, brilliant golden hair, milky white and creamy smooth skin, a heartwarming smile. June. You hadn\u2019t thought about her in nearly ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present, you cleared your throat. \u201cUh, actually, there was one girl who I interacted with pretty frequently. From when I was around ten until fourteen, my mom started going out with friends and Tara more often. However, she\u2019d leave a babysitter with me. One of her good friends had a teenaged daughter who\u2019d taken and passed an official childcare certification program, so she brought her over to watch me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at you in surprise. \u201cReally? You\u2019ve never mentioned her before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just remembered her.\u201d You admitted. \u201cHer name was June, and she was actually\u2026my first crush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely knew where to look or where to think when you first laid eyes on June. After being let in the front door by your mother, she had strolled over to the table you were standing on to introduce herself to you. Leaning forward slightly, she smiled brightly and extended the index finger of her left hand for a handshake. At 5\u201910\u201d, she towered over you. At this point in time, you were only around six or seven inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was that of an angel\u2019s, and her shining, beautiful face absolutely entranced you. The way her plush lips curved as she smiled, the faint blush in her cheeks, and the glow of her blue eyes. You were just stepping one foot into the turbulent whirlwind of puberty, and had begun to take a closer interest in girls. Being ten years old though, you were quiet, introverted, and painfully shy, and June\u2019s presence only overwhelmed you further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually overwhelming was June\u2019s more feminine aspects. As mentioned, you were only just beginning to notice girls in a romantic manner, and June was stunning from your perspective. At sixteen, June herself was still a growing girl, but that hardly diminished her appeal. Her modest breasts, lean frame, long legs, and cute butt were amazing, and she showed all the signs of only growing more attractive each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there! You must be Jake.\u201d June practically cooed. \u201cYou\u2019re just the handsomest boy, aren\u2019t you? My name is June, and I\u2019ll take great care of you tonight, we\u2019ll have so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body tingled with an incredible feeling of warmth as she spoke, the faintest hint of strawberry mouthwash flowing down from her face as she talked, washing over you. Your eyes flicked wildly from her face to her body, trying to wrestle with your thoughts. June was wearing  a frilly pink blouse that showed just a bit of cleavage and an inch or two of her midriff, and black short shorts. She seemed to take no notice of the effect she was having on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom was oblivious too, and she merely called from the door. \u201cTake care, Jake! You\u2019ll be asleep when I get home, so I\u2019ll see you in the morning!\u201d She blew you a kiss over June\u2019s shoulder, then left, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune had glanced to your mom as she left, and when the door closed, her alluring stare was right back at you, perfect face still smiling. Almost in a trance, you grabbed June\u2019s hand and shook it, eliciting a small squeal from the teenaged giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jake! What would you like to do tonight? It\u2019s only about three o\u2019clock, so we have time until dinner.\u201d June inquired, now looking at you pensively. She lightly bit her lower lip, and the sight drove another wave of confused emotions through your body.<br>\r\nBarely managing to string together a sentence in your head, you responded quietly. \u201cI like\u2026video games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune brightened. \u201cOh, sweet! Let\u2019s play some then!\u201d With delicate precision, June scooped you up into her outstretched palms, then carefully carried you across the room to the couch. Sitting down on one half of the couch, she let you rest beside her on the other half. She rested her hand beside you and looked down at you. \u201cAnything in particular you want to play? This night is all about you, buddy! Let\u2019s have fun with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to answer, but then June began absentmindedly tapping her finger, perfectly manicured digit rapping against the couch cushion right in front of you. You watched in rise and fall, rise and fall, lost in the rhythm. The red painted fingernail was expertly polished, almost gleaming in the light. Your heart ached. Why was this girl so perfect? Had girls always been so beautiful and attractive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterpreting your silence as either indecision or anxiety, June smiled softly. \u201cHey, no worries. I know hanging out with strangers can be tough, but I swear on my life I\u2019ll look out for you, okay? I won\u2019t hurt you. I can also pick the first game, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune leaned forward, standing up a bit to grab a game off the shelf your TV rested on. As she rose, your gaze, quite shamefully, zoned right in on her cute, modestly sized rear end. Her short shorts hugged her flesh tightly, enhancing her shapely rear wonderfully. You could just see the bottom of her cheeks poking out from beneath her short shorts cutoff. For the first time in your life, an ass wasn\u2019t a sight to scream and run at, and this really made you conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were reminded of your life a second later, as June slid a copy of \u201cExtreme Karting\u201d into your game console and sat back down. She wasn\u2019t anywhere near sitting on you, but the sight of her booty slamming back onto the couch, the reverberation actually knocking you on your back reminding you just how small you were to someone like her. She was a goddess to you, both in terms of her beauty and her power over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to everything happening in your head, June picked up the nearest controller and then looked at you. \u201cSo, Jake, how do you play? Do you need a controller like this, or something special? I imagine hitting all the buttons might be hard for you on a control like mine.\u201d Tactfully, June refrained from calling her controller \u2018normal\u2019, or referring to you as \u2018little guy\u2019 or \u2018short stuff\u2019, as Aunt Tara did at every opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head at June\u2019s question. Voice barely a whisper, you replied. \u201cNo, I have a cool controller, so small it fits in my hands. Well, I USED to\u2026but my mom snapped it in two when she laid down for a nap last week.\u201d You sighed. \u201cThe new one is still coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune gasped. \u201cAw. Sorry to hear that, Jake.\u201d The titaness frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a bummer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can just play. I\u2019ll watch.\u201d You sat down and folded your arms across your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden-haired giantess clicked her tongue. \u201cThat won\u2019t do, Jake. I can\u2019t sit here and have playing this game without you beside me!\u201d She fiddled with a strand of her long hair. \u201cHow about this? Give me a round or two around the track to figure out the controls, and then we can play together on the same controller. I\u2019ll use one half, and you can use the other half!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was genius, and you were taken aback by her sincerity and genuine care towards you. Face burning bright red, you averted your gaze as you nodded. \u201cO-okay\u2026sounds fun. Can you also turn off the lights\u201d You asked, trying to sound inconspicuous. You didn\u2019t want the teenaged girl to spot your furiously blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d June grinned, leaning off the side of the couch to just barely flick off the rooms light switch. The room plunged into darkness, quickly remedied by June turning the TV on. The title screen for \u201cExtreme Karting\u201d flashed onto the screen, and June looked at you once more. \u201cNow, don\u2019t laugh, but I can get a bit into video games. I really get invested in everything on screen, so don\u2019t make fun of me if I do anything silly, okay?\u201d She stuck out her tongue and made a funny face, prompting a small laugh from you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking back to the TV, June maneuvered the menu to a practice race, and chose her character. She flexed her hands as the race began, and was frankly pretty terrible for the first few minutes. Still, she persisted, and it wasn\u2019t long before she was tearing around the track, leaving the computer opponents trailing in her dust. She was also beginning to lean into the turns in real life, shifting side-to-side in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had yet to grasp which button let her fire missiles though, and she ended up losing the race because an opponent blasted her with a missile from behind and sailed ahead of her. You noted her frown, highlighted in the pulsing glow of the TV screen, and something stirred in you. You didn\u2019t want to see this angelic girl upset in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you press the square button.\u201d You said. \u201cTo fire missiles.\u201d June didn\u2019t respond, and merely retried the practice race. You looked over at June. \u201cMiss June? The square button. Hello?\u201d You said, this time a little louder. Still, she was firmly looking at the screen. It was only then that you realized just how loud the TV music was blaring, and how soft your voice was in comparison. She couldn\u2019t hear you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you crossed the couch until you were right beside her right leg. Her thigh seemed so smooth and soft that it took every ounce of self-control not to rub your hand along it. Instead, you hoisted yourself up onto her leg using the fabric of her short shorts as handholds, until you were standing on her lap. June glanced down at you briefly, her smile tinged with a hint of confusion, but her attention was back on the screen after a second as the race started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was resting her controller on her knees as she played, so you had decided to just push the button for her as an example. Walking up a bit on her soft thigh, your feet slightly sank into her flesh, nearly tripping you up. Reaching the controller, you leaned over her thumb and jabbed the square button with all your might, pushing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the missiles fired from her car, and blasted into the same computer opponent who had screwed her over last race. The opponent sailed off the track, and June slid easily into first place. You were surprised, as you hadn\u2019t planned to shoot the missiles at anything in particular, and had merely gotten lucky. Sadly, before you could bask in your own unintentional achievement, everything went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune, with lightning fast speed, leapt to her feet, rising in joyous satisfaction after taking revenge on her opponent. Right as she stood, her legs parted a bit, and you stumbled right in between her thighs, landing on the couch as June rose. You rolled into the indentation her butt had made in the leather, hit by a wave of cherry scented perfume so strong it almost knocked you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! Hee hee hee! Nice!\u201d June exclaimed, beaming. A second later, her smile turned sheepish, realizing she\u2019d fallen right into her own claims about getting too into gaming. Blushing a bit, June sank back down towards the couch, utterly headless of what lie beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to see with June blocking most of the light from the TV, but you knew she was sitting again. Crying out in a startled plea, you scrambled forward towards the edge of the couch, too afraid to venture in any other direction. Had you gone any other way, you might\u2019ve escaped what came next, but hindsight was twenty/twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune\u2019s ass slammed into the couch cushion, just barely missing you, but her bare thighs hit the mark. Slamming down right on top of you, you found yourself squashed and buried under June\u2019s left thigh, your body folding into a flat pancake almost instantly beneath the teenager\u2019s smooth skin. As June settled into her seat, more weight pressed down on you, squeezing you between her supple thigh and the leather of the couch, squishing you even flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, June had felt you, but the unaware giantess immediately passed the feeling off as just the leather of the couch squeezing a bit under her leg. Eyes firmly fixed on the screen, she resumed the practice race, and easily achieved a victory a minute later. Not taking her gaze from the TV, she grinned and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that, Jake. I hadn\u2019t tried the square button yet.\u201d She giggled. \u201cSilly of me, but thanks for being such a smart kid!\u201d She rolled her neck. \u201cHow about I give it one more race, and then we\u2019ll do that co-op I mentioned.\u201d Not waiting for a reply, June jumped right back into another race. She didn\u2019t have a clue in the world you weren\u2019t still sitting beside her. She hadn\u2019t even considered how standing with you on her lap would affect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried under her hot flesh, you tried to wiggle or squirm, but couldn\u2019t find enough room. Her thigh sank into the soft leather of the couch, surrounding you on all sides and pressing down on you. Tears sprang to your eyes, as they usually did in these situations. You were young, and being painfully sat and stepped on was a horrible experience you dreaded constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, until finally June\u2019s leg peeled off of the couch with a slick \u2018pop\u2019, a sheen of sweat beginning to appear. Unfortunately, your body stuck to the back of her thigh, so you were lifted up too, not left on the couch to reform. This wouldn\u2019t have been so terrible theoretically, had June not immediately moved to cross her legs, letting her left leg rest atop her right. You couldn\u2019t even brace for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her thighs collided, you were assaulted by a slamming force of slick, hot flesh from all sides. June\u2019s supple skin squeezed tightly around you as she let her left leg lie across her right, her thighs nearly gluing themselves together due to her growing sweat. The more she focused on the game, the sweatier she became, working herself tired with her constant leaning back and forth while steering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muffled cries and exclamations of success and surprise became muffled and indecipherable, everything around you muted and dark. Your own body was quickly slick with sweat, and in danger of escalating into a fever with how hot June\u2019s flesh was growing. You didn\u2019t stop trying to twitch and squirm, even though it grew more futile by the second. Your body was being squished flat by June\u2019s thighs, and soon you\u2019d be so stuck to her skin moving would be impossible, let alone reforming without her noticing you first and rescuing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed by, and June\u2019s promise of \u2018one more race\u2019 turned into five. Finally, after twenty minutes of being stuck in the sauna of heat amidst the flesh and sweat of June\u2019s thighs, your beautiful babysitter finally set the controller down. The golden-haired girl smiled and leaned back, letting out a big sigh. She uncrossed her legs, letting them sit properly on the couch. She winced slightly at the feeling of her sweat sticking to the leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m really sorry Jake.\u201d June glanced at where you were supposed to be sitting. \u201cI promised one race, yet I\u2013\u201d She paused, and squinted in the dark. Your absence dawned on her. \u201cJake? Hey, Jake? Where did you run off to?\u201d She leaned behind the couch and flicked the light switch on. She flinched briefly at the bright lights, and when her vision adjusted, she noted that you truly were not beside her on the couch anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, it all resolved in minutes.\u201d You explained to the Smalls. \u201cShe thought maybe I\u2019d gotten bored and wanted to play hide and seek, so she stood up to try and find me. Miraculously, I peeled off her thigh and remained on the couch. While she crawled around the room looking for me, I reformed back to normal, and when she came back to the couch and spotted me, it looked to her as if nothing bad had happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did she take the news?\u201d Maddie pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t tell her. Remember, I had a crazy crush on her, and was also still in my introverted and easily embarrassed years. When she lightly chided me for disappearing on her, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her she\u2019d sat on me, and had crushed me to her thigh for the past half hour. I didn\u2019t want to ruin the night, or hurt her happy mood. As long as she was smiling, I reasoned that it hadn\u2019t really been that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie cooed. \u201cAw, that\u2019s such an adorable little story! Like, OMG! Was that all you did that night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cThere was much more that went on that night, and most of it\u2026uh\u2026not the most pleasant on my end. June was incredibly nice and caring, and had the truest of intentions, but fate just kept throwing me into her path that night.\u201d You stroked your chin. \u201cAnd every night she babysat me, for that matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie smirked. \u201cSeems she isn\u2019t as great a guardian as I am, huh? I\u2019ll always be watching out for you, Jake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e\u2019s words elicited more happy squeals from Sophie, but you were a tad surprised. She almost sounded jealous that she wasn\u2019t your first crush, but it was more likely that she\u2019d just been caught off guard that you\u2019d had this story and never told her. Also, you didn\u2019t one hundred percent agree with her, but you wouldn\u2019t dare say that out loud. Cassie was your angel, and had saved you from hundreds of horrible accidents. Still, you couldn\u2019t count the amount of times since you\u2019d been sharing a room with her where you woke up crushed to her, and it took her hours to find you. She certainly wasn\u2019t above June in that regard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A good minute or two of complete silence passed after you finished your story of Tara nearly dooming you to an eternity fused with her butt cheek. Cassie was silently fuming and attempting to reign in her growing anger. Maddie and Kimberly seemed lost in thought, caught between being impressed at your resilience and disturbed by your aunt\u2019s mean actions. Only Sophie was smiling, but she had a distant look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sophie\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly, and she smiled wide. \u201cOoh! I got it!\u201d She declared happily. Her cheerful voice was so jarring that Maddie, sitting beside her, actually jumped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Soph! Giving me a heart attack here!\u201d Maddie put a hand to her chest, and Sophie grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I just finally thought of something fun.\u201d The bubbly blonde twirled a strand of her hair as she spoke. \u201cSee, Jake\u2019s story kinda bummed us all out, though I\u2019m glad he told us. But, like, we\u2019ve gotta be happier! Cassie\u2019s home on break, her adorable fianc\u00e9 is with her, and we should be having fun instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took a deep breath, and finally managed to sincere smile, pushing thoughts of Tara aside. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Sophie. If it\u2019s alright with Jake, I\u2019m good with moving on from serious discussions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m always down to destress. Did you have something in mind, Sophie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energetic giantess rocked back and forth excitedly. \u201cI sure did! I think we should all play a family game together, for a bit of bonding time! And, and and and, what better game to play than Twister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie instinctively glanced at you, and you met her concerned gaze, but Kimberly talked first. \u201cGoodness, we haven\u2019t played that in ages. I suppose I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d The Smalls matriarch glanced at herself. \u201cLucky that I\u2019m already wearing appropriate attire.\u201d She said, in reference to her red blouse and black leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie flashed a cocky grin and a thumbs up. \u201cI\u2019m game! Just as long as everyone is alright with me winning!\u201d Her outfit was suitable for the game as is, consisting of a tight sports bra and compression shorts. Sophie was also already set, though her cute and revealing swimsuit was admittedly a little bit more risqu\u00e9 than one would normally see for a game of Twister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e nervously looked down at her own attire, an appealing low-cut t-shirt and jean shorts. \u201cUh\u2026I guess I\u2019m fine too. But do you really think that Jake can\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling overwhelmingly confident, you spoke up and cut off your fianc\u00e9e. \u201cI\u2019m all in! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d Kimberly raised her eyebrows in a mix of surprise and acceptance, Sophie and Maddie smiled happily, and Cassie gave you a worried look. Discreetly, you nodded your head to her, signifying that you\u2019d be fine. You desperately wanted to unwind after that story about Aunt Tara, and any chance to grow closer to her family members was a chance you\u2019d jump at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly pulling her eyes away from you, Cassie smiled at her youngest sister. You could see the hesitation still written on her face, but not in her voice as she spoke. \u201cAlright, Soph! Go get the game, and we\u2019ll move things around in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling gleefully, Sophie sprang from her seat and rushed out of the room. You hopped down from the table and scurried to the side of the room while the other Smalls women got to work. Maddie and Cassie skootched the couch closer to the wall and the reclining chair in the corner of the room. Kimberly dragged the center table across the carpet towards the wall, and you tried to pitch in by gathering up loose pieces of trash left behind under the couch and table, and threw them up into the nearby trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Sophie returned, carrying the hefty Twister box under her arm. She nearly stepped on you as she carelessly skipped back into the living room, but you managed to sidestep her foot stomping down. She didn\u2019t even notice, and you admittedly felt a sinking feeling deep within you that this was only a taste of what was going to come in the next hour. Still, you were determined to join the Smalls women in their family bonding time, and prove to Kimberly you were eager to be a part of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the box on the distant table, Sophie and Maddie pulled out the larger-than-usual play tarp and unrolled it across the carpet. The tarp, comprised of eight rows of eight colored dots, took up nearly all the empty space in the room. Cassie dutifully set four heavy books on the corners of the tarp to keep it from sliding or rolling up during the course of the impending game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cassie and Sophie got the special electronic spinner ready, Kimberly and Maddie took to stretching their arms and legs as a form of warmup before the game began. Taking a cue from them, you followed suit, sitting down and touching your toes and bending your arms behind your back. You got so involved in stretching that you didn\u2019t even notice Maddie take a few small steps back as she bent her knees and fell into a deep squat right above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you held up your arms to brace for impact, too startled to cry out. Thankfully, Maddie\u2019s descended butt hovered a few inches above your head. Still, it was petrifying to see her compression shorts-clad ass fill up your entire vision, one wrong move away from falling down and completely pulverizing you beneath it. You stayed frozen in place, trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, Maddie happened to glance backwards and spot you. She cocked her head to the side. \u201cUh, interesting stretch there, dude. Whatever works for ya!\u201d She smiled, then looked away. To her, your arms folded over your head to brace for what you thought was going to be a butt slam simply looked like odd yoga. She hadn\u2019t realized the effect her simply squatting had had on you. Yet another bad omen of things to come, but you ignored it and pushed your fears aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking loudly, Sophie drew everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright, time for the game to start! All five of us will be playing, and the electronic spinner will give each of us a turn in order. It\u2019ll call us out by our initials.\u201d She kicked out her dainty feet and wriggled her toes. \u201cAlso, I\u2019d totes recommend taking off socks. It\u2019s easy to slip on this mat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly nodded. \u201cOf course, safety first.\u201d Lifting one leg up at a time, she peeled her black socks off of her feet, and tossed them over her shoulder. Unfortunately, the trajectory sent the socks sailing straight towards you. Ducking under her first sock, the second slightly sweaty sock struck you in the face, knocking you onto your back. Before you could sit up, Maddie had also taken her socks off and tossed them in the same direction as her mother, and the tangy, moist socks slapped down on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were only socks, at the end of the day, so it took you no more than a few seconds to scramble out from underneath them. Still, their traces of sweat had stuck to you immediately. Also, as you stood up and moved away from them closer to the board, you noticed how none of the giantesses in the room had seen what they\u2019d just done. Even Cassie was smiling ear-to-ear at her sisters and mother, fully onboard with the idea of Twister now that they were all set to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith childlike glee, Sophie flicked the START switch on the electronic spinner with her toe, and a droning audio voice called out. \u201cPlayer S, right foot red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d Sophie exclaimed, leaping dramatically onto the play tarp and slamming her right foot onto one of the open red dots. Maddie and Cassie sighed at their sister\u2019s ridiculous exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer J, left hand green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, being the only one with a name beginning with \u2018J\u2019, knew that it was your turn now. Racing forward, you sprinted onto the tarp towards the nearest green dot, and slapped your hand down onto it. Sophie and Kimberly nodded in an approving manner, and Maddie get your gaze with a confident, competitive grin in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer C, left foot blue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned and stepped forward towards a blue dot, setting her foot down. Catching your eye, she winked and then suddenly paused. It dawned on her, her foot resting a few inches away from you, just how small you really were on this mat. Frowning, she turned to her family. \u201cH-hey, we\u2019re a lot bigger than Jake, so remember to watch\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer K, right hand yellow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Time to show you girls how to play this game!\u201d Kimberly announced loudly, walking onto the tarp and sliding her hand onto a yellow dot. She didn\u2019t even realize she\u2019d cut Cassie off, and before Cassie could try to re-announce her warning, the audio voice beat her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer M, left foot green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie rolled her shoulders as she entered the metaphorical ring, the last giantess onto the tarp. \u201cReally, mom? I\u2019m walking away with the win this time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie smirked playfully. \u201cOnly if you two can manage to beat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie, Maddie, and Kimberly all laughed, and even Cassie joined in. As the announcer voice cycled back to Sophie\u2019s turn, Cassie completely forgot about even giving her family an extra precautionary warning to watch out for you. You took notice of this, but tried to give the Smalls women the benefit of the doubt. Surely this would all work out okay, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing with your hand on the mat and your entire body fitting soundly on a single green circle, you took a moment to assess your surroundings. And by surroundings you meant the monolithic women practically filling all corners of your vision. This extra large twister mat meant that the colored dots were more spread out than on the original game. You stupidly had walked right towards the center section of green dots for some godforsaken reason, rather than start off towards the edge of the mat. Maddie, Sophie, and Kimberly, by some stroke of luck had at least a bit of distance between you and themselves. For once, the only person you were worried about at that moment was actually Cassie. For some reason she had chosen to place her left foot on the blue dot that was adjacent to your green one. Looking up in an effort to catch your fiance\u2019s attention for even a second, you unfortunately were unsuccessful. Cassie was already laughing and far too caught up in the excitement of playing a game with her family. You gulped with fear at whatever was about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer S, left hand yellow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie theatrically bent over and slammed her hand down onto a nearby yellow dot, bending her entire body at the waist. Her revealing bikini served only to slide further up her ass with this movement, showing a truly alarming amount of ass for a family game night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer J, left foot green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather thankful to have a relatively boring round, you simply removed your hand from the green dot beneath it and stood up to your full one foot height. Looking up as you did so, you saw Cassie\u2019s eyebrows raise almost as if the electronic spinner saying your name had reminded you of her existence. She quickly shot you a look and a warm smile. At least if the Smalls women forgot about you then the spinner wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer C, left foot red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some stroke of luck for once Cassie was able to move her foot far away from you!  You breathed a sigh of relief, seeing that you now had a respectable amount of distance from the entire family. At least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer K, right hand red.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was forced to bend over further, placing both hands onto the mat. You couldn\u2019t help but see the tremendous ass straining against her tight fabric in this somewhat compromising position. You forced yourself to look away out of respect for your future mother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer M, right foot blue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie\u2019s turn rang out, you noticed just how far away Maddie would have to move her right foot away from her left foot. She simply smirked and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch and learn you soon to be sore losers, this is how a pro plays twister.\u201d You could immediately tell Maddie\u2019s change in demeanor from mere moments ago. She didn\u2019t seem mean or anything but she was definitely fiercely competitive. You were just glad that her turn took her far away from you. Effortlessly she stretched her right leg far across the board, sending herself into a perfect split, hovering her ass mere inches across the mat without allowing it to hit the ground. Everyone else on the board, yourself included, was incredibly impressed. You, Cassie, and Sophie visibly admired Maddie\u2019s dedication, while Kimberly pretended not to care, showing clearly where Maddie got her competitive nature from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s and your turns passed rather uneventfully. Sophie simply had to place another hand down near herself, somehow accentuating her ass even more than before. And you just had to put your other foot down on green. Thankfully the group realized that you were at quite a disadvantage due to your size and allowed you to just stay standing on your lone, green dot. It was rather boring to be honest, but boring was significantly better than dangerous. Finally, Cassie\u2019s turn came once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlayer C, right foot yellow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned confidently for a moment before looking down at the mat. The only reachable patch of yellow dots for her were clear across the board\u2026 with your green dot smack dab in between them. Her eyes went wide with apprehension. Before she could even act Maddie hollered out from across the mat,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look who\u2019s joining the splits club! Finally someone else has something difficult to do!\u201d Cassie looked down at you for the briefest of moments, you had no idea what to do. You didn\u2019t want to seem lame by telling Cassie to be careful with you, and you definitely didn\u2019t want your fiance to lose the game first. With this in mind you spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Cass, you got this, show your fam a thing or two!\u201d Maddie cracked her knuckles in anticipation, Sophie giggled at the camaraderie you were showing, and Kimberly simply chuckled upon hearing a motivational speech coming from your one foot tall body. Without another word, Cassie\u2019s apprehensive face turned to one of determination. Quickly, she reached out with her right foot, casting you into its shadow briefly as it passed over your body. As her leg stretched further and further, you couldn\u2019t help but notice her denim-short clad butt approaching you rapidly as well. Cowering in fear for a moment, it seemed your fate as a splatter underneath her buns was all but sealed. But just as her ass was about to make contact with the top of your head, she stopped! You looked over and saw that Cassie had reached the other dot with her foot! You were about to take a moment and cheer on your fiance, but she spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh jeez I haven\u2019t stretched like this in a while, I think I\u2019m going to fall!\u201d Far above you, Kimberly was absolutely loving the situation. Not only was one competitor going to fall out of the game, but you were going to get absolutely obliterated in the process. It was a win-win. However, surprising the entire room, including Cassie, out of nowhere you stuck your hands directly upward! Pressing firmly with every ounce of strength that you had into each butt cheek, Cassie felt the pressure on her body ease up ever so slightly. Looking down she just barely saw your tiny form, directly beneath her, giving it your all to keep her afloat! All four women were shocked you had the strength to do so, most of all Kimberly. In reality, Cassie was still supporting about 90% of her own weight, in any regular circumstances you wouldn\u2019t come close to being able to hold her up. But by some stroke of luck the stars had aligned and you were doing it. Feeling like Atlas holding up the entire world, you dug your heels into the mat and steadied your stance. Even if you couldn\u2019t win this game, you would do everything in your power to help Cassie win it!</span></div></div>",

The rest of us don't have help! Unless you can somehow lend us all a hand you need to let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on! No cheating! Don't be a bad sport!\" Chides Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheater, cheater, cheaterrrrr!\" Sophie sings at you. Looking back and shaking her head in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Looking up, just barely seeing Cassie's face peeking down at you last her expansive booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's kinda right... don't worry Jake. I'll hold on for you!\"<br>\r\nYou watch and feel as she rises slightly. Putting everything she has into keeping herself elevated to prevent crushing her tiny lover. Just then, the buzzer finishes what it was in the middle of saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... foot blue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all look around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! All that talking made us miss my turn! Guess we should let it cycle through back to me.\" Kimberly says, the faintest smile on her face as she makes eye contact with you. The other girls agree, and even though your response is drowned out, you begrudgingly do as well, looking up at Cassie's butt, inches above you...<br>\r\nAs you all wait for a few seconds, the buzzer going through Maddie's turn and then Sophie's, and so on, you watch Cassie's butt slowly descend. A light grunt barely reaching your ears as her legs shake ever so slightly. She was going to fall any second, you just knew it. Kimberly took her turn, Maddie next. Cassie's butt descending a bit more, brushing against the top of your head, you crouched down, even still you could feel the warmth radiating off her ass and thighs as they loomed over your dot ominously. You glanced around in worry;The other girls were caught up in the suspense as Maddie placed her hand on a dot after leaning back to reach it. <br>\r\nIt was Sophie's turn! She took it, placing her foot down on a dot nearby. And finally-<br>\r\n\"Player J, left hand blue\"<br>\r\nYou were relieved you got something other then green for once! Since you were excused from doing any of the crazy stretching the rest of the girls were doing, you quickly scanned the board around you and ran to the first free one you spotted. This far into the game there wasn't exactly any \"safe\" areas. But any spot was safer then directly underneath Cassie! As you hopped onto your new dot, you noticed you were nearby Kimberly. Not the best place to be, but hopefully you wouldn't come to regret it by the end of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Player C, right foot Green\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed in relief, bringing her right foot slamming down on the spot you previously occupied. (You didn't notice her check to make sure you had moved. Hopefully she had another spot in mind if you were stuck on green that turn.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Player K, left hand red\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kimberly's turn and just as you turned to look at her you saw her massive chest flying towards you! Instinctively you duck, feeling the breeze as her tits flew over you and swung back and forth as her left hand touched the red dot beside your blue dot.<br>\r\n\"Don't get the wrong idea, Jake! Just a game after all.\" She chuckled down to you. <br>\r\nAs you looked back up, you saw her, bent over above you, her enormous tits lightly swinging ( and threatening to fall out of her top) as they took up most of the space above. Leaving you crouched down beneath her. The girls all share in a laugh at your embarrassing situation. Cassie gives you a small frown, she was well aware of how humiliated you must be feeling now. Though really terror was the only emotion you felt at the moment. Kimberly's boobs were just as if not more imposing as a small trickle of sweat rained down upon you from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As a few drops of sweat dripped out of Kimberly's crevasse of cleavage, you couldn't help but feel terrified. From your current perspective crouched underneath the two massive breasts above you, it honestly looked like each of her breasts was as big as your entire body. And thanks to them being significantly wider than your slender frame was, each one probably weighed more than you as well. You had no idea what you were going to do. You well being laid entirely in the matriarch of the family's ability to hold herself up in this strange position. One slip and you would be absolutely decimated. Unfortunately, reaching up and giving her a hand like you did with Cassie was absolutely off the table. Even though she joked about you giving the rest of the girls a hand, taking her up on that offer and sinking your hands into her massive breasts seemed like a one way ticket into being kicked out of the house. You could only stay where you were and pray that Maddie got her athleticism from her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, you must have been zoned out in your scared stupor, because the rest of the Smalls girls' turns passed by and it was yours again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Player J, right hand blue.\" the buzzer announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and cursing your stupid luck, you briefly considered quitting the game entirely at that point. It was only getting more and more dangerous for a one foot tall person. But you didn't want to make your first impression one of a quitter, so you dropped the idea. Reaching down with your right hand, now in a full squat to have both hands on the floor as well as duck underneath the orbs of white flesh hanging above you, you completed your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Player C, left hand yellow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out into the sliver of daylight you could see beyond Kimberly's monolithic body, you saw Cassie bend over to reach her left hand into position. Her foot which was still occupying your previous space, twisted and smeared itself across the dot. You breathed a sigh of relief, thanking the universe that at the very least you weren't squashed there. However, in all honesty getting stomped on by your fiance might be a better fate than what may be coming with Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Player K, right hand blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, looking upwards. Now looking downwards, you could have sworn that you saw a look of victory in Kimberly's eyes, despite the fact that she would have to get into a fairly difficult position. Scanning around you saw that the only reachable blue dot was close to you, in line with both you and her left hand that was resting on a red dot. From the looks of it, Kimberly would have to lean down into an almost push-up like position to hold onto all 4 of her current dots at once. You realized what that meant for you a moment too late, as Kimberly reached out her right hand and dropped her body quickly towards you. Just as her right hand make contact with the blue dot, her entire torso lowered dramatically towards the ground, with you directly underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*squish*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's breasts made a shockingly noticeable noise upon making contact with both you and the plastic mat beneath her. What she didn't even notice herself was that your body wedged itself from head to toe deep into her cleavage. Then once her boobs made contact with the mat itself they squished together further, completely flattening your body like a sticker onto the inside of her right boob. Your head was sunk deep down between the mounds, and your feet were slapped onto the skin near her nipple. You had quite literally disappeared in the blink of an eye, only Kimberly was visible to the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah you lose, mom!\" Maddie shouted triumphantly from across the mat, somehow still holding her incredibly difficult splits, now with her hands askew as well. \"Your boobs are totally touching the ground!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked back confidently, enjoying the fact that she got to squish you as well as stay in the game. It really was a win-win for her. The truth was that she really had not completely warmed up to you yet, and this was only one of many tests of hers to determine how you are going to handle everyday situations. Storytelling can only take you so far, in her mind you needed to show her first hand how capable you were. Responding to Maddie, she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Maddie, you only lose if a knee or an elbow touches the ground. And I can't help it if my breasts have made contact with the mat, maybe some day you girls will understand me but for now... it seems like you three aren't quite on my level.\" Kimberly jokingly poked fun at all three of her daughters. While each of the Smalls sisters were astoundingly beautiful in their own right, nobody could argue against Kimberly when talking about the sheer size of their assets. You felt doubly disheartened upon hearing Kimberly be apparently fun and lighthearted with her daughters, because it seemed like every time her attention turned to you she was all business. Sighing internally, you could only hope to one day reach that level of closeness with your future mother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie then chimed in, \"Ugh you're actually right, but come on why is it fair that you get to rest part of your body on the ground when Jake couldn't hel... wait a second... MOM was Jake on that dot that your boobs just slammed into?!\" You metaphorically jumped for joy upon hearing your loving savior ask about your well being. Kimberly, on the other hand, was slightly annoyed that she hadn't gotten away with her plan scot-free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps he was? I'm not sure.\" Kimberly tried to sidestep the question with uncertainty. But pushing the issue further, Cassie leaned down even further in her contorted twister position as well to stare into the abyss of her mother's cleavage. While Kimberly's boobs were squished together forcefully by the ground, Cassie just barely made out the two dimensional sticker forms of your feet stuck firmly to her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god mom, he is under there! You have to let him out!\" Cassie exclaimed, further elating you. But little did she know, as much as Cassie cared for you, which was an astronomical amount, she respected her mom even more. At the end of the day, Cassie never had the guts to stand up to her mom too much, when the Smalls mother put her foot down then her foot was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I am so sorry, Jake\" Kimberly said pretending to care about your current state, \"However Cassie, I will say Jake is certainly not helping me in the same manner that he was helping you. In fact, his body being squished to my breasts is only weighing me down further, actually putting me at a disadvantage in this game! The way I see it is that thanks to me, Jake has unfortunately lost the game because he is no longer able to move to the correct dots. And while I do feel bad about that\" (she didn't) \"that does not mean that I am obliged to risk losing the game as well just to help him. We will play out the rest of the game and free him right as it ends, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's stern resolution sent the message loud and clear to the girls that there was no freeing you until the game ended. A moment of tension hung in the air before passing as the spinner called out the next turn again, reigniting each girl's passion for the game...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even hearing stories about your torturous times with Tara were making her furious to hear. Part of you wanted to stop talking about the struggles of your younger years, but on the other hand, these stories really seemed to be captivating the rest of the Smalls. Most importantly, they seemed to be winning over Kimberly. For this reason, when Kimberly said, \u201cForgive me, Jake, but please continue about your Aunt Tara. I find your dynamic with her fascinating\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassuring Cassie with an understanding smile, you turned back to the rest of the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, no problem, I\u2019m alive to tell the tales after all so it\u2019s not the end of the world to talk about them. I\u2019ll tell you the story of when Tara used me to scam people out of their money\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease mom I\u2019m sixteen years old I can take care of myself!\u201d You pleaded with your mother as she stood at the front door, packed bag in hand and ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but you know it\u2019s just too dangerous to leave you alone for the weekend! And I can\u2019t just skip this work conference so you need to accept it! You and Tara will have a blast together!\u201d Your mom said down to you in a reassuring voice. No matter how many times you came to your mom to tell her about how horribly Tara treated you, she had never believed it even once. Even times where she had literally found you plastered to your Aunt all it took was a quick lie from Tara to prove her complete innocence in your mom\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming voice from behind you reassured your mother that she had nothing to worry about. \u201cYep! Jake and I will have lots of fun this weekend! Now go enjoy your trip, sis!\u201d You looked back over your shoulder to see a pair of enormous soles, propped up on their heels mere inches behind your body. With a struggle you looked past them to see the mischievous grin of your Aunt, looking back and forth between you and your mom. You prayed that your mom would at least say something about how close Tara had her feet to your body, but of course she didn\u2019t. She simply wished you both the best and left, shutting the door behind her. Practically quivering at this point, Tara spread her feet apart just slightly so she could at least see your 9 inch tall body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, squirt! A whole weekend together, I really am excited, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tara said down with surprising sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut the crap, Tara, and just step on me, sit on me, chew me up, do whatever you have planned but please just get it over with and don\u2019t pretend like you like me.\u201d You said back up to her, already accepting how powerless you were compared to this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn, kid! I honestly wasn\u2019t planning on squashing you at all today, but hey if you insist!\u201d Tara laughed out her words and immediately raised a visibly damp foot over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT! I take it back\u2026 you aren\u2019t going to squish me today? Is this some sort of elaborate prank to get me not to expect it?\u201d You asked curiously. Tara simply chuckled and actually removed her foot from above you, placing it back on the ground beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I won\u2019t! But I did have a fun idea about something we could do together.\u201d Tara leaned forward in her chair, moving her feet back but now looming her torso ominously above you. Her breasts threatened to fall out of the unnecessarily skimpy white tube top she was wearing, briefly distracting you for a moment before fear knocked you back into your senses. She then continued, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to the mall and get women to think they either killed or seriously injured you! Then I\u2019ll say they either have the option of me pressing charges or if they pay me off then I\u2019ll let them go! It\u2019s genius!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your ears. You knew Tara was a despicable person based on the way that she treated you, but this was a new low. Not only would you be put in danger as per usual, but she would be torturing other people as well! You had to stand up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding, no way! I refuse!\u201d Taking a stand you rejected Tara\u2019s ridiculous offer. In response she simply took a moment, raised her eyebrows, and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my backup plan is shoving you between my ass cheeks and watching 72 hours of reality TV straight on this couch, so sure I respect your decision! Do you feel like saying no to me was the right idea, huh?\u201d Tara threatened you with three straight days of butt imprisonment like it was absolutely nothing and you immediately took back everything you said. As much as you disagreed with her plan to scam people, at least you would hopefully get some breaks between being squished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay nevermind I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry! Let\u2019s do your first plan!\u201d You shouted up to her. Tara just smiled triumphantly before grabbing you roughly in her hand. She held you up close to her face and immediately snapped a photo of you two together on her phone. Reading your mind about why she just did that, she said, \u201cFor proof! I need to tell people you\u2019re my son and might have to prove it with this picture.\u201d For once Tara actually made sense to you, it just had to be in the context of a scummy plan to steal people\u2019s money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, pipsqueak, let\u2019s roll!\u201d Tara quickly scooped up her purse and slipped her flip flops on, heading out the door. As you were roughly the size of a large G.I. Joe action figure, Tara had no issue stuffing your entire body in her fittingly gaudy purse. She tossed you in there carelessly, then zipping up the top to seal you in utter darkness. From what little light you could see you were sharing the space with various old candy wrappers, some lipstick, and what looked like a vape pen. You groaned at how indicative these contents were of your Aunt\u2019s gross personality. Without another word to you, Tara got into her comically oversized Hummer and started up the engine, placing you on the center console and starting her drive to the mall. Immediately she started blasting some terrible country rock, singing along loudly to it as she sped 20 mph over the speed limit down the road. This woman really was the epitome of trash, something you wished you had the guts to say to her at least once, but your natural instincts of self-preservation prevented you from doing so. Around 15 minutes passed and Tara screeched into a parking spot, sending your body lurching forward as well as causing the contents of her purse to jostle and slam into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmingly, still without a word to you in your purse prison, Tara grabbed her purse and began strutting towards the mall. Wearing a matching white mini skirt to match her white tube top, she was effectively showing about 95% of the skin on her body. And with each passing step, her outrageously large ass caused the skirt to ride up, revealing the last few percent of covered skin she had left before she would reach down to adjust it and begin the cycle once again. You were simply waiting in the darkness, praying that Tara\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t be too horrible for you. But soon enough, nearly 10 additional minutes had passed and Tara still hadn\u2019t addressed you! Just as you were starting to get really confused, you heard her annoying voice high above you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh now these are hot!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was freaking shopping! She had forgotten about her own idiotic plan, and more importantly had forgotten about you entirely! Furiously, you acted without thinking and began to slam your body back and forth against the walls of her purse. Luckily, you weren\u2019t so small that you were unnoticeable, so Tara immediately felt the shifting weight in her off hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Tara unzipped her purse and light shined into your dungeon for the first time in half an hour. \u201cOh shit! Short stuff I almost forgot all about you! You\u2019re just so damn easy to forget about! I threw you into my purse like some sort of accessory and you slipped my mind almost instantly! Thanks for reminding me that you existed, if you didn\u2019t then I probably would have just left you in my purse and shopped around then went home! Now we can get back to my plan!\u201d</span></div></div>",

But now you were back in it. Tara immediately fished you out of her purse and placed the clothes that she was holding down walking out of the store. Heading towards the food court she scoured the area looking for the perfect dupe. Taking a seat on a nearby bench she continued to look around until she finally saw her target. She smiled and held you up, your body still in her fist, forcing you to look at the woman. Immediately you could tell why Tara had picked her. She was clad head to toe in designer clothing, rocking a red velour sweatsuit that struggled to smuggle her tremendously curvy body. From what you could tell, the woman clearly has had some work done, and you heavily doubted whether or not her tremendous assets were natural. Gulping in fear, you noticed that she was deep in a conversation on the phone, but worst of all she was heading right for your bench. Tara turned you back around to face her briefly to whisper, \u201cOperation Sit and Scam is a go, let\u2019s do this.\u201d In a flash Tara tossed your body onto the hard, wooden bench, and you had only a second to look up at the wall of red velour fabric coming at your body like a meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Splat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rich woman slammed her ass down onto the bench without a glimpse at anything that might have been lying on it. Unfortunately for you, you were just big enough to annoy the lady with your presence underneath her buns, but not big enough to make her think you were a person for even a second. Immediately she squirmed in her seat, smearing your body back and forth underneath her buns. You were in hell, but you were at least holding up your end of the plan according to Tara. Now it was her turn. Biting her tongue to control the gut-wrenching laughter that she usually felt when she saw you get squished, she steeled her nerves and put on the face of a devastated mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. Oh my god, miss, you just sat on my son! Get up right now!\u201d Tara said in an honestly impressive stroke of acting. The rich woman turned and looked at her, utterly perplexed before seeing how worried Tara seemed to be. Hanging up her phone call she stood up and turned around to see the image of your body, completely flattened and motionless on the bench. Tara pretended to faint for a moment upon seeing your body and the woman understandably began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know! Oh god why is he so small and why was he sitting on the bench alone!?\u201d The mystery woman asked Tara. With this response Tara knew she had this woman like putty in her hands. Metaphorically speaking of course, the only person who could literally be like putty in her hands was of course you. She just had to bring it home with a killer performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s practically dead! You just broke every bone in his body with your fat ass!\u201d Tara pretended to cry and quickly grabbed your pancaked body in her hands, holding you up towards her breasts to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d The woman exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it! I\u2019m calling the cops and telling them there was an attempted manslaughter at the mall\u2026 that is\u2026 unless\u2026 you really want this to go away.\u201d Tara began to work her magic. As much as you hated this woman with every fiber of your being, you had to admit she really was incredible at convincing people of things. Perhaps in another world she could have been an actor rather than a con artist and all around jerk. She continued talking, \u201cI think for around $20,000 we could cover his medical expenses and pretend this didn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny halfway intelligent person would be shocked and appalled at what she had heard. Based on what Tara had just said, she would practically trade her son\u2019s life for $20,000. But by some stroke of luck this rich woman just had to be an absolute airhead as well, as she didn\u2019t pick up on the lunacy of the situation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, yes please, take $50,000 for all I care! I can\u2019t be accused of doing something like this, especially not after the car accident last month!\u201d The woman exclaimed in utter panic, all while reaching into her bag and pulling out a check book to write a check on the spot to Tara. Both you and Tara actually shared a very confused reaction to what the mystery woman had just said. But neither of you wanted to press the issue and find out more, well you were incapable, and Tara was more interested in giving the woman her information to receive a whopping $50,000. A few moments later the deed was done, Tara held the check in her hands and clutched you against her breasts, pretending to cry more over the \u201ctragic fate\u201d of her \u201cson\u201d. It all made you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rich woman immediately fled the scene, running straight out of the mall towards her car. Once she was out of earshot, Tara pulled you away from her chest and wiped her fake tears off of her face. Looking down at you she was absolutely ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, shrimp! I deserve an oscar for that performance! And look how much I scored!\u201d You, meanwhile, had to sit and listen to your Aunt\u2019s horrible gloating as you just focused on reforming from the utter decimation you had just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she got away with it, too. She really is just the worst.\u201d You finished your story somberly to the Smalls women. Everyone was too stunned at that tale to even laugh, including the normally overwhelmingly giggly Sophie. Once again, however, Kimberly seemed to be some bizarre mixture of impressed and further intrigued. You didn\u2019t know her well enough still, but she actually respected that level of resourcefulness from Tara, even though it was for a morally negative cause. Further, your ability to follow that plan even at your own risk was actually a good thing to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is quite a story, Jake. I must say you did the best with the situation once again, I\u2019m glad to know you when to go along with someone else\u2019s judgment, even if you don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d Kimberly said down to you. You honestly hated telling that story, it made you feel bad to even take part in such a scam, but if it earned even the slightest bit of favor in Kimberly\u2019s eyes then you were glad that you did.</span></div></div>",

What about when you two first met?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think for a moment, the first time you met your terror of an Aunt had been very soon after you and your mother had discovered your squishy characteristics in the first place. In fact, it was so soon after that fateful encounter with your mom that she hadn\u2019t even had a chance to tell anyone about your new \u201cability\u201d so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback begin)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere days had passed since your mom\u2019s great fall off of the ladder that ended up with your first time being completely splattered under her massive ass. In the time being the two of you had finished setting up all of your holiday decorations around the house, with Christmas coming up in the next few days. Unfortunately for you, ever since that fateful encounter between you and your mom\u2019s butt she had slowly but surely become less paranoid about your wellbeing. While this was great in part due to the fact that you had a bit more freedom for the first time in your life, it also meant the two of you were starting to have more frequent meetups between your (at that time) 6 inch body and her various gigantic body parts. Luckily for you, this exact moment was not one of those incidents, as you were happily sitting on the couch watching TV while your mom was in the kitchen. However unluckily for you, at that moment you heard a knock at the door. Being a bright-eyed kid without much experience to the world of gigantic women who didn\u2019t know you existed, you were excited at the prospect of meeting another family member! Little did you know that the person you were so eagerly looking forward to meeting would end up being the source of limitless torture for you from that moment on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until that day you had never actually met your Aunt Tara. You had only heard stories from your mom recounting how she was always the most fun-loving, pleasant person to be around when they were growing up. Needless to say this got you very excited to meet another person to have fun with! The reason that you two had yet to meet was because she previously lived across the country with her own family. But for reasons that were not made clear to you, she split from her husband because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t take it anymore\u201d. Not being able to understand what that meant until much later, you were still greatly looking forward to meeting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments after the knocking your mom came bounding to the door, running past you in a pair of casual black leggings and a loose t-shirt. She swung the door open and a duet of shrieks bellowed loudly out as the two sisters greeted each other. You could just barely see from your perspective the bleached blonde and scantily clad women who must have been your Aunt standing in the doorway. Both being a kid at this point in time as well as the fact that these two women were related to you meant that you had absolutely zero attraction to either of them, but from a purely curious perspective you couldn\u2019t help but notice how outrageously curvy each of their bodies were. You briefly considered hopping off of the couch and running up to greet her, but before you could your mom ushered Aunt Tara into the house and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just about to put some gingerbread cookies in the oven, kick back and relax. I'll come out here and hang in a second!\u201d Your mom exclaimed before giddily speed walking back to the kitchen. You were excited to see just how enthusiastic your mom was to have her sister back in town, so needless to say you couldn\u2019t wait to meet your Aunt. At that moment Tara took a few steps towards you and dropped her bags off by the side of the couch. You were just about to open your mouth and greet her when her enormous thighs brushed past your seated position on the couch, turning around at the same time. Your eyes went wide and you felt a nervous lump in your stomach, preventing you from making even a peep as you could only look up at the tiny pencil skirt struggling to contain the globes of meat that your Aunt called her butt. Not having much experience with these situations yet in your life, you had no idea how to react. Had she really not seen you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer the question that your inner monologue posed, Tara\u2019s skirt-covered ass slammed into your half-foot tall body, compressing you and the couch cushion beneath you in an instant. Surprisingly, your body actually made an audible squishing noise as her weight decimated you, prompting a confused look from Tara. She looked around but saw nothing, assuming that it must just be one of the natural creaks of a well-worn couch. The truth was, she had heard about you from your mom, but knew nothing of your squishy characteristics in the slightest. Tara had no reason to think that she possibly had compressed her nephew into a little sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright sis now that I\u2019m single and ready to mingle are we hitting the town and scoring us some guys or what?!\u201d Tara bellowed out towards your mom who was around the corner. She then kicked her feet up on the coffee table in front of her, transferring even more weight onto your completely flattened self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTara, I have to look after Jake now I can\u2019t just be going out willy nilly with you!\u201d Your mom joked back from around the corner. You, obviously, could hear none of what your mom was saying beneath the tons of insulation above you, but you would have appreciated her words if you could have heard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah your tiny kid! I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s just six inches tall, where is he?!\u201d Tara yelled back. In reality she was a bit annoyed that her sister was now such a responsible parent and wasn\u2019t as interested in living the out of control lifestyle that Tara loved. But she was still much more interested to meet a miniature person than she was annoyed at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was right on the couch last time I checked! Just look around!\u201d Your mom yelled back finally before resuming her baking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara immediately furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. She scanned her surroundings and didn\u2019t find a single trace of her 6 inch tall nephew. Just then her eyes shot open in shock. The squish that she heard when she sat down. Her heart began to race. If a six inch tall person was sitting on the couch beneath her when she sat down then there was no chance in hell that he would have survived her weight. Immediately she began to nervously perspire, something you felt just as fast even through the fabric of her skirt. Slowly she lifted her buns off of the couch and began to swipe her ass with her hands, praying that she wouldn\u2019t find anything under her. However, she caught what first felt like a bit of loose fabric then grabbed it tighter and yanked it free. Bringing it around to her frontside she nearly fainted. There was her tiny little nephew, completely squashed flat and not moving in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sitting in your Aunt\u2019s hands you tried to force yourself to move and get your body unstuck. But being so inexperienced with the whole ordeal you couldn\u2019t move a muscle, let alone speak. Immediately Tara began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap I just killed you! Oh god what do I do, I can\u2019t let her catch me like this!\u201d Tara whispered frantically to herself. At that exact moment your mom walked back around the corner and Tara squashed you flat into her fist, hiding you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright the cookies are in the oven, now we just have to frost them when they get out!\u201d Your mom said happily, heading towards the couch to spend some quality time with her sister. When she turned around to plop her equally massive ass onto the couch, Tara had the first of her cunning yet torturous ideas that would follow in the years to come. In a flash she threw your crumpled body onto the cushion right where her sister was going to sit. A split second later you felt the soul-crushing weight of yet another Bigg family member dominate your entire reality. As your mom settled into her seat and started to strike up a conversation with her sister, Tara interrupted her immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to tell you this but\u2026 you just sat on your son and killed him.\u201d Tara said gravely, leaning forward and touching your mom\u2019s knee in support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Your mom stood up immediately and reached around to the backside of her ass. Due to its sheer size she struggled finding you for a moment, but once she did she quickly peeled you off and held your flattened body in her hand. She felt bad about crushing you as she never liked to do it on purpose, but looking over at her sister freaking out while knowing that you were actually completely fine caused her to giggle a bit, then break into a full laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was doubly shocked, still assuming that her nephew was dead, and now her sister was laughing?! But just then, after nearly a minute your two dimensional form popped back to normal! In reality you hadn\u2019t been squashed for too long, so it didn\u2019t take you all that long to reform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dead, Tara! Oh my goodness no! He can squish and bend and he\u2019ll always come back to normal!\u201d Your mom exclaimed, telling someone else about your unique qualities for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was still too stunned for a moment to speak. She wouldn\u2019t have believed what she had just heard if she didn\u2019t witness it only moments prior. Now staring down at you her face went from shock to an ear-to-ear smile as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kiddin me! He\u2019s indestructible and you\u2019ve been worrying about him for all these years! Girl this is great news! Now we can hit the town and party just like we used to without worrying about him!\u201d Tara exclaimed happily. She figured that now knowing that your tiny self would be safe, neither of them would need to preoccupy themselves with your wellbeing. Unfortunately for her, your mom felt otherwise.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Tara did not take the news quite as warmly. \u201cI\u2019m going to run check on the oven real quick, keep bonding while I\u2019m gone!\u201d Your mom concluded before dropping you somewhat roughly into Tara\u2019s hand and walking back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Tara gave you a look that you would recognize for years to come. A mixture of arrogance, slight disdain, and interest that spelt nothing but dread for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, shrimp. If you\u2019re as indestructible as my sister says then you gotta stop getting in the way of her living her life. And more importantly, stop getting in the way of her having fun with me! Got it!?\u201d Tara held you close to her face, her gigantic mouth mere inches away from you blasting you with hot air as you spoke. You trembled with fear. You hadn\u2019t had any interactions with people like her thus far in your life. But for the first time you felt as powerless as your body made you out to be. And with that feeling came the spark of your combative relationship with your Aunt Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(CONTINUING FLASHBACK INTO FURTHER OPTIONS)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara eased herself off of the couch, while simultaneously squashing you flat as she clenched her fist. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re basically invincible, right? Your mom said you always bounce back and reform, so you must not be able to get hurt?\u201d Tara laughed, a harsh sound, even though her conclusion was totally wrong. You absolutely could get hurt. \u201cThen why is she so worried about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering over to the kitchen, Tara tucked your crumpled body into her slightly sweaty cleavage, then sidled up next to your mom, playfully bumping her with her butt. Your mom giggled and bumped Tara back, the slight action causing intense jiggling in Tara\u2019s tits, as they were only loosely held by a skimpy bra under her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I help frost some of the cookies?\u201d Tara asked, as innocently as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom grinned. \u201cI\u2019d love that. As long as you don\u2019t mind that I have to go use the bathroom real quick. Shouldn\u2019t take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, sis.\u201d Tara smiled, stepping aside to let your mom breeze by out of the kitchen and towards the bathroom. Once Tara heard the bathroom door click shut, she stuck a hand between her boobs, fumbling around for you. You\u2019d squashed quite a bit while in her cleavage, even though it\u2019d been less than a minute, but finally she felt you and pulled your body out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to hide the maliciously mischievous grin on her face, Tara took your gummy-like body and held you over the batch of thirty delectable, freshly baked gingerbread cookies. Biting her lip in concentration, your aunt squeezed your body into a shape resembling that of the cookies. She rounded out your head, squashed your neck down, and bulked up your chest and legs. She also folded up your fingers and toes into your hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Tara slapped you down onto a cookie right in the middle of the patch. The gingerbread was still sizzling, and your mangled mouth gurgled out a shocked cry of pain as the hyper-heated pastry burned your back. Staring up at Tara, you fought with every fiber of your being to wiggle or squirm, but she\u2019d done a number on your by molding your malleable body into this shape. You could only lie there as Tara turned her back on you for a second, and returned to your view with a bottle filled to the brim with frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry kid, but you make for a bad decoration.\u201d Tara shrugged with infuriating indifference. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if you add anything to the taste.\u201d She laughed again, before leaning over the plate of cookies. You internally screamed, but were still hopelessly powerless as her hands clenched around the bottle of frosting, and a veritable bucket load dripped from the bottle down onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frosting piled onto your face and chest, as Tara dumped a considerable amount onto you. Almost immediately, everything around you became darkness as the gelatinous frosting clumped over top of you. Tara used a nearby knife to spread the frosting out, lathering up every inch of the gingerbread cookie, and by extension, you. When she was finished, the frosting formed a perfect, solid layer, utterly masking your own flattened body hiding between it and the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Tara began applying a few pieces of candy to the cookie, arranging them to form a happy, smiling face. While she did so, she continued taunting you, though you could barely hear her through the thick, viscous layer of frosting. \u201cDon\u2019t worry kid, just think about how happy this\u2019ll make your mom. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll savor every last bite of you. Then, I\u2019ll just fish you from the toilet in a day or two before she flushes, make up some story that proves I\u2019m innocent.\u201d Tara paused, and rolled her eyes. \u201cIf I even remember. Heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara leaned back from her masterpiece right as she heard the flush of the toilet from down the hall. Admiring her handiwork, Tara couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of happiness. Seeing how much you had changed her beloved sister had really ruined her day, but seeing how easily she could use you for her own ends, while simultaneously getting you out of the way certainly gave her a bit of a thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom walked back into the kitchen, and squealed with delight. \u201cOh my gosh, Tara! That looks so cute!\u201d She gave your aunt a big hug. \u201cYou did an awesome job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks sis.\u201d Tara beamed. \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019d have had much less self-control back at my own home. All these babies would be in my gut right now.\u201d She patted her stomach for emphasis. \u201cBut they do taste better when you have the restraint to decorate \u2018em first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom grabbed the bottle of frosting and began coating her own cookie. \u201cBy the way, is Jake helping to decorate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara hid her grimace at hearing your name. \u201cNah, he said he didn\u2019t want to. Maybe he went back upstairs, I don\u2019t know. I left him on the couch.\u201d Tara shrugged. \u201cProbably doesn\u2019t want to end up eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom winced. \u201cYeah\u2026that makes sense, I guess.\u201d She smiled sheepishly, and a faint blush arose in her cheeks. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026have eaten him once or twice. Or five or ten times.\u201d Your mom\u2019s blush deepened as Tara\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBut it\u2019s always on accident! He\u2019s just so prone to freak accidents, and I get so\u2026inattentive? Unobservant? Whenever I\u2019m around food I hardly pay attention to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Tara nodded, trying to appear nonchalant, while simultaneously adding one more \u201ceating accident\u201d to your mom\u2019s tally, even if it was a bit preemptive. It was only a matter of time, really. Tara glanced down at the plate, at her delicately detailed gingerbread cookie masking a squishy boy underneath. She watched your mom casually squish her thumb into the cookie\u2019s chest as she leaned over to decorate another cookie, and Tara knew without a doubt that you\u2019d go straight down her sister\u2019s throat without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, it took the two women nearly an hour and a half to decorate all thirty cookies. Each of the gingerbread cookies looked scrumptious, but Tara\u2019s first and finest effort still stood out from the rest. As the two giantess sisters sat down at the table, the plate between them, Tara couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of you, not as your mom\u2019s stomach kept gurgling every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to be suspicious, Tara picked the cookie you were glued to off of the plate. \u201cCare for a cookie, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom frowned. \u201cWell, I would\u2026but why that one? That\u2019s your prettiest one! Don\u2019t you want to eat it yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had to admit, she really, really did. But there was something so much funnier about the squishy squirt\u2019s own mom doing the deed, so instead, she merely shook her head. \u201cNah, I made it for you, sis.\u201d She extended her hand to her sister, and your mom carefully grabbed the cookie from Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you, Tara.\u201d Your mom smiled warmly. She looked down at the cookie, which appeared to be nothing but an ordinary, very intricately detailed gingerbread pastry. No sign of her beloved son was visible, nor did your mother have any possible inkling to believe that you were trapped under a layer of frosting on this cookie. She only licked her lips, her eyes glinting with ravenous hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her gaze away from the cookie, your mom looked Tara in the eye and spoke\u2026but what did she say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(CONTINUING FLASHBACK INTO FURTHER OPTIONS)</span></div></div>",

Your mom wasn't lying when she said that you two have had a good number of times like this happen before. Sadly you knew quite well the torture that was coming for you if your mom wasn't stopped before eating you. While it was true that you wouldn't die or be totally digested by her giant stomach, it was still a miserably hot, claustrophobic, and to be honest slightly boring experience to live through until you were freed.

But unfortunately for you, being eaten by her happened with such alarming regularity that you both started to discover that it wasn't really all that dangerous for you. Something about your special body kept you alive even passing through her... entire digestive system. You whimpered thinking about the horrifying and downright embarrassing few times that you had gone through the entire process, being forced to call out to your own mother from inside the toilet bowl that she was currently sitting on. It was traumatic and humiliating to say the least, and now thanks to Tara it seemed entirely likely that you would have to go through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to contain a bout of evil laughter, Tara decided to truly seal your fate by saying, \"Hey sis I bet you can't eat the entire thing in one bite like you used to!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you think I can't!? Watch this!\" Your mom happily responded before opening her mouth as wide as she could. You couldn't see anything due to the layer of frosting, but when you felt your surroundings shift from cool outside air to humid, hot breath you could already tell you were beyond saving. She had to crumple up your legs to fit your entire cookie form in her mouth at the same time, but by some miracle of effort on her part she did it. Immediately her powerful teeth slammed down on your body, sending waves of pain throughout your entire self through the simple act of chewing. A few rounds of catastrophic chomping passed by, completely mashing your body, the cookie, and the frosting together into some unrecognizable blob. Then suddenly your mom spoke with her mouth still full,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm this is really chewy... just like I like my gingerbread cookies!\" As she finished her sentence her mouth closed back up and she swallowed the entire mouthful effortlessly down her gullet. \"Man that was so good! Eat one Tara before I eat them all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara sat there with a shit-eating grin plastered on her face. Her plan was a rousing success and she felt like she was on top of the world. It was just so damn easy to mess with your helpless, tiny self, and she was loving every second of it. Not only that, but now that you were soundly on your way into her sister's stomach, she could focus on the nice sisterly bonding time that she wanted all along. A true win-win for her. Finally she responded to your mom, saying \"Can do!\" before the two giantesses immediately began shoving cookie after cookie down their throats. Nearly 15 minutes passed by and somehow the two Bigg sisters had consumed every cookie on the tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta tell you, Tara. Those were all amazing but the first one you frosted was a masterpiece. It was extra soft and delicious compared to the rest! Did you do anything special to it?\" Your mom lauded Tara's work incessantly, not knowing that the special addition was her tiny, squishy son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara debated for the briefest second suggesting that you might have been mixed in with the cookie to give it its extra softness, but decided against it. She figured that just because your mom could be tricked into torturing you without knowing it didn't mean that she would be on board with doing any of this stuff to you willingly. To Tara's dismay she could tell your mom genuinely loved you, and would never intentionally mess with you the way Tara would want her to. Resigning these pranks to be a one-sided affair, Tara simply smiled and said, \"No clue, sis, that one might have been furthest away from the flame in the oven or something so it ended up cooked less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately buying her sister's excuse without a second thought, your mom's eyes shot open as she looked down at the empty cookie tray before her. \"Oh shoot we didn't save a single one for Jake! Oh man I feel terrible I was so caught up in the cookies I forgot all about him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara furrowed her eyebrows slightly. She had hoped in the back of her mind that her sister would forget entirely about her miniature son at least for the night, but sadly she was mistaken. Figuring she had to pretend to like you in front of her sister to keep the charade up, she thought for a second then spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Tara exclaimed before reaching one hand into her enormously deep cleavage. Snaking her fingers between her breasts she found what she was looking for and pulled out a crumb of gingerbread that must have dropped off of one of the dozen or so cookies that she had just consumed. It was roughly the size of a quarter and even had some frosting left on it. \"Here! Give this to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom looked at Tara for a moment before bursting into laughter, \"Are you serious, Tara?! You think I don't remember how sweaty your cleavage normally is? The only place sweatier than between your boobs is in your butt crack ya nasty girl. I don't think Jake will like the taste of that soaked crumb at all!\" Your mom barely got her jokes out between bouts of uproarious laughter, even causing a smile in Tara amidst all the light-hearted quips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you got me there, sis. But don't act like you're any better! You're just as bad if not worse than me!\" Tara came back at your mom, now both women uncontrollably giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man you're right you're right. But still I'll just have to make another batch for him soon. Speaking of him I'm going to go check on how he's doing!\" Your mom said before happily walking out of the kitchen. She wasn't sure where you were but she wanted the three of you to spend some quality time together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara panicked slightly as she figured that when your mom inevitably didn't find you that she would freak out and worry about you until you came back. It would totally ruin the whole night in Tara's mind. She quickly follows her sister out of the room in hopes to distract her once more, or at the very least convince her not to worry about you for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at the three choices before you, none of them were appealing to you at all. You almost started crying before putting on a brave face and telling your aunt, \u201cI will ride on you Aunt Tara. Maybe we can talk and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that is great squirt!\u201d Tara smiled with glee, \u201cWe are gonna have such a good night dancing at the club and sitting at the bar getting a drink. I dare say this will be a night you will never forget.\u201d With that ominous statement, your aunt brought you back around her back again and positioned you right above her waistline. She reached with her other hand and tugged open her skirt and panties once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stared down you couldn\u2019t help but notice how massive her butt was. You gulped and wondered how much this was going to hurt. Then your aunt let go of your body and you fell down until you came in contact with her panties. She released her grip and you shot right into her ass crack. This was a brand new experience for you as you previous encounters had been in the outside of the clothing. It was warm and soft and comfortable actually. You started to snuggle in when, SQUISH! Your aunt brought her cheeks together and you were flattened between her massive glutes.  You couldn\u2019t move at all, your features frozen with a goofy little smile that you had moments before had on your face at the warmth and comfort. You tried to call out but no sound could escape your body in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara smiled as she felt her small nephew completely flatten in her crack, this was a new feeling for her and she liked it! \u201cWow squirt you actually feel pretty nice in there! I may have to see if your mom will let you come over sometime ha ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment your mother enters the room and went to put on the clothes that had been picked out for her. She didn\u2019t even give them more of a look than what was necessary to get them on. If you had picked one of her clothing items as a ride then you would not have been noticed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that evening was a blur for you, it was filled with loud music, hot sweaty cheeks, and lots of pressure from walking, dancing, and sitting. Your mother never asked about you once trusting her sister completely with your well being, and true to her word Tara knew exactly where you are the entire night. You were out of sight but definitely not out of mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that was my first meeting with my aunt Tara,\u201d you finished this story for the Smalls family. \u201cShe removed me the next day and it took me about 20 minutes to reform. She then helped me clean up and made me promise not to tell anyone about this or she would keep me in her butt for good. This is actually the first time I have ever told this story to anyone...\u201d You trailed off realizing that with all the questioning of stories you had actually broken your promise with Aunt Tara! Memories of that morning came back to you and how you swore that if you ever broke your promise that she would be able to keep you at her house. You actually looked worried realizing this. You were not one to break promises, one of the things you prided yourself on was your word. Even with your small stature it was one thing you could be equal on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly noticed your facial expressions and smiled to herself. She was not very impressed by you yet and felt that Cassie could definitely do better. Hearing that you had promised to never tell this story on pain of being your aunt\u2019s toy basically gave her a horrible idea. \u201cWell Jake that was a crazy set of stories about your Aunt Tara. I think that is enough storyline for now though, why don\u2019t you come help me with a few office activities right quick. Girls, why don\u2019t you all get Cassie settled in ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at you with concern and seethed with anger at the way your aunt treated you. You were such a great guy and she couldn\u2019t understand how someone could intentionally be cruel to you. However, she knew when her mother said something it was best to do what she asked, so she got up and went with her sisters to unpack her things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you followed Kimberly into her home office, you still felt bad about breaking your promise with Tara. Not that you thought she deserved anything but it was something you had promised to keep secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake, let me be frank with you. I cannot believe that you would break a promise and divulge information to several people by just being asked! How can anyone trust you after that?!\u201d Kimberly said this with a voice of authority and you could think of no reply that would be appropriate except for apologizing and agreeing with her that it was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked down at you and smiled, \u201cWell but I suppose you wanted to let your new family know about everything right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her smiling face and nodded your head in agreement. Then her face scowled at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think that the first person who should have known if you were going to come clean was your own mother?!\u201d Kimberly said with a very serious tone. \u201cI think there are two options here. One we call your mother up right now so you can tell her this story as well, or we need to send you aunt at least an apology letter right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what she had said and nodded your head in agreement. \u201cYeah that makes sense Ms. Smalls.\u201d And with that statement you proceeded to give her your mother\u2019s phone number and your aunt\u2019s mailing address. Kimberly smiles receiving both and decided to</span></div></div>",

I really shouldn\u2019t call my mom and break my promise again,\u201d you said to Kimberly. She nodded in agreement and went to her desk and pulled out a writing pad, ink, and an oversized envelope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Jake, to save some time, if you will dictate I will take down your apology letter!\u201d Kimberly said in a cheery voice. You still felt awful about what had just happened and felt grateful that Cassies\u2019 mom was so helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poured out your soul and apologized to your aunt for finally telling a story you had promised never to divulge to anyone. You put in a line or two about making up for it one day to her and finally fell silent. Kimberly nodded with approval and then passed he note to you to sign. You picked up the pen and wrote your signature at the end of the letter, and handed it back to Kimberly. She reviewed the letter and then wrote something on the page and folded it up and handed it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright all done! Here put it in the envelope, sorry it is so big but it was the only one I had on hand.\u201d Kimberly said as she handed you the folded up letter. You nodded and then pushed the note inside the envelope. You notices it was actually big enough to house you and the letter. As you started to slide back out you heard Kimberly clear her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jake, in that letter you said you wanted to make up for this right? Well, as I recall you, as part of your promise, agreed to be kept in your aunt\u2019s butt if you ever did break your promise correct?\u201d Kimberly said in a matter of fact tone, underlined with severity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped in the envelope and thought about what she had just said. Yes it was true you had basically agreed that if you ever broke your word, that would be the price to pay. You gulped and thought about it harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did say in your letter that you hoped to make it up to her right? Well it seems to me that you owe her the option of making good on your deal, if she decides to decline then you would be all good but if she wants to follow through isn\u2019t that the only way you can make it up to her?\u201d Kimberly slowly said this last statement and you could do nothing but nod your head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw Kimberly reach out and begin to close the envelope with you still inside! Before you could even comprehend the lights went out and the envelope was sealed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I will let Cassie know where you went. I also put down my phone number on the letter in case your aunt doesn\u2019t want to collect on your bargain and I\u2019ll make sure you get sent back to Cassie on my dollar!\u201d Kimberly smiled as she finished that statement and got ready to leave the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly picked the envelope up and told her daughters she needed to go into town on an errand and would be back soon. You could barely hear them respond as Kimberly left the house and climbed into her car. After a short trip you could hear the echoing noise of the postal office and then felt yourself get sat down on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to send this the speediest way possible please,\u201d Kimberly said to the postal worker, \u201cit is time sensitive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course ma\u2019am we can get that shipped overnight delivery! Would you like it to be signed for as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Kimberly agreed. She definitely needed to know that Tara had received what she hoped would be her favorite new butt toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright that will be $25.00 please,\u201d the postal worker said. Kimberly eagerly handed over the money and smiled as your envelope was taken behind the counter and slipped into the overnight mail shipment bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly then left with a spring in her step as she exited the postal office. She would wait and let the family know of Jake\u2019s decision after she was sure the mail had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there in your envelope you couldn\u2019t believe what you had just agreed to do, basically give yourself to a woman who cared not for you as a person as had been proven time and time again... Maybe my mom will be there and she will get me out of this somehow you thought to yourself. Surely she wouldn\u2019t leave me to this fate....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting your thoughts, your entire world shifted as the overnight delivery was being sorted and loaded to the carriers who would ensure each parcel got to its intended destination as fast as possible. You sat in silence still coming to terms with what you had agreed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point you fell asleep as there was nothing to actually do in an envelope. The next thing you heard with a start was a voice you recognized all too well, \u201cWhat in the world?! What are you doing in a package squirt?\u201d your aunt\u2019s booming voice shook you awake. She was standing in her kitchen with you in one hand and your note in the other. She was dressed in just a bra and skimpy shorts that left little to the imagination. You managed a wry smile and thought about what you could possibly open up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well what does this note say,\u201d Tara continued and proceeded to read it. Her face changed expression slowly to one of great glee and amusement. She started laughing and looked back at you. \u201cWait wait, so you actually sent yourself here because you told someone about that first time I met you and that you would be punished by me keeping you in my big ol butt?!\u201d Tara was laughing very loudly now and you couldn\u2019t tell if she was happy that she has you or that it was just funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell squirt, thanks for the laugh...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your heart sank as your aunt declared her willingness to collect on your bargain. You tried desperately to think of some way out of this situation. \u201cAunt Tara, I just want to remind you that we made that deal a long time ago before I had grown up! I am an adult now and I have college and a fianc\u00e9e so I want to ask if there is any way we can shorten the amount of time you keep me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked at you with a huge grin on her face. She then put her other hand to her chin and thought about what you said. \u201cYou know squirt, you do have a point. I believe the bargain was I would keep you in my booty, but that was not very specific. You are an adult now so we should take that into consideration. Yes indeed...,\u201d Tara trailed off, then another of her devious smiles sprang back on her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, so this means you will only keep me for a little while?\u201d You asked unsure of what exactly your aunt was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara threw her head back and laughed again, \u201cHoo now that is funny squirt! Now I am not sure how long I am keeping you, that will be decided by a little contest. Right now you are set for two days in my butt,\u201d she smacked her butt as she said this and you  couldn\u2019t help but stare at how big it was and how much it jiggles from the impact... \u201cBut, depending on how you do at the start of each day\u2019s challenges will determine if you shorten your sentence or extend it!\u201d Tara smiled deviously and you couldn\u2019t help but be uplifted and at the same time apprehensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now though squirt, you are getting into my big booty for the remainder of the day! Glad the mail comes early here, it is just now 9 am! Just think for the next 24 hours you are gonna be squashed in between my big cheeks and there is nothing you can do about it,\u201d Tara said with so much satisfaction in her voice that you could do nothing but stare at her. She then brought you around her back like she did so many years ago, and used her other hand to grab her shorts and panties and open them wide exposing her giant ass to you. You gawked at how much bigger it was now, you had grown a lot since then but her butt seemed to have grown even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tara let go of your body without warning and you fell towards her giant butt. You screamed as you made contact with the inside of her panties, she then let go and the snap flung you deep within her ass crack again. You had difficulty moving, but you noticed how big, warm, and soft her ass was. In spite of knowing what comes next you couldn\u2019t help but snuggle in and then, SQUISH! Tara brought her massive glutes together and flattened you between them. You tried moving and found unsurprisingly that you couldn\u2019t move any part of your body. Your aunt\u2019s mighty booty had once again claimed you and there was absolutely nothing you could do about it, at least for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara let out a long sigh as she felt her tiny nephew conform to her ass crack. It really felt good having Jake over, she thought to herself, and who knows maybe he can stay permanently! She grinned as she thought of the \u201cchallenges\u201c she had planned for Jake to do. She needed to design some good ones that left little possibility for him to win. She rubbed her chin thoughtfully and finally came up with a system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d she said out loud to herself, \u201cJake will have to complete the challenge to not add any time to his stay!\u201d She grinned and squeezed her cheeks together, enjoying the feeling of your paper thin squishy body. \u201cI will also make him roll dice to determine the time! He can roll two and that is how many days are added on to his time!\u201d Tara grinned and she thought of how many more days she would get him for! If he kept failing, she was guaranteed two more days every morning at the least! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake I hope it is comfy in there, because you are probably going to be spending a long time there,\u201d Tara yelled down to you in a fit of laughter. You could do nothing but every now and then test if you could move. It was getting hot and sweaty in here already. You groaned thinking that it was going to be a whole day before she took you out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that day was filled with squishing, rubbing, and sweat. You heard your aunt go about her day, although very muted from her thick butt cheeks blocking almost every sound out. By the time your aunt crawled into bed for the night, you were an exhausted wreck! The only thought keeping you going was that it was just going to be two days hopefully... You sighed, there was no way Tricky Tara was gonna make these challenges fair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day your aunt, true to her word, pulled and scraped at your body until you peeled free. Leaving you in her underwear drawer to reform, she went to go set up your first challenge. After about 30 minutes you were standing on your own two feet again, and knocking on the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawer eventually slides open with the smiling face of Tara staring at you. \u201cMorning squirt!\u201d she said reaching for you, \u201cLet\u2019s get started! It is simple you will do a challenge of my choosing if you win, you add no extra time to your sentence ha ha, but if you lose,\u201d she dropped two dice on the dresser and set you down next to them, \u201cThen whatever you roll on these dice is how many days are added to your time with me! Got it?\u201d She bellowed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was nod, and you grabbed a die in each hand. You looked to the heavens and prayed for good luck as you rolled,</span></div></div>",

She also was wearing little and you averted your eyes from both of them. At least with your mom here you wouldn\u2019t be subjected to a horrible fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tara! What is...,\u201d your mother trailed off as she saw you in one of Tara\u2019s hands and a note in the other. Her eyebrows raised as she asked, \u201cWhy is Jake here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere read this note he wrote and mailed himself to me with. It explains the whole reason he is here ha ha,\u201d Tara got out with some difficulty as she was still overcome with the humor of this situation. That you would deliver yourself to her for punishment tickled her immensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother took the note and proceeded to read it through several times. You managed a glance at her and saw a weird look on her face. Finally she turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell son, it looks like you really kept things from me all these years. You were supposed to let me know everything happening with you right? Tara, what else did you and my son do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stopped her laughing, and told every story that you had told the Small family just yesterday with a few extras you had not told. By the end of it your mother was chuckling as well. That didn\u2019t bode well for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow dear I had no idea you got into so many situations with your Aunt. It is almost like you wanted these things to happen. You know sis, he did get into quite a few situations with me as well, he always seemed to have a knack for being in a bad place at a bad time. I don\u2019t know how many times I found him plastered to me somewhere...\u201d your mother trailed off remembering countless situations from over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara cleared her throat and finally said, \u201cWell I suppose he should pay for breaking his promise right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looked to her sister and slowly nodded, \u201cYes I think you are right. Now he probably shouldn\u2019t be punished forever, after all I didn\u2019t save money for his education for nothing. I believe he has a month break from school, so no longer than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe your mother was agreeing with this, you had been elated at first that she had happened to be at your aunt\u2019s house but now she was just cementing the deal.... At least she was putting a time limit on things that was helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sis,\u201d your aunt spoke up, \u201cIf that is the case I don\u2019t mind passing on the punishment to you. I am liable to forget he has to go back to school unless you remind me. So that way at least he would get back to school on time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, that is a good point Tara, how about we let him pick! He did go to all this trouble to make up for his mistake so letting him have one last choice seems nice!\u201d Your mother beamed with pride at having come up with such a good choice for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really couldn\u2019t believe this, you were now being faced with a really horrible choice. On the one hand your mother would remember you and definitely would let you free, however you didn\u2019t really want to choose her. On the other hand your aunt was not a much better choice and there was the chance she would conveniently forget about letting you out after a month... a whole month with one or the other. You sighed as you looked back and forth between your choices.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maddie cut in, leaning forward in her seat. She spoke. \u201cYeah, okay, okay. Tara\u2019s a piece of shit.\u201d You and Cassie gaped at her bluntness, but Maddie continued. \u201cBut like, you ever actually meet someone other than your mom who was nice to you? Like, treated you normal and cared for you? Any friends or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question threw you for a second. Your several previous stories had all been about bad situations with women who didn\u2019t treat you very well. In fact, most of the stories you could run off from the top of your head were unpleasant giantess experiences, most involving Tara. Women who had molded you into something to fit their purposes, women who had treated you like a slave or some kind of inferior pet. Happy stories were few and far between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they still existed, and you soon recalled some. \u201cUh, yeah! Yes, Maddie, I did have some encounters with a few girls who were really nice to me. I\u2019d say the closest people I had to friends growing up were Jolene Wilson and her daughter Kelly. They were our neighbors and lived just across the street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie grinned like a kid. \u201cOoh really? That sounds so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered her smile with one of your own. \u201cThey were pretty awesome, yes. I can tell you a bit about them.\u201d You cleared your throat and began\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK BEGIN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might go without saying, but your first encounter with the Wilson family was on par with your daily misadventures with your mother and Tara. Your mom invited the two over for lunch a week after they moved in, and as soon as the front door opened, Kelly stomped you flat under her sneakers and scraped away at your body, thinking you were a part of the doormat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your mom noticed and peeled you free before Jolene could follow her daughter\u2019s lead, and Kelly apologized profusely once you reformed and properly introduced yourself. That didn\u2019t stop Jolene from accidentally sitting on you three separate times in the next twenty minutes during lunch, but you excused her inattentiveness for the simple fact that she\u2019d never experienced being around a small squishy person like yourself. You were ten at this time, and only six or seven inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom and Jolene hit it off exceptionally well, and decided on an impromptu shopping trip to the nearby mall. They left Kelly, who was fourteen, in charge of hanging out with you while they were gone, and then rushed off. Kelly carried you over to the couch and sat down beside you, instantly jumping into conversation with you, talking quickly and excitedly about music and movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was overwhelming, to say the least. Kelly\u2019s exuberance and eagerness to make friends contrasted sharply with your introverted and quiet personality. She was exceptionally pretty, lengthy black hair with bright blue streaks tied back into a ponytail, bright eyes, and tanned skin. She was tall and lean, not fully matured (as she was only fourteen), but on her way to inheriting Jolene\u2019s considerably blessed curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, potentially because she noticed your awkwardness, kept the conversation simple and lively. She avoided making any comments or jokes about your height and squishiness, and it wasn\u2019t long before her calming voice and warm expressions broke you out of your shell. By the time your mom and Jolene returned from shopping, you\u2019d been talking with Kelly for two straight hours, with no incidents. Though unspoken, you and her had become fast friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jolene plopped right down onto the couch and kicked her feet up after arriving back from the mall, pulverizing you under her weighty derriere without a second thought. Kelly yelled at her mother and saved you in seconds, cradling you in her palms as you reformed. Jolene sincerely apologized, and you spent another hour talking to and getting to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolene was the manager of a local gym, and taught yoga classes on weekends. Kelly was about to start her sophomore year of high school, and she had just started dating a girl named Rina. Kelly blushed profusely hearing her mom gush about how adorable her daughter and Rina had been when they confessed their feelings for each other at the school dance. At the time, you were a bit sad to hear that the beautiful girl you\u2019d just befriended was taken, but you truly felt nothing but happiness for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your house that evening, Kelly promised to come over the next day and play video games with you, and Jolene gave your mom an all-expenses paid pass to the gym she managed. In just the span of one afternoon, you and you mom had found new friends that you\u2019d cherish for the next few years of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(FLASHBACK END)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly was easily my biggest friend, for years.\u201d You paused, noting your unintentional joke. \u201cLiterally, biggest friend.\u201d Sophie giggled at your bad pun, and Maddie and Cassie rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie cracked her knuckles, a clear unconscious habit. \u201cYou took up the free gym pass, right? Can\u2019t miss that chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, for sure.\u201d You nodded. \u201cMy mom and I got a lot of use out of it. Though, half of the use I got out of it was plastered to my mom\u2019s yoga pants, crushed into her sneaker like an insole, or scrubbed along her body like a sweat rag. Somehow, whenever she went to that gym, something messed up would happen to me. But, if Kelly tagged along too, she\u2019d get me out of any jam I was in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded her head, appreciating the helpfulness of your childhood best friend. \u201cKelly always looked out for you, huh? Like a guardian angel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly was amazing.\u201d You agreed. \u201cIf my mom stepped on me, she\u2019d notice me immediately and point me out. If Jolene had a weird \u2018itch\u2019 on her butt that she kept scratching, Kelly would politely inform her that it was actually my mushed body. Kelly and I hung out at least once a week or more for years, and I could never thank her enough for all the times she got me out of messes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, she wasn\u2019t flawless, no one is. I don\u2019t blame her. Once she threw me into the laundry on accident, and I came out nearly ironed into a pair of her panties. She wore me twice before noticing me. Another time she squeezed me into her purse to sneak me into a movie theater for free, forgot I was in there, and pulled out my balled-up body, thinking I was a gumball she\u2019d set aside earlier. It was halfway through the movie that she realized she\u2019d been chomping on me the whole time, but as she didn\u2019t want to risk losing me in the pitch-black theater, she had no choice but to keep gnawing away on me for another hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly could also be a bit distracted when she was around Rina, her girlfriend I mentioned earlier. They\u2019d get lost in each other\u2019s eyes, and nothing interrupted their make-out sessions, not even if I unintentionally ended up between them.\u201d You paused your recollections. \u201cRina was really funny, and we were good friends too. She\u2019d play with and tease me a bit, but not like Tara. More like a mischievous older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie rocked on her heels. \u201cWhat happened to Kelly? Do you still hang out with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head sadly. \u201cLast I saw her was when she went off to college with Rina. Some university across the country. She was pursuing a degree in physical education, probably following in her mother\u2019s gym ownership steps.\u201d You took a deep breath. \u201cThe hug she gave me when I watched her drive off lasted nearly ten minutes. We were definitely both pretty weepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and Sophie \u2018awwed\u2019 at your touching story, and Maddie seemed satisfied. \u201cShe sounds like an awesome person. Glad not every girl in your life was out to ruin your day.\u201d She smirked, trying to bring back some levity. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t above pranking and messing with Cass and Soph, but I wouldn\u2019t stoop to the lows of someone like Tara.\u201d Maddie eyed you directly with a glint in her eyes. \u201cWatch your back, though. I won\u2019t wait long to spring some pranks on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be on my guard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kimberly had a bemused expression on her face, and like usual, you couldn\u2019t read what was on her mind. After a moment, she leaned forward in her chair and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Jake, you\u2019ve reminded me of something because of your story\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Maddie jumped up as if startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god we are fifteen minutes late to start, Mom I'll meet you in there. You too Jake.\" and she took off while sophie and Cassie excused themselves to go and do other things leaving you alone with Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Follow me jake, we have our own little gym in the outside shed.\" She stood up and started walking leaving you to jog after her swaying hips. She indeed walked right to the shed where the heat made it sweltering inside almost immediately making you unsure of weather you should have agreed. Maddie was already running on a tred mill and Kimberly seemed to decide that she would be using the bike without saying anything to you farther. Of course you couldn't use any weights they had set up, even the small hand weights would be too much for you so instead you started stretching. Maddie only took a few minutes to get off the tread mill and grab what looked like a Yoga ball before she noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, you can use the tred mill now, here's the remote.\" she leaned down and handed a remote about half your size with a couple buttons on it and you figured that with so few people around it couldn't be that difficult to finally use one of these things. You got up on the treds and hit the on button immediately starting on the slowest pace even you could walk fast enough that it couldn't be described as a jog. You sped it up a little and got to jogging for a minute before you realized that you should put the remote down. You tried to hit the button to slow down, no response, so you hit it again, nothing. You got frustrated and punched it making you drop the remote and it flew off and smacked into the ground. You heard a beep that signaled the treads would speed up. You tried to run to the side but the whirl of the treads made you trip! You weren't going to go even fifteen minutes without incident as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost acting out a scene in an old cartoon show, your legs frantically scrambled on the rapidly spinning treadmill, until you finally lost your balance. With a strangled yelp, you slipped face first onto the treads, and were almost instantly rocketed backwards at unbelievable speeds. Your body flew through the air across the shed, until finally coming to a stop by impacting against a wide yoga mat hanging up on the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was immense, and your squishy body flattened out in the blink of an eye. You\u2019d hit it from behind, so your back crumpled into a lump, leaving your face visible and looking out. Your malleable form, having hit the soft yoga mat with the impact of a bullet, nearly glued itself to the mat instantaneously, and as soon as your rattled brain calmed down, you began focusing on reforming. At this point, you were merely embarrassed you\u2019d bumbled into such a silly accident, though you did notice with some alarm that the yoga mat was tan, as apparently nearly everything was that the Smalls women owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were reforming, your vantage point allowed you to look across the entire shed. Maddie was balancing delicately on her yoga ball, apparently stretching out her back. Kimberly was pedaling away at a brisk but pleasant pace on the exercise bike. Neither giantess had so much as noticed or heard your little accident on the treadmill. Much to your dismay, you also noticed the treadmill slowly powering down. Apparently, a built-in power-saving feature shut it down after a minute of not detecting any use. There went that possible avenue for someone to notice your accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes passed, and you expected to pop free from the yoga mat you\u2019d slapped into and fall to the floor any second. After all, the mat was hanging sideways on the wall, so there wasn\u2019t even any pressure on you. However, you underestimated just how forcefully you\u2019d been thrown into the mat by the treadmill, not to mention the soft fabric of the mat combined with your own sheen of sweat. You hadn\u2019t just been crushed by the pressure, but also a bit of sticky sweat was holding you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you held onto hope that you\u2019d reform soon, and stop being just comically squashed sticker on the yoga mat. Or at least, you held onto that hope all the way up until Kimberly slowed her pace on the exercise bike and hopped off. The matriarch of the Smalls family took a big swig of her water bottle, and then sauntered over to the wall, a happy smile on her face. Your blood ran cold as she drew nearer and nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream out to her, but even your mouth was still a bit mangled and incapable of speech. You could do nothing but look up at Kimberly\u2019s towering frame with fear in your eyes as she approached the wall and grabbed the yoga mat you were stuck to. Dragging the mat out into the center of the shed, she laid it flat and stood beside it. Daintily, she brushed her foot across the mat to straighten it, dragging her damp sock across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before she stepped onto the mat, her eyes locked with your own. Your heart leaped for joy, as you knew she\u2019d noticed you, despite your flattened body semi-blending in with the tan color of the mat. Finally, you could stop trying to telepathically scream up at her to spot you. However, you didn\u2019t expect her to scrunch up her brows in confusion, then look between you and the empty treadmill. And you CERTAINLY, didn\u2019t expect a slightly satisfied smirk to cross her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart dropped right as Kimberly looked away from you and stepped up onto the mat, the sole of her left foot slamming down onto your body. Your body cried out in pain as the full weight of your future mother-in-law bore down on you, the pressure easily pressing you down even further into the soft yoga mat. Your mind was reeling, as you could\u2019ve sworn she\u2019d recognized you, though it was always a possibility she had confused you for a simple sticker or design. She wouldn\u2019t knowingly torture you like this, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, coherent thought went out the window as Kimberly began stretching her body into various yoga poses. Everytime she shifted her position, her foot would drag across the mat and grind your body into the fabric of the yoga mat. Sweat, alongside pieces of dirt rubbed off of her sock and onto your face, and every twist of her foot harshly mangled and smeared your face. With futile effort, you tried to wiggle and alert her to your presence, but you couldn\u2019t manage even a measly twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for ten minutes, and when Kimberly finally dragged her dank foot off of you, you were much less recognizable. Your gummy-like body had been thoroughly mashed into the yoga mat to the point where you were much flatter than point, and your human features had been even more smeared away. You could only look up at Kimberly with one eye that was un-smudged, and beg the literal goddess that she was to look down and notice you. The more pressure you endured, the harder it would be to spot you on the tan mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, you vaguely thought you saw a smirk on Kimberly\u2019s face, but it was quickly replaced by a massive black globe. That globe was, of course, Kimberly\u2019s monumental ass, clad in skintight black leggings, and rapidly descending towards you. All you could do was let out a meek whimper as the bodacious bubble butt fell like a meteor onto the yoga mat, enveloping you beneath it and becoming your entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly\u2019s cheeks audibly clapped against the yoga mat, earning a quick smile from Maddie before the younger girl turned back to her own squats. Kimberly let her copious butt flesh settle and stop jiggling against the mat, then took a second to wiggle in place a bit, before resuming her leg stretches. That smile was still on her face, even though the swamp of sweat between her butt and the mat was getting a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ass to end all asses utterly dominated you, and nearly knocked you unconscious from the impact alone. Your mashed body was perfectly hidden beneath just her right cheek on its own, and the utter weight and pressure was unbearable. Buckets of sweat dripped from Kimberly onto your body, and you felt your squishy form glue itself more and more to the yoga mat as each second passed. Kimberly shifting around to get comfortable was no better, her thick cheeks grinding you almost to dust beneath them as she wiggled against the mat.</span></div></div>",

You felt your malleable body being ground and squished by every single motion the curvaceous woman made, the gross layer of viscous sweat coating you and gluing you to the mat. Kimberly\u2019s bodily fluids seemed drawn to you, as did the growing odor she emitted as she exercised fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sitting exercises continued for over twenty minutes, and by the time she stood up, her butt peeled away from the mat with a sticky \u201cpop\u201d. You were dazed and confused, and looked blearily up at Kimberly. Horror dawned on you as you tried to blink, but couldn\u2019t. Your vision remained hazy and unclear, and it became evident that Kimberly\u2019s intense routine had smeared and reduced your facial features to an almost unrecognizable blur. Now, it was harder than ever before to tell you apart from the tan yoga mat. On top of all of this, you felt less like a sticker and more like an engraining on the fabric of the mat. You\u2019d been thoroughly ground into the mat, and it would take considerable time and potential outside help to reform now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVision hindered, you missed yet another coy smile from Kimberly as she looked down at the dirty yoga mat. Stepping away, she refreshed herself with some cool water, before returning with a bottle of freshener spray and a rag. Kneeling down by the mat, she sprayed the cleansing chemical across its surface, then harshly scrubbed with her rag, picking up any traces of sweat and dirt lingering on the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this action only further cemented your imprisonment. The chemical freshener burned your skin, but not enough to actually cause you to stand out. And Kimberly\u2019s scrubbing with the rag, aided by her roughly pressing into the mat, pounded you more into against the fabric of the mat, and smudged your last remaining visible features into a featureless tan glob. You now, with the exception of your one half-open and barely noticeable eye, had totally disappeared into the uniform tan coloring of the yoga mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, Kimberly looked over at her daughter. \u201cHey Maddie, the mat\u2019s all clean and ready for you, if you need it.\u201d She explained as she walked over to the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie flashed her a grin as the athletic girl finished her sets of pull-ups. Jumping down from the bar, she threw in a flourish by back-flipping over to her water bottle. \u201cThanks mom! Perfect timing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Kimberly shook her head and laughed at her daughter\u2019s confident display of acrobatics. She hopped up on the treadmill, set the speed to a fast walk, then flipped open a book she\u2019d brought with her into the shed, instantly losing herself in the novel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie hydrated herself, the shed door swung open and Cassie walked in. You could barely recognize her through your blurry and unfocused vision, but as soon as you spotted her, you fought with every fragment of power within you to scream out to her for help. But it was no use. Kimberly had done a horrible number on you, and you were practically part of the yoga mat now. You almost needed Cassie\u2019s help at this point to reform. Either that, or many hours left alone and undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust checkin\u2019 in on you all.\u201d Cassie explained, walking further into the room. She stopped a few feet away from the yoga mat, just barely in your line of sight. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Maddie threw her sister a thumbs-up. \u201cCare to join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Cassie smiled. \u201cNot today, at any rate. I\u2019m still a bit sore from packing up and moving stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Maddie shrugged, and set down her water bottle, heading over to the yoga mat. \u201cMom and I might be going at this for a while longer, you don\u2019t have to wait up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just stopping by. I\u2019ll head back inside now.\u201d Cassie said, already starting to turn around. As she spoke, Maddie walked into your view, her feet stomping onto the yoga mat on either side of you. Her long, toned legs ran all the way up to her compression shorts, which hugged her like a second skin. Her flesh glistened with a heavy sheen of sweat, a few sticky drops already falling off of her and splashing onto your face and your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, something deep inside of Cassie stoked a weird feeling in her chest. For some odd reason, she was inexplicably compelled to look down between Maddie\u2019s feet, at the yoga mat she was standing on. The soft, tan mat lie there, ready and waiting to support Maddie for the next hour or so of her exercises, yet Cassie\u2019s gaze settled on one miniscule little spot between her sister\u2019s heels. Amidst the even tan coloring of the mat, was a small discolored dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant pretty much nothing, of course, and so Cassie disregarded the sight of the dot. It was probably some spilled drink stain, or something along those lines. As Maddie dropped to the ground, her sculpted, shapely rear end slamming onto the mat and burying the weird dot beneath her ass, Cassie shook her head, gave her sister a smile, and turned on her heel, leaving the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as she stepped outside, Cassie froze in her tracks. Her stomach was flipping over and over, and her mind was stuck on that dot. That inexplicable dot now buried under her younger sister\u2019s tight butt. Was was this bothering her so much? What did a weird dot matter? This feeling simply would not leave her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cassie took a few more steps out of the workout shed back towards the main house, that random little dot on the mat just wouldn't leave her mind. It was practically nothing, but after spending years with you she had become hyper vigilant with tiny little abnormalities just like that. At least, most of the time she was. She too had her moments of forgetfulness, as it was truly impossible for even the most observant of people to keep track of your one-foot tall form at all times. But luckily for you this was not one of those moments. She suddenly turned around and headed back towards her mother and sister, staring exactly back at where she saw the peculiar dot on the mat. Of course, at that moment all she saw was the firm buttocks of her more athletic sister pressing down firmly into the rubbery material as she bent forward and grabbed her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh hey mom, Maddie, I thought Jake was supposed to be exercising with you two. Any idea where he ran off to?\" Cassie said cautiously, a suspicious feeling of your location already appearing in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I saw him he was on the treadmill! He must not have been able to take the heat so he got out of the kitchen!\" Maddie exclaimed confidently. Cassie facepalmed at her sister's cocky attitude. When she was in one of her workout modes it seemed like she could only focus on the exercise at hand at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked up from her book and smirked, knowing that getting you around a warmed up and exercising Maddie was a surefire way to put you in harms way. So far it seemed like her plan was working perfectly. Wiping the smile from her face she turned to face Cassie, still walking at a brisk pace. \"Well thankfully he isn't under my feet for the second time today\" Kimberly said while looking downward at the treadmill, \"so I'm not sure where he went either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grimaced just thinking about the possibility of what her mother had just said. She wondered briefly why she even let you go workout in such a dangerous environment without her, before her mind came back to the more urgent matter at hand. Looking downward again at the yoga mat, Maddie briefly lifted her ass off of the surface, revealing a dark outline of her ass, completely soaked with sweat that had seeped out of her tight compression shorts. In the midst of this Cassie leaned forward, briefly fanning away the collective smell of sweat that had been created by both Kimberly and Maddie. Staring intently at the little white dot Cassie just managed to see a brown iris and a black pupil in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" Cassie said covering her mouth in shock as she recognized your lone eye staring up from the mat, the rest of your features completely smeared into invisibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Maddie returned from her stretched position and absolutely slammed her ass back down onto your face, obliterating you once more and squeezing butt sweat from her compression shorts onto your body like the world's worst sponge bath. \"What is it, Cass?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie! I think Jake accidentally got squashed into the yoga mat! Sit up right now!\" Cassie nearly screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Maddie was a good person at heart, and as fiery and competitive as she could get while exercising she would never intentionally torture you... as long as it didn't get in the way of her winning something. But at this moment it was just a casual day of exercise for two of the Smalls women, nothing too serious. So quickly she sprung up to her feet athletically, stepping on your face once more accidentally before finally stepping completely off of you. The last step left an evident footprint shape in your body, as well as bits of grime and dirt from the nearby ground that had been collecting on Maddie's well-worn sneakers. As miserable as the last stomp was for you, it actually served a purpose in freeing you. See, while your body was nearly identical in color to the yoga mat, it was actually quite a bit more malleable than the rubber material was itself. For this reason your body held the visible outline of Maddie's shoe tread while the rest of the mat did not! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie immediately fell to her knees looking at your body, \"Oh no Jake I'm so sorry I should have come out here and been watching after you!\" Cassie seemed distraught at the fact that such a horrible fate had befallen you, but at the same time she was careful not to place the blame on either her sister or her mom. And to be honest would have agreed with her, if it wasn't for the slight look of malice that Kimberly had shot you before decimating you underneath her gigantic form just minutes before. Regardless, you were in no position to be assigning blame in your current state either, you could only sit still and pray that Cassie was able to free you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit are you serious? Jake I'm so sorry I just get so caught up in my exercises that the entire world melts away. I feel terrible.\" Maddie said with obvious care in her voice. Kimberly rolled her eyes to herself, still not understanding why her daughters seemed to take such a liking to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie began frantically scratching at the nearly invisible edges where your body ended and the mat began. It was arduous work but after nearly 5 straight minutes of effort she caught an edge under her fingernail! She immediately grabbed whatever hold of your form that she could and began painstakingly ripping you off of the mat. With a sickening peeling sound as well as a tremendous amount of pain on your end, Cassie slowly but surely peeled your entirely flattened and disfigured body off of the the mat. After a few more moments you finally popped free! You could still barely see out of your one remaining eye but from what you could tell your fiance was elated to have saved you. And you were elated too. Once again Cassie proved why she was the love of your life and came to your rescue. Based on how badly it hurt when you were ripped off of that mat if you had spent more time compressed into it then you might have never been freed. While being condemned to a life as a piece of workout equipment to be used by a family of beautiful women wasn't the absolute worst fate in the world, it was certainly a hell of a lot worse than living a life as a regular human with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sitting in Cassie's hands as a flattened, tan blob, she wasn't sure what to do with you. Your features were still nearly invisible save for the same small eye. For all intents and purposes you were more like a tan piece of cloth than a human at that point. Cassie knew that you needed time to reform asap, but part of her also wanted to take you somewhere safe first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Cassie glanced nervously around the shed, trying to decide what to do with you, Kimberly watched her discreetly from her position on the treadmill. The matriarch of the Smalls family had a frown on her face as she watched her daughter gently stroke your misshapen, squashed body. Suddenly, she was hit by a brilliant idea, and she quickly whipped out her phone and an old pair of headphones. Throwing on the headphones and turning up some music on her phone, Kimberly turned back to her book, and sped up her pace a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cassie was conflicted. Part of her wanted to take you inside, but she\u2019d been in the middle of unpacking into her old room and organizing, and knew she\u2019d be too busy to keep an eye on you. Sophie was also locked in her room doing a livestream for her followers, so that ruled her out. Above all, Cassie wanted someone keeping an eye on you as you reformed, to prevent further accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you carefully, Cassie turned to Maddie, only to watch her younger sister stretch her lithe body into a deep split, while also raising her body with both hands planted on the yoga mat. It was an impressive display of upper-body strength, but also made it abundantly clear that Maddie was back in the zone, totally focused on her workout. Cassie felt the chances of Maddie obliviously crushing you were high if she tried to leave you under Maddie\u2019s care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only left her mother, so Cassie carried you across the shed to where Kimberly was still briskly pacing on the treadmill. Smiling at her mother, Cassie laid you out gently across the top of the treadmill\u2019s control console. This caught Kimberly\u2019s attention, and the curvaceous woman glanced up from her book, noted your mangled body, and then her daughter\u2019s tentative smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, can you look after Jake for me?\u201d Cassie asked sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m cleaning up and organizing inside, so I can\u2019t really keep an eye on him. Sophie and Maddie are both a bit occupied.\u201d Cassie giggled. \u201cYou know how they can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly didn\u2019t respond, but instead smiled warmly at her daughter. Cassie, bless her na\u00efve heart, interpreted this as understanding and acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom! You can keep reading your book, just check on Jake every few minutes. Also, please bring him inside when you finish. Please, and thank you!\u201d Cassie gave her mom a loving kiss on the cheek, traced a sensual finger across your face while blowing you a kiss, and then left the shed to head back inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, an overwhelming wave of fear had washed over you as soon as Cassie had laid you down. The soothing warmth of her hands had been replaced by the cold metallic control console, not to mention Kimberly\u2019s gigantic face hovering above you. It was unnoticed by Cassie, but you could swear you saw a glint in Kimberly\u2019s eye as she beheld you, even as she smiled innocently at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kimberly, initiating this plan was the simplest thing in the world. Truthfully, she\u2019d heard every word her daughter had said. However, by wearing headphones and blasting music, she knew she could cover for herself later on by claiming she hadn\u2019t heard a word. With Cassie having bought her ruse, Kimberly knew she now had free reign over the defenseless, malleable, squishy guy lying out in a roughly cloth-like shape in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly stared down at you with a menacing aura and a quiet smirk, but much to your surprise, she simply turned back to her book and kept walking. Every so often a drop of sweat would plop down from her brow and onto your body, but you were otherwise undisturbed. Perhaps you really had misunderstood the look on Kimberly\u2019s face, but that was neither here nor there. You merely put the remaining strength you still possessed that hadn\u2019t been crushed and squashed out of you into reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was abysmally slow, and you hadn\u2019t made nearly any progress after thirty minutes. None of your limbs had returned to their original shape, and your facial features hadn\u2019t materialized. Save for that one, barely noticeable and unblinking eye, you were still a loose, featureless tan blob, about ten inches by ten inches. You still hung casually across the control console, as if you\u2019d been set there purposefully for some other use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you felt a faint twinge of movement in your mashed body, a voice from behind you spoke up, the words chilling you to your core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, that was intense!\u201d Maddie exclaimed between heavy, panting breaths. \u201cFifty splits, squats, and push-ups! I can barely feel my arms and legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly frowned, and made a show of taking off her headphones. \u201cWhat was that, sweetie? I couldn\u2019t hear you over my music.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, mom. Just pumped at my workout but also hella tired.\u201d Maddie groaned, veritable buckets of sweat spilling off of her. \u201cDid you\u2026happen to bring a spare sweat rag? I think I left mine inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly grinned. \u201cOh, you know what, that must be what this is for.\u201d Kimberly stated, nodded with her head towards you. A new wave of terror hit you hard. \u201cCassie brought this over to me when she came in, and said something or other, but I couldn\u2019t hear her. She left before I could ask her to repeat herself. It must be your sweat rag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie laughed, her throat coarse and rough from her ragged breathing. \u201cThat\u2019s just like her. So\u2026considerate.\u201d You could hear tired, shuffling footsteps from behind you, until finally Maddie appeared in your view, towering above you. Her breasts, clad in her tight sports bra, blocked most of her face as she stood above you. \u201cI\u2019mma really need this little rag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all yours.\u201d Kimberly said, her face a perfect mask of sincerity, but there was a trace of something deeper in her voice that went unnoticed by Maddie. The brown-haired giantess merely grabbed you off of the control console, backed away a few feet, and got to work. Without a clue in the world that you were poor squishy Jake, and not a simple sweat rag, Maddie had no reason to treat you as anything but. Your one visible eye failed to catch her attention.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instantly, Maddie pressed your body against her face, rubbing you around her cheeks, nose, and forehead. Her soft, smooth skin provided minimal pain, but still coated you in a thick layer of sweat, and you immediately began absorbing her body\u2019s natural stench that had built up after an hour of intense exercise. You tried to wiggle or squirm so she would notice you, but your movements were so imperceptible that they made no difference at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie then slapped your face into her taut stomach, and scrubbed you up and down her lean tummy. She ground your body into her glistening abs, her alluringly tanned skin depositing load after load of sweat onto you. In your squashed state, you were acting just like a real sweat rag, absorbing the gross liquidy substance right off of the exhausted girl and onto your own increasingly dirtied body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oblivious tormenter then scrubbed you along her toned thighs and long legs, combing you up and down until you\u2019d picked up every last trace of sweat and grime from her skin. Satisfied, she took a brief moment to roughly and painfully wring your body between her clenched fists, letting some sweat drip from you and onto the floor. Treating you like any other rag, Maddie was merely thinking to dry you a bit before continuing her cleaning, unaware of how horrible it felt to be wrung out and twisted by her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely hanging on to consciousness amidst the sweat, stench, and pain, you could vaguely feel Maddie lifting you up her body. You caught sight of her pretty face, and mentally screamed for her to look down and notice your one remaining eye, but to no avail. You were merely balled up a bit in Maddie\u2019s grip as she began using you to clean her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer choice in sports bra left a good deal of her firm chest revealed, so Maddie was quite thorough in scrubbing you across her perfectly rounded breasts. She rubbed your face across her skin until you had involuntarily soaked up most of the sweat, then plunged you down into her cleavage, letting your squishy body pick up and dirt and fluid from between her tits. The heat in her cleavage was sweltering, and her boobs pressed against you from all sides, but it thankfully only lasted a minute until Maddie pulled you back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe athletic giantess then glanced over to her mom, who looked up from her book and gave her a comforting smile. Kimberly then glanced purposefully away, and Maddie knew that she was clear to strip. Maddie loved exercise like almost nothing else in the world, but she also hated the feeling of sweat. As such, even tough she knew a long soak in the tub was waiting for her, she wanted to scrub off as much sweat as possible before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding you in one hand, Maddie wiggled her uber-tight compression shorts down her shapely rear and hips, before letting them hang around her thighs. She then, after grimacing a bit at how rank the dampness of sweat was, plunged what she still happily believed to be a simple sweat rag right towards her firm buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collided with her ass, which was contained in only simple black panties, smacking right into her right cheek. Maddie wasted no time in scraping you across her smooth skin in methodical circles, missing no inch of her hot, damp flesh. Though you still weakly fought against her, you were utterly powerless as she squeezed your malleable body into her butt cheeks, cupping the palm that held you to better conform your body to her curvy posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maddie\u2019s brain lazily thought about what she\u2019d do after her luxurious bath, you tried desperately not to dwell on both how horribly humiliating your current situation was, and also how your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s younger sister was intimately scrubbing you against her ass. It as all you could do to block out the feeling as she pushed you into her cheek firmly, and rubbed you along her (thankfully covered by panties) crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity, but Maddie finally ceased her torment. She pulled her compression shorts back up, rolled up and hung up the yoga mat, then looked down at you. She scowled, and her attractive face crinkled up in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026gross.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cThis rag is so soaked with sweat and dirt.\u201d She looked over at her mom. \u201cI should probably just pitch this in the garbage, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly froze at the remark, and waged an intense mental war in her brain. Finally, she responded. \u201cOh, no. I think it\u2019s still good to be washed and used again. A good cleaning will make it good as new.\u201d She paused, and bit down a smirk. \u201cBesides, you look positively stunning right now, dear. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the best sweat rag you\u2019ve ever used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s mouth quirked to the side. \u201cHuh. When you put it that way\u2026why the hell not?\u201d She bunched you up in her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll head inside now and put it through the wash along with what I\u2019m wearing now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly slowed her pace to a complete stop, then closed her book. \u201cI\u2019m ready to finish up, so I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvaceous woman hopped off the treadmill and joined her daughter as the two left the shed and headed back inside. Once inside the kitchen, Kimberly held her daughter\u2019s shoulder to pause her, then stripped out of her shirt, leggings, socks, and underwear. Now nude, she dumped the clothes into Maddie\u2019s awaiting arms. The sweat-stained leggings fell on top of you, filling your body with a mix Kimberly\u2019s and Maddie\u2019s equally overwhelming scents mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo and start the wash real quick.\u201d Kimberly instructed. \u201cI\u2019ll fix up some smoothies for us to drink after your bath.\u201d While speaking, Kimberly grabbed a robe hanging up on the door and wrapped it around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie grinned. \u201cThanks mom!\u201d She declared, then hurried off to the washroom. Once inside, she popped the lid to the washing machine and dumped the load of sweaty workout clothing she was carrying into the giant, metal bin. Your rag-shaped body landed at the bottom first, followed by Maddie\u2019s damp sports bra and Kimberly\u2019s dirty leggings. All of the clothing piled on top of you, keeping you firmly flat and hidden away from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to herself, Maddie searched around in the drawer for the proper laundry detergent, eventually finding the bottle. She then dumped a generous amount of detergent into the bin and slammed the lid shut, then began to reach for the proper dials to start the wash cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Cassie was just coming downstairs to take a quick break from unpacking, and froze in surprise as she beheld her nude (save for a thin robe) mother, fixing up a few smoothies. Kimberly smiled warmly at her, and Cassie smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a smoothie, Cassie?\u201d Kimberly offered. \u201cOnce I finish making them, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love one.\u201d Cassie answered. \u201cHow was exercising with Maddie\u2026and Jake, of course.\u201d Cassie inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly froze, took a second to put on her act, then replied. \u201cJake? Oh, your little man. Was he out there with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie rolled her eyes. \u201cUh, yeah mom. He went out with you right away, got into a little\u2026accident\u2026and then I laid him down on your treadmill console. Did you forget him out there?\u201d She started to head to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Cassie?\u201d Kimberly\u2019s face portrayed genuine horror, even as her eyes glimmered. \u201cI think\u2026I misunderstood what you putting him on my control console meant.\u201d She smiled sheepishly. \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t recognize him, and also couldn\u2019t hear you with my music on. I thought he was just a simple sweat rag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie froze, and blinked once. \u201cSo you\u2026used him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shook her head vigorously. \u201cNo, no I didn\u2019t. Maddie did\u2026and quite thoroughly.\u201d Cassie\u2019s jaw dropped, and Kimberly quickly added, \u201cI had no idea, honey! I swear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d Cassie demanded, her voice rising frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, about to be washed, I imagine.\u201d Kimberly gestured towards the washroom. \u201cMaddie was just starting a wash cycle to clean all our dirty, sweaty clothes, and that sweat rag. Er\u2026uh\u2026Jake, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Cassie turned on her heel and sprinted towards the washroom, Kimberly following closely behind her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were surrounded by water gushing in around you as you lay as a helpless heap buried beneath Kimberly\u2019s heavily soaked spandex. Darkness encased you leaving your only company the horrid stench of the workout attire around you which you struggled to breath in through raspy breaths due to your flattened and beaten lungs. The still warm salty sweat of the two Smalls splotching onto you from above as the water gradually filled up beneath you was making sure you stayed soaked. Suddenly, like a beam of hope, you saw the lid to the washer open up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an angel you witnessed the beautiful face of your fianc\u00e9e peering down with a worried expression, her eyes darting around anxiously. This only lasted a couple seconds however before you saw Kimberly walk into view and you saw her arm stretch out above you as she grasped the lid and unceremoniously closed it once more. Cassie was taken aback and quickly belted out at her mother, \u201cMom? What the hell! I need to get Jake out of there now!\u201d Kimberly merely blew out a sigh before placing a hand upon her daughters shoulder. \u201cNow Cassie, lets think about this real quick.\u201d Cassie merely raised a concerned eyebrow wondering what her usually caring mother could possibly have to say that would explain leaving Jake trapped in their family washing machine. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Jake wants to be alone right now? He just got used by Maddie as a damn sweat rag for goodness sake!\u201d Hearing this for the first time Maddie\u2019s face flared up a bright red before gasping out, \u201cI did what?!\u201d and leaving her jaw hanging open as she embarrassingly listened on to Cassie\u2019s retort. \u201cBut Mom, he doesn\u2019t need to suffer any further!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly merely rolled her eyes and tsk\u2019ed her tongue against the roof of her mouth as she responded casually, \u201cOh Cassie, don\u2019t be ridiculous! He\u2019s not suffering it\u2019s just like a huge bubble bath for him at his size. You seriously worry about him too much; he probably wanted to get cleaned up on his own anyways.\u201d As Cassie let these persuasive ideas stir around in her mind, her gut was saying to just reach in and save you from the onslaught of water and detergent that was crashing into you...but before she could argue any further Kimberly grabbed her daughter by the wrist and whisked her out of the laundry room declaring, \u201cNow come, honey. I was hoping now that Jake\u2019s introductions are out of the way we could spend some more time catching up just the two of us...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you in the smelly confines of the cold washer, you were stirred about in a noxious concoction of gross fluids as Maddie, still beet red in shock and embarrassment as she recalled <b>each and every</b> stroke she took with you against her toned and sweaty body, fled the laundry room and flipped out the light. You cried out silently as you wondered why Cassie\u2019s face never returned and you spent an hour being spun around this metallic prison. The water was chilly, but it honestly was pleasant compared to the steamy and stuffy shed this family used to get in some \u201clight\u201d exercise. Not to mention the sweltering sauna that was the underside of both Kimberly and Maddie\u2019s ginormous rear ends as you had been flattened and suffocated under their hefty weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the machine had finished its cycle, you waited patiently for anyone to come and retrieve you. Finally, after who knows how long, you saw a ray of light pour in as someone finally came to your aid. Looking up, the first thing you saw was the shimmering blonde hair of none other than Sophie. Of course the <i>one</i> girl to come and check on the laundry had to be the <i>one</i> girl in the family who had no idea what awful fate had befallen you that afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hovering a basket of dirty laundry menacing next to the top of the washer that filled you with dread, but her ditziness didn\u2019t show itself in this moment as she actually looked down and saw that a load was already occupying the machine. \u201cAw man, guess I\u2019ll just have to move it.\u201d You heard her whisper to herself before her slender arms reached towards you and squished you into the pile of sopping athletic wear you\u2019d come to know quite well. Tossing you carelessly into the awaiting dryer, you saw Sophie\u2019s face disappear as she enclosed you in darkness once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awful tumbling of the dryer began with a blast of heat funneling in, but honestly you were just happy that the clothes no longer were suffocating you in their awful stench. Being thrown about in the dryer was unfortunately something you\u2019d become accustomed to thanks to being worn as clothing a decent handful of times by your often-times careless mother. So while you weren\u2019t able to reform thanks to the onslaught of motion, at the very least you kept your mind occupied by trying to keep yourself from melting into one of these women\u2019s gigantic pairs of pants, or worse, underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you heard the signature buzzer ring out and you felt the spinning stop as a mountain descended on you from above, burying you in a mass of flowery smelling fabric. You huffed internally as the weight on top of you was managing to keep you trapped until someone came to your aid. That aid came, but unfortunately it once again was in the form of the playful and clueless giantess Sophie. Needing the dryer for her own clothes, she began taking article after article from the dryer and folding them before placing them in a neat pile on top of the dryer. Finally her hand grasped upon you, scrunching you up in her grip as she withdrew you from the machine and peered down at what she was going to fold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s this thing?\u201d You peered up at Sophie through hazy vision with your one exposed eye, praying the washer hadn\u2019t damaged you too much to be recognized. Her clueless expression didn\u2019t fill you with much optimism, but that changed as you saw the gears turn and you suddenly watched had face warp into a signature \u2018Ah-ha\u2019 realization expression.  \u201cOhhhhhh! I know what you are!\u201d Sophie exclaimed with a bright smile. You felt a wave of relief wash over you as finally you could try and get this first day in the Smalls\u2019 household back on track. You\u2019d been stepped on, sat on, and used as a sweat rag but now you knew you could return to your normal charismatic self! \u201cYou\u2019re one of those fancy towels they give out at the gym! Mom must have taken you home by mistake!\u201d Sophie giggled out pondering ironically how her mom could be so air-headed. Instantly your blood ran cold and you tried to shout the truth up to this delighted giantess but she had already excitedly spun on her heel and begun skipping her way towards somewhere else in the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swung violently at her side as she carried your simple, flat, and tanned body out of the laundry room. You barely managed to make out through momentum-blurred vision the form of Cassie fast asleep on the couch while her mother sat watching some show beside her! You wanted to cry out for her help but Sophie\u2019s gleeful grip was far more than you\u2019d be able to fight in your shape. Finally coming to a stop somewhere, you attempted to collect yourself and peer forward as to where Sophie had taken you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the home\u2019s front door, Sophie pulled open a small coat closet before crouching down and reaching for something. The next thing you heard was a loud zipper being pulled open and you tried to think where the hell this girl had taken you in her attempt to be helpful. Finally catching a glance from between Sophie\u2019s fingers, you saw a moderately sized pink duffel bag filled to the brim with various exercise essentials and equipment. Spare clothing, a yoga mat, broken-in tennis shoes, and a grungy head band packed tightly into one duffel bag. You cringed at your impending prison that this unaware, smiling giantess was hovering you over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez it\u2019s practically full, but I think I can <i>squeeze</i> you in...\u201d Sophie mumbled to herself as she placed you atop the admittedly heavily sweat-scented pile. Putting some of her body weight into it, Sophie pressed on you with both hands before rapidly reaching for the zipper and managing to squeeze the old gym bag shut. Letting loose a satisfied sigh and a wipe of her forehead, Sophie stood up and admired her work stating, \u201cThere you are, safe and sound right where you <b>belong</b>!\u201d before lazily swinging the closet shut and kicking it closed with the back of her heel as she sauntered off back to the laundry room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that chaotic string of events finally over, you now sat in near-silence, the far distant voices and murmur of the TV the only thing you could make out. You couldn\u2019t even manage to reform as you felt your body squeezed on one side into the side of one of Kimberly\u2019s odorous shoes floating about, and on the other by her damn yoga mat. You cursed Sophie\u2019s cute friendly nature putting you in the position as you stewed in humiliation at being recognized as a damn rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cassie did make an attempt to find you that evening, after her nap she noticed the laundry folded nicely in the laundry room and figured you had escaped yourself and even folded up the family\u2019s laundry. Filled with a warm feeling of how kind her fianc\u00e9 was, she groggily fell into bed content with catching up with you in the morning when you could all laugh about the prior days misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to eventually drift off to sleep, you were woken up bright and early by a violent force as you felt your gym bag home yanked up by the strap and casually flung over a shoulder. You were thrown about among the other gym stuff as you bounced along with someone\u2019s casual stride. You felt yourself tossed crudely into a car seat before once again carried into what you could only assume was some gym. Hearing some feminine voices through your muffled environment, you soon heard a zipper ringing out as light flooded in to where you\u2019d been trapped all night. Peering up you saw none other than:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you heard the bag plop down and the zipper begin to open, you felt light pour in on you for the first time since yesterday afternoon. Being trapped in such a musty and tight space overnight really made you appreciate the sudden gust of fresh air and light that greeted you. You had also hoped to be greeted by your gorgeous fianc\u00e9e\u2019s face, but instead you were greeted by the daunting sight of her mother, Kimberly! Her face was somewhat far away, slightly obscured by her large breast\u2019s straining against a simple teal tank top; she must have placed her gym bag onto a bench to get out what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly didn\u2019t even spare you a glance as she focused on finding what she wanted for today\u2019s gym session. \u2018Let\u2019s see, today I wanted to try that new class...what was it called? BootyPump, or maybe Sweat-for-Summer?\u2019 Kimberly thought before deciding regardless she\u2019d need the same general stuff. Withdrawing her yoga mat and tennis shoes, you were shoved to the side by her digging hands. Tossing the flip flops she\u2019d worn in into her gym bag, you felt one land right next to you as the top of it toppled over to suffocate you in the warm fragrance of Kimberly\u2019s rank sole. You chocked and struggled but your arms and legs didn\u2019t budge an inch, still far too crushed from yesterday\u2019s chain of beatings from the whole lot of Smalls women, barring the angel Cassie of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through her bag for a hair scrunchie, Kimberly\u2019s hands lightly brushed against your flattened form before returning to probe you more. Grabbing you up in her firm grip, Kimberly pulled you from your prison before staring down at you in her hand with an uncaring and cool expression. Your tanned form was about a one foot by two foot long rectangle, just about uniform in shape and dimensions of a standard dish towel. It was only now that you were out of the deep depths of Kimberly\u2019s bag did you get a view of your surroundings. You were in the women\u2019s locker room surrounded by about a dozen women scattered sparsely around! Not only that, but you happened to notice at least half of them either had a lengthy tan colored towel hanging around their neck or tucked into the waistband of their leggings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? I had an extra towel in here?\u201d Kimberly whispered to herself in mild confusion. You peered up at Kimberly and suddenly noticed she too had a tan towel looped around her neck! Kimberly looked back and forth between her own towel and you in her hand before the smallest grin peeked it\u2019s way into her lips. You weren\u2019t sure what she was thinking but you began to hope maybe some part of you was visible and she had actually recognized you as her potential son-in-law and not just another gym towel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get any confirmation, you saw a hand tap onto Kimberly\u2019s shoulder before a feminine voice shrieked out, \u201cHey, Kim!!\u201d. Startled by the sudden greeting Kim tossed you into the air as she spun to face the lady, causing you to gently float down onto the cold locker room floor right in between the pink sneakers of this curvy new woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Irina, you scared me!\u201d Kimberly exchanged greetings with her friend before you saw this Irina lady peer down at you and extend a hand to pick you up. Her hand was soft yet a bit clammy as she raised you up to her face. Being the first time you\u2019d seen this woman, you were a bit awestruck by her generous features. Her short black hair hung stylishly and complimenting her shining, innocent, and kind eyes. But besides that you couldn\u2019t help but observe the body on this newcomer. A skimpy sports bra looked ready to tear as it contained her overflowing fleshy white tits, and a gray pair of spandex shorts adorned her like a second skin. A sparkling sheen of sweat was coating her body, and her skin looked flush with vitality as she\u2019d clearly been doing some kind of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? How did you manage to get two towels and I can\u2019t even get one!\u201d Irina belted out hanging you as evidence in front of Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly merely rolled her eyes at Irina\u2019s childish whine before retorting sassily, \u201cWell maybe if you stopped reducing them to shreds the manager would reinstate your privileges!\u201d Irina scoffed before crossing her arms, causing you to mush into her plushy left breast, looking to the side and donning a pouty face fit with jutted lip and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know why that happens! Don\u2019t make fun of me for it!\u201d Kimberly merely laughed in response to the start of Irina\u2019s justification before Irina continued, \u201cI have to sit on a towel when I ride the exercise bike! It keeps my butt from getting all soaked and icky! I will admit it does make the towel a...<i>disposable</i> contrivance, heh heh...\u201d. Kimberly was snickering at this point only making Irina even more defensive, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, though! It\u2019s not fair you would get <i>two</i> and I can\u2019t have <i>any</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome mischievous thoughts were stirring in Kimberly\u2019s head as she thought over what Irina had said. She wasn\u2019t sure, but it seemed quite likely somehow Cassie\u2019s little man had ended up inside her very own gym bag, and even better he was still in the shape of a standard towel. A light bulb suddenly clicked on in her mind as she thought of a way to get you away from her daughter for a bit, as well as test your competence as a potential member of the family. Feigning total innocence and generosity, Kimberly merely replied to Irina saying, \u201cAlright fine, you\u2019re free to keep it then. Just try not to tear it like you do with all your other rags. It\u2019s still the gym\u2019s after all.\u201d A cold chill befell you as Kimberly\u2019s words sank in. She was really giving you away, even if in ignorance, to this woman you\u2019d never met and who had a body fit to pummel you the likes of which you\u2019ve never experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>No promises~</i>\u201d Irina sang out playfully. You\u2019d gulp in anxiety if you could as you realized the woman holding you in her palm was totally unaware a squishy young man even existed, and she now thought you were her very own property!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing with delight at having her way, Irina bounced in place in joy causing you, and her ridiculous curves, to swing around chaotically. \u201cOh thank you, thank you, thank you, Kimmie! You\u2019re so sweet!\u201d Leaping onto Kimberly in a caring hug, you felt your body get sandwiched between these two giantesses as Irina gripped her tight, both pairs of pillowy breasts now strangling the life out of you and keeping you nice and flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently pushing Irina off, Kimberly winced as she felt a slick of her friends sweat rub off on her. \u201cGeez, Irina, why are you already all sweaty? The class hasn\u2019t even started yet!\u201d Irina casually took the hand bearing you and nervously rubbed the back of her head, causing you to get a face full of silky black hair that admittedly had an alluring aroma to it that washed over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is just from warming up for a few minutes upstairs...you know I tend to overheat when I get around to exercising!\u201d Irina donned a sheepish grin as she peered down at her shoes in mild embarrassment. Feeling a light droplet of sweat dripping down her thigh, she knew her shorts must already be starting to <b>darken</b> a bit as they soaked up the hot and sticky fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true her curves made her body produce an extra bought of heat, but mainly she knew she got so sweaty when she exercised due to how little she got around to working out. Simple yoga and her flawless genetics alone seemed to be more than enough to keep her waist trim and her butt tight. She was a bit embarrassed by how strangely often her booty managed to bump into things but that was far outweighed by how proud she was to have a drop dead gorgeous figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to belittle her closest friend, Kimberly encouragingly replied, \u201cHey, whatever keeps your body cool right? The more the better!\u201d Irina felt much better hearing this and barked out a simple \u201cYep!\u201d with a cheery bit of pep and a newfound smile. Without another word, Irina went ahead and tucked you into the waistband of her shorts like so many of the other girls seemed to be doing, subjecting you to the first up close assault of Irina\u2019s body. Her shorts really did act as a second skin, sealing all her body heat and sweat in a foggy miasma of stench just beneath the surface of her sexy exterior. You winced as your mouth made contact with this woman\u2019s salty bare thigh flesh and tried to scream for mercy that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing her way out of the locker room, Kimberly and Irina ventured their way to the gyms studio, your body swaying freely and chaotically with every swag of Irina\u2019s hips. They quickly laid out their mats and began stretching as they waited for the class to start. Finally your head was pulled free from Irina\u2019s hip as she withdrew you to work you around the rest of her body. Swiping you with ease along her doughy thighs and slender arms, Irina purred feeling how smooth you felt against her moist skin. You on the other hand were not feeling appreciative as your face was dragged along your kidnappers skin, forced to get a tour of all the tastes and smells Irina\u2019s body could whip up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing you in her palm, Irina was shocked to find no fluid poured out and her sweat was totally wiped up! With glee Irina decided this little rag just might be able to handle all her body\u2019s needs! Looking up at this clueless woman through stinging eyes, you saw a sly grin growing on her pretty face. You knew this meant nothing but trouble for you as you lay helplessly in the palm of her hand. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sparking the idea to put you through a little test, Irina made sure no one was staring before dunking you with exuberance into her cavernous cleavage. Her tongue stuck out in focus as she swabbed you all along her left breast and then moved onto the right, her nipples gently brushing against you and perking up a bit from your foreign stimulation. Returning to drag you along where all her sweat joined together, Irina smeared you along her cleavage up and down before pulling you out with a light audible pop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing you up under a close eye, Irina\u2019s inspection yielded that you were no worse for wear! No rips or tears at all! \u201cWhat a useful little thing! It\u2019s just what I\u2019ve been looking for!\u201d You saw this woman who claimed to own you squeaking with joy at how effective you were and you cursed your body for being so accommodating. If only this woman had hated the job you did, then you\u2019d be let go and have a decent chance to reform, if no other woman came along. But unfortunately for you, you were Irina\u2019s dream come true. Dozens of towels had met their doom under Irina\u2019s powerful rump, and now it was your turn to stand the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class began quickly and with it Irina draped you around her neck to be able to quickly lap up any droplets that dripped from her hair. This experience was certainly bad but at least the smell wasn\u2019t as awful and there wasn\u2019t any bone shattering pressure bearing down on you. Going through some sets of lunges Irina was already feeling the burn; at this moment you were actually getting the easier life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the women following directions, you heard the instructors microphone blare out to begin doing some jumping jacks in place. Irina groaned as she began jumping up and swinging her arms above her head and then dropping them as she kicked her heels together. At first this felt like just another exercise, with Irina\u2019s hair bouncing and brushing against you with every little hop; but soon you felt yourself falling backwards as the wild motions of Irina shook you loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any way to hold on, you slipped right off the distracted woman\u2019s collar only to plop right behind her with the daunting view of looking up right at her. Her long legs were pounding furiously and her humongous butt was jiggling wildly up and down with every jump. Honestly it wasn\u2019t even a bad view and the worst you had to go through was the occasional droplet flying off Irina and splashing onto you. \u201cAlright ladies, back to squats!\u201d immediately Irina dropped her ass down low, and you feared it was coming right for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the bottom of her squat however she paused with her titanic rear overheard before standing up once more. As she came down a second time you felt a whirlwind of stench come with her as her ass came an inch from your face. You winced looking up at her straining shorts, the threads had clearly been stretched to their limits and at any second looked ready to give up and rip. You thanked god you\u2019d never have to be stretched around her wide waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Irina and Kimberly finished up the last of their squats, the announcer indicated a break which prompted Irina to fall backwards in exhaustion right at the bottom of her squat. You watched her ass as if in slow motion plummet onto you and crush you in its forceful and passionate embrace. Hitting the ground hard caused Irina\u2019s shorts to squeeze out all the sweat it had barely been able to withhold. The sweat poured free from her crack only to drain right onto your face. You feared you might suffocate as Irina cluelessly drowned you in her ass sweat while taking a much needed breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shot a glance over at her tired friend and blushed seeing the awful fate that had literally fallen on you. Feeling the slightest ounce of pity, Kimberly nudged Irina stating simply, \u201cHey hun, I think you sat on your new towel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina strained to peer over her shoulder and spot you but in her complete fatigue she merely panted out, \u201cThat\u2019s fine...right...where I...need it!\u201d With that dooming statement she rocked back and forth atop you, trying to wring out as much fluid as she could from her soaked ass to be taken care of by you. If only the kind albeit klutzy mother knew a real person was being forced to endure the horrors of her ass, perhaps she\u2019d spring up and even manage to apologize. But unfortunately for you, Irina was only concerned right now with expunging this tidal wave of sweat from her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench was unlike any other as your exposed tongue caught the rough texture of her shorts, burning as she grinded her butt deeper and deeper into you. You wanted to be thankful this fabric was here to keep you from entering her bare ass, but honestly it was so skin tight it only made the experience more rough as the threads burned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was satisfied with <i>her</i> work, Irina stood up once again, cluelessly crushing her new tool under the worn tread of her sneakers, giving you the once more terrifying view of staring up at Irina\u2019s towering body as she stepped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, as the class wrapped up, Irina swept you up from the floor and mopped you all along her body to finish up. As she rubbed her forehead, you could feel her sweltering hot breath panting a mist onto you in exhaustion as she tried to catch her breath and dry off at the same time. \u201cGreat class, huh girl?\u201d Kimberly said lightly poking Irina in the stomach with an elbow. Irina merely nodded tiredly, too focused on making sure you absorbed every drop of her filth. \u201cSo, how\u2019d that towel hold up? Did that big butt of yours reduce it to thread?\u201d Kimberly laughed heartily at her own suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina, having finally caught her breath, brandished a great smile before she swung you around with a slap to her backside. \u201cNope! I think these two are going to be the <i>best</i> of friends!\u201d Irina and Kimberly both giggled relentlessly at your expense as you whimpered silently between them. You worried it was now or never that Kimberly could stop you from being doomed to service Irina\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the only thought running through Kimberly\u2019s mind that you sure made Irina happy, she decided to suggest aloud, \u201cWell I\u2019m glad! Maybe you should just keep it. Doesn\u2019t look like any of the staff are looking anyways! So long as you get it past the front desk you can use it over and over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Irina finished up swabbing you underneath her dripping underarms, she excitedly agreed. \u201cGreat idea!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes wandered around the room for a while before finally falling on your fianc\u00e9e. Her expression was that of sympathy and kindness, and her soft smile melted your heart. You hadn\u2019t considered every confronting your irrational fear of the beach, but now that you had, you felt a million times better knowing Cassie would fully support you. Now, you were honestly kind of looking forward to a beachside excursion with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the building sensual tension in the room, Kimberly politely excused herself, standing up and moving out towards the kitchen. Maddie followed suit, taking a second to stretch before running outside, no doubt for some sort of physical activity. Sophie was last, flashing her trademark irresistible smile to you and her sister before scrambling upstairs to her room. Finally, it was just you and Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she scooped you up off the coffee table and sank back into the comfortable plush recliner chair she was in. She hugged you tightly to her chest, pressing your head into her boobs. With her spare hand she turned on the TV, changing the channel to one of your favorite shows, a sci-fi thriller. She also noted that one of her mom\u2019s favorite movies was on after the hour-long episode of your show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, babe, it\u2019s that show you like.\u201d Cassie stated, fighting back a smug smile. \u201cWanna watch the episode?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried back to her in feigned annoyance, though your voice only came out as a garbled muffle. With your face firmly pressed into your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s killer boobs, you couldn\u2019t manage a single coherent word. This was only further compounded as Cassie began to laugh, her breasts jiggling as she giggled, soft skin wobbling against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she released you from her sensual, entrapping hug, and set you down on her lap. Her lusciously smooth things provided the perfect bed for you to spread out your arms and lay back. Your head rested on Cassie\u2019s crotch, and even covered up by panties and jean shorts, it was a wonder you could manage to keep your composure in a fairly intimate position like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this comfortable position, you and your fianc\u00e9e spent the next forty minutes watching the show. Of course, your attention was only half on the alien-fueled drama before you. Part of your mind was distracted by the gentle, soothing body heat emanating from Cassie\u2019s thighs all around you. Cassie herself also kept gently stroking your head or lightly squeezing her thighs around you. Eventually, you flicked your eyes up, and caught Cassie\u2019s loving gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I forget you\u2019re the world\u2019s sexiest stuffed animal, basically.\u201d Cassie joked with affection. \u201cMaybe I should sleep with you hugged up tight more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot her a coy look. \u201cWith you honey, anything. Besides you though, I had my fill with the stuffed animal treatment back in college with your old dormmate, Marianne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s face flushed. \u201cOh my god, Marianne! I almost completely forgot about that time she\u2026\u201d Cassie trailed off into a laugh, and you couldn\u2019t help but share in her enthusiasm at recalling the memory, even though it\u2019d been significantly more humiliating and embarrassing than funny at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne, Cassie\u2019s dormmate during her college years, had stumbled into their room late one night, totally plastered. You\u2019d been studying for a test with Cassie, who had been in the bathroom, leaving you alone on her bed. Mind fuzzy and vision blurry, Marianne hadn\u2019t even spoken to you before she had stripped naked in front of you, snatched you up off of Cassie\u2019s bed, and plunged your head and shoulders into her bare chest in a tight, sweaty embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d glumly realized that Marianne (being hammered out of her mind) had confused you for a little stuffed doll she slept with every night. As such, you\u2019d found yourself pinned in a simultaneously arousing and painful drunken hug, unable to pull yourself free before Marianne collapsed into her bed and promptly fell asleep. To make matters worse, Cassie had returned from the bathroom, saw you missing, and simply assumed you\u2019d left for the night. She\u2019d gone to sleep in her own bed, none the wiser to your predicament just a few feet beside her with Marianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie wiped a joyous tear of laughter from her eye and composed herself. \u201cHey, at least I got you back the next morning!\u201d She protested, hands on her hips. You scoffed in mock indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot me back? Barely! I was nothing but a mangled sticker on Marianne\u2019s stomach by the next morning, and you only spotted me because she wore a midriff baring top. Goodness knows she was too hungover to notice me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e adopted an expression of faux anger. \u201cUh huh. So what do you wanna do about it, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flashed her confident grin. \u201cTHIS!\u201d You cried, then you punched her thigh. Of course, your tiny fists did nothing but lightly tickle her. In fact, your hand nearly sunk a bit into her soft flesh, practically doing more harm to you than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie gasped in mock surprise, and then grinned mischievously. \u201cAlright Jake, you win. I can\u2019t top that little thigh tickle. Unless, of course, I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, without warning, Cassie stood up from the recliner and spread her thighs simultaneously. With a short, startled cry you fell right through the gap in her thighs and back down on the recliner\u2019s seat below. You were momentarily stunned, but even more so by the sight of your fianc\u00e9e now towering above you, and her perfectly shaped, jean shorts clad ass hovering over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026did\u2026THIS?\u201d Cassie exclaimed, excitement clearly heard in her voice. With enthusiastic energy she slammed back down into the seat, and you were pulverized in the blink of an eye. Flattening out, your foot-tall body was reduced to paper beneath Cassie\u2019s shapely derriere, all of her weight more than enough to reduce you to the size and shape of a pancake under her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, this was a sensation that you wholeheartedly welcomed. Sure, being crushed was always a little painful, but when it was Cassie, you cherished those sexually intimate moments with her. You knew Cassie had a bit of a fondness for enjoying your body\u2019s unique qualities, and with her careful guidance and respect for your safety, you couldn\u2019t say no. As such, moments like this were common and thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stayed put on top of you for a minute, glancing over her back to try to see any part of you, but you were fully hidden under her ass. Smirking confidently, she waved to an imaginary audience. \u201cAnd there you have it folks, Cassie Smalls wins again! Looks like Jake Bigg just can\u2019t handle this butt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough muffled under her cheeks, you could just barely pick up on your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s comical boasting, and you mentally rolled your eyes. She could get exceptionally theatrical from time to time, especially when it came to her little wrestling matches with you. You loved every little thing about her, even if she was sometimes a bit of a dork.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up above, Cassie was just about to relinquish her ass\u2019s dominion of you when movement out of the corner of her eye caught her attention. It was Sophie, strolling casually into the room while tapping away on her phone. Sophie glanced up at grinned at Cassie, but her brilliant smile faltered a bit a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis! Where\u2019s Jake, lil cutie?\u201d Sophie inquired, sauntering over to Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie felt her heart skip a beat and her face paled, and she struggled to maintain a neutral expression. There was no way she could live up the embarrassment of what she\u2019d just been doing to you. Worse still, she didn\u2019t want to establish a precedent for you enjoying being sat on. Next thing she\u2019d know, and airheaded Sophie would be crushing you under her butt in every possible instance, thinking that you\u2019d be having the time of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026he\u2019s um\u2026in the bathroom, I think.\u201d Cassie stammered out, trying to look innocent. She was acutely aware of your thin body pinned under her meaty ass cheeks, and growing more uncomfortable by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sophie was about to let all hell break loose. A wide smile grew on her face. \u201cOh! In that case, I guess there\u2019s no problem if I make myself comfortable, right?\u201d She suggested. Before your fianc\u00e9e could react, Sophie twirled around and slammed her own cute butt right down into Cassie\u2019s lap. She leaned back and settled on Cassie, her curvy frame comparable to Cassie\u2019s own, and easily able to hold Cassie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s eyes widened at this impulsive, childish act of playfulness from Sophie, but nowhere near as wide as your own eyes grew. Cassie\u2019s weight was one thing, but the full-bodied weight of two curvy girls squeezing the life out of you was another. The pain atop your miniscule frame was immense, and you mutely shouted out in a panic. Obviously though, your flattened lungs could produce no sound to aid you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie began bouncing up and down on Cassie\u2019s lap and giggling incessantly. Each bounce sent reverberation through Cassie\u2019s body and down onto you, your squished form somehow flattening out even thinner. Worse, sweat started to drip from both girl\u2019s skin, and the droplets ran their natural course down the deep imprint in the recliner\u2019s seat straight to your body, soaking you thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sophie! Please, get off!\u201d Cassie tried to exclaim, but Sophie\u2019s hair get fluttering into her mouth. The happy-go-lucky blonde\u2019s unstoppable laughter and energy radiated through the room as she gripped the edges of the recliner to try to stabilize herself, maintaining her throne atop her sister, and forcing Cassie to keep you buried beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, and a third variable entered the fray. Walking inside from some basketball in the backyard, Maddie took a swig from her water bottle and gazed at the bizarre circumstances playing out before her. Setting her bottle down and wiping some glistening sweat from her brow, she walked over to the recliner and smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup? Room for one more? You guys look comfy.\u201d Maddie joked. Cassie\u2019s heart caught in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026Madd\u2013\u201d Cassie began, before another clump of dyed blonde hair stuck into her mouth, and she coughed. Not picking up on her older sister\u2019s distressed expression, Maddie flung herself onto the recliner, prompting an annoyed groan from Cassie, and ecstatic squeal from Sophie, and a frantic but ultimately silent scream from you. Three sister\u2019s weight threatened to flatten you into dust, not to mention knock you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Maddie\u2019s leg tangled around Sophie\u2019s own, and Maddie began to fall backwards, dragging Sophie with her. Practically hugging Cassie, Sophie also dragged Cassie, and the three Smalls sisters toppled forward and onto the carpet. They landed in a laughing heap, and struggled to pull their limbs out of the pretzel-like lump they\u2019d become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left behind on the recliner, reduced to little more than a sticker on the fabric of the seat, molded into a butt shaped imprint. Caked in sweat, you fought to compose yourself and focus on reforming, only one eye yet un-mangled, and staring out above you. Truth be told, you actually blended in pretty well with the existing coloring of the seat cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fact was apparently confirmed, as Sophie was the first to her feet, and she jumped onto the recliner with a victorious grin and happy cry. Her bikini-clad ass smacked against your body, Sophie\u2019s hot flesh sticking to your skin. To make matters worse, Sophie began wiggling her butt back and forth along the seat, grinding her booty against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s eyes widened at this, and her mind was brought back to the issue at hand. Before she could protest though, Maddie spoke the feared words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is this a competition now?\u201d Maddie cracked her knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re on, sis!\u201d She declared, leaping to her feet and tackling against Sophie. Surprised by this, Sophie rolled off the side of the recliner and onto the floor, allowing Maddie to sink into the seat. Her own toned butt, clad in tight compression shorts, was no less overwhelming than Sophie\u2019s, the brown-haired girl\u2019s weight bearing down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie couldn\u2019t let this stand, and so she grabbed Maddie\u2019s wrist and yanked her from the seat in a move so bold Maddie was totally unprepared. With the seat free, Cassie plopped her own butt back down into the seat, a bit more forcefully than she\u2019d originally intended. She was admittedly getting a bit caught up in the action at hand, and was slowly forgetting about your predicament. It had been years since she\u2019d done something so childish and fun like this with her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took a deep breath. \u201cO-okay\u2026okay\u2026let\u2019s stop now. I won.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie shook her head, and her eyes glinted. \u201cNuh uh. Nope. I don\u2019t lose around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie smiled like a little kid. \u201cYou\u2019re going down big sis!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-can we please\u2026\u201d Cassie paled, and at once her two sisters commenced their attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fifteen minutes were a bit of a blur to you. Over and over and over again, the sisters tore each other from the recliner and reclaimed the prized throne. Butt after butt slammed into your poor body, each powerful impact rattling your brain and squashing you into oblivion. Sweat covered you and the sisters, and it was only a matter of time before you began sticking to someone or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a particularly powerful blow knocked you unconscious, as you\u2019d been fearing all along. You couldn\u2019t even tell whose ass had crushed you that final time. You simply faded into darkness, and prayed somehow everything worked out by the time you woke back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d A loud voice called out, breaking the competition into a standstill. The three Smalls girls, breathing heavily and drenched in sweat, laughed and panted for breath. They traced the sound of the loud voice to their mother, Kimberly, standing at the doorway. \u201cWhat ruckus are you three making? You\u2019re like little kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie beamed. \u201cWe were wrestling over sitting in the recliner! It was, like, so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie crossed her arms. \u201cI would\u2019ve won, given a few more minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie elbowed her playfully. \u201cWhat? You nearly fainted when I gave you a little love tap a minute ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA love tap with your butt!\u201d Maddie exclaimed, rubbing her forehead. \u201cYour junk in the trunk nearly gave me a concussion.\u201d Maddie lightly slapped Cassie\u2019s ass, and your fianc\u00e9e burned bright red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shook her head. \u201cYou three are a mess, but it\u2019s nice seeing you get along. My movie\u2019s coming on now, though, so it\u2019s my recliner now. House rules.\u201d She smiled warmly. Sharing a grin, the Smalls sisters all split off their separate ways, even Cassie, of whose memory you had completely slipped for the moment in all the hectic fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the room, Kimberly sank down into the recliner, shifted a bit to get comfortable, and turned the volume up. For the next two hours, nothing was going to disturb her and her movie watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real question was\u2026where did you end up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you regained consciousness, you were a bit disappointed to find your squishy body still stuck to something, face first and trapped in darkness. Still, from the shaking and swaying side-to-side, you could tell you\u2019d been transferred from the seat cushion to one of the asses of the Smalls sisters. That was probably an improvement, but your situation was still far from desirable, as your mystery captor was clearly still unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second more of thought, and you finely placed the shapely rear end you were glued to as belonging to your lovely fianc\u00e9e. The most obvious evidence was the mildly grating jean shorts fabric picking at your body, but you could also acutely feel the curvature of her perfect booty all around you as well. You\u2019d been buried under her creamy globes hundreds of times over the past few years (unfortunately about 50/50 intentional and accidental), so you knew her butt well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the context clues around you, you could tell that Cassie had just finished dragging her suitcase upstairs into her old bedroom, which would now serve as the room both of you shared during your stay. Each ass tensed and flexed around you as your giantess fianc\u00e9e bent down and rummaged around in her suitcase. You tried to wiggle and reform during all of this, but were simply too defeated to do so at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie retrieved a loose blue t-shirt and matching comfy short shorts, and then proceeded out of her room and across the hall, into the bathroom. She locked the door behind her, and wasted no time in stripping out of her sweaty clothes. Her mind was fully preoccupied with happy thoughts about wrestling around with Sophie and Maddie, her intelligent brain spinning with fun day trips to hang out with her family. Caught up in the moment, you were still far from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her clothes fall in a heap by the bathroom door, Cassie slinked over to the shower, turned on the hot water, and stepped in. Letting the searing water run over her naked body, Cassie let out a huge, pleased sigh, and began lightly singing. Her melodic voice carried over the running water, and brought a huge smile to your crumpled and mangled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her singing was hardly your primary focus. Bundled up in a heap, your flattened body was still stuck by sweat and pressure to the back of Cassie\u2019s jean shorts. Going to work on reforming, you focused all of your mind and energy on peeling your squashed limbs free. It was slow going, but soon your arms and legs were free. With a great show of strength, you ripped your gummy-like chest from the jeans, and began blindly crawling to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had unceremoniously dumped her clothes on the tiled floor, so you were lost in a tangled mess of her dirty clothes. Scrambling frantically, you continuously punched at pockets or sleeves, unable to find a clear escape path. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s obviously upbeat singing contrasted sharply with the blind panic you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, you felt sharp pricks tear into your chest and legs, and you cried out in surprised pain. Some strange hooks, no doubt buttons or zippers on Cassie\u2019s shorts, had torn into your own body in your frantic escape attempt. Wincing at the pain, you ripped free with a mighty tug, and finally tumbled out of the pile of discarded clothes, rolling out onto the cold tiles of the bathroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that you realized what exactly those sharp buttons and zippers had done, along with your hasty yanking to safety. Gazing down at yourself, your cheeks flushed bright red in embarrassment. You were now completely naked, your clothes having been torn right from your body. Looking over at Cassie\u2019s dirty clothes pile, all you could see were her shorts, shirt, panties, bra, and socks. Your own comparatively tiny clothes were lost somewhere in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly contemplated plunging back in to find your clothes, but disregarded the idea soon after. You didn\u2019t want to risk getting lost in that surprisingly confusing mess of clothes again. You also heard Cassie\u2019s singing die down, which implied she was moving onto conditioner her hair, which was often her last step in showering. She would be out soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to take stock of the bathroom you were in, and noted the sheer size of it. A wide counter with two sinks took up an entire wall, no doubt attempting to accommodate for four girls in one house. Cassie was in a walk-in shower against the other wall, which closed behind a sliding glass door. A large cabinet of towels and toiletries lined the rest of the wall beside it. That last wall is where the toilet was, but there was also a sizable circular tub just for bathing. It looked like something out of a fancy hotel, and even seemed to have bubble jets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water in Cassie\u2019s shower shut off a second later, and your heart skipped a beat. Not wanting to look as if you were being a pervert, or anything, you sprinted over to the sliding glass door to await Cassie\u2019s exit. The fact that you were naked was incredibly embarrassing, and you hoped Cassie would be understanding. At least it was your fianc\u00e9e, and not Sophie or Maddie\u2026or heaven forbid, Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slid back, and you opened your mouth to speak, but your words left you. Stupidly, your brain shut down right as the glistening figure of your bride-to-be materialized behind the foggy door. Her perfectly proportioned body towered over you, and you basked in her nude glory. A giantess like her was a goddess, and your heart melted with the love you felt for her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026which was immediately replaced by fear, as you noted Cassie staring straight ahead and rubbing her eyes, which were closed. She had a pained look on her face, that soon matched your own as she took another step forward. Stumbling over yourself trying to form words again, you were helpless as Cassie\u2019s foot kicked into you, knocking you backwards across the smooth tile. You flew away from her towards the toilet in the corner of the bathroom, sliding along the floor and impacting against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn soap\u2026\u201d Cassie moaned, rubbing her eyes as she finished stepping out of the enclosed shower. \u201c\u2026got right in my eye\u2026\u201d She sighed, blindly reaching for a towel from the cabinet beside her. Finding one, she mercifully pressed the plush fabric against her eyes until the pain ceased. Moving on to drying her face and hair, Cassie peered around the bathroom. \u201cWhat did I even kick? Felt weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Cassie was unable to see you, as you\u2019d sailed into the corner by the toilet. Partly hidden in shadow, your face had squished against the wall, so you were currently struggling to peel it free, and couldn\u2019t cry out to Cassie for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of your own struggles, Cassie methodically dried herself off, and then changed into her pajamas for the night, the loose tee and short shorts from earlier. She often slept naked, but while at home, she felt it\u2019d be a bit weird. Plus, she knew how much her cutesy and revealing pajamas turned you on, especially since she didn\u2019t have underwear on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette giantess hung her towel up to dry, and then sauntered back over to her dirty clothes. While approaching, she noticed a large wicker basket against the wall near the tub. It hadn\u2019t been there since before leaving for college, so it\u2019s appearance was new to her. It was tall, like a large trash can, and completely covered in finely woven wicker save for a circular opening up top. Cassie bent down to read a small sign hanging in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u2018Dirty Lingerie\u2019\u2026oh! Mom must\u2019ve put this out.\u201d Cassie smiled and spoke aloud, still thinking she was alone in the bathroom. \u201cI guess that makes sense, since we wash our underwear in a delicate cycle. Put it all in one place then!\u201d Grabbing up her dirty clothes pile, Cassie picked out her bra and panties and dropped them into the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to leave when a loud voice called out. \u201cCassie dear! Can you hear me?\u201d Though faint, you and your fianc\u00e9e could pick up the voice as Kimberly\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah mom!\u201d Cassie called back, opening the bathroom door to hear better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe TV\u2019s started acting up, so I can\u2019t watch my movie.\u201d Kimberly explained. \u201cDo you think you could fill up the tub for me? I could go for a nice, long soak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned. \u201cSure thing, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks sweetie. I\u2019ll be up in just a minute or two.\u201d Kimberly shouted up from the first floor. Cassie turned back into the bathroom and approached the tub, cranking up the hot water and closing the drain so the tub could fill. She also popped the cap on a small bottle and sprinkled liquid into the tub that began growing into a swath of bubbles. Lastly, she clicked the bubble jets onto a low level of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at this moment you pulled your face free from the wall and stumbled to your feet. Whirling around, you caught one final brief glimpse of Cassie as she strolled out of the room, closing the door behind her. You sprinted across the slick tile, slipping and falling twice, and finally made it to the bathroom door. You jumped up pitifully, and came nowhere near close to reaching the door handle. Cassie had just locked you in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to the center of the room, you ran your hands through your hair. What were you going to do now? There was no way you could just let yourself be caught naked in the bathroom by Kimberly! She already had a low opinion of you and your stature and squishiness. How could you face that humiliation? You doubted she\u2019d believe this was all one big accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard steps outside the door, and knew Kimberly had arrived for her bath. With seconds left, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The steps outside the door drew closer and closer as the pit of fear in your stomach multiplied tenfold. Your first impression with your fiance's mother was getting utterly decimated underneath her flip flop and now your second impression was about to happen while naked in the bathroom she was about to use. There wasn't a chance in the world you were about to let this happen so in a state of utter panic you scrambled backwards away from the door. Looking to your side you saw the dirty lingerie basket Cassie had mentioned earlier and immediately scratched that off of your list. The only worse place you could be found while naked than the bathroom would be rolling around with the Smalls family's undergarments. The towel cabinet was another option but thanks to your most recent retreat away from the door it was now too far for you to make. Hearing the door knob crack and begin to turn you mustered all of your might and scaled the wicker lingerie basket before swan diving off of that into the incredibly bubbly bath tub. The water was quite warm but actually felt rather nice, at least it would have if you had been capable of relaxing even the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking your head up from under the water your one foot tall frame had to just barely tread water while floating in the tub. Hills of sudsy bubbles surrounded you as you cleared some of them out of the way and took stock of the situation. Kimberly had just entered the bathroom, closing and locking the door behind her while wearing a long, tan robe. You took a mental note of its color and sighed, thinking about the inordinate amount of skin colored clothing the women who surrounded you would often wear. But as she removed the robe in one swift motion and hung it over a hook on the door, these thoughts fled your mind. Your eyes went wide and your jaw dropped as Kimberly's fully nude form was exposed to you. Immediately you could tell the uncanny resemblance between her and Cassie, as their bodies were nearly identical. The only difference was that Kimberly was a bit less toned than your fiance, but what she lacked in that department she made up for in sheer size. Especially from the back, the angle you were looking at now, you could tell you wouldn't want to be anywhere near that ass when it was coming down. In the midst of this terrifying situation the one reassuring thought you could cling to was that Cassie was going to age very gracefully if she followed the precedent her mother had set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow turning around and beginning to walk towards you, you breathed silently and broke out of your trance as you submerged up to your eyeballs underwater. The top of your head being still covered with bubbles you were nearly invisible to anyone looking at the tub. This was both a blessing and a curse as Kimberly finished collecting a few supplies from the nearby bathroom vanity and placed them on a small stand next to the tub. Then the moment you were fearing most of all began to take place, as you watched her lift one massive foot over the edge of the tub and over yourself, giving you a brief fearful flashback of earlier. Immediately it stomped down into the water just narrowly missing you by an inch. You would have been thankful to not be immediately squashed, but the force of her meaty leg entering the water created a whirlpool of sorts, sucking you fully underneath the bubbles and into the water. Tumbling around you felt her second leg plunge into the tub as well, dishing out a new wave of swirling water to toss you around under the water. By some luck you spun around her calves and feet but didn't manage to slam into any of them for a few seconds, giving you a chance to get your bearings once again. You finally stopped being tossed around by the water and swam upwards to find out where exactly in the tub you were, breaching the surface of the water ever so gently not to arouse any suspicion. You rubbed the soap and water out of your eyes and glanced upward, a sight which induced pure terror in your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were floating right behind Kimberly's two legs and now hovering ominously above you was her massive rear end. You gulped with fear at the size of the asset that was currently blocking out any light from reaching you and immediately you began to swim further away. As you took your first stroke you felt more and more shadow cast in front of you, and you kicked and pulled water as fast as your muscles could possibly do it. Taking one last look up you saw here bare cheeks mere inches away from your entire body, until they made contact with the water. With your last bit of strength you dove further ahead and just managed to escape the meteoric falling of her ass! However your victory was short lived, while you thought the whirlpool effect earlier was strong, the amount of water displaced by her curvaceous hips and rump was much greater. Immediately you felt yourself get sucked underwater once again, but this time it wasn't in orbit as you were before. No, this time you were being almost magnetically pulled... straight towards her ass crack. You had just enough willpower to force your eyes open underwater, and saw for a split second the mounds of flesh you were being propelled towards at breakneck speeds. Without even a hope in the world you went head first between these orbs, the rest of your body following suit until you reached such a deep point that your entire body became wedged. At this exact moment Kimberly's bottom touched the base of the tub and you were fully prepared to possibly be murdered by your would-be mother in law for being found in this situation. As strange as it sounded part of you honestly hoped she wasn't going to notice your presence in her ass crack as at least you would possibly be able to escape undetected in the future. Immediately you felt the weight around you begin to shift, and then a hand grasping onto your most squashed legs and you knew this dream was as crushed as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your body was yanked out of the water and you cried mentally, terrified at whatever punishment would come. But as you seemed to reach the apex of your ascent and you were dangling by your legs in the air, you opened your eyes to see Kimberly's face covered in a face mask with cucumbers over her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I sat on my luffa again I really need to get a wrist strap for this thing\" Kimberly mumbled out loud to herself before slapping your crushed form haphazardly on the edge of the tub right next to her. You couldn't believe your stroke of luck as you thanked your stars for it. Currently unable to move after the beat down you received from Kimberly simply sitting down, you saw her real luffa laying on the ground underneath a nearby cabinet. It must have been knocked off and away as Kimberly sat down, and from a distance it appeared to be strikingly similar to your body's characteristics: thin and somewhat squishy. You hoped beyond hope that Kimberly would take a bit of time to relax before getting to cleaning herself, but there was no way of knowing what her bathing routine was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lying on the ledge right beside the titanic form of your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom, you hesitated. She was currently lying back in the tub, smiling at the hot temperatures and relaxing bubbles. With her mask and cucumbers, you\u2019d been spared being immediately recognized, but it didn\u2019t make your current situation any less precarious. Was it really in your best interest to reform now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, as Kimberly slapped her hand back onto you a minute later, scooping you up in her palm. The massive brown-haired woman, still keeping her head back and expression peaceful, dunked your body under the hot water for a moment, before lifting you back up. She then used her other hand to grab the nearby tub of body wash, and she poured a generous helping onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquidy body wash stung your eyes so bad you cried out, thankfully still silent as your mouth was mashed flat. The body wash soaked your skin thoroughly, the sticky liquid adhering to you, which was unfortunately exactly how a real loofah would act. Realizing now how horribly unlucky you had truly been, you could only weakly brace yourself as Kimberly got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding up a bit out of the water and exposing her gargantuan breasts, Kimberly slammed your squishy body into her left breast. You pressed firmly into her unbelievable soft and jiggly tit, her hot flesh nearly enveloping around you. Slowly but methodically, Kimberly rubbed you across her boob in circles, using you to massage and coat her entire smooth skin in body wash. You were dragged across her pillowy flesh, her nipple dragging across your face multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost to your benefit how smushed Kimberly\u2019s constant smearing and rubbing was making you, as you would no doubt have given yourself away by now due to a certain\u2026common male reaction in sensual situations. You were far from attracted to your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mom, that\u2019d be weird, but being dragged across her perfect tits was simply forcing a biological reaction. You couldn\u2019t control it, just like you had no control over what Kimberly was currently doing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to her right breast, Kimberly repeated the process of massaging her boob with your body. Her hand guided you up, down, and all around her gigantic globe, squishing your body into her own intimately. After that, she slipped you down between her massive mammaries, using what she still believed to be a simple loofah to clean and caress in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly moaning, Kimberly smiled dreamily. \u201cGoodness\u2026\u201d She murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t remember it feeling this good\u2026\u201d She lowered her hand holding you, and moved to scrubbing her stomach. You were taken on a full tour of her stomach, sides, and hips, then onto her back and shoulders. She ran you up and down her arms, and began to lazily hum a little tune, her voice distorting whenever she shoved you back under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReapplying the body wash to your battered body, Kimberly moved onto her legs. She squeezed your squishy form in between her toes, removing small bits of built-up dirt and grime, and scrapped your face across her soles. Wrapping you around her leg, she carried your loofah-shaped body up her left leg and then her right, cleansing every bit of her skin. You were forced to embrace her thighs as she scrubbed away, heedless to the humiliating and intimate position she had her daughter\u2019s tiny fianc\u00e9 in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kimberly flipped over onto her stomach, resting her head on the edge of the bath and presenting her phenomenal derriere to you. You winced, but could do nothing as Kimberly slapped you into her meaty left cheek, her flesh wiggling in slow motion under the water from the impact. As dutiful as always, your future mother-in-law scrubbed you in methodical circles across both of her silky-smooth cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought things were going to come to an end, Kimberly took it one step further and moved you into her ass. Your flattened mouth let out a mute cry of terror as the brown-haired giantess shoved you into her ass crack, and began wiping up and down. Your face was forced to slid along the inside of her cheeks, whiffs of earth stench still entering your flattened nostrils over the pleasant body wash smell. You abandoned all pretense of hiding your identity and tried to squirm out of Kimberly\u2019s grasp, but it was no use. You were too far mashed to move now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t last long, but as Kimberly finally pulled you up out of the water and set you down on the tub\u2019s edge, the damage had been done. Never in your life would you have wanted to get intimate with your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother, and you\u2019d just been given the full tour. On your first day at the house, no less! At lot of crazy things had happened to you in your life, but you had never experienced being used as a loofah and scrubbing a naked woman\u2019s body in the tub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour beaten and exhausted form hardly twitched over the next thirty minutes. You tried to reform, but made absolutely no progress due to the intense and lengthy usage you\u2019d endured from Kimberly. You could only lie there on the edge of the tub as the unaware woman deeply washed and conditioned her hair, and then finally climbed out of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out and onto a towel, the curvaceous giantess peeled off her face mask and cucumbers, dropping both into the trash can. She then dried herself off for a few minutes, and then wrapped a towel around her big breasts, another around her sizable booty, and one to dry her hair. She returned to the edge of the tub, knelt down, and picked you up, holding you in her hands as she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed weakly up at her, expecting your cover to be blown. Instead, Kimberly said something completely different. \u201cHm. Perhaps I\u2019ve just never taken a bubble bath with this loofah, but it was divine today! I\u2019ve never felt so soothed and massaged by such a simple little bathing cloth!\u201d Kimberly seemed to be looking right at you, but simply chuckled and walked over to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew near the sink, you finally caught a glimpse of yourself in the mirror, and just about fainted. Through such lengthy time being forced to rub and scrub all over Kimberly\u2019s flesh, or maybe because of the body wash somehow, your human features had been nearly smeared away! Your eyes were faintly visible (which is why you could still see), but the rest of you was totally an even tan color, just like a plain old cloth. You looked nearly exactly like her real loofah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis renewed your spirit, and prompted you to begin fighting to reform again, but a second later, Kimberly dunked you in the freezing cold water of the sink. Dripping some soap onto your body, she lathered you up and cleansed you from the dirt you\u2019d accumulated. Squeezing over and over, her hands roughly smudged your flattened form, clenching to drain the water off of you. Attempts to reform were ruined immediately, and you became even more mashed than earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied she\u2019d cleaned her new favorite loofah, Kimberly walked once more over to the tub. She laid you out flat, and then folded your roughly rectangular body over itself twice, forming a small square shape. Thankfully, your face was the one part facing up, but your barely noticeable eyes once more passed Kimberly\u2019s glance as she dropped her heavy bottle of conditioner on top of you, crushing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! That\u2019ll keep you from falling into the tub again.\u201d Kimberly announced, proud of her tiny little DIY idea. Your folded-up body fit nicely under the bottle. Standing, she strolled happily out of the bathroom, mummering something quiet under her breath. \u201cReally should let the girls try that loofah out sometime\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision had been blocked by the bottle sitting on top of you, light vanishing into darkness. The bottle was surprisingly heavy, especially at your small size, and as you tentatively tried to wiggle a bit, you found it impossible. Folded up into a small square and trapped under the bottle, you were fully unable to move or even reform with this much pressure on you. Only a little bit of your body even poked out from under the sides of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as muffled as sound was under the bottle, you heard the sound of someone rushing into the bathroom seconds after Kimberly left. You couldn\u2019t tell from your vantage point, but it was Cassie, who had managed to piece together the events of the past hour, and realized that you\u2019d ended up in the bathroom during Kimberly\u2019s bath. Praying that you had managed to avoid being seen and punished, Cassie started methodically scanning for signs of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e dutifully scoured every corner of the bathroom, but obviously to no avail. Her gaze swept over the edge of the tub twice, but not once did she take note of your tiny tan form poking out from under the conditioner bottle. She was beginning to get desperate, and ran her hands through her hair. She knew you had to be in here, unless you\u2019d wound up somehow squished and stuck to her mom. She didn\u2019t even want to entertain that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the room a third pass, she finally spotted you. Frowning, she knelt down and lifted the conditioner. Leaning over you, she peered intently. Your heart leapt for joy, but dimmed as you noted Cassie\u2019s confused look. Surely your own fianc\u00e9e could see your faintly visible eyes, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud knock from outside caused Cassie to jump. \u201cHey, Cass! When you finish, I really need a bath.\u201d Maddie\u2019s telltale voice called. \u201cSuper gross and sweaty after playing some soccer in the backyard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked over her shoulder and stood. \u201cSure thing, Maddie!\u201d She turned to leave, but paused and looked at you again. From her perspective, you were just her mom\u2019s normal old loofah. You looked and felt exactly like the same squishy tan cloth her mom always used. But then why was something still bothering her? She was overthinking this, surely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

You silently screamed for her to come back, hoping against all hopes that she'd reconsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart lifted as you saw someone enter, but then it fell when you saw it was Maddie, who was quickly stripping out of her sweaty clothes. You couldn't help but gape a little at Maddie's body as it was revealed. Her rack and butt were not as large as Cassie's, but her butt and thighs were toned from hours of exercise, her glutes pert. Maddie, in her own way, was hotter than Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't trying to be perverted, but couldn't help but admire the amazing body given to this young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie filled up the tub with warm, bubbly water, before sliding in. She sighed as she relaxed into the water, sitting there eyes closed for a few moments. Then she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better start washing. Where's that loofah Mom told me to use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror struck you as you realized more catastrophe was about to befall you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie pulled you out from under the body wash. She placed some of the body wash on you, and then, for the second time today, you were used to wash a girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slammed into Maddie's skin forcefully, being rubbed hard across her skin to remove the dirt and sweat. Maddie, apparently, saved washing her assets for last, finishing up washing the rest of her body before burying you in her cleavage. When she finished with her perky breasts, Maddie ended with her amazing bubble butt. You were rubbed over and over again across Maddie's large rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Maddie finished with you, nodding with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom was right, that felt super nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie finished up her bath, setting you on the side of the tub as she did. She stepped out, draining the water. Maddie dried off, threw on some clothes, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, you had not been placed back under the body wash, but could start reforming.</span></div></div>",

You made it to the top and rolled in just as Kimberly opened the door. You fell to about the middle of the pile. The first thing you noticed was how soft all the clothing items were, the Smalls definitely didn\u2019t buy cheap undergarments. The second thing you noticed was the overpowering aroma of four different women. It frankly made your head spin. The third thing you barely paid any attention to, was the majority color of the undergarments, a nice familiar tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sighed as she started stripping  her clothes off. She needed a nice soak. Humming a tune to herself she walked over to the lingerie basket and dropped her own underwear into it. \u201cHmm this is starting to get full, maybe I should run a load after my bath\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought Kimberly climbed into the tub and relaxed. You were peeking through a small opening in the wicker to see if maybe you could climb out and escape but the door was of course shut and you didn\u2019t feel like risking being discovered. At this point you weren\u2019t sure if Kimberly would believe your explanation of why you were naked in the bathroom hiding in the dirty underwear... Nope definitely not an option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes, you heard Kimberly stirring and standing up. The water was cascading off of her body as she let out a sigh. \u201cThat was wonderful! All good things must come to an end though.\u201d She stepped out of the bath and started drying off the rest of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards she pulled on her clothes, and then stared at the wicker basket again. \u201cI really should get that started...\u201d she trailed off.

Hearing her approach, you wiggled a bit deeper into the basket, letting a frilly pair of panties slide over you and further obscure you. It was pretty dark all around you by this point, and you desperately pleaded that the towering giantess above you wouldn\u2019t see you. You kept absolutely still, not even breathing. The tension was high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I really should start the load.\u201d Kimberly said out loud. \u201cIt\u2019ll topple out onto the floor if this pile gets any bigger.\u201d Bending at the waist, she hefted the wicker basket up into her arms, and began carrying it out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should\u2019ve noticed it earlier, but this was the exact moment when the catastrophic failure of your own plan crashed down around you. As soon as the basket was lifted, your lightweight body slipped further down, more lingerie and clothing piling on top of you. As the pressure increased, so too did your body begin to squish and flatten a bit, your miniscule body entrapped on all sides by silky smooth undergarments and unmentionables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly carried the basket downstairs without much need to care, letting it bounce and sway in her arms. You were jostled and shaking around like a deflated ragdoll, banging against the sides of the basket and all sorts of dirty or slightly sweat clothing items. Your malleable body crumpled and folded more and more, reducing both in size and visibility. Your hopes of going unnoticed increased tenfold\u2026as your chances of escaping this horrible hiding spot drastically went down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly passed her daughters in the living room before finally reaching the back room near the kitchen which contained the washing machine and dryer. Popping open the metallic lid to the washing machine, Cassie\u2019s mom heaved the basket into the air with a bit of effort, and tilted it over, letting the contents inside pour out and into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tilting basket was like an erratic amusement park ride, the floor dropping out beneath you suddenly and sending you and the dirty lingerie tumbling away. You let out a scream, which was cut off after only a second by a skimpy thong slapping against your mouth, squishing your lips shut. Worse still, the brief sound you did make went unnoticed as Kimberly booted up the electronic washing machine, a beeping jingle drowning out your desperate plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor perhaps a quarter of a second your body was visible, as it exited the wicker basket and fell into the cold, dark depths of the washing machine. In the middle of a waterfall of undergarments, you theoretically could\u2019ve been spotted, had one been paying precise and total attention. Even still, if someone HAD seen you, they\u2019d lean forward and peer into the washing machine in confusion, only to see normal panties and bras lying on top, concealing you underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, Kimberly hadn\u2019t been looking at all. She\u2019d been dialing the washing machine to the \u2018delicate\u2019 setting, and also unscrewing the top from the name brand detergent she used on lingerie. Once the basket was empty, she turned on the machine\u2019s water flow and spin cycle, drizzled in a measured amount of detergent, closed the lid, and grabbed a nearby seat, returning to the good book she\u2019d started earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the now pitch-black machine, you felt the metallic tumblers begin to spin you and the other dirty underwear, slowly at first but quickly gaining speed. As this happened, freezing water rained onto you from above, filling the machine from the bottom like a growing lake. Tangy detergent stung your eyes and overwhelmed your sense of smell. The rumbling of clothing compacted and squished your body even more than before. In minutes, a scary situation literally became hell on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, and your tiny form collided with incredibly the slick fabric of a clothing item of some sort. Your squishy face embedded into the fabric, the rest of your gummy-like body following suit. Your misshapen, flat form adhered tightly to the mystery clothing, and as more wet underwear compiled around you, you found yourself unable to move or reform, held tightly in place. Each passing second crushed you flatter than the moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy a cruel twist of fate, the lingerie you were stuck to happened to drift near one of the water streams of the washing machine. You mentally screamed out as the ice-cold water drenched you, the pounding akin to a waterfall. From the pressure alone, your body smeared and stretched a bit, flattening even more onto the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore noticeably, the application of water triggered the fabric cleansing and protection particles of the laundry detergent. The goop that had drizzled onto your earlier began soaking into your skin as well as the fabric of the lingerie. With a moment\u2019s realization of horror, you felt your squishy body begin binding itself to the clothing, strands of fabric practically weaving themselves into your thoroughly squished skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d experienced this sensation before, but only with other human beings. Occasionally, enough sweat and pressure over time would build up and culminate in your body practically fusing with flesh, not unlike you\u2019d become a tattoo. It was a rare occurrence, and one you could (obviously) be freed from with enough effort and outside help, but this was the first time you\u2019d experienced it with fabric. The laundry detergent was somehow affecting your body, and there was nothing you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the wash cycle ended, the damage had been done. The spinning ceased, the water drained out of the machine, and Kimberly threw open the lid, but your temporary prison had been sealed. Numbly, you tried to do literally anything, and found it impossible. No movement (not even a twitch), no talking, no reforming, no nothing. Even your panicked brain had slowed down. What use was freaking out now? You could only pray for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly took out one clothing item after another, and dutifully tossed them into the open and waiting dryer. Finally, she reached the clothing you were stuck to, as you felt your body lift up into the air. Pressed face first in the fabric, you couldn\u2019t see anything at all. You also couldn\u2019t taste, which was maybe a saving grace. You could still hear and smell though, and what Kimberly said next both concerned and intrigued you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, these aren\u2019t underwear at all.\u201d The titanic woman said aloud. \u201cThese are bikini bottoms. Someone must\u2019ve tossed them in here.\u201d She ran her fingers over the simple but attractive swimsuit bottoms. As it happened, your form was fused into the fabric of the bikini bottoms right at the back of the suit, facing out. Her warm hand passed right over you, without feeling a thing. In her sweeping gaze, she didn\u2019t spot you either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, how could she be blamed? The near-fusing of your body and the fabric of the bottoms meant that your flattened body was nearly imperceptible against the fabric. Not only that, but the bottoms you\u2019d been engrained into were the same tan shade as your skin tone (like you\u2019d failed to realize earlier, almost all the lingerie in the basket was flesh toned). Only the faintest outline of your squashed lower half could be seen, and even that missed Kimberly\u2019s brief inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chances of being found were infinitely small, and that realization was crushing. Someone would have to practically shove their face up to the back of the bikini bottoms and stare intently to see you, then work for well over an hour to free you, hoping that some other twist of fate didn\u2019t mess things up. It was bleak, but you held onto a small kernel of hope, however small. Your fate was currently in Kimberly\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the bikini bottoms, Kimberly quirked her mouth to the side in a motion of indecision. \u201cHm\u2026I guess these don\u2019t technically need to be in the dryer then. I could just hang them up outside\u2026I wonder who they belong to\u2026\u201d She trailed off, unsure. They were stretchy and comfy enough to be Maddie\u2019s, modest enough to be Cassie\u2019s, cute enough to be Sophie\u2019s, and big enough to be her own. Although, her daughters were catching up to her in the size department each passing year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Kimberly\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shrugging, Kimberly tucked the bikini bottoms you were engrained to under her arm and closed the dryer. After setting the dryer cycle to run, she sauntered out of the room, carrying you with her. Passing through the kitchen, she slinked out into the back yard and approached the clothesline strung up beside the pool, perfectly catching the Sun\u2019s rays at all hours of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking two spare clothes pins, she hung the bottoms up on the line, pinching the sides of the bottoms to hold it in place. Unfortunately, this meant that the pins squeezed down on the top of your crushed body, succeeding in both keeping the bottoms stable on the line and holding you in place, further ruining your hopes of reforming any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her job, Kimberly smiled and turned on her heel, walking right back inside the house. This left you all alone, with nothing to do but hang on the line and blow gently in the breeze. Not only did you yourself blend in quite well with the tan bikini bottoms, but the bottoms also fit right in on the clothesline besides other similarly colored bikini tops and bottoms. How was it that your situation just kept getting worse and worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie and Sophie emerged from the kitchen and out into the yard an hour later, you barely took notice of them. You only vaguely heard them giggling as they leapt into the pool and proceeded to race laps and splash each other incessantly. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s melodic voice did little to raise your spirits, especially seeing how much fun she was having. Why wasn\u2019t she looking for you instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you had yet to reenter Cassie\u2019s mind since hours ago when she playfully sat on you in the living room before being attacked by her sisters. With the excitement of being home and spending quality time with her family members, you\u2019d slipped her mind completely, and if Sophie and Maddie kept up the games and laughter for too much longer, it could be a day or more before your safety crept back into her consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you were left to rot away on the clothesline for the rest of the day, the hot sun searing you on the cloudless day that it was. Your entire body was sweating, and you felt your naked skin cry out as it burned. Still, your mute pleas for help were met with another childish squeal from Sophie and a hearty laugh from Cassie. The girls had exited the pool, but your fianc\u00e9e had mischievously bumped her younger sister with her butt, sending her giggling back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses dried off and walked back inside as the afternoon rolled over into evening, soon succeeded by dusk. Not that you could tell with your face rammed firmly into the fabric of the bottoms, but night fell, casting the backyard in darkness. The hours ticked by in near total silence, and you hung listlessly on the line, the clothes pins digging into your head like a ceaseless migraine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you slipped into a restless and uncomfortable sleep, awaking sometime around eight o\u2019clock the next morning. You heard the sound of a mature voice humming, and deduced it to be Kimberly. Feeling the clothesline shaking and jostling a bit, you inferred she was plucking the now dried swimwear free, planning to carry it back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you felt her warm hands grip you a moment later, sliding the clothes pins off and dropping you into a basket by her feet. She still said nothing to you, adding to your recognition of how truly hard you were to spot on the identically toned tan bottoms. A few more bottoms and tops fell onto your body before Kimberly finished, and the titanic woman picked up the basket and shuffled back inside, still humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly dropped off the skimpy rainbow bikini in Sophie\u2019s room, and the supportive black swimwear in Maddie\u2019s, and managed to secretly sneak a barely-there thong into her own bedroom, glad her daughters didn\u2019t catch the act. The tan bottoms you were nearly fused to were revealed once more, and Kimberly was reminded of the dilemma from the previous day. Who exactly did they belong to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning mom!\u201d A bright and cheery voice called from behind Kimberly, and soon Cassie had wrapped her arms around her mother as she kissed her cheek. \u201cPutting the dried swimsuits away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear, but I don\u2019t know who owns these tan bottoms.\u201d Kimberly admitted, smiling at her daughter. \u201cI feel like they\u2019d fit all four of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie leaned closer to the basket, and her eyes lit up. \u201cAh! Those are mine, actually. Well, Sophie technically wore them a day or two ago, but she said they\u2019d fit me better, so I could try them out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly rolled her eyes jokingly. \u201cOh, now it makes sense. No wonder these little things ended up in the lingerie basket. Sophie probably tossed them in without thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right, knowing her.\u201d Still looking at her mom, she reached into the basket and picked the bottoms up, her hand clenching around your body. At the smooth and instantly recognizable feeling of your fianc\u00e9e, your heart leapt skyward with hope, as this change in fate at least put you one step closer to being found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhile we\u2019re talking, did I hear something about you going somewhere with Sophie today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s brilliant eyes sparkled. \u201cOh yeah, the local pool! It\u2019s not too special, really, but it\u2019s a whole lot bigger than our house pool, and they\u2019ve got a few waterslides there!\u201d Your fianc\u00e9e had to catch her breath, occasionally prone to fast rambling when she was excited. \u201cSophie and I will be there all day, tanning for a bit and swimming for the rest.\u201d She rubbed her thumb across your back absentmindedly. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to trying out these bottoms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly rubbed her daughter\u2019s head affectionately. \u201cSounds like a great day. I hope you have fun.\u201d Cassie flashed her mom a thumbs up and took off back to her room. Right as she turned into her room, Kimberly\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAh! Cassie, what about your little squishy\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, and Cassie had already closed her door without hearing a word. Kimberly was taken aback for a minute, having nearly forgotten all about Cassie\u2019s odd little fianc\u00e9. She hardly remembered your name. Jack? Jason? More pressing, it seemed as if Cassie had forgotten about you too, as she hadn\u2019t mentioned you at all in the past sixteen hours or so, and Kimberly hadn\u2019t seen you for that whole time either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe matriarch of the Smalls family was about to knock on her daughter\u2019s door and inquire about you, when she stopped herself. She took a minute to think. Truly, what did your fate matter to her? She hadn\u2019t been too impressed by you doing the first meeting, underwhelmed in your stature and defenselessness. Perhaps Cassie could do with time away from you. Also, for all Kimberly knew, Cassie was totally aware of wherever you were, and content with you keeping to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a decision, Kimberly walked away from the door, assured that Cassie knew what she was doing. And, if her daughter really had forgotten about her small squashable fianc\u00e9, and you were genuinely lost, Kimberly was just fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside Cassie\u2019s room, your fianc\u00e9e slipped out of the simple panties and bra she\u2019d worn to bed. Prone to sleeping nude, Cassie had been so exhausted from the previous day she hadn\u2019t even stripped down. Naked now, the beautiful giantess slid her big breasts into the cups of a stylish tan bikini top, tying the strings around her back. She then dropped the bikini bottoms you were baked onto to the floor and stepped in the holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the bottoms up her long, smooth legs, you felt your body contract and stretch bit by bit as the bottoms passed Cassie\u2019s supple thighs and reached her hefty rear. Bracing yourself as best you could, you just barely heard the muffled grunt Cassie made as she pulled the bikini bottoms out, up, and around her jiggly rump. Letting the elastic fabric snap into place, the bottoms clapped her cheeks tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottoms were a tight but alluringly eye-catching fit, perfectly hugging your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s enviable curvature. They covered just enough of her ass to be called modest, but left enough bare to turn heads for miles. Even the relatively humble Cassie admired her scrumptious booty in the mirror, running her hands along her butt and across your body. Of course, she felt nothing due to hoe flattened and ironed into the fabric you were, but the unexpected still occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d Cassie said flatly. \"That's weird.\" Smack in the center of her booty was a misshapen blob that was distinctly light red in color, contrasting with the normal tan of the bottoms. This was, in fact, due to your own body, which was stretched awkwardly around your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bubble butt. After hours of baking in the burning sun without protection yesterday, your skin had burned light red, which now offset the tan and stood out enough to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really have a way of knowing this currently, with your head still tightly squeezed into the bottoms and about to wedgie into Cassie\u2019s butt crack. And, as Cassie merely shrugged at the odd discoloration and proceeded to slip on her flip flops and head out of her room, you were convinced that you\u2019d truly been doomed to this existence now. The love of your life had failed to notice you, and as her powerful glutes shook you up and down and started to chew at your face, you resigned yourself to the humiliation and torment to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front door, Sophie was already waiting, and she smiled eagerly at Cassie. Holding the door open for her older sister, Sophie let Cassie through and couldn\u2019t help admiring her sister\u2019s great ass, wondering if she could sneak a pic later and post it online. While doing this, though, she glimpsed your misshapen red form, and frowned. Since when was that red mark on her former tan bikini bottoms?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you heard Kimberly speak those words, you immediately tried to think of a way out. Maybe you could sink deeper, maybe she hadn\u2019t seen you, maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Kimberly started shouting, \u201cCassie come here this instant!\u201d She was eying  you with contempt. \u201cYour \u201cwonderful\u201d man has some explaining to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what you were going to let say. You felt like no matter what you said be it a lie or the truth Kimberly wouldn\u2019t believe you. You knew Cassie would believe you at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie hurriedly came into the room wondering what on earth could be wrong. \u201cMom what is it?\u201d she asked as she entered then bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look in the lingerie hamper Cassie Smalls and I think that will be enough to explain the situation,\u201d Kimberly said very sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie knee when her mother called her by name, it meant something had seriously made her upset. She obediently stepped forward to look inside the hamper. She gasped upon seeing you naked in the middle of her family\u2019s dirty underwear. You meekly looked up at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like, I can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie didn\u2019t know what to think. Here was her adorable little fianc\u00e9, her promised man, naked in a hamper  with other womens\u2019 intimate wear. She felt shocked, disgusted, and betrayed. <i>How could he do this to me, she thought</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at the very least he should be punished. I can\u2019t believe he would sneak in here to spy on me,\u201d Kimberly said. You saw that Cassie was slowly nodding her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie I can explain what happened, you see earlier when we were in the chair and you,\u201d you began to explain when Cassie stopped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, unless you accidentally ended up in the hamper, I really don\u2019t see what you can explain! How could you do that? Have you been doing this elsewhere? If you want to make it up to me, then I suggest you just apologize and take your punishment.\u201d Cassie said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned, Cassie had never talked to you that way before. You wanted to argue but felt that if you didn\u2019t do as she asked then you ran the risk of further upsetting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very sorry,\u201d you said meekly, \u201cI will take whatever punishment you think is fit Ms. Smalls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly slowly nodded, \u201cI have the perfect punishment for you Jake. Since you seem to like butts so much, you can spend some time being up close and personal. Now just to decide who will be the punisher and how long it will last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, this sounded bad. Sure you loved Cassie\u2019s big rump, but didn\u2019t want to be squashed by it for an extended period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t think I should do the punishment. He really needs to be taught a lesson and well I would probably take pity on him and let him out early. We are here for the month, and honestly he doesn\u2019t have to be back at the college for the next 4 months. So anytime from a week to 4 months would be fine.\u201d Cassie explained this matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly nodded with understanding. \u201cYes dear I agree you would be far to soft on him. I am happy to give him the punishment he deserves.\u201d With that statement, Kimberly grabs you and slips you into the pair of panties laying nearby before stepping through the leg holes. \u201cI hope the view is great Jake,\u201d she said before pulling the panties up to her titanic ass. You were only able to stare as her panties rocketed up her thighs. Her enormous butt got closer every second until you were smashed into it. She wiggled a bit to get comfortable sandwiching you in between her massive cheeks. \u201cHope this is what you were  wanting, little man\u201d Kimberly said as she smacked her butt cheek making your entire world shake back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly then turned to Cassie, \u201cDear now that he is settled in we should probably decide on that timeframe of punishment. I will let you decide since ultimately he is still currently your fianc\u00e9.\u201d You heard this from deep within Kimberly\u2019s ass. You held your breath as the next words out of Cassie\u2019s mouth would decide your fate. </span></div></div>",

If that was the way you felt, you needed to be punished for a long break time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, if you are fine with it, keep him until it is time for him to be back. I think spending four months being squashed by your butt should teach him a lesson he will never forget! I just can\u2019t believe he would do something like that this, I thought he loved me...\u201d at this point Cassie started crying. She did care about you still but felt as if you had cheated on her. Kimberly squeezed her butt cheeks together, crushing you between them. She felt nothing but disdain for you now. Seeing her daughter cry and coming to more or less the same conclusion as to your intentions, made her want to make the next four months something you would never forget!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there dear, your mother will take care of this,\u201d she again squeezed her ass cheeks as hard as she could making you even flatter in her ass crack, \u201cdisgrace of a man! I won\u2019t let him have a break for the next four months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe what was happening, did Cassie really think you were trying to cheat on her? That was never your intention, you had just panicked and picked the first hiding place you saw! If you could just somehow explain it all to her, then maybe she would change her mind and get her mom to free you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Cassie left the bathroom to go lay down and finish crying. Kimberly decided that she needed to get the chores done and she would make sure to clench her cheeks every chance she could. She could feel your squashed form between her cheeks. If she waited a little while she could feel your body start to pop back into shape. Then she brought her massive cheeks together again and felt your entire body flatten away. It was honestly the most satisfying feeling she had ever experienced! She smiled, at least this was going to be all kinds of fun for her. Who knows, if Cassie stayed this upset she may not even check to see if Jake had been freed after four months. Then she could just decide to \u201cforget\u201d that she had a one foot tall man in her ass, but rather just a very fun toy that used to be a man....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not of course know this was what Kimberly was thinking, all of your thoughts were on trying to reform and get out of the situation you were in. It was hot in here and every time Kimberly smashed her ass cheeks together, the pain was immense! Your form would completely flatten out and you just looked little more than a sticker against one side of her crack or the other. If you could have enough time to reform, maybe you could wiggle out or at least make contact with Cassie and explain what really happened in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that takes care of the wash, really nothing to do now. Should I sit down in my recliner and try to watch a movie, or should I just go relax in bed?\u201d Kimberly pondered what to do. Sitting in her chair would certainly put Jake through more torture, but honestly she could really use a nap at this point. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Cassie out of the room it was back to only you and Kimberly, who at this moment was completely in charge of possibly the fate of the rest of your life. She turned her head over her shoulder and hooked a finger underneath the waistband of the backside of her panties, just barely catching a glimpse of your body already smashed flat into her crack. You could tell by the tone of her voice that she felt a mixture of contempt for you for making her daughter cry, but also some form of amusement at the utter control she had over your entire body with just a flex of her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, I'm going to give it to you straight. I was on the fence about you before but after finding you digging through our lingerie like some little creep I really do not like you. And from the sound of it, Cassie doesn't like you much right now either. With hope she won't change her mind and come back around to wanting you as her boyfriend again. But there's a silver lining!\" You felt the slightest bit of joy in the middle of Kimberly's soul-crushing speech from this sentence, only to have it immediately dashed as she continued, \"But my ass seems to like you quite a bit!\" Kimberly emphasized her statement by fiercely clenching her cheeks together once more before relaxing and looking down on your further flattened form. \"You seemed so eager to get up close and personal with our undergarments mere minutes ago and now you get to be with them for 4 months straight at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted and terrified at how haywire meeting Cassie's family had gone in just one day. In the span of hours you had gone from potential husband to permanent ass tattoo for the matriarch of the family. You prayed that you would get the chance to make your case and explain this whole misunderstanding, but Kimberly was an intelligent woman clearly, and it wasn't likely that she would even give you the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that doesn't mean you get to just relax back there. My backside tends to get quite sweaty over the course of the day, and I'm counting on you to absorb some of that sweat with your body's strange, squishy, abilities. If you can do that maybe I'll consider going easy on you every once in a while, but if you can't then I promise you that your life will be a living nightmare until Cassie forces me to let you out or better even, forgets about you entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your current state you were incapable of responding, but you knew that even if you could Kimberly wouldn't listen to a word you said anyway. Without another word she let her underwear snap back into place and walked towards her bedroom to slide on a pair of tight leggings to lounge around the house in. The elastic material immediately compressed her mountainous cheeks together and doubled the pressure on your body as you could only mentally cry out of helplessness. Throwing on a shirt as well, Kimberly then proceeded out of her room back down to the tv room where her beloved recliner laid. It was nearly twenty years old with daily use from the large, curvaceous woman, and it showed. The brown leather had been permanently stained a shade darker in the shape of two large globes right on the cushion. To some they would consider such signs of wear and tear a reason to simply buy a new chair, but to Kimberly they were perfect. Her ass had beaten the chair into submission, it conformed over years to her exact curvature and was now the epitome of comfort. As Kimberly hovered her ass over the chair she imagined you succumbing to the same fate as this piece of furniture and smiled from ear to ear. Imagining you, beaten down and bullied by just her rear end until you were permanently and perfectly shaped to support it. The mere thought made brought joy to the next few months she would get torturing you. It was just an added bonus that she was avenging her beloved daughter's feelings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly finally grabbed the tv remote from a nearby end table and dropped her ass into a free fall onto the cushion beneath her. With an audible smack that practically echoed throughout the house she plopped her massive form onto the recliner. She could just barely feel the last bit of 3D that your body had left be obliterated with this action and she sighed with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this truly your fate or will someone or something intervene?</span></div></div>",

You were required to clean the sweat from her crack every day. You were not given any tools but expected to use your body only. You hoped every day that Cassie would have a change of heart and free you from her mother\u2019s gigantic ass, and every day you were disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after a week of being trapped, you heard Cassie talking to her mother about how you were doing. Kimberly gave  her a glowing report of how nice it felt to have you in there, how you squirmed and moaned about how huge her ass was, and how she made sure to completely squash you every day. Cassie only replied with, \u201cWell glad that you are getting enjoyment out of doing his punishment. I thought it might have been a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared, and tried to wiggle out to shout at her. Kimberly felt this and immediately smashed her huge cheeks together, completely flattening you in her dark sweaty crack. You tried to move again but there just was no possible way you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never heard Cassie mention you after the first week. She left the house to go back to the college three weeks later, leaving you at the mercy of her mother. The next three months were a constant barrage of being squished by her cheeks while she walked, crushed every time she sat her enormous ass in her recliner, and absorbing sweat and farts at all times. Kimberly was very pleased with your performance. Her panties never seemed to get soaked by ass sweat since acquiring you. She had no plans on ever letting you leave her ass crack. You were her one and only ass slave.  Made just for her to be used to bring whatever comforts she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly though, as much as she wanted to just keep you, still respected her daughter enough to agree to her terms if she wanted to. At the four month mark on the dot, Kimberly called to check on her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello dear how have you been?  .... Well that is good! I have been doing very fine what with having Jake around to keep my butt feeling good. .... You remember dear, your little fianc\u00e9 you brought here four months ago? .... That\u2019s right! I was just calling to see if you wanted to come back and get him, if I should just peel him out and let him walk off, or you know just not bother letting him go? .... Oh I see dear, I understand! Well let me let him know and I\u2019ll talk to you later! Love you!\u201d Kimberly hung up the phone with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m glad she is doing so good at school!\u201d She then turned her attention to her ass and the little man within those cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Jake, great news! Cassie said...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You were amazing at soaking up her sweat and just generally being a pleasure for her ass. However, Kimberly believed in keeping a bargain and the terms were you were to be trapped for four months and Cassie hadn\u2019t gave her the ok to keep you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost an hour for Kimberly to peel your flattened form from her ass crack. Being in there month after month had basically made you a flat squishy liner for her titanic crack. She sighed as you finally came free and set you down on her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Jake, I will let you reform here. Please just let me know when you are headed outside ok?\u201d Kimberly instructed you. You did you best to nod your head, but could only manage to blink your eyes rapidly. Kimberly nodded her understanding and then turned to walk away. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at her magnificent ass as she walked away and felt a strange feeling.... were you missing being in there? Surely not! It had been hot and soft and crushing and sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was very confused and rightfully so. You had not really known anything outside of Kimberly for the last four months. Honestly you had started to get used to being in between those cheeks and now felt a sense of emptiness. \u201cIt would be nice to be back between those huge cheeks...\u201d you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your thoughts tuned to Cassie. She was the woman you had fallen in love with. She was kind, beautiful, and you missed her as well! It would be nice to see her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another hour, your body had finally popped back into shape. You stretched your muscles and unsteadily got to your feet. The goddess\u2019 ass had really done a number on you... You caught yourself thinking of Kimberly as a goddess and sighed. \u201cPull yourself together Jake! It is time to get ready to leave.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Kimberly walked back into the bedroom as you were finishing stretching. She sighed seeing that her favorite toy was looking more like his old self. She thought for a moment and then an idea came to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake, one last thing before you leave. Well it is more of an offer really. I really could use you around here. Specifically as my ass slave! The last four months were as a punishment, but you now have a choice to become my willing slave. You could spend the rest of your days being my useful slave. I must say, I never felt like my panties ever got soaked form my booty sweat when you were there. It is just something I am offering Jake, since I am such a wonderful woman!\u201d Kimberly said all of this as sensually as possible, swaying her hips with each sentence. This had the desired effect of making you seriously consider her offer. You could have the control of choosing to be her ass slave! The very thought excited you as you looked at her swaying hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly followed your gaze and smiled. \u201cHere Jake, if you want I would be glad to help!\u201d With that statement Kimberly turned her butt to face you and pulled her waistband back giving you a great view of her gigantic ass and the colossal crack just waiting to consume you once again! \u201cIt is totally up to you! If you would like to choose to be my slave, then hop on in. I guarantee that you will, never, ever,  leave it again,\u201d Kimberly made sure to draw out the last sentence with as much sexiness as she could. You felt everything in you screaming to submit yourself to this lady and never have free will again. A small part of your mind still told you to do the logical thing and return to the love of your life. It was having a hard time competing with the gigantic naked butt swaying back and forth though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally came to a decision and,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your jaw slowly drops as you helplessly watch Kimberly's broad, jiggly backside sway back and forth and back and forth. Mesmerized, you slowly take a step forward, and then another, drawn to the seemingly infinite abyss between her voluptuous cheeks like a moth to a flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly lets out a delighted giggle as she watches you take your first steps towards your future. \"Thaaaat's it, Jakey. Give yourself to my big bum. That's a good boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told she had been devastated when her daughter first introduced you to her. And now, she can no longer imagine life without you. She had been angry when she first found you inside of her dirty underwear, of course, but also thrilled. Watching you struggle so desperately against her dirty laundry had awakened a sexual fire within her, one she thought had extinguished ever since her husband left. Her heart had leapt in joy when her daughter agreed she could be the one to punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you had been just what the doctor ordered. Watching her daughters bring home their boyfriends and fianc\u00e9s, and not having them respond even the slightest to her own playful flirting at the dinner table, had started to make her feel inadequate and old. There wasn't anything quite like feeling a man half your age struggle helplessly in your ass to make yourself feel sexy and confident again. Whenever she focused, she had felt your every single twitch and wiggle for freedom, and had delighted greatly in mercilessly crushing these futile tokens of resistance underneath her. She had been surprised at how easy it was. Simply putting some extra sway in her step, or grinding herself against her seat, had proven more than enough to grind down even the most desperate of your struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dreaded this last week with you, silently praying Cassie would allow her to keep you. She had tried to convince her daughter that you were beneath her, that she could do so much better, but her eldest unfortunately still loved the pathetic speck residing in her bottom. Her last hope had been for you to break underneath her powerful glutes, and it seems four months of relentless squashing by them had done just that. You were clearly way too weak and pathetic to deserve even the most remote chance with her daughters or herself, but had to admit you also weren't entirely unhandsome. Her ass would be a perfect fit for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie would be heartbroken, of course. Kimberly felt a familiar anger boil up within her again at the thought. Even with her angelic daughter giving you a second chance, you just immediately threw it away to your perversions again. Hopefully telling her that her fianc\u00e9 chose a life as her mom's buttslave over a life with her will finally wake her up to the fact that you never deserved her. And any pain your actions cause her daughter, she'll make sure her behind pays back tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little bit further Jake,\" she hisses lustfully, eagerly anticipating being able to watch you disappear between her cheeks for good. \"Just a couple more steps and and you'll finally be where you truly belong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lumbered forward, your body on autopilot, unable to resist the siren-call of Kimberly's voluptuous behind. You felt like a fool, four months wasted struggling against the inevitable while you could have spent them servicing this goddess' divine backside. You step into the shadow of the glorious buttocks, the perfect pair now lazily resting on top of the dresser. They bulge out towards you, parting slightly underneath the matriarch's weight as if trying to show you where you need to go. You extend a trembling arm to their surface. It felt warm, soft, and welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They missed you, Jake. They thought they'd never get to feel you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I'm sorry,\" you mumble, tenderly bracing your lips against the doughy cheek. You hesitate for but a moment before you abandon all restraint, wantonly making out with the slab of maternal buttmeat in a way that rivals your steamiest evenings with Cassie. You relentlessly push yourself deeper into its springy surface, wishing, praying that it could just swallow you up and never let you go again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgetting the other one~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately correct your error, throwing yourself on top of the neglected cheek to correct your mistake. Kimberly fails to suppress a laugh as she watches you paw at her butt like a wild animal, doing your best to coat every inch of it with your affection. If Cassie saw you like this, she would never want to take you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. Now prove yourself as my ass-slave. Climb inside of my ass and make love to my back door. Show me you understand that even the lowest part of me is so far above you, it deserves nothing less than your life-long devotion. Beg me to lock you away inside my bum, and to never let you out! Convince me that your only desire in life is to be accepted as a butt-toy to a woman almost twice your age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly found herself panting, having to exercise every single bit of self-restraint she had to stop herself from just pushing you inside of her. She could feel her pent up arousal soak through her panties, but she didn't care. If they started to bother her, she'd just order her new slave to lick them clean before throwing them in the wash. With an eager moan, she reaches back, spreading her cheeks before her future plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embrace your future as nothing more than a plaything for my rear-end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had inexplicably stopped, hotdogging the middle-aged housewife's buns with your entire body. You tremble at the feeling of her glutes softly hugging you, wanting to push deeper into those gorgeous mountains and feel them envelop you from all sides. Still, there's a niggling though in the back of your mind. Cassie. You could have a future with her, instead of her mother's divine rear-end. Maybe you could convince Kimberly to just take you on as an ass-slave in the weekends? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen perfectly manicured fingers descend from the heavens, each one tipped with a nail dyed in a beautiful deep purple. The gently push you backwards, digging themselves between the magnificent cheeks before you to separate them in a single fluid motion. Your jaw drops as Kimberly's crack slowly widens before you, seemingly bottomless as the infinite sea of her buttflesh parts before you. Eventually they stop, allowing you the faintest glimpse of her hot, sticky anus puckering in their depths. The massive walls of maternal assmeat darken the deeper they go, small drops of sweat clinging to their surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour goddess' booming voice made you shiver with anticipation. This was it, your life's true purpose. Everything had led up to this point. Your small height, your malleable body, all blessings to make sure you would fit Kimberly's divine rear perfectly. Even the love of your life was nothing more than a guide to help you find your true destiny: her mother's gorgeous, sexy bum. You tremble as you step into the valley of her behind, gently tracing your fingers across the firm, warm walls as you slowly make your way deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly ground her thighs together in a futile effort to stave off her lust, her fingers digging deep into her cheeks to stop them from diving straight into her sopping wet cunt. She eagerly moans as she feels your hands trace against one of her cheeks as you continue your journey, desperately humping against her dresser. Not long now. Just a little more. Any second now she'd feel your face against her exit, and then you were hers. A soft bubbling from deep inside her guts briefly interrupts her fantasies, and she quickly bites her lip to stifle a moan at the deliciously naughty way she now planned to introduce you to your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had arrived before Kimberly's gorgeous pucker, the tight muscle immaculately clean as it softly pulses. The atmosphere this far up her backside has turned tropical, your nose being flooded by both the familiar smell of her ass as well as a much muskier scent that leaves you panting like a botch in heat. Her panties feel absolutely soaked, your feet squishing noisily through the thick, clear liquid covering them. You stare lovingly at the gently puckering starfish, the winking orifice being easily the most beautiful thing you'd ever seen next to Cassie. Your half-lidded eyes widen as you remember the love of your life. Cassie! She-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anus before you suddenly shuts tight as it slowly bulges outward and then gently relaxes, allowing itself to casually yawn open, blasting you point-blank with the stench of Kimberly's colon. The hot, airy expulsion of gas instantly envelops you, blowing away all thoughts of Cassie as the odor of the matriarch's bowels fills your lungs. It smells heavy, earthy, natural, motherly and welcoming. It had smelled like home. Without a second thought, you throw yourself head first into the pucker, ravenously lapping away at the closed muscle in a desperate attempt to find more of the wonderful scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Kimberly shudders as she finally feels you seal your fate. She carefully releases her two buttcheeks, allowing her ass to claim its new plaything. She saunters back to her favorite recliner, giving her rear a bit of extra sway as she walks. Her smile only broadens as she can already feel her glutes start to pummel your body into submission with every step she takes. She had grown familiar with the feeling, yet it was somehow different. Previously you were being punished, but now you had fully given yourself to her ass as its willing toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sat back in her favorite recliner, closing her eyes to better focus on the tiny thing tucked away in her bum. She slowly rolled her ass from one side to the other, grinning as she feels you squish and flatten beneath her bit by bit. She took great care to leave your face and arms intact, for now, allowing them to tenderly stroke and caress her from deep between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just felt... right to have you underneath her. Cassie would understand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It only took you a few seconds to realize what had happened to you by the time you regained consciousness. Your full vision was darkness, meaning you were stuck face first against something. Half of your body could feel slick and stretchy fabric, while the other half felt smooth and warm skin. You also kept rhythmically bouncing up and down in a predictable pattern, which was clearly walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck to Sophie\u2019s ass, no doubt about it. Apparently, half of your flattened form had stuck to her bikini itself, while the other half of you was glued to her right butt cheek. Your second clue was the heat of the sun that began to shine down upon you as Sophie headed outside. The third clue was Sophie\u2019s lilting, happy-go-lucky soprano voice ringing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis! Have fun shooting!\u201d Sophie cheered in the direction of Maddie, who\u2019d taken up position on the other side of the back yard at a half basketball court. Maddie flashed her a confident thumbs-up and expertly sank her first shot into the hoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie laid out a fresh towel on a table by the pool and kicked off her flipflops. Squaring up in front of the pool, the blonde giantess ran her body through some stretches, squatting, flexing her arms, and bending at the waist to touch her toes. If Maddie had been watching, she\u2019d surely have seen your poor body on Sophie\u2019s booty as she bent over, but the athletic girl was far too engrossed in her basketball practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Sophie leapt into the pool with childlike glee, splashing down and displacing an eruption of water. The water hit you like a brick as her butt slapped into the water, and the cool temperature overwhelmed the hot and sweaty nonsense you\u2019d endured back inside a few minutes prior. It stung at first, but soon began to cool you down and relax you just as much as the curvy girl who\u2019s behind you were glued to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sophie started kicking her legs around under the water, her bubble butt shook back and forth in a rhythmic manner. You hoped this would shake you loose, but all it ended up doing was nauseating you as her flesh jiggled in slow motion in the water of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you did begin to notice though was the downside to the particular bikini Sophie was wearing on this day. It\u2019s stretchy material was stylish and certainly cute, but it was that same stretchiness that was slowly causing the fabric of the bottoms to wedge themselves in the blonde giantess\u2019 butt crack. The movement of her own glutes was pushing her swimsuit further into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not go unnoticed by Sophie, who stopped lazily paddling around the pool and frowned. Wading over to the shallower end of the backyard pool she picked aimlessly at her ass, halfheartedly trying to pull her bikini back out from between her fleshy cheeks. While doing so, her manicured nails hooked around your squishy body, painfully pinching into your back, but also succeeding in ripping you free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately jumped for joy, only for that joy to fall apart seconds later. Sparing you a split-second look, Sophie didn\u2019t instantly recognize your flattened form in her hands, grimaced a bit, and tossed you nonchalantly over her shoulder. Your brief chance at being noticed as now gone, but fate was clearly on your side as you landed right by the edge of the pool, instead of the much more dangerous alternative of falling into the water once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on your back, your squished face staring straight up into the sun. The bright sun burned your eyeballs, but you merely had to deal with the agony for the moment, as your paper-thin eyelids couldn\u2019t close currently without reforming. Eyes welling up with tears, you willed yourself to reform back to normal as quickly as possible. As your arms and legs inflated incredibly slowly, you even contemplated jumping in and joining Sophie for a swim after getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a moment later, Sophie\u2019s angelic voice spoke up, demanding your attention. \u201cOh my gosh, I totally forgot to take a cute swim selfie!\u201d You heard her let out an infectious giggle, and then the sounds of her splashing and pushing herself through the pool as she drew nearer. For some dumb reason, you didn\u2019t think anything of this, still confident you were a minute away from reforming and joining your future sister-in-law for some fun in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour na\u00efve optimism lasted all the way up until Sophie entered your vision, her eyes locked on the poolside table behind you, and not you. As she grew larger and larger, she turned around, presenting her smooth back to you. Her hands slammed down onto the edge of the pool on either side of you, and with a cute exertion of effort, she hoisted herself out of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer delicious derriere filled up everything you could see as it rose out of the pool, water cascading down her skin. The light shone off her supple skin beautifully, and you felt your fear being overcome by a mix of awe and slight attraction, which was quickly disregarded. Cassie was the one for you, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the awe gave way to renewed fear as you noticed that Sophie\u2019s bikini had once more ridden up, bunching into a wedgie at her butt crack. As such, the sides of her bottom were pulled in, baring much of her bare, tanned ass cheeks to the world. You tried to scream out to her, only to realize with an additional pang of horror that your mouth was still thoroughly mashed shut. You could do nothing to get the oblivious girl\u2019s attention as her ass became your whole world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in one day, Sophie\u2019s right butt cheek claimed your body as its own, her attractive but hefty weight slamming you flat in an instant. Your body crushed and folded in on itself, your face mashing into her soft flesh. Unlike last time, your body had been compressed into a misshapen blob only a few inches across, and as Sophie stood up, you felt yourself easily go with her, your skin already sticking to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to rub your fate in even further, Sophie was bothered by her swim suit yet again, and pulled the bikini out of her crack with slight annoyance. That simple act was all it took for her bikini to snap in place against her ass over top of you, pressing you in tightly to her butt and also hiding you from sight to the outside world. You could no longer even hope to reform, let alone move or talk with the pressure of her tight bikini holding you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs happy and unaware as ever, Sophie skipped over to the table where she\u2019d laid down her phone. Her butt bounced as she moved, tossing you and her flesh up and down but not with enough force to push up her swimsuit again and expose you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing a brilliant smile and angling the phone to catch her beauty as best as possible, Sophie snapped three different poses of herself and posted them all online to her followers. While she was up, she took the opportunity to reapply another layer of sunscreen on all of her bare skin. She also looked over at Maddie, who threw one more shot into the hoop before strolling over, drenched in sweat and downing a water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis!\u201d Sophie said cheerfully. \u201cYou did awesome, from what I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie shrugged. \u201cYeah, pretty good. Not my best, but not a total waste. Still aiming for that perfect score.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s totally you!\u201d She giggled and tossed her sister a towel, only for Maddie to throw it right back. Your blonde captor frowned. \u201cUh\u2026what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s smile grew. \u201cI could do with a better cooldown than a towel, Soph. Think I can join you in the pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie beamed, the vision of beautiful innocence. \u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019d love it!\u201d She then noted her athletic sister\u2019s attire. \u201cUh\u2026good thing no guys live anywhere around our block.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026except for Jake, but he\u2019s still inside, right?\u201d Maddie asked. \u201cI doubt he\u2019d mind if I hopped in the pool with my sports bra and compression shorts. He\u2019s a pretty cool dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie bit her lip. \u201cHe\u2019s a cutie for sure, but do you think Cassie would like him to see you dripping wet in a sports bra and shorts that are skin-tight and kinda see-through when wet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s cheeks flushed ever-so-slightly. \u201c\u2026that\u2019s fair. But, like I said, he\u2019s inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie moved to put Maddie\u2019s unwanted towel back on the table, only to accidentally miss and drop it to the ground. Rolling her eyes at her own clumsiness, the energetic girl bent down to retrieve the fallen towel, and fate once more tempted you. As had happened twice already, Sophie\u2019s bikini rode up her butt, wiggling into a wedgie, and you were revealed to the world again, the hot sun warming you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie glanced at her sister for a second, catching only the briefest glimpses at your flattened, blob-like body adhered to Sophie\u2019s right butt cheek. Most of your human features had been smeared or blended in closely to Sophie\u2019s own skin tone, so you didn\u2019t even register to Maddie. Maddie simply hopped into the pool and basked in the relaxing cool waves washing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Maddie was a much smarter girl than her proclivity towards sports and physical activity suggested, and she HAD seen you, even if she hadn\u2019t recognized you. Brushing hair out of her face, Maddie whipped around to check out her sister\u2019s ass once more, her gaze zeroing in on your smooshed form. She frowned in confusion and concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Sophie stood up with the towel in hand, set it down, and as was becoming her habit, picked at her bikini bottoms, yanking them out from their wedgie and stretching them back around her sizable rear. You were lost in darkness yet again, invisible to the world. You began to wonder just how long this humiliating fate was going to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sophie slipped back into the pool, Maddie looked at her and spoke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sophie brushed her wet hair out of her face, giggling and smiling brilliantly. Her pretty face shone so much that it could light up the whole world, but Maddie hardly noticed. Staring at her sister, Maddie simply could not get the image of the flat tan blob stuck to Sophie\u2019s right butt cheek out of her head. The more she thought about it, the more it struck her how similar that little blob was, both in skin tone and size, to the cute tiny fianc\u00e9 she\u2019d just been introduced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her sister\u2019s thoughtful look, Sophie titled her head in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Maddie? What\u2019cha thinking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie chewed her lip. \u201cHey Soph\u2026I think you\u2026uh\u2026sat on Jake.\u201d She said quietly, still unsure of the conclusion her mind was making. Sophie seemed similarly unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe little cutie? He\u2019s inside, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sophie inquired. Glancing behind herself, she stared at her bubble butt, her view warbled and distorted by the water she was now mostly submerged in. On top of that, you were once more hidden by her skintight bikini. \u201cI don\u2019t see him. Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Maddie admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019d still like to check. Can you climb onto the edge of the pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Sophie saluted comically, and turned back towards the edge of the pool. Hoisting herself out of the water, she leaned forward onto the concrete surrounding the pool and jutted her shapely rear out towards Maddie. \u201cCan ya see the little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie waded closer to her sister, and peered intently at her curvy posterior. The brown-haired giantess frowned, gazing at Sophie\u2019s flawless skin and adorably revealing bikini. \u201cUh\u2026no, I don\u2019t. Could\u2019ve sworn he was\u2026\u201d She paused, and an image of Sophie adjusting her bikini flashed into her mind. \u201cUh, gimme a sec.\u201d Maddie explained, as she gently pinched Sophie\u2019s bikini and peeled the stretchy swim material back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, you were once more revealed to the world, though you couldn\u2019t tell that from your own perspective. Your world was nothing but hot flesh, cool water, and darkness, pressed firmly face first into the youngest Smalls daughter\u2019s doughy butt cheek. Regardless, Maddie spotted your mashed, tan form immediately. You were hardly recognizable as human, but your skin tone contrasted with Sophie\u2019s just enough, and she could also make out a crushed hand and foot, as well as one of your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026yikes.\u201d Maddie winced. \u201cYep, he\u2019s definitely here. You did a number on him, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sophie shrilly exclaimed, violently flinching. Her frantic motion pulled the bikini bottoms from Maddie\u2019s fingers, and they snapped back against Sophie\u2019s jiggly cheek, slamming into your body and hiding you once more. You were jostled as her gelatinous cheeks wiggled and shook, and could only barely hear Maddie\u2019s muted cry of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSophie?!? What the heck!\u201d Maddie exclaimed, forcibly grabbing her sister\u2019s shoulders to calm her down. \u201cHe\u2019s still stuck, stop shaking around and let me get him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, right. Sorry.\u201d The bubbly blonde said, taking a deep breath to steady herself. \u201cH-how did he get stuck to my butt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie shook her head as she pried back Sophie\u2019s bikini again. \u201cNo clue, Soph. We can ask him once I pull him off and he reforms, or however that works for him. Cassie told us he was squishy and resilient, so he\u2019s probably fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the athletic giantess began picking at your body with her nails, trying to get a hold on you to scrape you free. Her fingers danced across your body and Sophie\u2019s cheek as she attempted to pry you from the blonde\u2019s flesh. Sophie, meanwhile, bit hard into her lip and tried to quell the spasms in her body as Maddie worked, every little touch from her sister tickling her like mad. It was all she could do to not burst into laughter and spastic movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Maddie swore under her breath and leaned back, having made no progress in freeing you. Years of intense exercise and sports-playing had worn Maddie\u2019s nails down suitably flat and unobtrusive. However, she could not fit her short, dull nails between your body and Sophie\u2019s flesh because of this. Also, still soaked with water, Sophie\u2019s flesh was slippery and moist, and Maddie\u2019s attempts to peel you free only squished Sophie\u2019s thick cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Sophie stayed still when Maddie pulled back, and only looked over her shoulder. \u201cD-did you get him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He\u2019s stuck super tight. It\u2019s damn annoying.\u201d Maddie seethed. \u201cHe\u2019s stuck tight to your butt; you can hardly even feel a difference between him and your own skin. The biggest problem is that my nails aren\u2019t sharp enough to pick him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! I can do that!\u201d Sophie shouted, flourishing her own well-manicured and long nails. Before Maddie could respond, the blonde giantess reached behind her blindly, her hands slapping against her butt. \u201cWhere is he, huh? I can\u2019t feel him? I can totes peel him off, but I can\u2019t find him!\u201d She mindlessly rubbed her hands over her right cheek, and Maddie almost choked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s aimlessly wandering hands kneading her butt cheek like dough, squeezing into her squishy flesh as her misguided attempts to feel you escalated in intensity. Her soft hands jammed into your body, pushing you into her globe-like cheek. Her roaming fingers jabbed into your back and pushed you forcibly tighter and tighter against Sophie\u2019s cheek, and as she scrubbed across her cheek in search of you, she inadvertently ground your body under her palm, smearing your blob-like form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Maddie snapped out of it, and slapped Sophie\u2019s hands away. \u201cWhat the hell, Sophie! Stop making it worse, I just told you that you can hardly feel him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie blushed, her thoughtless actions finally dawning on her. \u201cOh\u2026uh\u2026sorry Maddie.\u201d She apologized, smiling sheepishly. \u201cJust trying to help\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her voice was a bit muted from your perspective, you still caught her words, and were mildly alarmed that she\u2019d apologized to Maddie instead of you. Honestly, she\u2019d only mildly inconvenienced Maddie, but had painfully ground YOU into her own butt. You were still trying repeatedly to reform, but any small progress you\u2019d made had been undone instantly by Sophie. Honestly, you felt even more squished than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie frowned deeply, a hint of worry genuinely written on her face. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026even harder to see now. I used to be able to make out a hand and foot, but now I can only tell it\u2019s him because of his one little ear that isn\u2019t all\u2026gross and smudged.\u201d Maddie looked her younger sister in the eye as Sophie glanced backwards. \u201cHonestly, he\u2019s nearly fully blended in with your ass, Soph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s blush deepened. \u201cW-well, we can\u2019t leave him there! What if we head inside and try to, like\u2026I don\u2019t know. Rip him off with a towel, or use the vacuum. Something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie nodded. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a great idea. Yeah, let\u2019s head inside and\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! CAN I JOIN IN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie froze mid-sentence, and Sophie\u2019s eyes went wide with terror, as a familiar, friendly voice called out from behind them. Turning to face the source of the voice, they saw big sister Cassie standing by the backdoor, clad in an eye-catching blue two-piece bikini. She had on sunglasses and a towel was draped over her shoulder. Wasting no time, Cassie slid the door shut behind her as she walked towards them, a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stammer out something to say, Maddie slid back from Sophie to try and appear less conspicuous, letting the blonde giantess\u2019 bikini snap back into place. The tight swimwear crashed into you, constricting every inch of you and hiding you from sight. Seconds later, water flooded over you, as Sophie slid herself from the ledge and back into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026actually Cassie, we were just about to\u2013\u201d Maddie started to stammer out, but Cassie waved her off with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, come on Maddie!\u201d Cassie laughed melodiously. \u201cYou can spare a bit of time, right? It\u2019s been literal years since we\u2019ve swam in a pool together.\u201d Tossing her towel and sunglasses down onto an empty chair, Cassie stepped down into the pool, sinking all the way into the water and then emerging like a goddess, the water cascading down her perfect body. \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun, just the three of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYep yep. J-just the three of us!\u201d She giggled, her voice a bit shaky, but Cassie didn\u2019t seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie took a second to splash under the water again, Sophie and Maddie shared horrified looks. Without speaking, they made a unified pledge to not say a word about what had happened to you. They were genuinely worried that Cassie would react with anger and distrust, and didn\u2019t want their first day reunited with their big sister to end with sadness or mean words. Fearing the worst, they silently pledged that, in no way could they let Cassie figure out what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the two sisters made a mental vow to keep your humiliating and frequently painful position on Sophie\u2019s butt cheek a secret from Cassie, and then find some way to free you later in the day. Surely that would be a perfect plan, and in no way would Maddie\u2019s fun-loving and competitive nature, or Sophie\u2019s carefree and airheaded attitude mess that up. As far as Maddie and Sophie were concerned, at this exact second in time, you were safe in their capable hands\u2026or Sophie\u2019s curvy derriere, to be more precise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had no idea how much time passed until you regained consciousness again, and it was immediately clear that your situation had hardly improved. Everything around you was dark, and you could feel your face still firmly pressed up into a giantess\u2019 ass. From the slight shifting and moving of your body it was also clear that you had been ripped from the seat cushion and taken with\u2026whoever it was as they walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, you noted that the tight and sizable butt squeezing against your body was more firm and toned than the supple cheeks of your fianc\u00e9e or energetic Sophie. The fabric your squishy body clung to was also definitely not jean shorts, nor a flimsy bikini bottom and bare flesh. There was also a distinctly hot sensation on your back complete with a light breeze of wind, signifying your captor was now outside. Obviously, it was Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie hustled over to their house\u2019s half basketball court. There was one hoop and then a wide cement court around it. The brown-haired girl took a second to adjust her hair and stretch her arms before scooping up her trusty basketball into her arms. Across the yard, she spared Sophie a friendly wave, and rolled her eyes as the exuberant blonde dramatically fell backwards into the pool. She then resumed her solo ball practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triple giantess stacking had been hell, but this was hardly better, you quickly realized. Maddie raced from one end of the court to the other, battling imaginary defenders and weaving around, scoring basket after basket. Her powerful glutes pushed against your body as her compression shorts constricted, her cheeks bouncing up and down before clenching again. You shook uncontrollably, unable to even attempt to orient yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what little clear headedness you possessed, you tried to peel yourself off of Maddie\u2019s compression shorts, but to no avail. The assess of the Smalls sisters had truly dominated you thoroughly, and you were exhausted of all energy. You could only hang limp, squishy body nearly ironed into the fabric of her shorts, as Maddie obliviously tore back and forth across the court, having the time of her life. The cool breeze had been a brief relief, but now the hot summer sun was baking your skin, and recoating you and Maddie in sweat and stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a voice called out. \u201cHey, hot stuff! Work those legs!\u201d The voice, possessing a playfully flirty intonation, rang out from somewhere behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie stopped moving, shot another quick three-pointer, and turned around. Her begrudging smile was already growing on her face, knowing full well who it was that had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAria, can\u2019t you start any conversation normally?\u201d Maddie sighed, gesturing to the mystery girl as she approached. Face planted firmly into her rear end, you couldn\u2019t quite see who this mystery girl (apparently named Aria) was either, and could only try to listen to their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormal?\u201d The new girl, Aria, smirked. \u201c\u2018Normal\u2019 isn\u2019t really my thing, cutie. I prefer\u2026\u201d She paused, and then you suddenly felt a smooth but forceful hand smack with into your body, pressing you even more against Maddie\u2019s butt. \u201c\u2026SPONTANEITY!\u201d Maddie\u2019s butt shook from the impact of the slap, as did your own body, and you nearly threw up as your world jerked, Maddie spinning hastily away from Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cARIA! Please, not when my family\u2019s around!\u201d Maddie cried, her voice wavering and her cheeks blushing. Although she feigned annoyance, it was clear that she was fighting to not smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria laughed, a melodic and mischievous sound. \u201cImpulse is my middle name, Maddie, and pranking is my game.\u201d She looked over Maddie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAdorably lil Sophie didn\u2019t even notice, the ditzy child. Besides, what\u2019s a best friend to do when you\u2019re looking like such a snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie choked on her next words, and her face grew even brighter red. Dropping the conversation, she turned on her heel and retrieved her basketball. Aria\u2019s contagious laughter echoed across the yard. As Maddie bent down to pick up the ball, her shapely rear jutted out from her hips, curved cheeks stretching the compression shorts and your own body to their respective limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also at the exact moment that Aria\u2019s wandering gaze passed over the strangely unsymmetrical design of her best friend\u2019s shorts. Maddie\u2019s shorts were two thirds black, and yet oddly tan over her left cheek. Biting her lip in confusion, Aria casually wandered closer to Maddie, who\u2019d gone back to shooting hoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s with the funky clothing design?\u201d Aria inquired, standing behind Maddie. \u201cIt\u2019s not an awful look, but doesn\u2019t scream \u2018you\u2019 to me. Ya know? It doesn\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m a gorgeous girl with a toned body that drives my best friend wild, but I always wear boring colors.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gave her an exasperated look over her shoulder. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Aria? My shorts\u2026are\u2026\u201d Maddie looked down at her own backside, and finally noticed your misshapen tan body hugging her cheek. Her brow furrowed for a minute, before being replaced with a mix of guilt and horror. \u201c\u2026oh shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria gave her a coy look. \u201cOne of Sophie\u2019s compression shorts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie winced. \u201cNo, I somehow sat on Cassie\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Geez, I did a number on the poor dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor perhaps the first time in her life, Aria Oliveira was utterly speechless. Completely floored, Aria only looked up at Maddie, then back at your squished body, then back at Maddie. \u201c\u2026uh, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie dropped her basketball and began scraping at your flattened head, her nails just long enough to being peeling you from her ass. With an audible and gross \u2018slurp\u2019, your sweaty frame ripped away from Maddie\u2019s slick shorts, and you dangled in Maddie\u2019s hand, blowing in the breeze. It took a minute for your eyes to adjust to the blinding light after the past thirty minutes in darkness, but finally your vision cleared. Standing before you was the face and body to match the voice: Aria Oliveira.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aria was a stunning knockout, with no other way to properly describe her. Long and flowing chocolate brown locks framed her sensual facial features, plump lips, hazel colored and almond shaped eyes, and a cute nose. Her skin tone was a brilliant bronze, and you finally made the connection between her appearance and her slight accent and deduced she was of Brazilian descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit prominent, and perhaps befitting of her flirty attitude was Aria\u2019s outfit of choice. Her tight red crop top was cut to reveal nearly all of her cleavage, and the majority of her stomach. Her wide hips and large butt were hugged tight in form-fitting short shorts that appeared to be a size too small for her. Thick thigs traced downward followed her long legs and feet in simple red flipflops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie cleared her throat and shook you a bit for emphasis, wiggling you in the air. \u201cSee how it looks like a little man? Well, it is. Uh\u2026HE is, I guess. He can just be squashed and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria flicked her eyes onto your face, then back up to Maddie. \u201c\u2026okay, sure. So you sat on him for fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie blushed. \u201cWha-NO! It was an accident. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d She walked over to a small bench and set you down. \u201cLet\u2019s just let him reform, and he\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReform\u2026uh huh.\u201d Aria tore her gaze away from you slowly. \u201cSo, uh\u2026what were you doing. Just some practice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls stumbled back into normal conversation, you thanked the stars above for your lucky break and focused on reforming as quickly as possible. You had sustained absurd punishment back in the living room, and knew it would take a few minutes at the least to grow back to 3D. You could only hope that Maddie and Aria would be distracted long enough for that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, right as that thought crossed your mind, disaster struck. A strong gust of wind blew across the yard, chilling you to the bone. Maddie and Aria relished the cool breeze, their hair fluttering in the wind, but you almost screamed as you felt your paper-thin body lift up from the bench and flutter into the air. With your lungs still crushed flat, you could only silently yell as your body helplessly spun out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breeze died out shortly, and the lack of wind dumped you onto the concrete basketball court right near where Maddie and Aria had begun taking turns shooting hoops. Aria was awful at it, but her unfaltering laughter and occasionally playful flirting kept the mood light and their spirits high. You didn\u2019t know quite how to interpret their relationship just yet, but any further train of thought down the line died as soon as Maddie decided to back up for her next throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill too mangled to move or scream, you were powerless as the titanic giantess backed up right into you, dirty sneakers slamming onto your battered body. The treads in her shoes and her full weight above you squashed you flat again, undoing any progress you\u2019d made so far. Maddie, of course, didn\u2019t feel a thing, her mind way too focused on basketball. She merely lined up her shot, jumped in the air, and threw the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ball went in, but you barely cared. All you saw was the wholly terrifying image of Maddie leap above you, seem to float in the air, and then crash back to the ground. Her sneakers pounded against your body with relentless savagery as she landed, mercilessly squeezing your squishy body into the very cracks of the pavement. Your whole body ached with the pain and the pressure, and you silently begged for help. Sadly, Maddie stayed put atop your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly you received that help from a different source. Aria, never one to shy from staring at Maddie, had clearly seen you fall onto the ground. Before she could speak, she had watched her best friend trample over you, and then stomp onto your body after her jump. Frowning, she wondered why this supposed \u2018squishy fianc\u00e9\u2019 was being treated so callously, until she caught Maddie\u2019s eye and realized the brown-haired athlete was oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria rolled her eyes. \u201cNice shot, and nice job trampling your squishy little man, or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie paled and looked down at her sneakers, seeing nothing. Sliding her feet apart and revealing your face, Maddie felt her knees go weak. Of course, she also didn\u2019t realize that moving her feet like that unintentionally scraped her soles across your body, harshly grinding at your malleable body and caking half your face in dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake!\u201d Maddie exclaimed, stepping off of you and squatting down. \u201cHow did you even\u2026god, man! I\u2019m so sorry dude! I thought you were safe on the bench.\u201d She apologized, scraping at the corners of your body to peel you up. Sadly, you were pretty ground into the cement, and she couldn\u2019t succeed in pulling you free. Panic for her, and you, began to sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering over, Aria knelt down. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d She said, slipping her manicured and long fingernails between your thin and pounded body and the concrete court. Her word choice concerned you, but you were still thankful that she was helping, and soon she had you peeled free and fluttering in her hand. \u201cAlright, I saved your\u2026now super dirty and sweaty\u2026toy. What do I do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie grabbed you from her a bit roughly, crumping your head in her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s not a toy. He\u2019s Cassie\u2019s husband-to-be, Aria. And he\u2019s a chill guy. I think you\u2019d like him, so be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria put her hands up defensively. \u201cChill, Maddie. Calm down. I\u2019m sorry. Just let it\u2026the dude\u2026\u2018reform\u2019 somewhere safe this time, okay?\u201d Her tone of voice clearly indicated disbelief in your true existence, but that intonation went over Maddie\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie ran a hand through her slick hair and walked over to a water cooler lying on the ground by the court\u2019s edge. Atop the water cooler was a small and damp wash cloth, probably set aside earlier by Maddie for her convenience. A bit carelessly, Maddie dropped you on top of the water cooler, so you feel right beside the damp wash cloth. With an almost detached sense of dread, you noticed how tan colored the cloth was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e\u2019s athletic sister took a few deep breaths and filled a cup from the water cooler, downing the liquid refreshment in a single gulp. She then leaned against the cooler and locked eyes with Aria. Lazily, her hand rested on the top of the cooler, right hand resting atop your body, and unknowingly keeping you just pressured enough to not reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird, ya know? Cassie coming back with a one-foot tall dude? I guess he\u2019s attractive, and funny, and nice. I\u2019m super happy for Cassie.\u201d Maddie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know though. Seems like he lives a pretty terrifying life, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d cope if I was responsible for accidentally doing something horrible to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, her fingers outstretched and curled around your body. Those fingers slowly squeezed, tightening their grip, and soon you were lifted off the water cooler and into the air. You fought with every bone in your body to twitch and wiggle in Maddie\u2019s iron grip, but you were simply too squished and defeated to protest. All you could do was see Aria out of the corner of your eye, the Brazilian beauty watching you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria never took her eyes off of you as Maddie lifted you off of the water cooler. Aria didn\u2019t stop Maddie from speaking either, or alert her to what was going on. She merely tried to hide her growing smirk, especially after what unfolded next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes fully on Aria, and totally wrapped up in her mini rant, Maddie began wiping her arms with your body, slapping your face into her biceps and scrubbing you up and down her skin. Naturally absorbent and malleable, your body picked up every bit of sweat and dirt from your future sister-in-law, even as your body screamed at being squashed and rubbed in this way. That didn\u2019t stop Maddie from moving onto her long legs next, wrapping you around her toned thighs. It certainly didn\u2019t keep her from shoving your head back against her tight ass, the stench and swampy sweat totally overpowering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her focus on talking and looking at Aria, Maddie had completely confused you for her little wash cloth, and so oblivious wiped down her entire sweaty body with your own body. She rambled on the entire time to Aria, unaware of what she was inflicting upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Maddie drew to a close. \u201cSo, anyway\u2026that\u2019s it. I\u2019m thinking I can win the free-throw tournament at the park next weekend.\u201d Maddie paused. \u201cWere we talking about something else?\u201d Aria bit back a laugh and shook her head. Maddie shrugged. \u201cHuh. Alright, anyway, give me a sec.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped your limp body back onto the cooler and walked away. The basketball had rolled quite a way from the court after Maddie had thrown it, so she was going to retrieve it. With Maddie out of earshot, Aria crept over to the cooler and grinned down at you, mischievous and alluring eyes twinkling. Your dazed mind barely registered her though, to worn out physical and mentally from scrubbing down all the grime and yuck from Maddie\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria plucked you up, wincing only slightly at how soaked in sweat you were. She noted your tired face and giggled. \u201cCredit where credit is due.\u201d She murmured, absentmindedly stroking your body. \u201cThis little squishy toy does look like a little dude. Still, Maddie should know by now that I\u2019m the pranking master, and a little gooey toy isn\u2019t going to freak me out. Love her enthusiasm though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria Oliveira considered herself a master of pranking, and hardly went a day without trying to pull one over on someone. Her pranks were always lighthearted and playful, if a bit flirty, and Aria was mischievous to no end. If someone pranked her back, she considered it the biggest thrill in the world, and now she was floating on cloud nine after perceiving the events of the past fifteen minutes as one big prank. Brand new prank ideas sprang to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing at you gleefully, what does Aria do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an outrageously perfect smile on her face, Aria stared down at you pondering how she could prank her best friend back. Maddie was quite a bit away still retrieving the ball as Aria's mind went through various possibilities. Just then, a light bulb flipped on in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it, this stuff feels so weird I'm going to put it in her shoe so she gets all grossed out when she puts it back on! It's simple yet effective!\" Still looking at you, her eyebrows lifted as she chuckled slightly, \"I don't know why I'm saying this out loud instead of just thinking it, it's not like you can hear me! Sheesh, a one foot tall man? Yeah right like I would believe that for a second.\" Just then Maddie came back dribbling the ball towards her friend. Aria spun around, hiding you behind her back as she spoke to Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maddie I think you should probably take your shoes off and retie them! Sometimes that helps me feel like my shoes fit better when I do that!\" Immediately Maddie seemed slightly suspicious at the suggestion from her usually mischievous friend, but after thinking about it for a moment she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea, Aria. I guess I will!\" Maddie quickly walked over to the bench near the water cooler and Aria, sitting down and unlacing each shoe individually. She slipped them both off, wiggling her toes in her long, black, athletic socks. Aria sat down beside her, pretending to take out her phone and browse some sort of social media, but secretly she was slyly reaching for Maddie's well-worn, right basketball shoe. In a flash she reached in and yanked the insole out of the bottom, grimacing as she felt the moist fabric between her fingers. She nearly gave up on the plan upon having to feel her friend's foot sweat, but there was no turning back now. She brought your body out from behind her back and dropped it immediately into the awaiting sneaker. Face up, your head must been somewhere towards the front as you were staring at mostly darkness, with a slight light beaming in from the opening away from your vision. The atmosphere in there was immediately damp, with a thick fog of sweat practically obscuring your vision. You cried mentally, wishing that for once in your life meeting someone new didn't end up with them causing you torment in one way or another. But in reality you honestly couldn't blame her for not believing you were a person, as bad as that sounds. Nobody else in the history of the world had been fully grown at one foot tall, let alone with a body made of some unidentified malleable material. Interrupting your existential crisis, Aria placed you back down secretly, right as Maddie reached for the shoe that contained you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up off the ground, she deftly laced the shoelaces through the eyelets. Then, the moment you feared, Maddie's large foot filled the space in the opening and blocked out any remaining shred of light that flowed into your prison. You felt the heat rocket up even higher than it already was as her foot squeezed into the opening. The ball of her foot made contact with your face, pressing down onto you firmly even before the shoe was on the ground. Immediately though, Maddie tied her shoe up completely, making sure it was extra tight to prevent any possible ankle injuries while playing. This unfortunately meant her foot squeezed into your now insole form more than ever. And once she slammed her foot onto the court below, the torture increased greatly. She took a few steps, squeezing sweat out of her sock and raining down onto your form below. You were in hell in your current situation, meanwhile Maddie was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Your tip really did help! My shoes feel way better now! Especially this right one for some reason! It feels like it somehow got way more comfortable! Thanks, Aria.\" Maddie said to her good friend. You couldn't hear a word of this conversation from your shoe prison, but above in the realm of regular people Aria was perplexed. She was hoping that Maddie would take one step on top of your gummy form and be totally grossed out, but somehow it seemed like she was thankful for the prank Aria just pulled! Not knowing how to respond, Aria meekly said, \"Uhh, yep, no problem!\" Maddie immediately picked the ball back up and dribbled over to the free throw line. Aria stood up and walked over as well, preparing to get the rebounds for her friend as she often did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie squared up her feet, aimed at the basket, and in one fluid motion swished the free throw. Aria caught the ball out of the bottom of the hoop and passed it back to Maddie as she repeated the motion. Swish yet again. Once more they repeated it, and the outcome was the same. The duo repeated this act 27 more times, each and every time resulting in a perfectly made free throw. The duo of girls began to feel even more and more shocked, Maddie especially. She had always been a good player, but by some stroke of luck she was absolutely on fire at that moment. Meanwhile, every motion drove her feet further and further into the ground beneath her, squelching your body beneath her hefty right foot. A few minutes later as Maddie sunk her 30th free throw in a row, she finally paused to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Aria, what is going on right now!? If I shoot like this I'm going to win the free throw competition hands down!\" Maddie exclaimed giddily before continuing, \"What's causing this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria, who admittedly had nearly forgotten about her squishy prank entirely, finally had her memory flood back into her brain upon hearing Maddie's question. She responded, \"Oh! I put that gooey little toy into your shoe while you weren't looking as a prank! I thought you would feel it and freak out but you didn't at all! Turns out it made a pretty good insole, huh? And a super lucky one at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's heart absolutely sunk upon hearing her best friend's words. She had been playing with her future brother in law inside of her shoe for multiple minutes now. Feeling incredible guilt about pressing her entire weight onto his body she immediately shrieked and sat down on the concrete, unlacing her shoe and ripping it off. Reaching in with her hand she found an edge of your body not cemented into the fabric of her shoe and managed to rip you clean out of her sneaker. Now looking at your body, it had been beaten down into nearly the exact shape of her other insole, not to mention turned slightly gray due to the influx of black fuzz from her socks mixing with her own foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jake, I'm so sorry I had no idea you were in there!\" Maddie said to you as your eyes adjusted to the light and saw her panicked face. She continued, \"Aria! Jake is literally a person, not a toy! Just give me my old insole back and put him on the bench then wait! He'll turn back into a human shape you'll see!\" Aria, now beginning to believe her friend's story due to the genuine panic she saw in her face, obliged, and traded you for her original insole. Maddie immediately placed her old insole back into her shoe and put it back on, taking a moment to sadly realize how much less comfortable her shoe was. Meanwhile, Aria placed you on the bench on the side of the court and sat down next to you, looking at you for a moment before turning back to Maddie. Trying to take her mind off of the torture she had just caused, she picked the basketball back up and lined up at the free throw line once again. Squaring up she shot the ball once more... and bricked it. Running to get the ball herself she tried again, and missed. Repeating the motion time and time again it seemed Maddie had utterly lost her touch, and was now practically incapable of making a shot. Meanwhile, you were slowly but surely reforming, watching Maddie miss repeatedly on the court. Aria's eyes were now locked onto you with her mouth open in shock, watching what looked like an insole slowly transform into a miniature human. A few more minutes passed and you finally unstuck your arms and legs from the rest of your body, as well as pried your mouth open, and you had finally gotten back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maddie had stormed back over to both of you in an annoyed huff. She softened for a moment upon seeing you, saying, \"Sorry again, Jake, I'm glad to see you're okay.\" Focusing her mind back on basketball she continued, \"But what the heck happened to me! I was on fire a few minutes ago, now I can't buy a single make! If I shoot like this I'll get dead last in the free throw shooting contest!\" Aria seemed to have come to terms with you being a real human finally as she seemed capable of talking once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean the only difference is that... you took the toy, err, Jake out of your shoe.\" Aria said matter of factly. The three of you paused and looked at each other. You had yet to see this side of Maddie but deep in her mind her competitive instincts were slowly overwhelming all other common sense in her brain. You could tell her mind was running quickly as she processed the information Aria had just given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at Maddie, the brown-haired giantess towered over you, her shadow cast ominously across your body. Normally, you\u2019d be worried about her sitting on you, or any other such freak accident. This time, however, your gaze was locked purely on her face. The thoughtful and fiery expression on her face filled you with fear, and it seemed as if she was seriously considering a certain plan of action you wholeheartedly disagreed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s eyes glinted with a steely look of determination, but there was some clear internal conflict going on in her mind as well. The athletic girl began chewing on her lip, eyes flicking between you and her best friend. Concerningly, her gaze seemed mostly focused on your body, and not your own eyes, like she wasn\u2019t quite seeing you as the human being that you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria wasn\u2019t helping matters in the slightest. Her befuddled face after discovering that you really were a real person had been replaced with excited enthusiasm, bouncing in her seat like a little kid. Her mischievous smile and playfully twinkling eyes had returned in full force, and she looked expectantly between Maddie and yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, Maddie ran her hands through her hair. \u201cNo, nope. I can\u2019t ask that of you, Jake.\u201d She kicked at the ground and folded her arms across her chest. Aria hopped off of the bench and sidled over beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, Maddie, hey!\u201d Aria cooed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a coincidence! Squishy here\u2019s your lucky charm, girl! You can\u2019t turn this down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie glared at her best friend. \u201cHis name is \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria waved her off. \u201cYeah, yeah. Listen\u2026deny it all you want. You were a goddess of the court with that dude in your shoe. You want to win the free throw competition? Drop him back in there, and play your heart out. It\u2019s only for a few hours\u2026tomorrow, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie winced. \u201cYeah, three hours in my sweaty, smelly sneakers? I don\u2019t think Jake would like to be crushed like that for so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe playful giantess smiled coyly. \u201cYa sure? A little dude like him, pressed up against your feet for some nice, intimate playtime? Doesn\u2019t sound so bad to me.\u201d Maddie flushed and stammered, trying to retort. Aria only laughed melodically. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that the cutie might be into it! He certainly wouldn\u2019t turn down the chance to help out his future sister-in-law, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired athlete chewed her lip more thoroughly than before and looked over her shoulder at you. You hadn\u2019t heard a word of their conversation, and so you simply spared her a happy wave. Taking one more look at Aria, Maddie let out a deep sigh and nodded in silent agreement to her best friend\u2019s plan. She walked back to you, missing the huge grin on Aria\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jake\u2026I\u2019ve got a weird request\u2026to m-make.\u201d Maddie said shyly, her normally extroverted and confident personality faltering. \u201cWhen you were\u2026uh\u2026in m-my shoe, I did really, really well. When I took you out\u2026I sucked.\u201d Clearly embarrassed, she avoided eye contact with you. \u201cI think you might be\u2026a good luck charm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201c\u2026ooookay? Where is this leading?\u201d You began to feel a shiver coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie twirled a loose strand of her hair. \u201cM-maybe\u2026I could put you back in? For the competition tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled. \u201cBack in your shoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-just for a few hours! Your good luck rubs off on me, and I can win the free throw competition! We\u2019ll kinda be like a team!\u201d Maddie splayed her hands. \u201cHonestly, I just need your help to win. I don\u2019t care about the trophies and stuff, I just have to prove to everyone that I can do this. Without the recognition\u2026I just feel worthless, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, I get that. I understand you, but \u2013\u201d You began, but were cut off by Aria pushing between Maddie and you. Maddie was confused, and you were slightly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria grinned, ever the cheerful girl. \u201cGive us a second, love.\u201d She teased, gently pushing Maddie away and lightly touching the Smalls girl\u2019s ass. While Maddie blushed, Aria knelt down in front of you, and flashed you a huge grin. In a whisper, she continued. \u201cHelp a girl out, Squishy. She really wants to win, and you\u2019ll have some fun too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but willingly being squashed like that is \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUN!\u201d Aria loudly proclaimed, slamming her fist down onto the bench and pulverizing you in one terrifyingly unexpected second. In the blink of an eye, your body crunched down into a flattened pancake accordion-style as Aria pounded the bench with her hand. You didn\u2019t even get out a single word of surprise before you\u2019d been reduced to a gummy-like lump, your face frozen in a look of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie wandered back to the bench, oblivious to what had just occurred. Aria peeled you off the bench and stood up, proudly dropping you into Maddie\u2019s awaiting palm. Maddie quirked her mouth to the side and looked at Aria intently. \u201cHe\u2026agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria scoffed. \u201cUh, of course. He was ecstatic for the idea! A chance to help you win the competition, AND spend quality time hanging out with you? Two-in-one bonus! He even said it was going to be so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie frowned, but fought to keep the corners of her lips from curling up. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine it\u2019s that much fun\u2026for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTelling ya! The little cutie likes this squishing stuff.\u201d Aria giggled, and Maddie\u2019s frown faltered into a full-on grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracing a finger along your face affectionately, Maddie beamed down at you. \u201cYou have no idea how much this means to me, Jake. I\u2019ll never forget this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to one knee, Maddie slipped off her right sneaker and peeled the dirty, worn insole out from the shoe. She then lowered you into her sneaker, pressing your body down into the heel of the shoe. Using three fingers she pulled and twisted on your malleable body, stretching your top half out so that you filled up the entire confines of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squishy face was dragged all the way to the deepest reaches of the toe section of her sneaker, while the rest of your upper body and arms made up the middle area of the shoe. Worryingly, your flattened crotch was exactly where Maddie\u2019s heel would be, but it was apparently far too late to let anyone know that now. Maddie contorted your squashed body to fit in as her new insole perfectly, and you could already feel trace remnants of sweat adhering to you. This was to say nothing of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie carried her right sneaker over towards the back door of the house, and placed it down on the ground. She also slipped off her left sneaker and laid it beside the one you were trapped in. Bending down, she retrieved her sweat cloth from earlier and stuffed it into the sneaker, filling up the space inside and pressing down on your flat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, so\u2026uh\u2026Jake\u201d Maddie cleared her throat. \u201cThe competition is early tomorrow morning. Seeing as how it\u2019s nearly 6:00 PM right now, I figured you could just stay in my sneaker all night and be ready for when I put\u2026uh\u2026you on in the morning. Maybe you could get accustomed to the shape you\u2019re in, and it won\u2019t be so bad tomorrow. The cloth is just to keep you from reforming\u2026otherwise I\u2019d have to reshape you all over again tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking, Maddie!\u201d Aria laughed, patting her friend on the back. \u201cSpeaking of, I should run back home. I\u2019ll definitely be here bright and early tomorrow for the competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Maddie smiled, giving her best friend a long hug before parting ways. Aria sauntered out of the yard and back towards her own house, but not before giving her friend\u2019s worn sneakers a last, mischievous look. Maddie headed inside and straight towards Cassie, knowing she\u2019d need to distract her older sister for the next few hours until bedtime so Cassie wouldn\u2019t worry about your mysterious disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, that left you to lie out in your cramped confines, squishy body contorted to be the perfect insole in Maddie\u2019s smelly old sneaker. The sweat cloth pressing down on you certainly did it\u2019s job keeping you crushed and unable to reform, though you\u2019d hardly made out a word Maddie had said in her little speech earlier. Most of her words had been muffled. Context alone let you know you\u2019d be here for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was still reeling over what Aria had done. You\u2019d wanted to help Maddie, of course, but the squashing and crushing had deterred you. Still, Aria had slammed you down without a thought, and lied to Maddie about your welcoming compliance. Fun, she\u2019d claimed you had said. Nothing about this was fun, and you firmly knew now that Aria and her unceasing desire for pranks and mischief spelled trouble for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to do but sit in silent darkness, you slipped into sleep an hour later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the morning came, you had no idea, stuck as you were in total darkness and silence. Your only clue was the most obvious, as the sweat cloth was removed from the sneaker, and a streak of sunlight shone through. That sunlight was immediately replaced by the sight of Maddie\u2019s foot, clad in what frighteningly appeared to be the exact same ratty and sweaty black socks from the previous day, slink into her sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot settled onto your body, squeezing the very life out of you. The sole of her right foot pressed down onto your chest, and her toes wiggled excitedly, dancing across your face and repeatedly slamming into your eyes. Sure enough, her heel also dug painfully into your crotch, and as soon as Maddie took a single step, your body cried out in aching pain, but there was nothing you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above you, Maddie\u2019s muffled voice spoke. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get up so early for this, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bubbly voice giggled, indicating it was Sophie. \u201cWhat? And miss your little basketball thingy? No way! I totally support you, Maddie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Soph.\u201d Maddie replied, giving her energetic sister a hug. A third voice spoke up, sing-song voice hiding a hint of playfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should see your sister on the court, Sophie.\u201d The third person, Aria, laughed. \u201cShe tears it up out there, especially with her\u2026little good luck charm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie blushed and looked down at her right foot. Truthfully, she\u2019d almost completely forgotten about you, her mind fully focused on the upcoming competition. She was now acutely aware of your presence under her foot. Sophie, though, was totally unaware. Maddie hadn\u2019t told anyone in her family what she\u2019d done with you, for fear of embarrassment from Sophie, disappointment from Kimberly, and anger from Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling away from the house, the park where the competition was being held was only a few blocks away. The breeze was chill and the air crisp, beams of sunlight streaking through the thick clouds of early morning. Sophie skipped along happily, Maddie walked methodically, trying not to put much pressure on her right foot, and Aria trailed behind, admiring her best friend\u2019s short shorts clad posterior, and also peering intently at Maddie\u2019s right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the park, Maddie found about twenty other people were there for the competition, and thirty others aside from them were there to watch. Signing up at the registration table, Maddie noted that she was being slotted into the last placement, meaning she\u2019d be the final contestant up onto the court. It put all the pressure on her to win, but it also meant she\u2019d know exactly how much she had to score to take home the trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe competition began, and the first participant walked onto the court. Aria and Sophie took a front row seat, but Maddie was too wired up to sit, and stood the whole time. Of course, this meant you had to suffer beneath her full weight for over two hours as every other competitor in the free throw competition took their turn. The temperature in your sneaker prison steadily rose, and Maddie\u2019s foot began to dump buckets of sweat onto you, while her toes mercilessly tapped against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Maddie\u2019s turn. An intimidating blonde girl had scored 49 points a few rounds back, just one shot shy from a perfect showing. Maddie wiped sweat from her forehead and gulped, knowing she\u2019d need a flawless attempt to reach 50 points and take home the win. Stepping out onto the court, she looked back briefly at Aria and Sophie. Aria blew her a kiss and Sophie waved her arms excitedly and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in spite of her stress, Maddie took her first position and grabbed the basketball. Steadying her nerves, she bent at the knee, pushed up off of the concrete, released the ball\u2026and sunk it right into the net. Sophie cried out happily from the front row, and you cried out miserably as Maddie landed after her toss, right foot slamming onto hard pavement and crushing you even flatter than you already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the next ten minutes of your life. Maddie, a vision of beauty and athletic superiority, absolutely blew the competition out of the water, sinking ball after ball into the net with ease. Each throw was perfect, her precision flawless, and her form enviable. Maddie began to laugh, Aria and Sophie were cheering wildly, and even the tough-looking blonde nodded appreciatively as Maddie drew closer and closer to surpassing her score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one suffering was you, and you had hardly endured torment like this in your entire life. Maddie\u2019s foot, drenched in a waterfall of sweat, had formed a swamp of horror inside of her sneaker. Your body was coated in layers of sweat and caked in dirt, not to mention covered in fuzz and partially stained grey from her dirty socks. The sweat was sticking you to her shoe, and the intoxicatingly horrid smell overwhelmed your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last hurrah, Maddie nailed the final shot and scored 50 points. She let out a triumphant cry, and everyone in the stands, including the blonde girl, cheered with her. Racing onto the court, Aria and Sophie embraced Maddie, who was laughing and pumping her fist. The competition runner handed her a massive, glimmering trophy, and she posed for a snapshot that would be in the next day\u2019s local paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the excitement of the crowd died down, Maddie led the way back to the Smalls house, clutching her trophy and grinning from ear-to-ear. Riding the high of her triumph, Maddie gushed about how exhilarated she felt, and her vindication at proving she was capable of winning. Sophie basked in her sister\u2019s radiant energy, and Aria relished a tight victory hug. Upon reaching the house, Maddie kicked off her sneakers unceremoniously by the door, and the three girls headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Maddie\u2019s right sneaker, you struggled to reform as soon as Maddie removed her foot, only to find yourself entirely unable to so much as twitch. Her foot had totally demolished you over the past couple of hours. Coated in sweat and filth, you couldn\u2019t even blink. Little did you know, but Maddie\u2019s foot had also partially smeared and mangled your body, blurring some of your recognizable human features. You didn\u2019t even know if you could get free without someone\u2019s help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, someone finally approached and lifted the shoe, thrusting you into the air. Unable to see from your blurry vantage in the toe section, you strained to hear who had picked you up, and prayed that they\u2019d free you from this nightmarish experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it, and what do they say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A brief moment of silence passed as you concluded your apparently uproarious story, at least it was according to Sophie. It was always a bit of a pain to hear that some girls found tales of you being utterly decimated and squished funny, but you had learned to keep your head up with this kind of stuff. And at the very least making the Smalls family laugh must mean you were winning them over! In your moment of thought you saw Kimberly take out her cellphone and begin typing away at something on her screen. It seemed she must have worked rather quickly through whatever she was doing as she flashed a beautiful smile before putting her phone down and addressing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!...and Jake. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you this but I had a trip planned for us and we leave tonight!\" Kimberly exclaimed with genuine enthusiasm. You were taken aback slightly as you were hoping to get a feel for where your beautiful fiance grew up, but you weren't in any position to be negotiating canceling a trip that Kimberly already had planned so you stayed silent. Looking up at Cassie you could tell that she felt an inkling of confusion as well. But once more the family dynamics pretty much determined that whatever Kimberly said was law, so she kept her mouth shut as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow no freaking way that's so cool! Where are we going!?\" Sophie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell yeah I hope it's somewhere way with crazy weather, I heard training in different climates makes you a way better athlete.\" Maddie said, indicating her own enthusiasm in her own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, mom! Tell us all about it!\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could chime in, Kimberly responded to Cassie and continued, \"Well, it's funny Jake told that story about the beach because we're going to the world famous resort Atlantica!\" As soon as the words came out of Kimberly's the whole room practically erupted in excitement, save you and Cassie who shot you a sympathetic look. In reality, Atlantica had everything you could ever hope for in a vacation destination all wrapped up into one package. It had picturesque beaches, a fully staffed and functioning spa, even an amusement park with both water slides and roller coasters. To the average person it was a dreamland, but you couldn't help but feel fear imagining all the chaos that could ensue with this group of women you had hardly met in a place like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly continued to say, \"Even better, now knowing Jake's special, erm, condition, I transferred his ticket over to our neighbor, Irina so now she can come along with us!\" A look of confusion swept across the room at what Kimberly just said. Preempting the questions she was about to receive she continued, \"Relax, Selena is more than capable of looking after Persephone for the week that we are gone, and the plan was my idea so I don't want to hear any complaints about you wanting to bring other people!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Maddie closed their mouths, as it seemed each of them would have preferred to bring one of their own friends on the trip as well, but it didn't seem to bother them too much. Cassie, on the other hand, was perplexed at the fact that her mom had just given away your ticket so hastily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Jake needs a ticket just like the rest of us? I don't understand why you took his name off of the reservation.\" Cassie showed genuine compassion for you in that moment, and you blessed her heart for it. She truly did see you as an equal and a partner more than any other girl in the world, but to everyone else the answer that Kimberly was about to give was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cassie, no offense to you or you, Jake, but I did just cover his entire body with my foot earlier today. If we gave him his own seat there's no guarantee that a regular sized woman wouldn't assume it was empty and end up utterly squashing him under her rear. I mean, who do you think needs an entire seat more, Jake, or Irina?\" You had yet to meet this Irina that Kimberly was going on about, but from the looks on the Smalls' faces you assumed she too was yet another large, curvaceous lady. Kimberly's words shocked you with how blunt she was being, and she added on, \"One of us could easily sneak Jake onto the plane on our person somewhere without security finding out, or you could even just pack him away in your suitcase with the rest of your things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH mom Jake is not a thing, he is a person!\" You could feel the pain in Cassie's voice as she argued on your behalf, obviously torn between her desires to appease her mom and her love for you. Kimberly responded quickly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, dear, of course I am terribly sorry he is not a thing.\" Now turning her gaze downwards towards you, stuck in the literal  middle of this conversation without having a say, Kimberly shot you the briefest of looks that indicated seriousness. \"Now Jake, I'm sure you understand more than anyone where I am coming from. Again, no offense, but you can get seriously beaten down by women without them even feeling you. I mean like, squished flat as paper.\" Her emphasis on this intimidated you further, as she continued, \"So for that reason you don't mind being our little stowaway for this trip, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was running a million miles a minute. Not only were you about to be forced to face your fear of the beach head on, but in order to get there you were either going to have to be smashed, worn like clothing, or packed away in a suitcase along with a bunch of clothes. You desperately wanted to rebuke this insane suggestion from Kimberly, but you just couldn't find the words to do so. Spurning the ideas of your future mother in law seemed like a one way ticket out of being able to take Cassie as your wife. So, dejectedly you responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right, Kimberly. That makes total sense and it's a great idea. I wouldn't mind giving up my seat to your friend one bit. We can figure out some way to get me there just as easily.\" You feigned confidence in your words, looking up at a rightfully unsure Cassie before shooting her a thumbs up as well. Looking back at Kimberly you saw a smile on her face that you honest-to-god could not tell if it was of genuine happiness or a sense of victory. At that exact moment, however, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up from her seat, Sophie ran to the door and opened it. From your position on the coffee table you could just barely see the statuesque woman standing in the doorway. She was a sight to behold to say the least. Her black hair was freshly cut into a stylish yet functional bob cut, and blue eyes contrasted with her radiant, tanned skin. As she gave Sophie a hug she continued walking in, closing the door behind her, and at this point you finally were able to take in this woman's immensely curvaceous body. In all honestly she looked quite similar to Kimberly, her curves standing out from her body in an almost unbelievable fashion. Her overwhelmingly large breasts must have weighed more than your entire body, each, as they strained the fabric of her low cut purple blouse. And somehow, her butt managed to make them look small. The bottom of her ass flesh pushed its way out underneath her indecent mini-skirt, while the remainder of it that somehow stayed contained within the fabric of this tiny garment looked like it was about to tear each and every seam that held it together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but take in the sight of this goddess-like woman, but shaking your head out of its stupor you knew that no matter how stunning she may be, she didn't hold a candle to Cassie in your eyes. Now out of your brief trance, you chuckled as you thought about just how many beautiful, curvy women seemed to surround you no matter where you went in your life. You definitely weren't about to complain about this fact, however. Irina continued her trot towards the group, and yourself, and everyone jumped up to greet their neighbor and good friend. You actually shouted out hello at the exact moment that the rest of the Smalls family did, but their regular-sized voices vastly drowned yours out. Irina flashed a beautiful smile at the reception and went to greet each woman individually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she did so, she swung her heavy suitcase up into the air. You had less than a second to process what was happening but you recognized the dire situation far too late. Irina's bag swung like a pendulum upwards... then downwards right onto the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD* the suitcase landed heavily on the wooden furniture. The rest of the women paid no attention to this thoughtless act, caught up in the moment of hugging their neighbor. You, however, were once again obliterated underneath something that outweighed you tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so great to see all of you girls! I always keep a suitcase packed just for situations like this and I ran over here as fast as I could. Atlantica wooooo!\" Irina exclaimed excitedly. From what you could hear through the pounds of fabric it sounded like Irina was a genuine fun-loving person, much more so than Kimberly at least. And her energetic attitude radiated to the rest of the Smalls family. She continued, \"Now where is this fiance I have been hearing about!?\" Cassie looked downwards only to see the large, purple suitcase of her neighbor before her eyes went wide with shock and realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly five minutes later you were back to sitting on the coffee table, Irina now squeezed onto the couch with Cassie. The hips of the two girls threatened to fill every available inch of space between the armrests, granted the majority being taken up by Irina. Nevertheless you kept this fact in your mind and made a note never to watch a movie with too many members of this curvy group of girls at once. She was bent over you, mouth agape and eyes transfixed onto you. This position revealed a literal chasm of her cleavage to you, and you had to try your absolute hardest not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*to be continued*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uhh yes, of course I am a real human being just like you.\" You responded. Irina had been firing multiple questions at you from the second she had discovered you flattened to the underside of her large suitcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, and you survived my heavy bag flattening you because...?\" She continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body is naturally squishy and malleable so no matter what happens to me I'll always pop back into shape... eventually.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, and you got these powers because of like a chemical spill or something? Like a superhero?\" Irina added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, while I'm flattered you would label me as a superhero, I have actually been like this since birth! Doctors and scientists studied me a lot when I was a kid but nobody could figure it out!\" You responded back up to her. You had been labeled a lot of different things in your life thanks to your stature, but it wasn't often that the label was something positive rather than the usual rotation of shrimp, pipsqueak, toy, etc. Because of this you didn't mind the incessant questioning. That plus the view of her canyon-like cleavage hovering no more than a foot away from you kept you sufficiently entertained. Of course, you still thought of your fiance as far and away the most perfect woman in the world, but that didn't mean you were incapable of at least acknowledging the radiant beauty of a woman like Irina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the past few minutes, Maddie and Sophie had ran upstairs to pack as quickly as possible for this surprise trip. Now it was only you, Cassie, Irina, and Kimberly left seated in the living room waiting. Kimberly had of course already packed, and Irina had as well, with her bag that you had been introduced to already. As for you and Cassie, neither of you even had enough time yet to unpack which worked out in your favor so you were ready for the trip as is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Irina's questions finally lulled, a moment of silence overtook the room. Kimberly seized the opportunity to speak once more, saying down to you on the table,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well now that introductions are out of the way, I believe we need to figure out the logistics of how we are going to get you on this plane, Jake.\" Turning around to face her, she continued, \"The way I see it there are a few options. You could either ride inside Cassie's suitcase, inside of her socks under her feet, or in her pants.\" Both you and Cassie blushed furiously at the matter of fact way Kimberly was speaking, talking about things like you literally getting in her daughter's pants. \"Each comes with its respective pros and cons, of course. I assume you are familiar enough with each situation after the life you've led to know what they are, yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Kimberly talked so nonchalantly about you being confined in Cassie's suitcase, squashed flat underneath her foot, or squeezed tightly between her ass cheeks was startling to say the least. It seemed like when it was convenient for her, Kimberly had grown quickly accustomed to viewing you as nothing more than an object. An unsettling observation to say the least. Ever your savior, Cassie luckily spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I don't know how comfortable I feel putting Jake through that for the 8 hour flight!\" Gulping, you didn't even know the flight was 8 hours, but there wasn't any time to process that fact as Kimberly quickly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I understand that, dear.\" Cassie seemed surprised as Kimberly appeared to be listening to her pleas, but just then Kimberly added on, \"I'm sure either Irina or I would be able to transport him on ourselves in that case. However, I'm sure both of us are a bit, ehem, heavier than you if you excuse my rudeness, Irina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no offense taken, Kim! It's just the truth! I could probably fit two or three of the little guys in my big ol butt and you still wouldn't be able to see them! ... No offense, Jake!\" Irina responded in an utterly carefree manner, only at the end realizing she may have offended you in return. From this retort you already began to grow a few seeds of fear in your heart about how spending time around this woman would go. You could tell she was a fun loving woman, and while they are a blast to spend time with, it often meant they were less concerned with where they were throwing around their assets. Gulping with trepidation, you didn't even have time to respond before Cassie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind! I'd be happy to keep him on me! Don't worry about it!\" Cassie shot you a brief look and you two immediately made the mental connection that this was for the greater good. There was no telling how stashing you away on anyone else's body would turn out. At least this way Cassie herself would be in charge of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Well then which option are you two going to select?\" Kimberly asked. You swore you saw the briefest of smirks flash across her face, almost like she was enjoying forcing you to pick your own torture for the journey ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cassie looked at each other, your gaze then shifted towards her massive rump pressed into the couch, then down over the edge of the coffee table towards her sizable feet. It was going to be a tough decision.</span></div></div>",

You were about to speak up to inform Cassie of your decision, but Kimberly suddenly cut in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I just remembered! The security guards at the park do luggage inspections! Guess that one\u2019s out the window then, huh?\u201d Kimberly laughed. With only two options now, you were about to speak up again when Kimberly hit you with a menacing glare, as if she could read your mind. Swallowing the lump in your throat, you meekly said \u201cI think it would be best to ride in your sock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at you with a bit of concern. \u201cAre you sure honey? My feet don\u2019t exactly smell like roses.\u201d she said as she wiggled her toes absentmindedly. You looked back at Kimberly only to be met with the same menacing glare. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d You said with feigned confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s the better option anyway. He could totally slip out if he was in your panties.\u201d Kimberly added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay I guess.\u201d Cassie said, shrugging her shoulders. She then picked you up and put you on the floor. \u201cSorry about this babe, but if you\u2019re going in my sock, I need to flatten you.\u201d Cassie peeled her pink ankle sock from her right foot and flexed her toes, as if she was trying to air them out. It didn\u2019t take long for the smell to make its way to your nostrils, but luckily Cassie took good care of her hygiene, so her feet didn\u2019t smell too bad, at least from where you were standing at the moment. Cassie then pressed foot into your face and knocked you over, pinning you to the carpet under her warm sole before standing up and shifting all of her weight to the foot you were under. You flattened out almost instantly, and your squishy body adhered to her skin like gum. You began to regret your decisions as your girlfriend pulled her sock back over her foot, sealing you between her skin and the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled as she watched her daughter step on her tiny boyfriend like a bug. She was amazed at how submissive he was. All she had to do was give him a look and he did exactly what she wanted him to. No hesitation, just obedience; like a dog. Kimberly bet that she could have him licking her soles by the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie finished tying her sneakers as Sophie and Maddie came down the stairs. \u201cIs everyone ready?\u201d Kimberly asked. Everyone agreed, well, except you. You suffered silently in your girlfriend\u2019s sock, which was already reaching unbearable levels of claustrophobia, as you were repeatedly stepped on again and again. Cassie wasn\u2019t lying either when she said her feet didn\u2019t smell like roses. It was at this moment you realized that Cassie didn\u2019t have to put you in her sock until they got to the park, and you had a four hour drive ahead of you. You began desperately licking your girlfriend\u2019s sole between steps in hopes to get her attention, but...</span></div></div>",

Honestly they all seemed to be bad ideas but if you had to stowaway, you would do it with the most attractive part of your beautiful lady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess riding in the back of your pants seems like the best idea...\u201d you trailed off. Looking at her sizable rump and the way the couch cushion was compressed by it had you second guessing your decision, after all it was an 8 hour flight and..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s decided then\u201d Kimberly boomed, \u201cJake will hide behind you. Now do note dear that sometimes at the airport they randomly select people to be screened. It would probably be best if you used his squashing properties and make sure he is smushed between your cheeks. That will help in two ways, one if you are screened they will not notice something in your clothing. Two, he will have no chance of being lost accidentally. We certainly do not want to leave him alone at the airport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at hearing this. Not only were you going to be squashed by your bride to be, but also you would be trapped deep in her crack for 8 hours. You thought to speak up but Cassie was already picking you up and heading into the bathroom to get you ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set you down on the sink counter and turned to take her pants off, you couldn\u2019t help but notice just how big her butt was. You had been squashed by it several times but never for the length of time that was coming up. At least it was Cassie, she would be sensitive to your needs and get you out as soon as the trip was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was unbuttoning her pants, there was a knock at the door. \u201cSweetie, again if you would rather I would be happy to transport him for you. I know you would be worried about him the whole time and might not enjoy the flight. I would be happy to help you both out.\u201d Kimberly stops at the door with a half smile on her face. She was actually just curious what it would feel like to transport a squishy man for that long in her ass crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie turned towards the door and you saw she was actually contemplating the offer. Your blood ran cold at the thought of Kimberly transporting you. You could tell she was at least suspicious of you and you had no idea if she would be in a hurry to release you at the end of the flight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie then made up her mind and said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure Mom, I would be worried about him all flight I guess...,\" Cassie replied trailing off still a bit unsure of her decision. She looked back at her mom who stood in the doorway and you could swear you saw an unsettling smile creeping onto the edges of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it seemed at least that your fiance wasn't completely clueless about her mother's personality, \"But you have to promise me that you won't forget about him and you'll at least try to make the flight a little bit less 'uncomfortable' for him.\" You were grateful for the consideration but you couldn't help but feel that a promise like that was going to do little to stop Kimberly's handling of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear, what do you take me for? I promise I won't forgot about him and I'll do my best to make sure he has an unforgettable experience to make up for not being able to talk with us on the flight. Think of it this way honey, if I'm the one carrying him then you won't have to be kept up worrying the entire time and I'm sure a nap could do you a world of good for when we arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie finally could only sigh in defeat at her mother's words, Kimberly had hit the nail on the head for her biggest worry in transporting you this way was how exhausted she would most likely be by the end of the flight having to take you into consideration in everything that she did. You were in a similar position as your fiance, you wanted to refute Kimberly but seeing how sound her logic was and you really didn't want to have to put Cassie through all that. Unfortunately you had to agree with Kimberly here that, knowing Cassie's character, she would most likely be too busy worrying about you the whole flight to get any sleep. Because of this, you could only keep silent throughout the exchange and wait for your fate to be decided for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd decided it was as in the next moment Cassie had handed your small self over to her mother who promptly headed off towards her own room to complete her packing, that is, packing you into her large behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jake, I know that we've only just met today so we haven't really gotten the chance to know each other yet but you're about to become very, and I mean very, acquainted with my ass so if you have anything you'd like to say before I put you in your home for the next 8 or so hours, now would be the time,\" Kimberly said this as she placed you onto her bed and began pulling down her pants to prepare her backside to accept you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't too fond of the fact that she had referred to her butt as your 'home' even if it was to be a temporary one at that but you weren't about to get held up on every small issue cause you could tell that this would just be one of many to come with Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit, you could tell Kimberly was becoming impatient so not being able to come up with anything in particular, you settled with just trying to appeal to Kimberly since you knew that she still hadn't entirely accepted your relationship with her daughter and your chances to fix that would be put on hold for the next 8 hours, assuming she released you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, despite your imminent up close meeting with her rear assets, you thought carefully how best to kiss Kimberly's ass, metaphorically of course, \"Um, well, I don't have anything in particular that I need I guess but I just wanted to let you know that I know you and Cassie haven't had the chance to talk for a while so you don't have to worry too much about me on the flight. Take all the time you guys need to catch up with each other. I just want to make sure that you guys can have the best reunion possible, although I'd like to be apart of it too so I can better get to know everyone...so...uh...if you could let me out as soon as you guys have caught up, that'd be much appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly paused for a moment having pulled her pants down taking a second to process what you said and you could swear that just a hint of appreciation and what you hoped was respect had crept into her eyes before she turned around in just her underwear giving you a view of her glorious behind. You couldn't help but admit that Cassie's mom looked absolutely stunning despite her age and just the sight before you was making you look forward ever so slightly to your near future visit to its depths. \"You don't have to worry about me Jake, I was already planning to take advantage of the long flight to catch up with my daughter but I do appreciate the thought and I will definitely be taking you up on the second half of what you said. Now, if you don't mind, we have a flight to catch and my butt is starting to feel lonely so why don't we get you two familiar with each other before we're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you hadn't noticed when you were trying to get on Kimberly's good side with your speech was the unintentional way you worded the part where you allowed Kimberly to keep you between her cheeks until she felt that she had properly caught up with her daughter. Of course Kimberly hadn't missed the loophole and though she knew it wasn't on purpose, she wasn't about to waste such an opportunity. Not to mention that she was truly curious what it would feel like to have such a small man flattened between her large rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reply to Kimberly's statement, she had reached behind her with one hand picking you up while using the other to pull back her panties to leave enough space for someone your size to slide into. Bringing you above the opening into the depths below she released your body with one last departing statement, \"Have a nice trip, I know I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, you had passed her waistline and you slowly felt your body come to a stop in the center of the outside of her two enormous globes until you were pinned within the tight confines of her underwear one step from the musky depths in front of you, but you knew she wasn't done, at least not based on her comment before about making sure you were unable to be seen and squished in case of a random security check once at the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fears were proven true when you felt Kimberly enter her panties and settling on your back when you were suddenly propelled forward betwixt the mountains of flesh surrounding you until Kimberly felt that you were deep enough to not have to worry about the security checks or potentially losing you somewhere along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, this meant that you were quite deep within her butt crack to the point that your environment now consisted only of ass flesh, darkness, and the musky smell from before though it was now much stronger with hints of an earthiness to it now. As to why that was, you really didn't want to follow that train of thought so you attempted to get comfy for the long wait ahead and snuggled into Kimberly's cheeks unknowingly giving her quite a pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour peace lasted for an entire 2 seconds before Kimberly finished up her 'packing' of you by clenching her butt cheeks flattening your form against her skin which you could tell was already starting to produce some sweat from the humid and stuffy space you were now trapped in and would be for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your form conforming to her backside, Kimberly showed an accomplished smile before pulling her pants back up and heading back to the others who were all ready and waiting to leave as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following 8 or so hours were a humid nightmare for you, especially given how little Kimberly even acknowledged your presence throughout the entirety of the flight. Heck, from what you could tell, it was almost like the whole situation was completely normal and you were little more than a tan rag that she was using to soak up the large amounts of sweat that were constantly building up within the depths of her ass. You were honestly surprised that she was sweating this much despite not moving very much but what you were of unaware of was the fan that are usually above the seats happened to be under repair today so she was perspiring much more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also meant that she was shifting in her seat quite a bit causing your form to be pressed more and more into her pores and simultaneously smearing your features so that if someone were to look right now, you would be practically invisible among her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way you were going to be getting any sleep with all of this happening so you could succumb to the torment and when you felt the familiar sense of weightlessness as the plane dropped you were immensely relieved, you had finally arrived and get out from between the ass cheeks of your fiance's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Kimberly release you upon getting off the plane or does she take advantage of the loophole in the speech you made prior the flight like she said she would?</span></div></div>",

You tried to move your body but it was flat and adhered tightly to the inside of the matriarch\u2019s crack. All you could do was hope that you would be released from this prison soon and be reunited with Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo mom, once we get to the hotel we can get Jake out and get him freshened up! I am glad we had a chance to chat, sorry I napped half the time but airplanes always make me sleepy.\u201d Cassie said to her mother as the group exited the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry dear,\u201d Kimberly said with a smile, \u201cJake insisted that I remove him after we have had enough time to catch up! I was initially taken a back by such a selfless offer, but he insisted he would stay back there so that way we can catch up on everything! Such a wonderful little man..\u201d Kimberly trailed off as she squeezed her cheeks together and enjoyed the feeling of you being smashed between them. She smiled thinking that if she did this correctly she could conveniently make sure that Cassie was not able to get completely caught up for the entire vacation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Cassie exclaimed, \u201cWell Jake is really sweet, so if that is what he said then I would hate to take away from his kind offer... I guess we can get settled in and then catch up on everything and have him out for bedtime!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled, that was almost too easy. Now all she had to do was make sure Cassie got to catch up in bits and pieces and with a little luck maybe she would even forget where you were being kept. She sighed as she again used her butt to squish your body over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the hotel, Kimberly handled getting everyone checked in. They had settled on two rooms, one had two queens and one had a king bed. Kimberly thought about the best way to split the five up since you were out of sight and not part of the planning. She figured Maddie and Sophie could share one of the Queen sized beds, which meant that either Cassie and Irina could share the queen, or one of them could share the king with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, if Cassie shared the room with her, she would have to come up with something to keep from catching up too quickly, but it made more sense for mom and daughter to share a room. She could always have the room to herself as that would have, interesting opportunities of \u201cbonding\u201d with the man currently trapped in her ass. Then having Irina in the room would give an opportunity of \u201caccidentally\u201d trading Jake off onto Irina with only Kimberly knowing what had happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly thought long and hard over her options before deciding that,</span></div></div>",

You had to be hearing wrong, surely this was a joke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell dear that makes sense to me and I would love to have an opportunity to catch up just the two of us\u201d Kimberly said with a smile. \u201cLet me just go let her know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie buttoned her pants back up and looked back at you apologetically, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to catch up with just Mom in forever, you don\u2019t mind do you dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into her eyes, you just couldn\u2019t say no. \u201cSure dear, I can understand that you want to catch up with your mom. In fact if you need more time after the flight to catch up you can!\u201d You aren\u2019t sure why you said that last part, but you always tried to go above and beyond for Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, \u201cWell I doubt that will be necessary. Unless mom doses off and we don\u2019t get a chance to chat or something. Irina is a great friend of the family though so I know she will take good care of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed a smile, and a thumbs up. Inside however you were slightly afraid and wondering why Cassie couldn\u2019t just catch up with her mom while transporting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was also wondering this as well as she went to get Irina. She came to the conclusion that either Cassie is just that trusting and the two of you had such a good relationship that nothing could come between you, or maybe she was trying to get rid of you... No surely her daughter would come right out and say that, but she was a kind sweet girl maybe she just couldn\u2019t get up the nerve to break up with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrina, Cassie wants you to transport her fianc\u00e9 so we can get some time alone to catch up! I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mind...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh not at all! I would love to help the both of them out! Though\u201d she giggled, \u201cMy rump is a lot bigger than what he is used to! I hope I don\u2019t lose him in here\u201d she then proceeded to give her butt a small smack. \u201cLet me get up there I guess and get him packed away\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still coming to grips with what had happened when the door opened and in came Irina. She waved at you and then proceeded to pick you up and place you inside her panties. You were plunged into darkness and could barely make out a huge shapely rear end in front of you. It was gigantic! You remembered Irina had said she could fit two or three people your size in here and you had to agree. Then you felt yourself pushed in between the cheeks by her fingers behind you followed by her cheeks clenching together. This immediately squashed you flat and smeared your body out. It would be hard to even recognize you with just one simple action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you feel good and secure little guy!\u201d Irina  said with a small giggle. \u201cI guess we should get going!\u201d She then proceeded to walk out of the bathroom. Each step squashed you back and forth in your fleshy \u201ctransport\u201d. The heat was intense, and you had to endure this for 8 hours! At least it was just 8 hours, then you would be reunited with your beloved Cassie. You couldn\u2019t make out any sound from in here, Irina\u2019s butt was just way too thick to hear anything. After just 30 minutes of the intense pressure and heat, you passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight was calm and uneventful. Cassie and Kimberly were able to have a great chat and caught up on a lot of things. Cassie never even mentioned Jake, which again caused Kimberly to wonder if anything was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile stayed passed out for the entire flight which may have been a blessing. Irina didn\u2019t move too much after initially wiggling in her seat to get good and comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally awoke to the feeling of being squashed side to side again. It took a moment to remember where you were. \u201cThat\u2019s right I am in Irina\u2019s butt crack. It feels like she is walking so I should be getting out soon!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Cassie come to get you, or are you stuck with Irina for a little longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Irina's seismic shaking of her massive cheeks pounded your body between them, you couldn't help but wonder why you let yourself get into this situation. You obviously loved Cassie with all of your heart but allowing a total stranger to shove you up her ass crack for over a third of a day seemed like overkill even for you. At your current position your entire world was nothing more than skyrocketing temperatures, crushing pressure, and butt sweat. You could hardly even hear the conversations of the normal sized women who you were traveling with due to the near sound-proof insulation of Irina's butt flesh. However, as of this moment you finally felt the constant pressure of Irina's seated ass be replaced by the rhythmic pounding of her buns as she walked. This was a great sign for you as that meant your captor, fiance, and rest of her family was at least exiting the airplane. Hopefully this meant your position as an ass crack filler was nearly over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up above the women were casually strolling off the plane, reminiscing about when Cassie used to live at home as well as casually planning all of the fun things they wanted to do. Finally after a few minutes of walking, Sophie and Maddie had already run ahead together, and Cassie spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, guys, I was having so much fun I nearly forgot about Jake! Let's just get our luggage then you can take him out, Irina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina looked back at Cassie with a face of total confusion, \"Uhh who? You want me to take someone out on a date? Also I don't mean to change the subject but I have a real killer wedgie going on right now\" Clearly over the course of the long flight, for most of which Irina slept soundly, she had utterly forgotten about your existence. As she finished her retort she discretely tried to pick at her \"wedgie\" which of course was just your foot tall form lining her crack like a sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irina!\" Cassie nearly shouted before lowering her voice as to not raise any more attention, \"That's not a wedgie, that's my fiance, Jake! You said you would carry him in your butt on the plane so security wouldn't find him, remember!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Irina's memory was jogged and her eyes went wide, \"Oh dear I remember now! Sorry about that Cassie! And sorry to you too, Jake! I hope it's at least comfortable down there!\" Irina spoke down to you, something you managed to miraculously barely hear but it was nice to know she at least cared about you somewhat. She affectionately rubbed her own ass, something she thought you would appreciate but in reality all it did was smear her cheeks around even further, piling on to your already established torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't apologize, Irina, it's completely understandable not to be used to concealing an entire man in your ass, although if anyone would be capable of doing that to a full height guy it would be you!\" Tragically, Cassie and you both shared the trait of being overly appeasing to others in your lives, and it was showing through now. Most of the time you loved how kind and empathetic Cassie was towards everyone, but at this exact moment you wished she would have put her foot down and made sure Irina knew the situation should be taken seriously. However, you held exactly zero power at this point in time so you couldn't voice any concerns about the bits of muffled conversation you were hearing. You tried to shout just to see what would happen and managed to just barely open your mouth up. Before a single peep could escape your lips, Irina's swaying, gelatinous ass flesh shifted into the newly opened space. You were now stuck with your mouth open, holding a chunk of her inner cheek like some sort of holster, getting an upsetting taste of her warm, sweaty skin. You whimpered as you accepted the fact that making any attempts to better your situation would only result in worse torture. At this point you honestly wished the crushing pressure of her buns would knock you out once more but it seemed fate wouldn't even grant you that pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Irina laughed heartily at Cassie's playful joke, \"Oh honey I wouldn't be surprised if I could either! It seems my rump will just never stop growing as I get older! It's got to be like the size of a house to Jake, maybe he's been traveling in more luxury than all of us today!\" Both Cassie and Kimberly laughed at Irina's joke as well before Kimberly responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Irina, based on the way that mini skirt is locking your buns in I doubt there's a millimeter of space to spare back there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina feigned a look of being offended by her best friend's comment before relenting and saying \"Eh, you're probably right!\" This elicited another round of laughter from the three women, confusing you greatly in your position. You were hearing nonstop muffled laughter from multiple sources, as well as feeling the vibrations of Irina's own chuckles sending shockwaves through her ass flesh. You were unsure what was so hilarious at this moment but if Cassie was involved in the uproar that did not bode well for you. Typically she was your lifeline whenever you were stuck in situations like these, so if even she was caught up in the fun and levity of the moment then you were in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys enough chit chat let's grab our bags and get to the resort!\" Cassie announced and the conversation died down a bit. Time and situation were nearly imperceptible for you in your current ass prison so you didn't even know what the women were up to, but as Irina continued to stand around and shift her weight unconsciously all over you, you soon became confused as to what they were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, Cassie, Kimberly, Maddie, and Sophie had all gotten their luggage off of the carousel already, but Irina's was nowhere to be found. Nearly twenty minutes had passed by and every other passenger had gotten their stuff besides Irina. Finally fed up with the situation, Irina marched over to an employee and talked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you heard was, \"...my bag?... Lost?!\" and you didn't need to hear any more. Despite your horrific situation you still felt empathy for your giantess captor. The airline had clearly lost her bag that she had packed perfectly for a trip just like this. You told yourself that you would offer to buy the woman some replacement clothes once she peeled you out of her ass to make her feel better. After all, despite how horrible the journey had been, Irina really did take a risk by smuggling you on her person through security and you still owed her for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour or so was rather uneventful as well, you felt Irina slam her ass down hard into a seat with a bit of give, you assumed correctly this was a taxi to the resort. And after a little while it seemed the women had finally reached their hotel room. The beautiful Atlantica resort had effectively entranced all of the women with is lavish amenities and gorgeous scenery, even enough to take Irina's mind off of her tragically lost luggage... and of course you again. Rather uncharacteristically once again even Cassie failed to bring up your presence as the women started unpacking and changing their clothes. Apparently being with all of her family and family friend was bringing her back mentally to the time before she knew you, and as a result you were slipping her mind much more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your first glimpse of freedom as Irina slowly unzipped the back of her tight, pencil skirt, and slide it down her legs. Immediately her cheeks swung freely and peeled apart ever so slightly to alleviate some pressure on your body. Of course it still wasn't enough to reveal your mashed and flattened form, but as she bent over to slide the skirt all the way off of her feet they peeled apart even further! Light flooded onto you for the first time in hours as you were exposed to genuine sunlight and not just crushing pressure mixed with pitch black. Luckily, Cassie was even entranced by Irina's almost comically large posterior as she caught sight of your body smashed deep in her neighbor's crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, oh Jake!\" Cassie shouted out. Thankfully seeing your battered form at least inspired some worry in your future wife, a fact you were grateful for. Irina froze in her tracks, her memory being jogged of your existence once again as well. She stayed bent over and clearly lied on the spot, saying, \"Yes that's why I was bending over like this! You can take him out now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina grabbed a cheek in each hand and spread her ass apart, giving all of the women a clear view of you. Cassie quickly went to work attempting to free your form, but you were stuck flatter and firmer than you had been in years. A few minute passed by and somehow Cassie managed to sneak her fingernail underneath your head at the very least. She had just begun to peel your head off of Irina's sweaty skin when you heard Kimberly's voice ring out ominously,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on one second, Cassie.\" Kimberly said as Cassie paused, your head with no more than an inch of separation from Irina's tremendous ass, and the rest of your body still firmly squashed to it. \"I'm not sure if you could hear from your hiding place, Jake, but Irina has tragically lost her luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just barely had regained the ability to speak, as you began to respond, \"Oh that's terrible I'm sorry to hea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is a true travesty\" Kimberly interrupted you, \"but now it appears our dear friend has nothing to wear for the whole trip. No shirt, no pants, not even a single... swimsuit bottom. Now Irina has done you quite the favor by allowing you to ride with her on this trip, it would be the least you could do to act as her replacement bottom, now wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned into silence, as was Cassie. You were finally exposed to light after hours being pressure cooked inside a stranger's ass, and now you were being asked to voluntarily continue that torture? What do you say in response?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't know how to react to Kimberly's outlandish request. Based on the way she had treated you thus far you figured that it would take a bit of time for her to warm up to you, but outright asking you to be molded into their neighbor's thong instead of enjoying a vacation? That was quite a leap. As your mind was racing and you tried to figure out how exactly to respond, you took a moment to understand your surroundings. Your entire one foot tall body was crumpled and mashed into the inside of Irina's ass crack, with only your head popped free enough to see. As your captor continued to peel her hefty cheeks apart you could see the very concerned look of Cassie's face, as well as the judgmental look at Kimberly was putting on. All things considered, Irina could decide for you by simply letting go of her buns and having them seal you up like some sort of prisoner. So with that in mind you couldn't help but appreciate being given some semblance of choice, even if you could tell Kimberly expected a \"yes\" from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back to Cassie you prayed that she would interject, stand up to her mother's ridiculous request and save you, but despite as kind and compassionate as she was, you didn't see that happening in the moment. For one reason or another, being surrounded by her family and family friends had changed the way she was acting. She even forgot all about you during the flight and was only reminded of your existence upon literally seeing your mangled body in Irina's ass. You couldn't help but understand the tough situation she was in, however. Both you and Cassie understood that if it looked like she was catering too much to you instead of her family that it would make you look overly dependent on her. This feeling would only be amplified if Cassie directly stood up to her mother on your behalf. For this reason, as much as every fiber of your being told you to say otherwise, you spoke up and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I have no problem with her wearing me in the meantime!\" Both Cassie and Kimberly's eyes went wide with surprise. Cassie looked like she wanted to cry out, but bit her tongue and stayed silent. Even Kimberly was taken aback that you would agree so simply to such a horrible task. She figured that she would simply put a bit of pressure on you by asking the question, but didn't expect you to actually agree. Unsure of whether or not the extent you would go to for the Smalls impressed her or actually weirded her out, Kimberly simply straightened herself up and responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely! Thank you for your cooperation, Jake.\" Kimberly said down to you, still deep in your ass prison. Completely unsure of what you had just done, you prayed that perhaps one of the other Smalls sisters would interject. But it seemed that they had already gone into the connecting room next door and were out of earshot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then your captor herself finally spoke up, \"Wow, Jake, that's awfully nice of you to do for me. I promise I won't wear you any longer than I have to!\" Without further ado, Irina snaked one hand deep into her ass crack, just barely grabbing hold of your head that was free from her warm skin. With a few seconds of rather tough effort, she finally ripped your body off of her flesh. \"Ouch! Damn it's a good thing I got you out of there when I did, Jake, you were really stuck onto me well! If we forgot about you for a couple more hours it would have taken some serious effort to free you!\" Irina delivered this bone chilling possibility without a care in the world, clearly not understanding the gravity of carrying a tiny man in her ass. It seemed like this woman really didn't have a care in the world, she was clearly a nice woman, but being worn by someone this relaxed and carefree meant that she most likely wouldn't be worrying much about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, and with Cassie and Kimberly simply watching idly, Irina began to work at shaping your body. Luckily, for her at least, the way you were stuck inside of her ass had your limbs sticking out as opposed to being completely smashed together into an unrecognizable blob. With the dexterity and efficiency of someone who worked with clothing for a living, she quickly began twisting and and pulling your body out of human shape and into the rough shape of a swimsuit bottom. She yanked on your arms and legs until they were nearly three times their normal length, compressing your upper legs together so they would somewhat adequately form a solid mass as thick as your torso. Your lower legs were stretched further and pulled towards each respective arm on the same side. Showing her expertise again, Irina quickly double knotted your limbs together, forming quite a tight hold on themselves. All this time you were in rather excruciating pain. You always tended to downplay the fact that even though you were very squishy and stretchy, it was in no way a comfortable experience for you to be molded like this. But right now you wished you had made it much clearer. Finally, Irina grabbed your torso and head, shooting you a quick look of sympathy before mashing them together in her hands and stretching them out width wise. After a few more minor adjustments, Irina happily stated, \"And finished! What do you think!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina held you up in front of a mirror nearby and you mentally cried. Depressingly, she did a fantastic job. You looked exactly like a swimsuit bottom, your face being the only really discernible feature of your humanity. But looking at yourself once more you noticed that based on the orientation she was holding you at, your face was going to be on the inside... of the backside. Your heart dropped, but continuing to look at yourself it at least seemed like you were stretched out enough to attempt to cover her butt rather than slide inside of it like a real thong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like she was reading your mind, Irina said, \"Yeah I didn't make it a full thong because I feel like you've seen enough of between my buns recently, Jake!... I just hope you fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly simply added, \"Great work Irina, I can't tell he's human at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was shocked still, unable to speak as she witnessed her fiance be treated like a scrap of cloth. She merely nodded and threw a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina quickly slid her current underwear off and tossed them aside before lowering you down to the ground beneath her feet. You could only gaze up at the monumentally thick thighs that absolutely towered over you, concluding with a truly cartoonishly massive ass at the top. Irina stepped into the holes between your limbs and torso before slowly starting to pull you upwards. As you ascended you brushed against more and more of her skin, her legs getting progressively meatier towards the top. Finally, you reached the point of no return, the absolute planet of her rump. With a mighty heave, Irina pulled you against her ass flesh, slamming your stretched out face and torso against the bottom of her cheeks. She stopped for a moment before trying again, once again ramming you into her warm, already sweaty from the humidity flesh, but not making any progress towards actually covering her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina sighed, before speaking, \"Sorry about this, Jake, but I just don't think you're big enough to cover my ass like this!\" You metaphorically jumped for joy! If she couldn't wear you then you could actually enjoy the vacation as a human being instead of as clothing! But before you could celebrate for too long, Irina spoke again, \"So I guess you have to just be a thong after all! I mean at least you are familiar with what it's like in there! Here goes nothing!\" With these words your heart was broken once more. Irina reached back and simply pinched your stretched out upper body together with her thumb and pointer finger, leaving you as a pencil thing thong. You could only whimper as she grabbed your limbs once again, and yanked you up one last time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a man shot out of a cannon, you rocketed back between Irina's dizzyingly large globes of butt flesh. You had been free from this prison for no more than ten minutes before being immediately shoved right back in. Immediately you recognized the earthy smell of stale butt sweat and god knows what else. Instinctively Irina clenched her ass, getting used to the feeling of your threading her cheeks like floss, before giggling slightly at the feeling. She immediately turned and checked her front and backside out in the mirror. Your skin tones were different enough that you did at least look like a swimsuit on the voluptuous woman, but your minuscule frame was stretched to its absolute limits to even fit around her. As a result your body parts were practically string thing, just barely doing enough to cover what they needed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit scandalous, I must say, but cute too! Nice work, Jake! You're great at this!\" Irina said out loud, still checking herself out in the mirror. You just barely heard her compliment in her ass, but nevertheless you were alarmed at how much she seemed to like wearing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect I think! You're an attractive woman, Irina, you should flaunt it!\" Kimberly said to her good friend. \"Now, in my opinion I think we should keep this whole thing a little secret from Maddie and Sophie, they might not understand the situation as well as we do and object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded understandingly. Cassie on the other hand was finally coming to terms with the reality of what was happening. She wasn't happy about it, but there wasn't much she could do without risking upsetting her mom. Steeling her resolve she said, \"Yep! He looks great on you.\" before reaching into her suitcase and grabbing her swimsuit out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust barely being able to hear Cassie's approval, your heart sunk. You really were going to be condemned to being a thong. You could only pray that your stay wouldn't be too long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the rest of the Smalls women changed into their swimsuits for a fun day at Atlantica, Irina waited patiently in the corner. She\u2019d borrowed a plain white bikini top from Kimberly, as they were close in size. The fact that her white top didn\u2019t match your tan tone bothered her internal fashion designer senses, but she pushed the feeling off for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe absentmindedly rocked back and forth on her heels as the minutes passed. Her rhythmic motion shifted her butt cheeks slightly up and down, hot flesh grinding against you from all sides. It seemed that no matter how slight a move Irina made, it caused innumerable uncomfortable humiliation for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was the first to be ready after Irina, and she approached her mother\u2019s best friend with an amicable smile. Her matching blue two-piece was attractive but modest. \u201cHey Irina, do you think you could do something for me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina put her hand on your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you or your family, Cassie. Name it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blushed faintly. \u201cTh-thanks. Well, I was wondering if you wanted to go shopping for new swimsuits. I heard there\u2019s a gift shop with a huge clothing selection just a few hallways down from where we are now.\u201d Cassie tried to act as inconspicuous as possible. \u201cThat way, you\u2019d get some awesome new bikinis, and we could give Jake a rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, that is a great idea!\u201d She glanced back at her prodigious rear, where you couldn\u2019t even be seen save for your arms and legs wrapping around her hips. \u201cYour cute squishy man is a great replacement, but I do feel a bit guilty about how much he\u2019s handling right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly demonstrating her point, Irina grabbed your thin, gangly arms and yanked you up her hips, ramming your body even further inside of her sweltering ass. Your squishy form, stretched to its limits, wedged itself far in her crack, the bodacious booty dunking you in sweat. You fought limply to pull away, but your attempts to wiggle or squirm were pitifully minute with how stretched and worn you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie recoiled at Irina\u2019s action, looking at the black-haired giantess with surprise. Irina caught her look and frowned innocently. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Cassie dear? Do you think I actually should keep wearing your fianc\u00e9?\u201d Irina truly hadn\u2019t thought anything of readjusting you, nor how horribly rank and moist your imprisonment in her rear was. Realistically, how could a normal-sized woman like her know what being buried in a butt crack felt like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the brunette girl recovered quickly. \u201cUh, no! No! I think buying a replacement is a better idea.\u201d Cassie slung her purse over her shoulder. \u201cIn fact, I could go\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I can!\u201d A cheery voice cut Cassie off. Beside her, Sophie had just entered the room, wearing a revealing bikini top and immodestly ripped shorts over her bikini bottoms. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood to buy some super cute clothes too, and I promised my social media follows I\u2019d do some totes adorable modeling in the changing room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie began to panic. \u201cNo, really Sophie, it\u2019s alright. You don\u2019t\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice interrupted from behind her. \u201cRelax, Cassie. Let Sophie spend some quality time with Irina.\u201d It was Kimberly, wearing a tight one-piece red swimsuit that seemed perhaps a size too small for her. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to chat with you about a few things, actually. Sophie and Irina can take care of themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded. \u201cYup! I have plenty of money with me, too, so if anything, I\u2019ll need to be careful to not buy out the whole store! Ha ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled. \u201cThere. It\u2019s decided, I\u2019d say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina turned to the door after grabbing her purse, giggly Sophie following suit. Cassie watched with barely concealed worry as Irina began walking outside. Her heart sank watching her poor fianc\u00e9 wedged so deeply in between the woman\u2019s gargantuan cheeks, and she imagined how dark and sweaty it was for you. As her sister and neighbor closed the suite door, she realized glumly the situation was out of her hands\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and she also missed the faint smile dancing across Kimberly\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the hall, Irina walked along with Sophie towards the gift shop. It was only a three-minute walk, but it felt like an eternity. Every step produced an almost comical jostling and jiggling of Irina\u2019s butt cheeks, her hot flesh slapping you in the face over and over. Sweat caked your skin, a faint pungent scent overwhelmed your sense of smell, and every single noise was horribly muffled and distorted. You still fought to wiggle out an inch or two, though it was quite useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the store, Irina and Sophie balked at the staggering array of stylish and designer swimsuits, alongside bikinis emblazoned with the Atlantica logo. There were classic one- and two-piece sets in a rainbow assortment of patterns and colors, alongside risqu\u00e9 string bikinis, flowing swim dresses, and some unconventional swimwear. There were also cute sunglasses, flip flops, and hats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie squealed with delight and rushed off down on of the aisles. Irina followed suit with a bit more restraint, though her mind was already racing at all the possibilities. Her eye was drawn to the elaborately colored two-piece sets. Interestingly, each set had the bikini top facing out, and the bikini bottoms tied around the top in a semi-bow shape. It allowed customers to easily pick a matching set off of the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost greedily, Irina grabbed an alluring purple set, and flowery red set, a polka dot pink set, and a deep sea-blue set from the shelf. She also helped herself to a snow-white swimdress and a pitch-black one-piece. Her arms were getting heavy carrying the full load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint thought in her mind reminded her that her tan bottoms didn\u2019t match her white top, so she reached for matching white bottoms. Hesitating, she recalled the top was actually borrowed from Kimberly, and she\u2019d have to give it back. Switching her train of thought, Irina instead picked up a tan bikini top, adding it to the pile in her arms. The unbelievable irony of her selective memory once more served to torment you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling to the back of the gift shop, Irina entered the changing room. She heard Sophie giggling and taking selfies in one of the stalls, and she herself entered a stall, closing the door behind her. Delicately hanging each potential purchase on the rack of hooks, Irina then began stripping. Her humongous breasts heaved as the white top pulled off her, and she turned to working her thong out of her butt and down her legs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blast of cold air that hit you chilled you to the bone as Irina at last retrieved you from your swampy ass crack. The bright lights of the changing room stung your eyes briefly, and you basked in the sensation of fresh air and the sweat that caked you finally drying. Your vision adjusted as Irina worked your stretchy limbs down her thick thigs and long legs, finally slipping her feet out from the makeshift holes she\u2019d formed with your arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you loosely, you prepared for Irina to apologize for wearing you, or at least set you down and give you space to reform. You also tried to avert your gaze from her fully naked body, as she was still mostly a stranger to you, but it was impossible with your mushed face. Until you reformed a bit more, you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to her, so the conversation you still felt was impending would be one sided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the absolute last thing you expected was for Irina to merely wrap your looped limbs around a vacant hook on the clothes rack, and then turn away from you. Your eyes widened in panic as the titanic black-haired giantess simply plucked one of her many potential purchases from the rack and began wiggling her gratuitously curvy body into the tight swimwear. Had she truly forgotten about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou willed your body to reform quickly, but then came to a startling relaxation. With your hands and feet bound into loops, you didn\u2019t think they\u2019d actually be capable of reforming at all. And with your body stretched and squished, it wouldn\u2019t be much use either. In fact, the only part of your body truly capable of reforming out of your thong-shape was your head, so you could at least communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was easy said than done, however. As the minutes passed by, you made almost no progress on reforming your head and mouth. Soon thirty minutes had passed, and you felt no closer than when you\u2019d first been freed. Irina\u2019s ass had demolished you, even with how short its claim on your body had been. All you could do was stare upwards at the tan bikini top hanging on the hook above you, the significance of that fact not yet dawning on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only two suits left to try, Irina, naked again, glanced at the rack, her eyes falling onto you and the top. Unfortunately, her brain told her she already knew what you felt like, so she didn\u2019t spare you a second glance, and instead focused on the tan top above you. The oblivious giantess chewed on her lip for a second, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, you know what?\u201d She said softly but aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think tan is my color. I\u2019ll return this set.\u201d She nodded as if to confirm her decision, then pulled you and the top from the rack. As she grabbed you, her hand crunched down on your body, hiding your visible human features clenched in her palm. She bunched your thong-body and the top together and tossed them onto the bench beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a knock sounded on the door. \u201cHey hey, Irina!\u201d Sophie\u2019s unmistakably bubbly voice called from the other side. \u201cAlmost done? I\u2019m all set.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina reached over and unlatched the door, allowing her best friend\u2019s daughter in. She addressed her. \u201cYes, Sophie dear. I just need to try on one more swimsuit. I think I\u2019ll buy all of this, it\u2019s so gorgeous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie, who had purchased a wide-brimmed flower hat and gaudy sunglasses, was wearing both. She also held a bag with two cute, revealing swimsuits she\u2019d purchased. \u201cGreat! Remember, if there\u2019s something you find super adorable, you can wear it out of the store. They\u2019ll scan the price at the register, then cut the tag. You don\u2019t have to leave here with what you wore in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s eyes raised approvingly. \u201cReally? That\u2019s great, because this white swimdress is calling my name.\u201d Irina chuckled and began slipping the eye-catching swimwear on. Sophie\u2019s wandering gaze fell on your body, bundled up with the tan bikini top, lying on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want this stuff too, or should I return it?\u201d She inquired innocently, and your blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking back at her, Irina answered. \u201cOh, yes, you could be a dear and return it for me. Tan isn\u2019t quite my color, I don\u2019t think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do!\u201d Sophie saluted comically, then scooped you up into her smooth arms. She left the stall, closing the door behind her, and skipped back into the shop. As she walked, your body rolled out on top of the top, your face staring up into her angelic, na\u00efve smile. Mentally screaming at her as your mouth had yet to reform, you willed her to look down and notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, she actually did, stopping in her tracks as she beheld the tan thong with a vaguely human-shaped body. Quirking her mouth to the side, the blonde\u2019s eyes glinted playfully. \u201cOoh, what a silly-looking thong. Kinda cute though, but a bit big for me.\u201d She said aloud, tracing a finger over your face. \u201cNeat design. Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes shattered. Of course Sophie wouldn\u2019t recognize you. She and Maddie hadn\u2019t been told about you volunteering to be molded into Irina\u2019s thong. Why would she ever expect you to subject yourself to that. Also, as you recalled, Sophie hadn\u2019t seen or heard about your ability to be shaped into various objects. On top of that, Sophie\u2019s air headedness meant any passing resemblance that anyone else might\u2019ve picked up on by looking at you sailed right over her pretty head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the store employee, Sophie held you and the tan top out. \u201cSorry, my friend doesn\u2019t want to buy this. Where should I put it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk smiled graciously. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it. Thank you, miss.\u201d Sophie dropped you into the shop girl\u2019s waiting hands, and then strolled away, already dropping you from her memory as she uploaded a few more cute pics of herself to her followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out from behind the counter, the employee held you tightly in her grip as she approached the sprawling assortment of bikinis. Finding an appropriate empty hook, she delicately hung the bikini top on the hook, the exterior of the cups facing outward. She then took your body, stretched your torso a bit with her fingers, and began wrapping you around the top, as all the other bottoms in the store were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou internally screamed and panicked, trying your hardest to twitch and wiggle out of the girl\u2019s hands, to no avail. Your body refused to move as the girl wound your chest around the center of the bikini top. Your face was soon crushed into your lower half as the girl wrapped you in two circles. She then took your looped limbs and tied them into neat bows around the two cups, perfectly framing your thong-shaped body. As she pulled the knots tight and let go, you held in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring her work for a second, the employee smiled before taking a nearby price sticker dispenser and slipping it onto the placard above your hook. Taking a pen from her pocket, she scribbled a price in to match the other bikinis all around you. Finished, she strolled back to the counter and sat down by the register, taking a cue from Sophie\u2019s book and almost immediately filing the memory out of her mind. What use did she have to remember clearly something she did hundreds of times a day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to deny the reality of your situation, you tried wiggling and moving, but it was as useless as ever. Your strung-up arms and legs had been knotted so tight they wouldn\u2019t budge remotely. Your torso was wrapped so strongly around the mid-section of the bikini top that you couldn\u2019t even dream of reforming. Your face was also pressed into itself, hiding your most recognizable feature from the world and keeping your mouth from reforming and shouting out. For as long as you remained on this hook, you\u2019d keep your thong-shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hit by a wave of despair so strong you reeled, still fervently trying to escape despite the futility of it all. You didn\u2019t even hear Irina walk by, clad in her new white swimdress, and the other bikinis in her arms. She briefly glanced at the shelf, her eyes sweeping over you without a care in the world. You blended in perfectly with the other bikini thongs your exact shape and size, just in different colors. You looked nothing like a human, and exactly like you belonged. Even the price tag sticker above you and the bikini top practically denounced your humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina paid for her new swimsuits and then left with Sophie, the two women chatting excitedly about their plans for the day. On the way back to the room, they ran into Kimberly and Maddie, who were off to grab some food from the dining hall. Cassie, feeling stressed from worrying about you, and elected to stop by the sauna for a short relaxation session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly immediately noted Irina\u2019s new swimwear, and also that no tan thong appeared to be in her bag of purchases. She frowned in confusion, but shrugged her shoulders as her daughters and Irina hurried off to the dining hall. Smiling a bit, she trailed after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the store, there was nothing you could do but wallow in your own self-pity. Unable to move to get someone\u2019s attention, and unable to reform while tied into tight knots and wrapped up like a bow, you could only act the part of a good little thong bikini. Minutes passed into an hour, your body screaming with the aches of holding the same position, but still no miracle saved you. How long would this last?</span></div></div>",

All while you do your best to try and reform or at the very least gain this won's attention somehow with some movement. But you realize that it's hopeless as you are just to squished.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the other members of the Smalls family finished changing into their respective swimsuits, Irina borrowed a tan bikini top from Kimberly, one that was of similar tone to your own. She was slightly more bountiful than Kimberly, but she made it work, tugging the bikini onto her massive mammaries until it was snug and taut. If anything, the tight fit only further accentuated her generous curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone else was finished, Irina beamed from ear-to-ear. \u201cWe should all head to the water park, right away!\u201d She declared, rocking a bit on her heels. Her cheeks squished together from her movements, sweaty flesh pushing against your body from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled warmly. \u201cThat sounds like a wonderful idea. We could head there right now.\u201d She was wearing a tight red one-piece, nearly as skintight as Irina\u2019s outfit. Both of the curvaceous women were sure to drop jaws all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie frowned, and put a hand on her stomach. \u201cAren\u2019t we gonna get breakfast? I\u2019m totally starved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie shook her head. \u201cNo a good idea. A rough waterslide right after a meal is a recipe for cramps.\u201d The brown-haired girl rubbed her sister\u2019s head teasingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll live for another two hours, then we\u2019ll get lunch in the water park and wait it off in the lazy river.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was the last to speak, tearing her eyes off of your body stretched to the extreme around Irina\u2019s wide hips and thick thighs. She offered a tentative smile and spoke up. \u201cUh, yeah. Sounds like a plan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided, the group of five strolled from their suite and down the hall to the nearest elevator, riding down to the ground floor. From there, they walked out the back of the central resort building, and along a smooth cobblestone path that wrapped over to the waterpark. Talk was light-hearted and lively as they neared the waterpark, each giantess voicing her plans for their fun day in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own day was decidedly less sunny, at least for one third of your body. Your arms and legs sizzled and burned under the glare of the sun, as Irina had only coated herself in sunscreen, and not you. Your face and upper body, however, were as far from the sun as could be, wedged deep inside Irina\u2019s meaty cheeks, surrounded only by sweat and faint stench. Every step Irina took wobbled her comically large ass cheeks, her flesh slapping and pressing into you. Horrifically, the day had merely just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlantica was first and foremost a resort, so its waterpark wasn\u2019t unbelievably huge. However, it did possess several waterslides, a small wave pool, a lazy river around the perimeter, and a few shops and food stalls. It was enough to excite the Smalls family, and Maddie instantly dashed off for the tallest water slide, Sophie hot on her heels, and Cassie dragged helplessly along behind Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly laughed at her daughter\u2019s joy and happiness, then looked to her best friend. Irina shot her and equally excited grin, and began sauntering off to a nearby, and less threatening, waterslide. While Irina walked, Kimberly noted the way her good friend\u2019s jiggly cheeks ground and shook together, and watched with no small amount of enjoyment as the string-like thong flossing her cheeks was mashed and smooshed repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women waited in a short line to reach the top of the waterslide, and finally it was Irina\u2019s turn. The black-haired giantess plopped down onto the plastic of the slide, her butt cheeks compressing together and squeezing the life out of you. All sounds were muted to you save the rushing water pumping onto the slide, soon replaced by the muffled but noticeable shriek of Irina as she pushed herself off the top of the slide and raced down to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater flooded up Irina\u2019s butt crack as she sped down the slide, soaking into your body. Surprisingly, you could barely feel the effects of the slide, so deeply pushed up between the curvaceous woman\u2019s cheeks. The water pounded into you, but otherwise only the shifting of Irina\u2019s fleshy cheeks squeezing into you as she hit the turns in the slide affected you. In a weird sort of sense, it was almost fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun ended as soon as Irina splashed down into the water. Everything around you became submerged, and as Irina emerged from the pool like an Aquarian goddess, your thong-shaped body held a bit of water inside of her crack. This, unfortunately, bothered Irina, who proceeded to grab the straps she\u2019d formed out of your arms and legs, and hoist you up a bit, shimming you up to try and dislodge the water from her crack. All she succeeded in doing was ramming your face deep into her ass, where her cheeks crushed into you even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly followed her out of the pool moments later, laughing from the exhilaration of the water slide. The two women giggled at each other\u2019s flushed cheeks. It had been years since they\u2019d enjoyed themselves like this, and it brought back amazing memories of the wild adventures they had as teenagers. The two raced off to the towering waterslide that the Smalls daughters had first tackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf walking was hellish, running was a whole new realm of torture. Irina\u2019s powerful glutes bounced up and down as she ran through the park, Kimberly hot on her heels. Her meaty mounds of flesh ground into your body, sweat sticking to every inch of you. Your thong-shaped body, flossing deep into Irina, was given no space to breathe as her flesh ground into you, smearing your already molded body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women came to a stop at the end of another short line, and Irina panted for breath. Kimberly smiled, as she too fought for breath, and finally managed to speak. \u201cI\u2019m so glad\u2026we could have this much fun together. Just\u2026just the two of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina returned her playful grin. \u201cGoodness, I think I knocked two poor boys over taking that one turn back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shook her head knowingly. \u201cHonestly, how you bumped into them, they\u2019re probably on cloud nine.\u201d She laughed, and Irina laughed with her, a faint blush in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t hear anything but garbled words, but you could feel the vibrations of Irina\u2019s flesh as she laughed. Hot, rippling skin slapped into you repeatedly. You then inexplicably felt Irina\u2019s cheeks crash tightly into you, her butt seemingly caving in around you, constricting you. Flesh overcame you, pouring into you from all sides, sweat and stench growing. You could hardly breathe, and you mentally cried out for Irina to stop, your mouth far too mashed to actually make any sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, all that had happened was Irina had leaned back against the metallic fence running the length of the stairs leading up to the waterslide. Her squishy booty firmly compressed into the fence as Irina let all of her weight push backwards, trying to take the strain off of her feet. Kimberly watched her best friend\u2019s thick derriere squeeze into itself as Irina tried to relax, and bit down on a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally made it to the top of the slide, which wasn\u2019t much different from the first from your perspective. They even rode two more slides after that, and eventually were in line for the fifth and final slide that Atlantica had to offer. It was only then that Kimberly happened to look up at the sky, and note that the sun was directly overhead. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, damn. I forgot about meeting the girls for lunch.\u201d She swore. Irina gaped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness, it slipped my mind too.\u201d The black-haired giantess shifted nervously, unconsciously throwing her weight from one foot to the other. The effect this had on you was obvious. \u201cShould we leave the line and head to the food stall area?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly quirked her mouth to the side, and found herself gazing at the thong-shaped object still hugging Irina\u2019s hips. She smiled. \u201cOh\u2026I think we\u2019re fine. The girls can just eat and carry on with their day if we run late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d She grew a childish grin. \u201cI really wanted to ride this slide too.\u201d A minute of silence followed her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing nonchalant, Kimberly leaned against the fence behind her. \u201cSay, Irina. I\u2019ve been meaning to ask. Where did you get those bikini bottoms? That cute little tan thong bikini?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina titled her head. \u201cUh, Kimberly\u2026I swear you can be even more forgetful than me sometimes!\u201d She giggled, and Kimberly waited with bated breath. \u201cYou let me borrow it this morning, silly? Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly loosed a breath, her eyes flashing victoriously, but she only let Irina see a casual smile. \u201cAh, of course! That feels so long ago.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt certainly looking great on you, it really highlights your beauty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina blushed at the compliment. \u201cThanks.\u201d She ran her hands over your arm and leg straps affectionately. \u201cA little scandalous, but probably the comfiest thong bikini I\u2019ve ever worn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, when we get back, I could let you keep it.\u201d Kimberly offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded. \u201cI might take you up on that offer! Hee hee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill buried deep in sweltering, sweaty butt flesh, you hadn\u2019t heard a single word of their conversation, and thus remained oblivious to the terrible implications. All you could do was continue to suffer as they stood around, rode the slide down to the pool, and then walked off to the food court. Every second you begged for the day to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the food court, Kimberly and Irina find\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The friendly, caring, and perhaps-too-generous part of you almost immediately blurted out an answer to Kimberly, declaring that you\u2019d be perfectly fine with serving as Irina\u2019s bikini bottom for the rest of the vacation at Atlantica. Thankfully, your more conscientious and grounded part shut down that declaration right before the words left your mouth. Did you really want to be nothing more than a swimsuit for the next few days? No\u2026you didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt for Irina, truly you did. You knew she had no control over losing her luggage. At the same time, why did that mean that you had to serve as a replacement bikini for her? Kimberly mentioned it as if you were repaying a favor, but it seemingly hadn\u2019t cost Irina too much to transport your squishy body inside of her ass during the plane ride. After all, she\u2019d forgotten you were even in there\u2026twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you thought about it, the more sure you were of your upcoming decision. The entire point of your break from college was to hang out with your wife-to-be\u2019s family. A surprise trip was certainly not planned, but you didn\u2019t want to waste this opportunity now that it was here! Why did you need to help out Irina with her plight as miss spending quality time with Cassie, Maddie, and Sophie? YOU didn\u2019t lose her luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, flattened body still glued to most of Irina\u2019s sweaty butt cheek, you spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think I can help with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly\u2019s smile twitched ever-so-slightly. \u201cWhat do you mean, Jake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, a bit anxious but no less deterred. \u201cI want to enjoy my vacation here with Cassie and the rest of your family as much as possible. I can\u2019t do that and help Irina at the same time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Meeting eye contact with Cassie, you signaled her to keep peeling you free. Cassie did so, while also giving you a proud wink for standing up for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was less enthusiastic. Frowning deeper, Kimberly shook her head. \u201cJake, it will only be for \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina cut her off. \u201cOh, Kimberly, I\u2019ll be fine. You know money isn\u2019t a terrible concern for me anyway. I can just buy a whole new set of clothes, make a shopping trip of it!\u201d Her full smile instantly melted the tension in the room. \u201cJake should enjoy his time here, not spend it hugging my big ol\u2019 booty! That isn\u2019t quite fair for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly huffed, but quickly composed herself. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Good solution.\u201d She looked at you, and you caught the faintest hint of annoyance in her smile. For some reason, that scared you. \u201cThis is a vacation, after all. We all need to relax and enjoy ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTension successfully diffused, Cassie finished prying you free from the clutches of Irina\u2019s butt, then took you into the bathroom. She tenderly washed the sweat and grime from your body, her smooth hands expertly massaging your body in a relaxing and sensual manner. Drying you off gently, your fianc\u00e9e helped you get dressed into fresh clothes, and held you close in her arms. It was almost as if things were returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours blew by. Having spent most of the day flying, Cassie and her family (plus Irina), decided to spend the remainder of the day exploring the resort and planning their itinerary for the coming days. Kimberly had paid for an all-expenses covered full package experience, and the total time everyone would be staying at the resort was one week, not counting this first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping you close to her at all times, Cassie and you gazed upon the sparkling beaches, spas, saunas, waterslide and wave pool, massage parlor, and more, soon losing track of just how much luxury and fun Atlantica provided. Sophie bounced excitedly from one attraction to the next, Maddie trying her hardest to slow her sister down and tame her own unabashed enthusiasm. Irina gawked at every little thing, and Kimberly smiled with motherly affection (though you could swear you caught her eyeing you at least once).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, life isn\u2019t without incident for one such as yourself. Briefly, Cassie dropped you when she tripped in a small puddle, and you found yourself trodden upon by Irina before Cassie could scoop you up again. Another time Sophie stopped suddenly and bent down at the waist to look at a little gecko crawling around outside, and Cassie ran right into her sister. Held in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s arms at stomach height, you were squished right into Sophie\u2019s cute butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-in-all though, it was a fine second half of the day, culminating in a gourmet dinner in the resort\u2019s grand hall. Returning to the hotel room after eating, you and Cassie showered together (drawing no shortage of teasing and giggles from Sophie and Maddie), stripped off your clothes, and climbed into the queen-sized bed you shared. Kimberly and Irina each had a bed in a separate room from your own, and Sophie and Maddie also shared a room. Your suite was quite large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep came easily after the day you\u2019d had, to say nothing of the pure bliss of sharing a bed with your perfect, angelic fianc\u00e9e. Cassie cuddled you up against her bare breasts, her soft skin more heavenly than any pillow in existence, and her soothing body heat keeping you warm and cozy. Giving your wife-to-be\u2019s breast a quick kiss, you closed your eyes and slipped off to dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next morning as also pretty typical of your daily routine with Cassie. Your fianc\u00e9e was a pretty heavy sleeper, and had a bit of a habit of tossing and turning. As such, it wasn\u2019t particularly surprising to find yourself crushed flat to her naked body. Best you could tell, your face was squished into the bottom of her right butt cheek, and the rest of your body was adhered to her thigh by a light sheen of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was no big deal though, as soon as Cassie awoke, she\u2019d find you stuck to her and peel you off. Cassie was brilliant at remembering you each morning, something you always cherished about her. Sure, if it was a rough morning, or there had been extenuating circumstances (read: drinking), Cassie might forget you for an hour or two, but she never let you down in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were totally unaware that, just a few minutes prior, a certain blonde-haired sister was going to potentially ruin your entire morning. Having woken up a little bit ago, Sophie decided to return, even if only briefly, to the good old days of growing up with Cassie by leaping onto her bed to wake her up. Having snuck into your room, Sophie stood eagerly by the side of the bed, barely keeping her giggles at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stirred, a small groan escaping her lips as her eyes fluttered open a bit. Stretching an arm, the brunette giantess yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2019mornin\u2026\u201d Before Cassie could finish mumbling, Sophie sprung her trap, leaping onto Cassie\u2019s bed with a manic cry of \u201cWAKE UP!\u201d. The blonde girl slammed onto her sister, her knee jamming into your body through the bedsheet Cassie had over her, smearing your face more into Cassie\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Cassie screamed and tried to throw her attacker off, instantly awake. Of course, Sophie kept her firmly pinned down, and her infectious laughter soon made it clear to Cassie what was happening. Smirking, Cassie rolled to the side to shake Sophie free, then turned the tables on her younger sister and began wrestling her down instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie laughed until her face burned bright red, and Cassie relented, out of breath but grinning from ear-to-ear. \u201cR-really Sophie?\u201d Cassie laughed. \u201cAre we back in middle school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cYep! Been so long since we\u2019ve done that, huh?\u201d In a flash, Sophie snapped a selfie of her frazzled appearance, then typed a caption, reading it aloud. \u201cJust tackled sis to wake her up, but she turned the tables. Lol.\u201d Sophie posted her image and lifted herself out of bed. \u201cMom and Maddie are heading down to the buffet breakfast, and Irina\u2019s still snoozin\u2019. Let\u2019s get going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie rolled her eyes. \u201cOf course, give me a sec to freshen up. And put on clothes.\u201d She gestured to her naked body. Rolling off the bed, Cassie headed into the private bathroom you shared with her and ran a hot wash cloth over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now that you realized something startling. Cassie passed the hot cloth over you without a second thought, scrubbing sweat from her gorgeous body. She didn\u2019t even check in the mirror for you on her way out. Had she truly forgotten about you? Was the time spent reenacting childhood silliness with Sophie reverting Cassie\u2019s attentiveness to you? This wasn\u2019t like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the room, Sophie rocked on her heels and hummed a tune while Cassie turned to her suitcase to dig out something to wear for the day. Presenting her backside to Sophie, Cassie began pulling out lingerie and a cute outfit. Sophie\u2019s attention was mostly on her phone, only occasionally flicking up to Cassie whenever the brunette made a sudden movement while rummaging in her suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace pressed firmly into Cassie\u2019s right butt cheek, you fought with every fiber of your being to wiggle and squirm for her attention, but to no avail. It would take another hour at least for you to reform without help from anyone, but that obviously wouldn\u2019t come with Cassie changing in the next two minutes. Since Cassie had clearly forgotten you at the moment, your only hope of being found before she put her clothes on over you lie with Sophie\u2026a truly frightening thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassie accidentally caught her finger on a sharp piece of plastic in her suitcase, and her frustrated exclamation was enough to draw Sophie out of her social media world for five seconds to make sure her big sis wasn\u2019t hurt. Those five seconds were all the blonde needed to see the obviously man-shaped sticker on Cassie\u2019s butt and thigh, and her concern instantly melted into pure joy. She erupted into hysterics, and snagged a quick photo of her indecent sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, Cassie turned around and frowned, licking a drop of blood from her finger. \u201cIs my pain that funny, Sophie?\u201d Cassie sighed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie waved her hand in front of her face and shook her head, trying to signal \u2018no\u2019, but her infectious giggling didn\u2019t cease. Her face grew red as she tried to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking at her sister\u2019s habit of always laughing, Cassie pulled cute purple panties and a matching bra from her suitcase, and began sliding the panties up her legs. Sophie\u2019s eyes widened and she doubled over in renewed laughter, caught between concern for your safety and the hilarity of her own sister being oblivious of her squishy fianc\u00e9. She tried to blurt out a coherent sentence, and failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric of the panties passed over you, and soon snapped into place around Cassie\u2019s shapely rear, slamming your face firmly into her posterior. You tried to talk, move, or do anything anyway, but you could not. In fact, in your total darkness of ass flesh, you didn\u2019t even know why Sophie was laughing. For all you knew, she was just giggling at social media, and hadn\u2019t spotted you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie couldn\u2019t stay mad at what she still thought was Sophie being a bit mean, not when her younger sister was so exuberant. Beginning to laugh herself, Cassie struggled to hook her bra on as her breasts quivered and shook. Seeing her older sister struggle tickled yet another funny bone in Sophie, and the carefree giantess collapsed to the floor, wheezing now. Both sisters laughed uproariously, with Cassie hoping they weren\u2019t waking up any of their room neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sophie essentially defeated by her own giggly nature, Cassie was free to dig out an eye-catching miniskirt from her suitcase and slide it up her legs and into place around her waist. The skirt hugged her legs tightly, but didn\u2019t prevent any movement either. Of course, this meant the skirt not only totally hid you from view but also kept you plastered in place on her thigh, unable to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on a tasteful but still appealing blouse, Cassie passed a brush through her hair and grabbed her purse. Sophie had mostly settled down, so Cassie helped her adorable knucklehead of a sister off the floor. Sophie\u2019s phone had also fallen onto the carpet, but as Cassie went to retrieve it, she noticed it had fallen face-up, and was also still unlocked. Smile fading, her eyes narrowed on the picture on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot of Cassie, bare naked, standing in front of her suitcase, with you firmly glued to her butt and thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blinked once. Then twice. She looked at Sophie and showed the photo. \u201cSoph\u2026what is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie looked at the photo for a second and giggled. \u201cOh yeah. That\u2019s what I was laughing about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026okay. What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie titled her head. \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s Jake stuck to your butt?\u201d She replied simply, and Cassie paled. Sophie was unphased. \u201cI\u2026didn\u2019t mention that earlier? Was I too busy laughing? Oops!\u201d She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Cassie another fifteen minutes to undress, peel you free, and then let you reform, and she did her fair share of complaining to Sophie for endangering you by not telling her right away. Sophie apologized to Cassie (strangely, not to you), and was back to smiling and laughing a minute later. Cassie didn\u2019t stay mad long, and soon both you and her were ready to go to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie carried you protectively as the three of you headed to the dining hall and the huge breakfast buffet. You complimented her on her beautiful outfit, and took note of Sophie\u2019s eye-catching and rather risqu\u00e9 swimsuit attire. Soon though, all eyes were on the sweeping assortment of food being offered. Kimberly waved you over to a table she\u2019d saved, and you each took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, there were only five chairs at the table, even though there was room for a sixth. At the moment, it worked though, as Irina was still asleep. Kimberly was still eating, and Maddie was just finishing her meal. Sophie claimed the chair next to Cassie, so your fianc\u00e9e flashed you an apologetic look and then sat you down beside Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and Sophie went to grab plates of breakfast for themselves and for you, so you preoccupied yourself with a bit of conversation with Maddie and Kimberly. You asked the Smalls women their plans for the day, to which Maddie responded with beach swimming, volleyball, and a dip in the sauna, and Kimberly voiced her desire for a full-body massage and spa treatment. It was the first truly normal conversation you\u2019d had with your future mother-in-law, which was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife-to-be and sister-in-law-to-be returned with food, and you all dug in. It was a bit hard for you to reach your plate from the chair, but you managed. The food was exceptional, and Cassie had picked out all of your favorites. The entire experience was wholly enjoyable, and continued as such for the next ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was soon drawn into conversation with Sophie, and Maddie excused herself to head down to the beach. Kimberly hadn\u2019t said a word to you in the past few minutes, though you thought you saw her glance at you once. Just then, she looked over her daughters and behind them, and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrina! Over here!\u201d Kimberly shouted. She pointed to the seat beside her\u2026YOUR seat. \u201cSaved you a seat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, and finished eating a sausage. Swallowing, you looked up at Kimberly. \u201cUm\u2026Miss Smalls\u2026I\u2019m still\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off by Cassie and Sophie laughing loudly at a joke, their happy voices drowning out your own. Kimberly joined in their laughter too, so your follow-up attempt failed too. The table was comprised of individual chairs each two or three feet apart, so you couldn\u2019t just reach over and poke Kimberly to get her attention either. Maybe climbing up onto the table would work best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached for the wood, your hands, still slick with syrup, slid right off the table. It was an embarrassingly display, really. Desperately, you licked the syrup off, which only made you choke in your haste. You coughed and sputtered out another cry to Kimberly, who simply laughed at another of Sophie\u2019s jokes and sipped her apple juice. Once more, you swore she made eye contact with you from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, your chair was overcome by shadow, and you whipped around in fear. All you had time to glance was the gargantuan ass of Irina, her smooth and creamy globes of flesh held only by an almost non-existent white thong that practically flossed her cheeks. Silently and weakly, you raised your hands as her rump descended, slapping onto the chair with an audible \u2018squelch noise\u2019. Audible to you at least, as it fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into what was apparently now HER chair, Irina wriggled her ass to get comfortable, twisting and grinding her meaty flesh on top of you. Your body was reduced to a pathetic squishy blob in seconds, half of your body stuck at her crack and the rest against her left cheek. As she twisted in her chair, you slowly began slipping towards and then past her thong, her sweaty skin offering no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your entire upper half was past her thong and firmly inside of her butt crack. The heat and pressure on your doubled instantly, as did the veritable buckets of sweat dripping onto you. You tried to thrash and squirm, but your movements were entirely hampered by Irina\u2019s the sheer heft of Irina\u2019s butt. Her flesh was simply to overbearing and jiggly to give you and freedom to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You even gave me a plate!\u201d Irina grinned happily, digging into the pancake you\u2019d made almost no progress on, and downing a gulp of your apple juice. Kimberly smiled warmly at her best friend, then glanced at Cassie and Sophie, who were gazing at Sophie\u2019s phone, absorbed into some silly social media posts. She smiled, and began talking with Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s jaw-dropping ass covered the entire seat of the chair, and by extension you, so not a soul could possibly see you or even know you were there. The black-haired giantess herself certainly didn\u2019t feel you. Your body was almost nothing to her, let alone just her butt, and she\u2019d established her dominance over you in seconds. For the second time in as many days, her ass threatened to claim you. As nice as she seemed, you regretted every meeting this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst was still to come though, as the buildup of sweat in Irina\u2019s ass crack was piling on your body, quickly forming a small puddle. This bothered Irina, who decided to discreetly sneak a hand down to her ass, lift up her left cheek, and poke her index finger into her crack, trying to scratch the itch. Kimberly watched her with rapt attention, eyes flickering between Irina and her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s fingernail caught your lower half, and as she moved to scratch her itch, pushed your lower half into her butt crack, past her thong. You mentally screamed and tried to fit her, but to no avail. You simply couldn\u2019t move or squirm or do anything at all. Heedless to your silent pleas for salvation, Irina\u2019s efforts to scratch her itch wedged your malleable body fully inside of her sweaty crack, completely hidden.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She removed her finger a moment later, satisfied that the bothersome feeling was gone, and let her barely-there thong settle back into place, trapping you inside the dank cavern of moist darkness. She caught Kimberly\u2019s eye and smiled sheepishly, embarrassed she\u2019d been noticed, then returned to chowing down on her\u2026or rather your\u2026pancakes. Kimberly picked up the conversation again, and the two women were back at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Irina\u2019s sweltering ass crack, your form had been balled up and smushed against her left cheek face first. The sticky sweat adhered to your body like glue, pinning you in place. Each slight movement that the curvaceous woman made sent ripples through her flesh, slapping hot skin against your body. The stench was unbearable, and the occasional rumbling from deeper inside her filled you with impending dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes of utter hellish torment passed inside of Irina\u2019s booty prison, until finally Cassie and Sophie finished their first plates. Eager to finish her meal with a donut and also replenish her orange juice, Cassie looked away from Sophie\u2019s phone and picked up her things, only to notice Irina\u2019s presence for the first time. She blushed and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrina! Hello!\u201d She grinned. \u201cSorry, got caught up in Soph\u2019s feed. How are you this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina gave her a warm, motherly smile. \u201cExcellent dear, slept like a cozy, stress-free log. I love my girls, I really do, but they can be a hassle back at home. Getting away like this is a godsend. Though I suppose Selena will want me to buy something for her after putting up with Persephone for a whole week\u2026\u201d Irina trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly bumped Irina\u2019s elbow playfully. \u201cWant to hit up the massage and spa after this? I\u2019m dying for a full-body relaxation experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina beamed. \u201cOh, of course! I\u2019ve been a bit sore lately, and would kill for the whole package on MY whole package!\u201d Irina winked playfully and slapped her butt, the loud sound reverberating through the dining hall. Sophie broke into giggles and Cassie bit back her own laugh. Kimberly shook her head at her friend\u2019s antics, but there was a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in the swamp of stench and sweat, Irina\u2019s slap had an entirely different effect. Her whole butt quivered like a bowl of jello, your body tossed around and crushed over and over by her shifting fleshy cheeks. Terrifyingly, the continuous movement shifted you an inch deeper into her ass, further into a darkness you might never return from. You begged for freedom, but your mute cries did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and Sophie stood up and turned towards the buffet, walking away while chatting. Kimberly and Irina ate and talked for a few minutes, planning the wonderful and amazing massage they\u2019d be getting in less than an hour thanks to their premium resort passes. It was only when Cassie and Sophie returned with fresh plates that your fianc\u00e9e froze in her tracks and stared hard at Irina. Her brow furrowed and her frown deepened, only for her to finally react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Irina! You\u2019re sitting in Jake\u2019s seat.\u201d Cassie said. \u201cYou might want to move to Maddie\u2019s empty chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, my apologies!\u201d Irina smacked her forehead. \u201cI didn\u2019t even check whose seat this was.\u201d The black-haired beauty stood up slowly, but still grabbed your food plate, and shifted around behind Kimberly towards Maddie\u2019s chair at the corner of the table. Apparently, she hadn\u2019t made the connection that your chair indicated your food, but you couldn\u2019t do much about that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you couldn\u2019t do much of anything as Irina\u2019s butt wobbled and shook as she moved, banging you around in her meaty derriere, before she slammed down once more into Maddie\u2019s vacant chair. The swift slamming motion jammed your body forward, another two inches deeper into the abyss of her butt. You became more and more squished as the already tight space constricted into a painful choking hold on you, and you felt the sweat begin bonding against your body, threatening to firmly adhere you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Cassie\u2019s mind, Irina wasn\u2019t blind enough to sit without checking her seat, so clearly you were grabbing more food from the buffet, or using the bathroom. That would explain your absence. She didn\u2019t even consider that you\u2019d been sat on, and went right back to eating, laughing, and enjoying her family time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly, meanwhile watched her daughter intently after she asked Irina to move, noting her daughter's apparently relaxed expression. She looked down at the chair Irina had been sitting in, and saw nothing out of the ordinary. As Irina sat again and Cassie turned back to eating, Kimberly smiled, and spared a glance at her best friend\u2019s humongous booty, still wiggling a bit after sitting down. Taking a bite of her muffin, Kimberly felt satisfied, and began chatting with Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fifteen minutes passed, and by this point your squishy body had just about cemented itself to the hourglass-figured giantess\u2019 left butt cheek. Molded and mashed into a small lump, you\u2019d been flattened out and firmly engrained into the flesh of her cheek, deep inside of her crack where no light could reach you. The overpowering smell was the only sensation. You couldn\u2019t hear, couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t talk, and could barely muster the strength to dream that a miracle would save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Smalls family and Irina finally finished breakfast, the four beautiful women stood, and a polite resort maid cleaned up their dirty plates dutifully. Stretching her back, Cassie grinned as Sophie struck a pose and took a selfie with their group, sending the image as a post on her feed. Each giantess gathered their belongings, and began walking towards the exit of the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly purposefully held back, and glanced at her best friend\u2019s scrumptious posterior bouncing up and down in an entrancing motion. You weren\u2019t anywhere to be seen. The Smalls matriarch nodded in an almost approving manner, and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where is everyone headed right now?\u201d She asked. \u201cI know Irina and I are heading straight to the massage of our dreams!\u201d<br>\r\nIrina hugged herself. \u201cOoh\u2026I can almost feel it already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie pointed outside. \u201cUh, how could I not go ride the waterslide, mom! I\u2019ve brought my waterproof phone case and everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was thinking of asking Jake what he\u2026wanted\u2026\u201d Cassie trailed off. \u201cUh, wait. Where\u2019s Jake? Where is he?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly rubbed her daughter\u2019s shoulder and spoke affectionately. \u201cDidn\u2019t he go to the bathroom or something? Maybe you missed him leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Nonchalantly, she scratched the side of her butt, the movement catching Cassie\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, your fianc\u00e9e began wondering if maybe you actually HAD been sat on by accident. Suspicious, Cassie pretended to scan the dining hall for signs of you while circling around Irina, only to then peer intently at the bodacious black-haired woman\u2019s derriere. Unfortunately, there was no way at all to see you from the outside, and a lack of your squashed form crushed Cassie\u2019s dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie bounced on her heels. \u201cYou can hang with me until he catches up, Cass!\u201d She suggested hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly immediately agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. We don\u2019t have time to waste, and we can simply spend time with Jake later. After all, we have a whole week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, still a bit unsure, bit her lip. \u201cUh\u2026yeah\u2026I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina playfully bumped Cassie\u2019s hip with her ass. \u201cCome on girl, no moping about! Time\u2019s wasting, and that massage is calling my name!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassie slowly nodded her head. You had to just be somewhere else. Irina would have noticed if she had sat on you. Finally shaking the thought free from her mind Cassie went off with her sister, planning on catching up with you later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled as her daughter finally gave up on finding you. She looked at her friend and laughed to herself thinking how perfect this vacation was turning out. If this massage went according to plan, Cassie might just be free from marrying such a small worthless man. Kimberly stared at Irina\u2019s booty and imagined you being stuck there for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Irina, let\u2019s get the massage of our dreams! I\u2019ve heard they use all the latest techniques, do the entire body, and use some of the finest oils! We will be feeling years younger I\u2019d wager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes! This is going to be wonderful! I hope I can get an extra good massage for my big booty! It could really use it!\u201d Irina commented gleefully and gave her butt another smack. This caused another major jiggling session to her ass and caused you to be shook even deeper into the canyon that was her ass crack! You couldn\u2019t believe how this day was going. This was supposed to be a vacation with you fianc\u00e9e and now you were nothing more than a lump in another woman\u2019s butt. You tried to move but so much flattening has been done that you were little more than a sheet of paper in her crack. You were beginning to worry what may happen to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, Kimberly and Irina arrived at the resort spa. After showing their passes, they were immediately brought back into a fancy room. The lights were dim and the atmosphere cozy. They were instructed to strip down and lay out on the two tables. Their masseuses would be in shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly took her time stripping as she was watching her friend rather intently. As Irina stripped out of her bottoms, she bent over giving Kimberly a direct view into her ass crack. What Kimberly saw at first shocked and then pleased her. She saw your pitiful body plastered deep in Irina\u2019s crack. In fact you seemed to be as deep as you could be. As Irina straightened back up, Kimberly notes how your position was immediately crushed by her cheeks as soon as she started to straighten up! Yes it would be very hard indeed for you to unsquish in that position, actually probably close to impossible! Kimberly couldn\u2019t help but giggle at this, which caused Irina to turn and raise her eyebrows at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny Kim? Is there something wrong with my butt?\u201d Irina asked with a hint of aggravation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no not at all Irina! I was just thinking if poor Jake were here he wouldn\u2019t know what to do!\u201d Kimberly lied to her friend. She almost felt sorry for your predicament but reasoned it away by thinking this was for Cassie\u2019s own good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess you\u2019re right Kim! Poor guy wouldn\u2019t know what to do, I mean you are very good looking yourself! I wonder if he was here who he would stare at more?\u201d Irina giggled at her question, \u201cHe would probably want to get all over this one though,\u201d she said as she again smacked her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely make out the conversation. When Irina has bent over, you had barely been able to make out Kimberly, and you swore she was looking right at you! Then as Irina straightened back up you could no longer see anything. After a few moments of discussion you could hardly hear, your entire world was shook again as you heard a loud smack. You groaned how often is she going to do that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly and Irina settled onto their respective tables and awaited the massage that was coming. Laying on their stomachs did spread their cheeks slightly apart and as this happened  you redoubled your efforts to reform. You just hoped you would have enough time before the massage started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly gave a quick glance back at Irina\u2019s ass and thought she could make out a slight movement. She frowned, if this was going to work she needed you to stay stuck there for this massage. Finally she decided to reach over and pinch Irina right on her butt cheek! Irina gave a small yelp and clenched her cheeks together hard! You were again completely flattened out. You whimpered but couldn\u2019t do anything to stop this! Right after you heard two sets of footsteps and the finality of what was about to happen set in. You prayed that somehow Cassie would come looking for you here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly saw that her pinch did the trick and you had been effectively decimated into submission. Then two masseuses walked into the room. One was a small lady while the other was a tall lady with bigger hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are ready to get started,\u201d the taller lady stated, \u201cI specialize in deep tissue massages. Every muscle will be treated and you will feel brand new. My colleague does the finishing touches to smooth everything out. She specializes in all the oils as well. We work as a team so the only question is who wants to be first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly decided to let Irina pick. She felt that with that last squash there was no way you would be able to reform in time either way. Irina blurted out,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOoh! Please start with me!\u201d Irina bounced with excitement, looking like the world\u2019s curviest school kid. Kimberly couldn\u2019t help but shake her head and laugh, both at her best friend\u2019s energetic disposition and her own secretive knowledge of a tiny tagalong about to experience Irina\u2019s massage right there with her. Content, Kimberly laid out on her table and closed her eyes, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The tall masseuse, named Kara, nodded. She flexed her hands and rolled her shoulders as she walked over beside Irina, who could hardly stay settled with her excitement. Every little movement and shake she made while lying on the table jostled you around along with her plump, jiggly flesh. Still, you put every ounce of determination and strength you still possessed into trying to reform before your fate was well and truly sealed\u2026perhaps permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara placed her large, firm hands on Irina\u2019s shoulders, curling her fingers around the black-haired giantess\u2019 clavicle. Irina stopped her giggling and slowly arched her back in surprise, the masseuse\u2019s touch tingling her skin. Like a practiced professional, Kara eased Irina back into a prone position on the table while tracing her fingers down Irina\u2019s back, letting the carefree woman grow accustomed to the sensation of her hands on her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Irina settled, a sleepy smile growing on her beautiful face. Satisfied that it was time to begin, Kara winked at her partner and got to work. She began at Irina\u2019s upper body, working her well-trained fingers into the woman\u2019s tanned back. Irina let out a few quiet moans of happiness, each noise affirming Kara that she was doing her job perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Kara\u2019s trail, her partner masseuse, who\u2019s name was Talia, dipped her delicate hands in viscous and aromatic oil and rubbed Irina\u2019s smooth flesh in slow and rhythmic circles, easing the oil into the relaxed woman\u2019s skin. Irina shivered briefly at the cool temperature of the oil, but her face soon glazed over in a look of pure bliss, and she slipped into gentle slumber, snoring quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDutifully, Kara and Talia worked like a well-oiled machine, working their way onto Irina\u2019s sides, then her lower back, then onto her hips and waist. Moving a bit out of order, they worked her thick thighs and long legs, ending by flexing and gently massaging her toes individually. Irina didn\u2019t budge an inch, but her dopey smile grew and grew as she sank deeper into an intense state of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the moment of truth came, as Kara and Talia only had to massage Irina\u2019s prodigious derriere before moving to the sleeping woman\u2019s front. Kara, in a professional manner (though she couldn\u2019t deny Irina was absurdly gorgeous), examined her sleeping client\u2019s booty in an attempt to figure out the best way to tackle massaging it. By complete chance, she glimpsed briefly inside the black-haired giantess\u2019 butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the past fifteen minutes of the massage you had been working tirelessly to try and reform, only to realize just how horribly Irina\u2019s meaty cheeks had pulverized your body over the last hour. You\u2019d only managed to marginally unstick one of your arms and your left foot in the time you\u2019d been granted. Your body was still almost fully imprinted on Irina\u2019s butt cheek, and worse still, your partially smeared and squished body was hardly distinguishable as human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her brief glimpse, Kara\u2019s eyes certainly did pass over you, with what little light shined down from above into Irina\u2019s canyon-like abyss of her ass crack. However, to the masseuse, your poor trapped body looked more like a slightly odd-shaped beauty mark, an almost unnoticeable stain on Irina\u2019s otherwise flawless, goddess-like body. Not paying you any more mind, Kara signaled Talia to prepare the oil and continued the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike earlier, Talia led first, dripping cool, cleansing oil across Irina\u2019s ass and into her crack. Her tiny hands spread the oil evenly across Irina\u2019s tanned flesh like she was buttering bread, and when she had finished, Kara stepped in, employing the same practiced roughness and thorough massaging as she\u2019d used earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara dug her fingers into Irina\u2019s jello-like cheeks, grabbing one cheek in each hand in a giant fistful. Kneading Irian\u2019s butt like bread, she squished and pushed her cheeks up and down, around in a circle, and squeezed them together. Her hands squished and pressed Irian\u2019s flesh like dough, and it would\u2019ve almost been comical had you seen this massage taking place from a spectator position, but unfortunately you had a front row seat to the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Irina was experiencing unparalleled relaxation, you were trapped in a prison of hellish torment. From Kara\u2019s initial slamming of Irina\u2019s cheeks, you were crushed flat between the unrelenting walls of flesh, the slight progress you\u2019d made over the past fifteen minutes ruined in one small second. Instantly you were a paper-thin smudge once more, coated in sweat and luxury oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara\u2019s working of Irina\u2019s butt cheeks was only the beginning, and the woman soon began snaking her fingers down inside Irina\u2019s crack. She grabbed and squeezed Irina\u2019s booty cheeks repeatedly, not missing an inch. Once or twice her fingers swiped past your body, and you prayed beyond all hopes that you\u2019d catch onto her finger and be pulled free, but your foolish optimism was for naught, and everything you\u2019d feared finally came to pass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tall masseuse finally planted her index and middle finger squarely on your body, and as she gave Irina\u2019s ass a tender squeeze, her fingers forcefully shoved you hard against the sleeping woman\u2019s skin. Irina\u2019s sweat and your own sweat adhered like glue, and as the cleansing oil began to dry and sink into Irina\u2019s flesh, you felt your skin tingle as it started gluing itself in place, like it was bonding to Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara didn\u2019t just squeeze though, as she made sure to thoroughly rub up and down, her fingers firmly pushing into Irina\u2019s jiggly cheek. As she worked her way deeper into Irina\u2019s ass, you mentally screamed as your body was dragged along with Irina\u2019s finger. Not only did your squishy body distort and smear under the scrubbing pressure of Kara\u2019s fingers, but by the time you finally were plastered enough to not move, you were as far as you could possibly be inside of Irina, your arm touching her anus. The smell was overwhelmingly atrocious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she was aware of her own cruelty, Kara finally moved on to Irina\u2019s other cheek, but the damage had already been fully done to you. After the intense rubbing and grinding she\u2019d given you, you weren\u2019t recognizable as human to anyone but the closest observer. Your tanned flesh blended in almost perfectly to Irina\u2019s own, and with your face pressed into her doughy flesh, you had not even a slight hope of catching someone\u2019s eye or screaming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ten minutes was a blur to you as Kara and Talia finished Irina\u2019s ass. Then, with a bit of effort, they managed to flip Irina onto her back without even waking up the peacefully sleeping woman. Getting to work on her front, they had not the slightest clue in the world of what they\u2019d just done to you, buried under mounds of flesh and so deep inside Irina\u2019s butt. You\u2019d been stuck bad before the massage, but the drying oil Talia had used bound you to Irina like super glue, and Kara\u2019s rubbing and squishing had smudged all of your human features into an inconspicuous tan blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours you wallowed in pity, unable to give even a half-hearted attempt at reforming. Lying on her back, Irina\u2019s cheeks had squeezed together a bit, her meaty globes easily constricting around you tightly, trapping you in sweaty and smelly torture. Irina didn\u2019t move either for the whole two hours, not even as her own massage ended and Kimberly\u2019s began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kimberly\u2019s massage ended, your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother stood up off the table and gently shook Irina\u2019s body, rousing the deep sleeper from her happy dreams. Groggy, Irina rubbed her eyes, gave a lazy smile to Kimberly, and then rolled slowly off of the table, hopping down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt jostled quite a bit as she hit the floor, but you barely felt it. Wedged you unbelievably far into her crack, the constant shaking of her cheeks was barely felt by you. This was hardly acceptable consolation for being stuck further into Irina then you had ever been trapped in a woman\u2019s butt, let alone smeared into a tan blotch and engrained to her skin by the oil. It was as if you were a tattoo on Irina\u2019s skin, and also one that was barely noticeable against her tan flesh tone and sealed away somewhere where no one was likely to ever look for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly discreetly fell behind her best friend as they shuffled over to their swimsuits. She looked intently at Irina\u2019s ass, and even tried to sneak a peek between her friend\u2019s jiggling cheeks. You were nowhere to be seen, and Kimberly had to fight to keep the satisfactory look off of her face, passing it off as a pleasantly relaxed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina wrangled her skimpy top back over her massive mammaries, and then wiggled her thong bottoms up her long legs and settled it between her cheeks. You couldn\u2019t even feel her thong anymore, as it didn\u2019t wedge far enough into her butt to touch you. You noticed its effects though, as what little slivers of natural heat touched your body were gone, replaced fully by Irina\u2019s sweltering, swampy crack. Fresh air didn\u2019t seem like it was getting in either, a sickening feeling rising in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing, Irina took a deep breath and let it out, her smile growing into a radiant expression. \u201cOh, goodness Kimberly! You don\u2019t know how much I needed this!\u201d Irina gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly returned her friend\u2019s smile, part of her good mood for an entirely different reason. \u201cOh, I know exactly what you mean. I feel ten years younger, at least!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina giggled. \u201cWe look gorgeous too, don\u2019t we?\u201d She gestured to herself. \u201cThose masseuses really worked us good, I\u2019m nearly glowing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly nodded at her curvaceous and scantily dressed friend. \u201cYou certainly are. I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t a soul alive who wouldn\u2019t kill for some up-close appreciation of your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina blushed, but didn\u2019t refute her friend\u2019s compliment. She also totally missed Kimberly\u2019s thinly veiled allusion to a certain squishy individual very much hating their up-close appreciation of Irina\u2019s body. She then sauntered over to the massage parlor\u2019s exit, grabbing the door and holding it open for Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s next on our agenda?\u201d Irina inquired. Her smile was carefree and full of enthusiasm. \u201cAfter waking up, I feel like I could take on the whole world. What are we doing next? It\u2019s just the two of us after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smirked and gave her best friend a friendly hug. \u201cYes, it is. And, we can do whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world of sweat and darkness, all sounds from outside muffled beyond comprehension, you could only push away your despair and silently pray for rescue. Cassie was your only possible savior now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimberly smiled as her two daughters went off to enjoy some time together. She couldn\u2019t believe how easy it was to get Jake squashed and hidden from sight. She would have to thank Sophie later for distracting Cassie so well. She again stole a quick glance at Irina\u2019s ass and smiled thinking of how much you were being squished right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that Kimberly hated you per se it was just you seemed so tiny and helpless that maybe you weren\u2019t the right man for her daughter. She knew how sweet Cassie was and she felt like her daughter was dating you out of pity instead of love. Kimberly has decided that she was going to use this week to make Cassie forget about you and this was step one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were still being squashed back and forth by honestly the biggest ass you had ever been in. You groaned thinking again how nice Irina was but how horrible she was being to you without even realizing it! You also thought back to all the small glances from Kimberly before she had called her friend to sit on top of you. Kimberly has to be doing this on purpose! What was causing her to do this though? You ran through every interaction you had had so far with her and you could not think of anything that would have made her want to do this to you. You were slowly coming to the conclusion that she just didn\u2019t like you, maybe because you had got engaged to her daughter without even meeting the family first. It had to be something along those lines. You were busy trying to think of a way to impress Kimberly enough so that she would accept you. At this point you were willing to do anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this place! The spa looks amazing! I have heard it is one of the best in the world and their full body massages are to die for!\u201d Irina gushed as she and Kimberly stepped through the door. \u201cI have this awful wedgie though! It is worse than usual almost feels like something else is in there,\u201d she says with some aggravation squeezing her massive glutes  together to try and stop the unpleasantness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGasp! Oh I bet I know what it is!\u201d Kimberly exclaimed to her friend, \u201cJake was sitting in the seat when I called you over. I hadn\u2019t thought about it til now but I bet your big butt must have gobbled  him up.\u201d Kimberly have a small smirk. She knew that was exactly what had happened but was feigning ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s eyes went wide as she put a hand to her mouth. \u201cYou know you might be right Kim, oh gosh I feel so awful about doing that to him. I mean he probably should have said something but maybe he was speechless thanks to how huge my ass is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly nodded her head, \u201cThat is probably exactly what happened. Look let\u2019s go over here to this restroom and I will be happy to remove him for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded her head enthusiastically and practically ran over to the restroom. She was trying her best to help you as quickly as possible but moving that fast only had the effect of completely shaking your entire world and steamrolling your body between her cheeks. You gave a small whimper from within your ass prison. Why does this always happen to you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina went into the bathroom followed by Kimberly. Irina wasted no time in peeling her thong out of her ass crack and leaning against the wall displaying her ass to her friend. Kimberly crouched down to get a good look. She at first saw no sign of you at all. Raising her eyebrows, she placed her hands on Irina\u2019s rump and peeled her cheeks away from each other. Then she saw your balled up form still stuck to Irina\u2019s left cheek. Chuckling, she kept holding the left cheek and used her right hand to peel you out of your prison. You came free with a squelch. Irina let out a small gasp as your body came free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow he was really stuck tight wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Irina exclaimed turning around and fixing her bikini back in place. She stared at your small balled up form in Kimberly\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes indeed! For a moment I didn\u2019t know if he was gonna come free! You go on ahead to your massage, I want to speak with him first and make sure he is alright.\u201d Kimberly said to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded her head and reminded Kimberly to catch up and enjoy a massage as well. Kimberly smiled and nodded her head as Irina left the restroom. Then she turned to stare at you with a look of disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh what am I gonna do with you Jake? First day here and you already get into a horrible situation! It is lucky I remembered where you had been, who knows what would have happened to you! Honesty, I just don\u2019t know why my daughter is with someone who can\u2019t even call out or dodge something that you could obviously see coming,\u201d Kimberly ranted as your body was slowly popping back into shape. You winced at her complaints and actually took some of it to heart. Why hadn\u2019t you just jumped out of the chair? Sure your legs would have squished but then you could have gotten Cassie to get you out of the floor afterwards. You hung your head in shame and apologized to the matriarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly grinned from ear to ear seeing you hang your head in shame and apologizing. Then your next question made her entire week, \u201cMs Smalls, how can I make this up to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was ecstatic! Not only had she caused this mishap to happen, you were now begging for a way to make it up to her. She was barely able to compose herself as you looked back up to her. She furrowed her brow as if in deep thought before saying, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, here\u2019s an idea!\u201d Kimberly finally announced. Even from your position on the bathroom counter, she towered over you, and there was something foreboding about the otherwise contented smile on her face. Swallowing your fear, you prompted her to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what\u2019s your i-idea\u2026Miss Smalls?\u201d You meekly inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething simple.\u201d She explained. \u201cI\u2019m a forgiving person Jake, and I want to like you, for sure. You just need to earn my trust a bit more. Prove you can handle yourself and help others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026go on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how about a bit of shopping? We passed by a rather impressive gift shop earlier. I\u2019d love an Atlantic souvenir!\u201d Kimberly crossed her arms. \u201cIf you can go get one for me, I\u2019ll consider everything \u2018made up\u2019. I\u2019ll even provide the money, you\u2019ll just be my delivery boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brightened instantly. \u201cIs that it? I can absolutely do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. That\u2019s what I like to hear, Jake. Oh, and the bigger souvenir the better. Impress me.\u201d Kimberly added at the last second. She fought down a growing smirk as your enthusiasm dimmed a bit. She knew full well how much trouble it\u2019d be to lug a massive souvenir to her at your stature, but this test wouldn\u2019t be fun without some challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you agreed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get on that right away Miss Smalls! You can count on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kimberly lifted you off of the counter and carried you out of the women\u2019s restroom. Setting you on the floor, she dug a crisp fifty bill from her purse and handed it to you. As it was too big to even fit into your pocket, you folded it in half and held it closely to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Kimberly pointed down the hall. \u201cWalk to the far end, take a left, and then a right. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d She turned the opposite direction. \u201cI\u2019ll be down this hallway, a short right, and then up some stairs. If I\u2019m in the middle of a massage when you return, wait patiently.\u201d She looked you directly in the eye and lessened her smile. \u201cIf you AREN\u2019T there when I\u2019m done with the massage, I will be incredibly disappointed in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, and managed a confident grin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing! I might even be back before your massage starts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly\u2019s eyebrows raised, indicated your response had impressed her. Without another word, she turned on her heels and walked away. Taking one more second to psyche yourself up, you dashed full tilt down the hallway, following the directions Kimberly had dictated to you. Gift shop, here you came!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of living at your height had done wonders for your endurance and stamina, so the sprint down the hallway was nothing to you, even considering the lengths you had to go. What was less easy to deal with were the constant obstacles thrust into your path. What had looked like a straight and clear hallway became anything but in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid pushing her cleaning cart ran over your feet, which delayed you a few seconds. While you were pinned down, a groggy woman desperate for her morning coffee stumbled out of her room and decimated you beneath her fuzzy slippers. It took two minutes to peel off of the floor and keep running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the first hallway, a group of teenage girls rounded the corner ahead of you, rushing to the breakfast buffet before it closed. Either looking at their phones or each other, the girls remained oblivious of you, and in your haste to run, you were out of breath and unable to shout at them as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped past the first girl, only for the second to kick you in the stomach. Falling back into the path of the first girl, her designer stilettos stabbed down onto your face, causing you to cry out in pain. Sadly, your cries were deafened by their incessant giggling and gossiping. The other five girls trod on you in turn, a barrage of sneakers and heels ripping pieces of your clothes to shreds. Amazingly, the fifty-dollar bill remained unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the home stretch, you dodged another two girls on their way to the dining hall, but collided with a third woman\u2019s suitcase while you were distracted. Momentarily stunned, your squished face stuck to the suitcase as the woman rolled it inside her room. Scrambling like crazy, you popped your head free and rushed between her legs back into the hallway right as she closed her suite\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gift shop was now before you, and the coast was seemingly clear. Grinning with a sense of victory, you dashed across the lobby and into the gift shop. True to Kimberly\u2019s word, it was surprisingly big, with shelf after shelf stuff with knickknacks and clothing branded with Atlantica\u2019s logo. Several unique displays were set up, with brand new items for sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what Kimberly would like as a souvenir, so you scanned the aisles until something caught your eye. Near the back of the store was a sizable stuffed bear plushie, easily three feet tall. The bear was adorably designed and coated in soft, fuzzy fur. It had on an Atlantica hat and shirt. You just barely remembered Cassie telling you that Kimberly once owned a stuff bear as a kid that she cherished. Miss Smalls would HAVE to be impressed by both a large souvenir and one with a personal connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrutting over to the display, you noticed for the first time that you weren\u2019t alone in the gift shop. A woman was pacing around the sides of the store, staring at items on the shelf before marking something on a small clipboard she was carrying. You also noticed a nametag on a lanyard hanging from her neck, and realized she was Atlantica staff, and most likely the gift shop\u2019s attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had platinum blonde hair worn straight down her back, cut off at about her shoulder blades. What little of her skin was showing was pale and smooth, and you caught a glimmer of blue eyes behind her cute glasses. She was dressed in typical employee attire, a dark blue button-up blouse and dark blue dress pants. Still, the dress pants complimented her figure well, and you could tell her chest was having a hard time fitting beneath her blouse. At a guess, she was twenty-six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached the bear, only to find it stuck. It\u2019s arm had become hooked on the display. Groaning in frustration, you pulled and yanked on the bear\u2019s other arm, trying to yank the plushie three times your size off of the wall. It was a comical sight\u2026or at least it was until the bear popped free, along with the two other bears above it. An avalanche of bears fell from the wall, right on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, stuffed bears didn\u2019t weigh a ton, and though you were partially squished, you were able to wriggle out from under the pile. Still gripping the fifty dollars, you struggled to stand up, dropping the cash beside you as you caught your breath. Randomly, a light in the store above you flickered out, so you looked up to see what that was about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you realized a light hadn\u2019t gone out, but had been blocked. By a shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee\u2019s shoe stomped down onto you, crushing your body like an accordion, crumpling you flat. Your face was stretched out into a comical expression of shock, not unlike a cartoon. Pressed into the treads of the girl\u2019s flat, you couldn\u2019t so much as whimper at the sudden twist of fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard the commotion, the employee had walked over to investigate why the bears had taken a tumble. Her gaze was locked entirely on the broken hook on the wall, not on the bears themselves. By extension, this explained why she\u2019d missed you on the floor to. She did hear the squishing sound you made though, and looked down at the ground in confusion. All she saw was the bears, her own two feet, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Fifty dollars?! Hell yes!\u201d The girl exclaimed with glee. Bending down, she scooped up your fifty-dollar bill hastily, glancing around to make sure no one had seen her. Satisfied, she slid the bill into her back pocket, tucking it in neatly. \u201cUnexpected bonus, but I\u2019ll take it!\u201d The girl said softly, ending with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then adjusted the broken hook and returned the bears to their proper positions, her foot twisting side to side as she worked. This had the unfortunate and painful side effect of grinding you beneath her sole, crushing you flatter and flatter. It was only when she finished that her attention drew back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, swear I stepped on something.\u201d The girl said. Lifting up her right foot, she saw it was spotless. Checking her left, her eyes finally locked onto you for the first time. However, by this point, you looked far from human. Frowning in confusion, the girl picked you from her sole, peeling your flattened body free. She set her foot back down and deposited you into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl scrutinized you closely, smirking at your goofy looking stretched face of surprise. To her, you appeared to be a flat disc several inches wide that also looked like a crushed cartoon guy. She traced a finger along your face, and rubbed her thumb against your back. She could also tell that you were a bit squishy and stretchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked around the store, then back at you. \u201cNo, seriously, what are you? It\u2019s almost like my own shoe did this to you, what with your weird face.\u201d The girl laughed softly, oblivious to the ironic truth of her observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you did everything in your power to reform as fast as possible, but the going was tough and slow. Each time you made a tiny bit of progress, the employee\u2019s curiously probing finger would reflatten you. You mentally begged her to just sit still and let you reform so you could explain this mess\u2026and also get your fifty dollars back. All you truly accomplished was managing to read the nametag dangling off of her abundant chest: Renee.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Confident that the display was now back in Tip-Top shape, Renee walked back to the front counter holding a strange squishy disc in her hands. You were only crushed for a moment beneath her shoe, but her nonstop touching and smearing of your body in her hands was inhibiting any progress towards reforming that you could make. Times like these you wished that your existence wasn't quite so unique, because in this girl's eyes there is no chance that the object that she was holding was actually a human being. Coming around the back side of the register, Renee simply tossed your body on the counter beside her. In her mind she had decided that she would wait until her break to figure out exactly what you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were elated to have a few moments of uninterrupted progress towards becoming human again. As you focus all of your efforts towards this you gazed upwards at Renee has she scanned the rest of the store. In another stroke of luck, nobody else seems to be coming into the gift shop at least. The last thing you needed at this point was yet another giantess milling about while you were helpless beneath them. But after a few minutes you felt your arms and legs pop free from your torso, and finally your face snapped back into shape as well. Renee was still looking out in the distance, but you knew you had to get her attention. Taking a deep breath you prepared to reveal yourself to this admittedly friendly-looking employee. Even so, meeting any new giantesses came with a measure of danger in and of itself. You never knew quite how anyone would react to discovering a malleable, one foot tall man, let alone being surprised by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling your resolve, you cleared your throat and said, \"Umm hi there.\" You had originally planned to say more than this, but as soon as you got a few words out Renee shrieked with surprise and turned her her head to face you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, are you a real person!?\" She said incredulously, still standing in an on guard position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes please relax I didn't mean to scare you! I'm just going to save you the breath and say yes I am a person, one foot tall to be precise, yes that was me that you stepped on earlier, I am completely fine my body has the ability to stretch and be shaped but I always return back to normal, and yes I forgive you for stepping on me, okay?\" You attempted to rush through all of the inevitable questions that arose whenever you met a new person, and from the look on Renee's face it seemed like it worked. As her face showed her mind working through each bit of information, you simply stood there in awkward silence. You could only hope that she would take this influx of information well, and more importantly treat you like a human being after it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it seemed like she had processed everything you said, and she opened her mouth to speak. \"Wow, this is hard to believe but I mean I don't see any reason for you to lie to me, so I guess I'll just say pleased to meet you, uhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake\" you interjected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! Hello! I am Renee which you could probably already tell from my name tag. Now what are you doing in the gift shop today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter witnessing the girl pocket your $50 bill no more than 10 minutes prior you were a bit nervous to call her out on it, but nonetheless you persisted. \"Umm well I was here to buy one of those huge teddy bears but as you can see I had a little accident trying to grab one. And I was going to do it with... that bill you found on the ground earlier. I dropped it when everything came tumbling down, sorry to rain on your parade of finding some free money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee's eyes opened as she immediately swung her hand down to her backside and retrieved the bill. She then said, \"Oh no need to apologize to me, it's your money I wouldn't willingly steal from anyone!\" Her kind words and tone up until this point were reassuring to hear, as you could pretty much tell that she was a good person already. Handing you the bill you two shared a smile before she said, \"Oh just let me grab you that bear and you can be on your way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee strutted across the store, her uniform trying its hardest to be unflattering but the woman's body filled it out so well that this was impossible. You simply chuckled, thinking about how every woman that you came in contact with just happened to be gorgeous in their own right. Needless to say, Cassie was your one and only, but you could still acknowledge the looks of the various other women in your life. Coming back to the counter with the 3-foot bear in hand, Renee picked it up and slammed it on the counter mere inches away from your body. You jumped slightly with fear but luckily she missed you. This stupid stuffed toy even towered over your body, reminding you further just how big the size discrepancy was between you and regular people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the item scanner in her hand, Renee happily aimed it at the price tag on the gigantic bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it comes to $54.99 after tax!\" Renee smiled down at you, but in your head you groaned. You had exactly $50 and nothing more on you. Long ago you had given up carrying a wallet or really anything around so you had nothing else to offer this woman. With your propensity for getting crushed you had simply have had your belongings taken from you either by force or by accident too many times in the past to keep carrying them. Looking up at the friendly giantess above you, you spoke up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah umm I have just this $50, is there any way you can just cut me a deal or something? I'm going to level with you this is for my potential future mother-in-law and if I don't get this bear I feel like she'll make me disappear... And that's not a metaphor I literally think she might crush me so bad that nobody will ever find me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a look of empathy wash over Renee's face briefly, and for a moment it looked like she really did want to help you. But unfortunately when she opened her mouth she said, \"I'm so sorry, Jake, but I can't give you any discounts or I'll lose my job. They're really strict around here about us doing stuff like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, you hung your head before turning around and scanning the room for another souvenir option. Looking around you found that nothing jumped out at you quite the way this bear did. Plus the added factor of the sentimental value for Kimberly meant that it was really the only option. Thinking for a moment about how to respond, Renee actually cut in first, saying \"Okay how about this Jake! I have a $5 in my pocket that I'll give you if you just help me with a few tasks around the gift shop! It shouldn't take very long at all, consider it a brief employment opportunity!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly elated at the opportunity, you then remembered Kimberly's threat about you not being back before her massage was over. You thought about it for a second but realized that you really didn't have any other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great, thanks Renee! I just have to be back by the spa in about an hour or so, but until them I'm all yours!\" You figured that Kimberly's all expenses paid massage would take at least an hour, so you figured you had just about enough time to work this deal out and get back with Kimberly none the wiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now let's put you to work!\" Renee said gleefully. From what you could tell about this girl you assumed that she wouldn't make you do anything too horrible, but in reality you had no clue. Perhaps she would have you do something simple or perhaps she was saving the worst tasks for someone else to handle. You gulped with trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Renee have you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, I know what you can do!\u201d Renee brightened. \u201cThis actually works out perfectly, because I didn\u2019t know quite what to do.\u201d<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms. \u201cOh? What is it? I\u2019ll do anything I can to help out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee smile beautifully. \u201cHee, that\u2019s sweet of you. Basically, my boss wanted to talk to me in her office. She said it was urgent, and sent me a text about it like ten minutes ago, but I guess she forgot I run the gift shop by myself during this shift. I can\u2019t really leave the shop abandoned to visit my boss, can I? She\u2019d chew me out for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem quite fair.\u201d You said. \u201cHow does she expect you to visit her and run the shop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, really. BUT, now that you\u2019re here, I can hop on over to her real quick. You\u2019ll just run the gift shop in my place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled, immediately thrown by her request. You\u2019d expected maybe a job involving stocking the shelf or carrying some items, or maybe counting money in the register. But running the gift shop entirely on your own? You weren\u2019t an Atlantica employee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026is that the best idea?\u201d You asked. Renee nodded, leaning back and turning towards the shop\u2019s exit. Apparently, she\u2019d already decided this was the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll only take me a few minutes, Jake. Five tops!\u201d Renee held up her open palm to signify five. Nearing the door to the shop, she looked at you with an earnest, almost pleading expression. \u201cI know you can do it! Just help people buy stuff and take their cash or credit.\u201d Stepping further out of sight, she gave you one last parting remark. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s been a slow day. No one will even come in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her lilting optimism, Renee disappeared from your sight. You watched the direction she\u2019d left from for another minute, still a bit stunned at this sudden development. One second, you\u2019d been robbed and squashed by an oblivious shop employee. Then you\u2019d met a new friend and been offered a gracious proposition. Now, you were apparently a temporary employee at Atlantica for the next five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you looked around the empty, almost eerily quiet store. Not much else to do, you paced back and forth on the countertop. Nothing the slight disarray of misplaced items and loose papers, you took it upon yourself to clean up Renee\u2019s workspace. It was the least you could do for someone as nice as her. And it made your minor OCD tendencies satisfied with everything on the counter squared away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, and you heard footsteps clapping against the ground in the direction of the gift shop. They sounded like flipflops, which you hadn\u2019t thought Renee was wearing, but you were glad she was back none-the-less. Turning to the door and smiling, you prepared to wave and greet her\u2026only for the words to die before they left your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike\u2026hello? OMG, is anyone even here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee knocked on her boss\u2019 door. \u201cI\u2019m here to see you ma\u2019am. Sorry for my delay.\u201d The reply from the other side of the door was muffled, but sounded like confirmation, so Renee let herself in. Her boss was buried in her computer, typing furiously and with a scowl on her face. Meekly, Renee slid into the uncomfortable chair in front of her boss\u2019 desk. She was pretty sure her boss ordered the chair to be uncomfortable on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss didn\u2019t even look up at her. \u201cYour tardiness has set me back, but that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve compensated for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee winced at her boss\u2019 unyielding and analytical manner of speaking. \u201cWh-what did you want from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss glanced ever-so-slightly up at her, and managed a small smile. \u201cPlease, Renee. I\u2019m not going to eat you alive. You\u2019re here because I value you as an employee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platinum-blonde girl blushed. \u201cO-oh? Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss spun the monitor of her computer around to face Renee. \u201cTo battle falling returns from her gift shop, we\u2019re ordering entire new stocks of exclusive products. I\u2019d like you to share your opinions on each potential item we\u2019re considering. Are they worth it? Will people buy them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee was floored, but recovered quickly and gave her boss a huge smile. \u201cI can totally do that! I think I know our customers really well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I love to hear. This may take a while though.\u201d Her boss took a sip of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee waved her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got all the time in the world, boss. If you want me to do this, I\u2019ll give it my all, no matter how long it takes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl standing at the entrance to the gift shop was decidedly NOT Renee. She couldn\u2019t be any further from Renee. For starters, her hair was as black as night, styled into a celebrity-worthy wavy run down her back, with bright red highlights at the tips. Her skin was a darker tan than Renee\u2019s, and her eyes were a deep hazel color, though at the moment she was wearing designer shades. Her voice was also higher-pitched and a bit grating, dripping with annoyance and pretentiousness. She had a small purse slung over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch, much more different than Renee was her choice of clothing. Unlike Renee\u2019s modest and practical employee uniform, this new girl was clad in only her swimsuit, though calling it that was a bit too lenient. Truthfully, the scraps of fabric on the girl\u2019s body were hardly more than just that: scraps of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer top consisted of two fancy red diamonds just managing to conceal the girl\u2019s nipples, and then pathetic little strings tied over her shoulders and around her back. Her swimsuit bottom was a floss-like red line only barely covering her crotch, to say nothing of how deep into her butt it was wedged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee was a beautiful girl, and you could see the curves hidden under her unflattering work attire, but this new girl was on an entirely different level. Her boobs were gargantuan, her meaty thighs rubbed together as she walked, and you could even make out her sizable derriere from the front. Your jaw-dropped, and you fought to pull it back up from the counter, only for it to drop again as the girl took a few tentative steps into the shop, her breasts quivering and jiggling like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, for real! Where\u2019s the bitch that runs this shop?\u201d The girl moaned, smacking bubble gum loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought you back to your senses immediately. Hearing the girl flagrantly insult Renee was way out of line, and any sparse attraction you had been tempted with by her curvaceous body alone was gone in an instant. Adopting a neutral stance, you waved to get the girl\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, over here. On the counter. What can I help you with, miss?\u201d You forced your voice to be louder and just a tad deeper than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to the sound of your voice, and seemingly made eye contact with you. Strolling closer, it took every last ounce of your gentlemanly inner strength to maintain strong eye contact with her instead of glancing down at the ninety-nine perfect of her glorious body she was flaunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at you, the girl raised her designer shades and sneered. \u201cLike, what the fuck are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twitched slightly at her brash wording. \u201cI\u2019m temporarily manning this shop. Is there anything you would like to buy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stared at you for several moments, chomping her bubble gum ominously. Finally, she slowly removed her sunglasses, pushing them up onto her forehead. \u201cJesus, you\u2019re a weird little freak, aren\u2019t you? Like, you\u2019re super dumb looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. \u201cThat isn\u2019t particularly nice. I\u2019m just offering to help you look for a souvenir to\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl cut you off by popping her gum loudly, a few small speckles of spit landing on your face. \u201cI don\u2019t want you. I, like, just want that slut who ripped me off earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were scowling. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, miss. If you could just\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Ashley, itty bitty doll freak! You, like, sound like a disgusting perv saying \u2018miss\u2019 over and over. OMG, you\u2019re so annoying.\u201d The black-haired giantess rolled her eyes. \u201cLike, the employee in here earlier told me they don\u2019t have swim tops in my size. And I was like, are you fucking serious? Jesus, this place blows!\u201d Ashley snapped her bubble gum again, the sound loud enough to deafen you momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward nonchalantly onto the countertop, her massive breasts squashing against the delicately aligned piles of Atlantica flyers you\u2019d arranged earlier. Her gargantuan globes scattered the papers as her flesh squeezed out onto the counter, some papers even falling to the floor. If she even noticed, Ashley didn\u2019t seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m, like, dying in this god-awful place because my tits feel so heavy without support!\u201d Ashley whined. \u201cI totes left my better bikini at home, and mommy gave me a few grand to spend for new swimsuits, but, like, this shitty place doesn\u2019t even have any! OMG, this was supposed to be, like, the best resort ever. Garbage rip-off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cMa\u2019am\u2026Ashley, I don\u2019t know what you want from me.\u201d As discreetly as you could, you backed up an inch from the girl. Her boobs alone were bigger than you were, as as closely as she was pressed up onto the counter, her abyss of cleavage threatened to swallow you whole in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, what I WANT is for you to drag that smug little asshole out from where she\u2019s hiding, so I can get her fired!\u201d Ashley smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s what she gets for denying me. Like, the customer is always right, right? I think she was just jealous of me, the uggo! Her boobs are so dumb and flat compared to my boys!\u201d Ashley laughed, a harsh scraping sound. As she laughed, her gratuitously thick body shook entrancingly, and you took another half step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad move, as Ashley noticed this time. Raising an eyebrow, she peered down at you. \u201cAw, what\u2019s the matter little dolly? Scared of, like, dying under one of my tits?\u201d Grinning from ear-to-ear, Ashley hoisted one of her squishy boobs off the counter and let it fall back down with a resounding \u2018slap\u2019, prompting another screeching giggle from the cruel giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come in here and boss me around, miss. As long as I\u2019m the one manning this shop, I have full say in what goes on.\u201d You crossed your arms and fought down your rising anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley replied by simply slamming her hand down onto the counter, inches away from you. Out of pure reflex alone, you flinched and curled back a bit, even though her hit was more a show of force than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grew a smug, condescending smile on her face. \u201cUh huh. What if I just crush you into paste. Like, could you even, like, do anything to stop me from squishing you like the little freak you are? That\u2019s totes pathetic.\u201d Her eyes flicked left and noticed the cash register. \u201cYou know, I might just help myself to a few hundred, and I\u2019ll call it even. Skanky bitch keeps her job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d You shouted out, your tolerance boiling over into anger. \u201cYou\u2019re the stupid one here. Renee was doing her job, and you\u2019re an entitled brat. Get your hand away from the register before I call security.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s face registered shock at being yelled at, which quickly turned into disdain. \u201cOMG, shut the hell up you little fucker.\u201d A vividly frightening look of careless violence crossed her face as she raised her fist over you. Without proper time to react, you could only drop your macho-act and yelp briefly before her fist descended, smushing you between her hand and the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand retreated a moment later, to your surprise, and your one unmangled eye gazed lazily at the confused expression on her face. As you morphed back to normal and reformed your squished limbs, her jaw dropped slightly, and her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? You, like, didn\u2019t pop like a grape!\u201d Ashley exclaimed, effectively confirming her genuine attempt to kill you with her fist slam. \u201cWhat even are you? This is uber weird.\u201d You were half standing now, and in the middle of reforming your smooshed mouth to yell at the girl when she lashed out with her right hand, slapping you down flat again, ruining your attempt at reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were held flat, the girl began to laugh, her harsh voice rising from a low giggle to a down right howl. Effortlessly, she began to toy with your malleable body between the fingers on her right hand, while reaching into the cash register with her left. Relishing the feeling of you squeezing in her grasp, the girl pocketed five hundred dollars in cash, slipping the bills into her purse like it was nothing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she peeled you off the counter and held you taut in both hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you are, but this is, like, way too funny. OMG!\u201d Ashley smiled maliciously. \u201cYou\u2019re, like, stretchy and squishy and hella gross, but god, you can\u2019t imagine the things I could do with someTHING like you. And you couldn\u2019t even stop me if you wanted to, itty bitty freak! Loser! Finders Keepers, like mommy always says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley laughed again, you fought valiantly to squirm and wriggle from the sadistic giantess\u2019 grasp, but it was no use. She had total control over your body now that you were flattened and stretched a bit in her hands. You could only weakly glance over her shoulder towards the exit of the shop. What in the world was taking Renee so long in coming back? She was your only savior now!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, put me down! I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d You shouted from Ashley\u2019s grip as she walked to the exit. You hoped that Renee would come to your rescue any second now, but fate seemed to dislike you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, shut the fuck up you little loser.\u201d Ashley spat as she stopped walking and dangled you in front of her face. She looked even more annoyed than before now; pissed, even. Then, you saw her scowl turn into a smirk, as if her sadistic mind had come up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wondered what she had in store for you, Ashley released her grip on your leg, dropping you to the floor. You landed on the carpet with a small bounce, leaving you groaning in mild pain as you pushed yourself up. Now standing, you watched with dread as the gargantuan bombshell kicked off one her designer flip flops. With a good idea of what was coming, you try to turn and flee, but Ashley was too quick. You felt her massive sole crush your body in under a second as she stepped on you with her full weight, painfully pressing you flat under her tanned foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed internally as you felt your flattened body stick to Ashley\u2019s warm sole. She then slid her pedicured foot back into her flip flop and made her way through the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re like, a way better insole than a person.\u201d Ashley said as she walked in the summer heat, each step smushing you flatter into her flip flop. The high temperature was making Ashley work up a sweat, too, which made your experience even worse. \u201cYou should be like, thanking me, honestly. Most guys would kill just to touch me.\u201d Ashley trailed on. It\u2019s not like you could hear what she was saying, anyway. Your body was much too flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked yourself why god was so cruel to you as you laid flattened under Ashley\u2019s foot. Your body continued to squish and squelch with every step as she merely walked, smashing you over and over and over again beneath her pink sole. On top of that, Ashley\u2019s foot was starting to smell like vinegar, and the toxic fumes burned your nose as you inhaled. You wondered how long you would have to endure this hell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, you internally cry for joy as you feel your body being peeled away from Ashley\u2019s foot, but you celebrated too soon. As soon as you were back in shape, Ashley dropped her heavy foot on top of you, but not hard enough to squish you. Her warm skin was still slightly damp with sweat, and the smell hadn\u2019t faded either. Ashley laughed as she rubbed her toes on your face, rubbing some of the sweat onto you as you pointlessly struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStart licking, slave.\u201d Ashley demanded with her pink toes raised just above your face. \u201cHell no you crazy bitch! Get your nasty foot off of me!\u201d You shout angrily at the evil girl. Completely unphased, Ashley presses down with her foot, squishing everything but your head under her bare sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like someone needs to learn some respect for his new goddess\u2026\u201d Ashley said as she raised her heel, smushing your head under her toes as she increased the pressure. She then began slowly twisting her foot side to side, painfully grinding your upper body into the floor. Ashley then stands up, increasing the pressure even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I tell you to do something...\u201d Ashley said coldly as she raised her foot up. \u201c...you do it.\u201d She then stomped on you hard, flattening you  even more under her warm sole and causing you to internally scream in agony. She then sat back on her couch and raised her toes again. \u201cNow start licking if you understand.\u201d With your head reformed, you throw away your pride and quickly put your tongue to work, hoping to avoid any more stomping. \u201cGood dog.\u201d Ashley cooed happily in a condescending tone as she sat back and opened her phone, enjoying the power rush she got from bullying the tiny squishy guy at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had been licking for a few minutes, Ashley slid her foot up your body, replacing her toes with the ball of her foot. Getting the memo, you continued licking, hating yourself more and more every time you dragged your tongue across her skin. She made you lick every inch of both of her feet this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had finished the humiliating task, Ashley moved her feet to either side of you and picked you up. \u201cI think you deserve a reward for your hard work. Don\u2019t you?\u201d She asked. You meekly nodded, not knowing what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your reward?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cassie rummaged through her suitcase, bent over at the waist, Sophie was almost completely engrossed in the social media she was browsing on her phone. However, when Cassie pulled out a thankfully billowy skirt she involuntarily said \"ooh\" out loud, eliciting her younger sister's attention for a second. It was in this moment that Sophie saw a strange shape plastered against her sister's right butt cheek and back of her thigh. After staring at her for a moment she saw the unmistakable brown color of your hair as well as your skin tone which stood out from Cassie's somewhat more tan complexion. Sophie opened her mouth to speak but before she could she stopped herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTragically for you, Sophie's defining trait would seal your fate at this very moment. A naturally fun-loving girl, Sophie was always looking for games to play or even opportunities to just be silly. This meant that when she saw your one foot tall form splattered against the back of her sister's leg and ass like a sticker, her mind assumed a rather ridiculous explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! They must be playing hide and seek! What did genius spot to hide, Jake! Right under her nose is where she'll least expect you! Don't worry little buddy, your secret is safe with me. I won't expose you and make you lose.\" Sophie's ridiculous inner monologue had inadvertently condemned you to be stuck for the foreseeable future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you plastered face first into Cassie's now freshly washed skin, you were utterly unaware that her sister had even seen you at all. Even if you knew that she had, you wouldn't have been surprised at her ditsy mind coming up with some dim-witted explanation as to why she shouldn't reveal you. The real shocking bit of information was the fact that your own fiance seems to have completely forgotten about your existence. Normally Cassie was the most observant person you knew, but apparently being surrounded by family members had somehow caused you to somehow slipped her mind! In all honesty you could kind of understand that. You two had been away at college for years, and this was the first time that both you and her family were mixed together. She had never had to deal with both looking out for your safety as well as entertaining her sisters and mother. With this in mind you honestly weren't mad at Cassie, you just hoped that soon enough she would shake the cobwebs out of her brain and actually remember you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you felt a loose layer of cloth drape over the back of your body, casting you into further darkness, you had a feeling that this realization would not come soon. Cassie had slipped on a forest green, knee length skirt and completed the outfit with a v-neck white tee that showed off just the right amount of cleavage. If you were in any other situation physically you would have been ogling your future wife, but sadly you didn't even have a clue as to how good she looked in the moment. Your entire sense of sight was darkness and all you could feel was her slightly jiggly flesh moving as she shifted her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up in the realm of normal sized people, Sophie watched as Cassie completely covered covered up your body, giggling slightly. Once again she thought to herself, \"Man Jake really is a master of hide and seek, but it looks like Cassie isn't even trying. Either way I'm rooting for you to win Jake!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her outfit now ready, Cassie turned to face her little sister and flashed her radiant smile. \"Ready to go get breakfast with Mom and Maddie?\" Still a bit confused by Cassie wasn't even making an attempt to find you, Sophie brushed these thoughts out of her head and rationalized that if it took her sister a long time to find you and the victory would be even sweeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am! Let's head down there!\" Sophie exclaimed excitedly. The two gorgeous women then began their brief walk out of the hotel room and into the elevator to take it down to the breakfast buffet. Any passerby would be rightfully stunned by the beauty of these two ladies. Sophie was giving off a much different look than her sister, taking advantage of the tropical climate to wear nothing more then a skimpy bikini top and barely there jean shorts over her bikini bottom. Little did anyone know that the more modest dressed one of the two was currently carrying a 1 foot tall man cemented against the back of her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, we're dealing with the rather chaotic movement of Cassie's right thigh and ass cheek. While your fiance definitely made an effort to keep herself in good shape, she had a hard time burning off excess fat around her hips, thighs, and butt. For you personally this was a fantastic trait. She carried a bit of extra weight in all of the areas that you found most attractive, while remaining perfectly lean everywhere else. While this made her look even more beautiful, it meant that your current prison was jiggling significantly. Moreover, the warm humid air caused Cassie to nearly immediately replace the light layer of sweat that she had just showered off. You felt this sweat run over your body and down her leg slightly. You knew from experience that's sweaty skin led to you being sucked into it quicker than normal, prompting you to worry even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses promptly reach their destination where their mother and sister had already grabbed them a table. Maddie was shoving her face with as much protein heavy food as she could, clad in sweaty workout gear. She clearly had already gotten some exercise in and was now refueling. Kimberly, on the other hand, was also eating her fair share of food, but with more variety. Remnants of pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit, and bacon were strewn about across the table. If you could have seen the damage that these two women had already done to the buffet, you would have understood how they managed to maintain such tall, somewhat weighty frames, but also had been shocked at how they all distributed this weight perfectly around their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women change good mornings as Cassie pulled her seat out from the table. You felt her skin tighten slightly as she squatted towards the seat. Knowing what this meant from years of experience you braced yourself for impact. Sure enough a split second later, Cassie plopped her buns hard onto the wicker chair, smashing you once more and eliminating what little progress towards freedom you had made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Cassie giggled as they made their plan of attack for the buffet, talking about what foods they would get first and what they would go back for seconds of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed you truly had slipped your fiance's mind. Would this be your fate or will someone or something come to your rescue?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finalizing their strategy for tackling the breakfast buffet, Cassie and Sophie leapt back up from the table and rushed over to the three full aisles of delicious food on offer. Cassie scooped up a fresh stack of hot buttermilk pancakes, a heaping helping of scrambled eggs, and a towering glass of orange juice. Sophie helped herself to a cavalcade of muffins and donuts that hardly fit on her plate, and certainly would\u2019ve confused you as to how she maintained her beautiful physique with such a diet if you\u2019d been able to see her (and not be pressed firmly into your future wife\u2019s butt).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood and drink prepared, Cassie and Sophie walked back to the table, settling in beside Kimberly and Maddie. Your body was once more slammed firmly between the chair and Cassie\u2019s toned butt and thigh as Cassie sat down. The simple act of pulling in her chair ground her butt against the seat as she got comfortable, smearing your squishy form more against her smooth flesh. The sheen of sweat coating your body grew in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie bit into her pancake stack and savored a sip of orange juice, as well as stifled a giggle as Sophie nearly crammed a full chocolate donut into her mouth. Kimberly also smiled warmly at her three daughters. It was a long time since her whole family had done something this fun all together. She wasn\u2019t obtuse enough to not notice your mysterious exclusion from breakfast, but she certainly wasn\u2019t concerned about your disappearance. She simply assumed you were back in the room sleeping or some such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie was less deterred. Finishing up her breakfast, she stood up and grabbed her dirty plates. Looking at Cassie, she frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take out Jake, sis.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie paused, and swallowed her mouthful of eggs. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie smirked. \u201cWell, I mean, I don\u2019t see Jake, but you obviously brought him with you, right? Did ya stuff him in your purse or cleavage to carry him? Just don\u2019t forget him, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blushed at her sister\u2019s frank declaration\u2026but then blanked, dropping her fork onto her plate. Her face paled and her jaw dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, I actually DID forget Jake back in the room!\u201d Cassie exclaimed, jumping up from the table so quickly her skirt caught the edge. Pulled up just a few inches, Sophie could now spot your flattened form hugging Cassie\u2019s thigh, and she bit her lip hard to keep from excitedly exclaiming. From her perspective, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to rat you out and ruin your hide and seek game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sighed. \u201cDear, Jake can wait, can\u2019t he? He\u2019s an adult, and he can \u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head, stepped back, and adjusted her skirt, hiding you from view once more. \u201cSorry, this will only take a minute. I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Without waiting for a reply, your fianc\u00e9e dashed from the dining hall and back towards the suite. Sadly, she just missed Sophie losing her cool and breaking into an adorable lilting laugh, suspicious behavior that would\u2019ve immediately given you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s fast running bounced her cheeks rhythmically and nauseatingly, tossing your body up and down ceaselessly. Her right butt cheek grew slick with sweat as her flesh warmed up from the brief jog, and you felt your body slip ever-so-slightly down her leg and more onto her thigh than before. You could feel a tantalizing hint of a breeze fluttering up from under her skirt, though your body was still fully hidden from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty feet from the door, Cassie stopped in her tracks, surprised to find Irina heading right towards her. Similarly to Sophie, Irina was dressed in a provocative black two-piece bikini that left little to the imagination. The top and bottom were frilly and stylish, with the bottom piece including a short flowy skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrina? I thought you were still sleeping?\u201d Cassie asked, momentarily distracted from her quest to find you. Again, very different from the Cassie you normally spent time with on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust woke up and changed.\u201d Irina smiled. \u201cMy stomach was rumblin\u2019, as they say! Besides, can\u2019t waste time at a resort as beautiful as this.\u201d Behind Irina, Cassie watched two young boys staring slack-jawed at the black-haired giantess\u2019 massive rear end, with one boy accidentally running into the wall. Irina was often a bit oblivious of her own sex appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking eyes with Irina again, Cassie returned her smile. \u201cI just needed to head back for a second to grab something I forgot.\u201d She explained, before immediately wincing. She hadn\u2019t meant to describe you as a \u2018thing\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina nodded. \u201cWell, the door\u2019s open! See you back at the dining hall!\u201d The older woman gave Cassie a gentle grasp on her shoulder and then brushed past, sauntering down the hall. Chastising herself for accidentally demeaning you, Cassie continued the last stretch to the room, Right as she reached the door, and noted it was open, Irina\u2019s words rang in her mind. Why exactly was the door left open?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie received her answer as soon as she stepped inside. The first thing she saw was a curvy, tanned butt clad in adorable pink panties. The butt belonged to a girl in a maid uniform easily a size too small, who was on her knees by the couch, digging around for something. Her frilly skirt had been flipped up without her realizing, essentially forcing the poor girl to moon anyone who happened by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Cassie let out a tiny gasp of surprise, which prompted a startled, high-pitched shriek from the girl. She spun around, knocking her head against the table, and stood up on wobbly feet. Her cheeks burned bright, and she looked at Cassie in abject astonishment, before blinking twice. She took a deep breath and adjusted herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI-I\u2019m terribly s-sorry about\u2026screaming.\u201d The girl said. \u201cY-You must be a guest in this suite, right? Um\u2026that other lady ordered room service\u2026so I started cleaning.\u201d The girl gestured to her large cleaning cart parked to the side of the suite\u2019s main room. Cassie assumed Irina had made the request in an attempt to be proactive and helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I apologize for startling you.\u201d Cassie closed the suite door and approached the girl. \u201cMy name\u2019s Cassie Smalls. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed even more. \u201cOh, that\u2019s very kind of you ma\u2019am. M-My name is A-Amber\u2026uh\u2026Amber Evans.\u201d She bowed deeply. \u201cPleased to\u2026uh\u2026m-meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took this opportunity to take a good look at Amber. The girl, maybe about 22 years old, was most likely of Hispanic descent, indicated by her alluringly dark tanned skin tone and chocolate brown hair tied into a somewhat messy ponytail. The girl was Cassie\u2019s height, but only because of her three-inch heels that matched her black and white, traditional maid outfit. The outfit did wonders for her image, but most likely not her comfort. Amber had some weight to her in all the right places, and her miniscule skirt struggled to stay down over her butt, and her blouse looked fit to rip at the seams where her impressive chest pushed against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Amber, nice to meet you.\u201d Cassie shook the girl\u2019s shaky hand. \u201cDid you drop something under the couch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber fidgeted. \u201cOh\u2026well, yes. I did. But I can reach it!\u201d Amber declared, dropping again onto her knees and flailing her arm under the couch. Cassie\u2019s eyes widened as the maid\u2019s skirt once more flipped up and presented her beautiful ass. Amber didn\u2019t even seem to notice in the slightest. In more ways than one, Cassie was reminded a bit of Sophie while interacting with Amber, albeit an introverted Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Amber popped back up, holding a small set of keys. \u201cI dropped my master keys while vacuuming.\u201d She explained, slipping the keys into a pocket on her cleaning cart. \u201cI c-can be a bit\u2026careless at times.\u201d Amber twirled a strand of her hair. \u201cA-actually\u2026it\u2019s my first week. This is\u2026uh\u2026a stressful j-job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you luck then.\u201d Cassie smiled gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about little things, either. Our family is pretty laid back. I\u2019m just here to find something real quick.\u201d Cassie said, this time not even catching her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber\u2019s uncertain face morphed into genuine relief, her smile radiant. \u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d A bit too confident, she thrust out her chest. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll always do a good job. I\u2019ve already collected all the used towels and bedsheets and thrown them in this hamper.\u201d Amber indicated a hefty bag secured to the underside of her cleaning cart. \u201cThey\u2019ll get a good cleaning this afternoon. All that I have left is the back room.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat did you need to find?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie paled. Images of her precious fianc\u00e9 crushed and balled up in Amber\u2019s dirty hamper flashed in her head, before she remembered that the room she shared with you WAS the back room. Excusing herself, Cassie dashed back to her room, ignoring Amber\u2019s confused offer to help Cassie look for whatever it was she needed. Expecting to see you almost immediately upon entering the room, Cassie entertained the thought of you lying on the bed, giving her a sarcastic expression, and knowing all she\u2019d need to do was scoop you up and kiss you and she\u2019d be forgiven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly (but expectedly, for you anyway), you weren\u2019t there. Running a hand through her hair, Cassie paced around the room, checking everywhere. She looked under the bed and in her pile of dirty clothes, before finally climbing up onto the bed. Meticulously, Cassie scanned each blanket, pillow, and bedsheet for any sign of a squished tiny man, to no avail. You desperately wished you could simply call out to your future wife and let her know where you were, but her skirt still held you tight enough to prevent your mouth from reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until Cassie got off the bed. Opting to slide off in defeat instead of hopping off, Cassie\u2019s skirt caught the sheets and pulled back as she slid off, exposing you briefly. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s gorgeous legs smeared against the bed as she weakly rolled off, and your sweat-slicked body finally gave way. You peeled right off Cassie\u2019s thigh and onto the bedsheet, like dough unsticking from a rolling pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree but still flattened, you could only stare up helplessly as Cassie moved around the bed and towards the door. You focused all of your power on some sort of dumb mental connection, begging her to just look back and spot you. Not expecting anything, you were genuinely stunned as Cassie hesitated by the foot of the bed and froze for a second. Would she actually turn around and see you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026not at all. Cassie bent down, grabbed a bundle of blankets that had fallen from the bed, and tossed them over her shoulder back onto the bed. You mentally screamed as the blankets arced with towards you, then plopped down onto the bed, burying you and hiding you from sight. The weight wasn\u2019t much, but the line of sight issue was the real pressing matter. Still oblivious to your plight, Cassie walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the door, Amber bumped into her, letting another cute squeal out and stammering an apology. \u201cD-did you find\u2026uh\u2026what you were looking for?\u201d The klutzy maid inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shook her head. \u201cNo\u2026I\u2019ll check another room.\u201d Dejected, the brunette giantess trudged into the adjacent room, very concerned for your safety. Watching her sadly, Amber shrugged and entered your room, turning on the lights and pushing her cart against the wall. Methodically (and not without tripping twice), Amber began bundling up blankets and sheets and tossing them into her cart\u2019s dirty hamper. Soon, only the small pile covering you was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, you found your body possessed just the amount of strength to slowly wiggle, and you had been squirming out from under the blanket towards the edge of the bed, hoping to fall off onto the safety of the floor. Being picked up and tossed into the hamper by Amber was a fate you had no intention of experiencing. Of course, you could hear her heels clacking closer, and knew it was now or never. With a final twitch, you wiggled your flattened body to the edge of the bed\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the moment you felt your body possess that little bit of final strength, you were convinced that your freedom was secured. Perhaps it was hopeful optimism, but you still genuinely believed you could wiggle away to safety. It was only as Amber lifted the bundle of blankets off of the bed, and you were carried up with them, that you realized how screwed you were. The fight left you just as your hope shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to all of this, Amber dumped the blankets and your body into the hamper under her cleaning cart, and you toppled inside. Your body slid into the already quite stuffed hamper, and the rest of the blankets tumbled on top of you, thoroughly burying you and creating enough pressure to keep you flat and unable to reform enough to move or cry out for help. You could only wallow in the darkness, as the faint scent of dirty laundry wafted all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the hamper prison, Amber surveyed the room to make sure she\u2019d gotten everything, tripped and smacked into the bed table, and then pushed her cart out of the room, rubbing her sore forehead. Out in the hall, she helped Cassie look for you for about ten minutes, your fianc\u00e9e still being a bit cagey on exactly what/who she was looking for, but eventually Amber had to return to her duties. She was still on the clock, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the cart out of the suite and down the hall, the muffled rumbling of the wheels turning was your only clue that this oblivious maid was taking you further and further away from your only chance at salvation. You could do little but hopelessly pray for some miracle to save you, but to no avail. Amber kept a steady grip on her cart as she headed off down the hall, even venturing to sing a soft little song as she walked. She ran into no one else on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she reached one of the many resort laundry rooms exclusive to staff at the end of the hallway. Pulling her cart inside and closing the door, Amber grunted as she hefted the hamper off the cart and onto the floor by the industrial-sized washing machine. Demonstrating surprising strength for a klutzy girl her size, she hefted the hamper up and deposited all of the contents, yourself included, into the cold bin of the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFittingly, she tripped right afterwards, slapping her noggin into the wall. Dazed, the ditzy maid fumbled at the washing machine controls, and accidentally hit a button she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to, and shrieked as a valve in the washing machine squeezed out a small stream of some red detergent. Amber hastily shut the valve off, and glanced glumly into the bin, watching the red detergent soak into the blanket on top of the load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, and hoping her mistake hadn\u2019t cost her her job, Amber quickly hit all the correct buttons, starting the spray of freezing water, the spin of the bin, and a deposit of the correct, extra-absorbent detergent. Satisfied that she\u2019d done it right this time, Amber slammed the lid to the washing machine closed and sat back on a chair, accidentally toppling backwards onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber\u2019s careless antics aside, your experience inside the washing machine was decidedly less comical. You had landed near the top of the pile, with only one queen-sized sheet falling above you. As such, you felt the chill of cooling detergent as the accidental red liquid slipped out of the valve Amber had activated, and dripped all over you and the sheet. It soaked into the fabric of the sheet, and coated your squished body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you felt a somewhat burning sensation across your body, a rushing wave of tingles dancing across your skin. The red detergent coated you and the sheet above you completely. It smelled funny, and as a few drops ran down your face, tasted funny too. Your body felt\u2026weird\u2026as it was submerged in the liquid, and even the presence of freezing water seconds later didn\u2019t dispel the odd feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bin began to spin, picking up speed until it was rumbling quickly. You soon lost all sense of direction inside the cramped, pitch-black washing machine as a mixture of water, detergent, bedding, and yourself flipped and flopped in circles. You spun and smacked into various articles of dirty laundry over and over, before finally firmly smashing into a velvety smooth sheet, your back smacking into the soft fabric so that you were still facing out. Water then fully flooded the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnveloped underwater, your body cried out at the bone-chilling temperature, even as the constant spinning and rattling threatened to knock you unconscious. The entire wash lasted an hour, but it felt like five as you were stuck to the sheet you\u2019d been forcibly slammed into. More sheets and blankets slapped and crashed into you as the bin spun and spun, and if you hadn\u2019t been smushed flatter than a sticker, you\u2019d have thrown up long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wash cycle did eventually end, but that was hardly salvation for you. Without missing a beat, the lid was opened by Amber, who dutifully grabbed the sopping wet bedding and tossed it into the nearby industry-sized dryer. You and the bedsheet you were glued to went in the dryer as well, Amber failing to spot you in the brief second you were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryer was more of the same, but the opposite effect. You were still tumbled head over heels by the rotating bin inside the machine, but now hot blasts of horribly high temperature air blew at you from all sides. You felt like you\u2019d start melting, but most worryingly of all, you squishy body began to adhere even more into the sheet you were stuck to. It was like the blow-drying air of the dryer was baking you into the bedsheet, like a makeshift tattoo on the fabric. There was nothing you could do to stop it either, way to squished and battered to reform now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the drying cycle stopped two hours later, you tentatively tried to wiggle or squirm, but couldn\u2019t move a muscle. You tried to speak, but your mouth as way too mashed. As you focused harder on reforming, you noted with no small amount of terror just how fused you felt to the fabric of the bedsheet. The baking heat in the dryer really had cemented you in place firmly, and a kernel of doubt popped into your mind about your slim chances of breaking free without outside help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot missing a beat, Amber pulled open the dryer and yanked out one sheet, blanket, and comforter at a time, delicately folded them up, and laid them out on a fresh cart she\u2019d prepared while waiting. The curvaceous girl was still humming her little tune to herself as she worked on folding up the freshly clean and wonderful smelling laundry. Finally, only one bedsheet remained in the washing machine, and it was the one you were stuck to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled it out, you felt her smooth fingers press into your chest, seemingly without her noticing. You begged her to look down and notice you, as she held the bedsheet in her arms and began grabbing its corners to fold it up, but her gaze was not on you. She was looking at the clock above the door to the laundry room, noting how much time she had left until her shift was done. You tried calling up to her, but is was still useless, so you mentally frowned and glanced behind shoulder at a full-length mirror on the wall\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and your heart stopped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking back at you was not the typical tan, white, or blue sheets and blankets Atlantica Resort was known for, but instead a deep crimson bedsheet. And, right in the upper middle of the bedsheet was your human-shaped body, crushed flat in a spread-eagle position. Or at least, what tiny percent of you could be seen. Because, for some reason that both eluded you and horrified you to your core, you too had been dyed a deep crimson color, and blended in seamlessly with the fabric of the bedsheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t pieced it together, but the red detergent Amber had bumbled her way into letting drip into the wash had soaked into the fabric of the bedsheet and dyed it crimson, but it had also stained your own skin that crimson color to. In fact, that brand of detergent was so infamous for dying fabric and flesh that most people bought it solely for that purpose. A big warning label on the bottle explained that the only way to get the stain out of fabric or skin was via a separate cleansing chemical, a bottle of which sat on a nearby shelf behind Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished folding the bedsheet, Amber did indeed glance down and make eye contact with you, but only for a sparse second, and then she smiled happily and placed the sheet onto her cart, with you pressing downwards. Though you were technically visible, a cursory glance at the bedsheet would trick someone into thinking it was purely a uniform crimson red color. One would have to look close to spot your faint outline, especially as you only took up the space of one foot near the middle of the otherwise huge bedsheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to internally break down, your mind scrambling to think how you could get out of this. Because of the red detergent dying your skin and the bedsheet, you were nearly invisible to all but someone looking closely. Even then, you looked more like a weird design than a crushed human, especially with how fused to the fabric of the sheet you were. You bet that you even felt as smooth and soft as the rest of the sheet after how thoroughly you\u2019d been cleaned and dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to leave, Amber took a step towards her cart, only to step on a small wet patch on the floor. Her arms sprawled out and she let out a cute squeal as she slipped backwards. Her sizable booty smacked into the shelf behind her, and the small bottle of cleansing chemical clattered to the ground and smashed into tiny pieces. The chemical spilled out onto the floor and into a nearby drain meant for catching water, disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Amber sighed. \u201cOops. Hope that wasn\u2019t important.\u201d She bit her lip nervously. Bending down, she took note of the name of the chemical, and made a mental reminder to ask the resort staff to order more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving rectified her mistake (from her perspective, at least), Amber strolled from the laundry room with her cart, and pushed her way down the hall. Stopping every few doors, Amber grabbed some blankets and bedsheets from her cart, headed into the room, and fixed up the beds. Then, she\u2019d return to her cart and continue on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took well over an hour, but finally Amber was at her last room before clocking out for the day. The bedsheet you were engrained to, along with a few other blankets, were all that remained. Grabbing everything up into her arms, Amber shuffled into the last suite, and walked into the first bedroom she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedsheet you\u2019d been practically fused to was spread out across the queen-sized bed, the corners tucked under the mattress. Amber pulled the bedsheet firmly until it was nicely taut. Your body was still in the middle, closer to the pillows then the end of the bed. Glumly, you realized that this meant that you\u2019d been directly underneath the butt of whoever\u2019s bed you\u2019d just been strapped down to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought gave you pause, and renewed your fears and futile struggles. You hadn\u2019t even considered Amber taking you to a room that wasn\u2019t the Smalls suite. What if you were in some complete stranger\u2019s room? Chances were that they wouldn\u2019t recognize you, and even if they did, they\u2019d have no reason to think you weren\u2019t just an odd decoration. Also, Cassie would have no idea where to even begin looking for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged and pleaded mentally with Amber for her to notice you, but to no avail. The maid was hyper-focused on her task at hand, and soon she was spreading out a blanket. The blanket fell on top of you, and as Amber drew it up around the pillows, it constricted it bit, holding you down forcefully as well as totally hiding you. Once more, your hopes crashed down around you, and you barely noticed Amber placing out the comforter at the foot of the bed, and giving everything a nice brushing for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sounds were muffled to the point of near silence, so you barely took note of Amber leaving the room, readying the other beds in the suite, and then leaving to clock out and enjoy a complimentary soak in the hot tubs. You couldn\u2019t move or even dream of reforming while still held down tight by the blanket above you, let alone how thoroughly you\u2019d been dried to the bedsheet. All you could do was wile away the hours in boredom, and try not to think about how terrible your situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you heard the first muffled sound since Amber had left. It was the sound of laughing, and definitely feminine. You dared to believe that maybe, just maybe, it was Cassie coming to rescue you. More voices soon joined in alongside the first, a chorus of female voices. Some higher pitched and some a bit lower. All of the voices sounded happy and energetic, laughter punctuating inaudible conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another hour still until you heard the dulled click of the bedroom door opening and then closing. You\u2019d picked up on noises of a shower and toilet, and now could clearly hear someone in the room with you, rummaging around in a few drawers. At long last, the blanket above you was pulled back, revealing the outside world to you. The bright light of the bedside lamp briefly blinded you, and all you could make out was a curvy silhouette towering above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to blink in your flattened state, you had to wait a few seconds for your vision to clear. Meanwhile, the figure above you shifted and moved a bit, though you could hardly see. The blurriness fading, you finally see\u2026</span></div></div>",

Soon you would be out of here and reunited with your dear Cassie. You gave as much of a smile as you could given the circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we are here ladies,\u201d Kimberly said as they were walking through the airport, \u201cAll that\u2019s left now is to get to our hotels!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely heard Kimberly through the thick walls of Irina\u2019s butt. One thing that did stand out was the word hotels. Weren\u2019t they staying in the same hotel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour hotel is just a block away from ours right Irina?\u201d Kimberly asked her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you had already reserved your rooms and when I tried just a day later they were already full! At least I found another one close by! Which the hotel isn\u2019t why we are here so we will see each other plenty at the restaurants, and the shops, and the...\u201d Irina started to ramble on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened! You needed to be retrieved here at the airport, or you might be forgotten about. Why hasn\u2019t Cassie asked Irina to get you out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was thinking the same thing and looked at her eldest daughter. \u201cDear are we forgetting anything? Maybe a part of our luggage or you know someone...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at her mom, then towards Irina. She then looked back at her mom and said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so. We have all our luggage and no one is missing.\u201d Cassie then leaned in closer to her mom, \u201cDon\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten about him. It\u2019s just, he said if I wanted more time to catch up with you I could. So I figured we can just get him from Irina later. She will take good care of him!\u201d Cassie said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cassie was responding to her mom, Irina had bent over ever so slightly which had the effect of opening up her ass crack just a little. This allowed you to hear that Cassie didn\u2019t think anyone was missing! You tried to yell but at that moment Irina straightens back up and seals you away again. You were stunned, there was no way Cassie had forgotten about you right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled and said, \u201cWell we better get going then! Irina we will talk to you later about where we are going alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Kim!\u201d Irina giggled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait just to get to the hotel and relax a little bit. Flights aren\u2019t the most relaxing. I need to change, and then hit the in hotel spa!\u201d She sighed thinking about how good the spa would feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group flagged a taxi and headed off to their hotels for the night. Cassie felt a momentary pang of guilt for not getting you back but reasoned it away with reminding herself that you had said it would be fine to do this. You really were a great guy, so selfless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Irina checked in and made it to her room, you were now coming to grips with the situation. It would probably be best to get Irina\u2019s attention and explain why you were still in her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina sat down on her bed putting all her weight on you. She bounced a few times before standing back up and getting out a change of underwear and a bath robe. She was going to head to the spa now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she peeled off her clothes, light flooded into her ass crack. You could see that you were very deeply wedged between her cheeks. She would need to dig you out. You started struggling to speak and move your body. Her butt had done a real number on you. You were flat as a sticker and could barely move your lips. You saw out of the corner of your eye a pair of panties being pulled back up her thick thighs! If you weren\u2019t noticed soon you may be coming along for the spa treatments!</span></div></div>",

Tragically, however, after standing still for a few more seconds she added, \"Oh yeah! I'm going to the spa I should probably wear a swimsuit instead of panties!\" Your hopes were dashed as Irina evidently did not remember you yet. However as she took an extra 30 seconds or so to shimmy her panties back down her legs, reach into her bag to find a swimsuit, and begin to put it on you spent every second forcing at least your face to reform. And just as her swimsuit reach the precipice of her butt cheeks your mouth popped all the way open and you yelled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irina wait let me out first!\" you shouted out, the sound of your voice echoing out of the canyon of her crack. Irina gasped loudly and paused her motion once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! Oh dear I almost forgot about you entirely!\" Irina responded with some surprise but also with a tone of nonchalance almost like having an entire man wedged in her ass was a normal occurrence. She pulled her swimsuit down further to just about knee level before spinning and facing her butt to a mirror on the wall. There she grabbed a hefty cheek in each hand and spread them apart, finally getting a glimpse of your body for the first time in hours. \"Oh Jake I had no clue you could be squished to such an extent, you're nearly two dimensional down there. I hope the ride over here wasn't too bad for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy her last sentence you could tell that Irina at least did not wish any ill will upon you, but that didn't make the tremendous pounding you had received in between her buns any less torturous. You responded, \"Honestly, Irina, I really appreciate you smuggling me on the plane like this but you were right, your butt was definitely too much for me to handle. I don't mean to be rude here but your ass being so, umm, large meant that it just squished me with more pressure than I've ever felt before. Hell, you straight up knocked me out without even trying like 30 minutes into carrying me! If you don't mind could you just take me out before you go down to the spa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an effort to not make your captor feel uncomfortable or insulted in any way, you relayed all of this information with a sense of humor that did not match the amount of abuse her ass had just inflicted upon you. Sadly it seemed like your decision to make light of the situation caused Irina to not take it seriously either, as she responded with a hearty laugh before saying, \"I told ya, Jake! I'm sorry my butt just overpowered you like that... but I don't think it would be a good idea to let you out just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted, you responded, \"What?! Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of promised Kimberly and Cassie that I would keep track of you, and if I let you out then I might lose you!\" Irina stated matter of factly, as if she was doing this for your own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irina, I appreciate the concern I really do, but despite my size I am an adult man and I am more than capable of taking care of myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Kimberly told me on the way here about how she squished you flat underneath her flip flop without even seeing you, as well as the story you told about the incident with your own mom when you were a child. I would just feel terrible if something terrible like that happened to you while you were supposed to be with me!\" Cassie retorted. You desperately wanted to shout up at her that something like that was happening at that very moment thanks to her own massive ass, but once again you didn't want to make a bad impression on a single family member or friend of Cassie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Irina, you seem like a genuinely caring and compassionate woman and I think it's very nice of you to look out for me, bu...\" Irina cut you off before you could get to the actual point you were trying to make by simply pulling her swimsuit up rapidly into her awaiting ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'm glad we agree then!\" Irina yanked her suit seemingly deep in between her butt cheeks, pressing up against your already sticker-like form. Evidently her swimsuit was a scandalous thong, something which really didn't surprise you based on the way the woman dressed when you first met her. She continued, \"We can go and have a lovely time at the spa together then and meet back up with the Smalls later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina finally stood up, sealing you once again in utter darkness and pressure as she struggled to put on her bikini top over her heaving breasts. Eventually she succeeded and threw a complimentary robe over her swimsuit, grabbed her room key and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part of the spa does Irina go to first?</span></div></div>",

She paused for a moment, laughing to herself at how absurd the reality of that last part was, but honestly she had already gotten used to it and was ready to just relax. After all, you did agree to riding in Cassie's ass for the duration of the journey so you must not mind it that much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down in the titanic crack of this woman you met no more than a day ago you did mind it... a lot. Irina had somehow gotten the idea in her head that if you weren't sealed up inside of her ass like a tattoo then she would lose you and the Smalls would be mad at her. You wished you could get the idea through to her thick skull that you were, in fact, an adult man and you could survive just fine on your own. But as it turns out it was very hard to win an argument when you were could fit head-to-toe in between the butt cheeks of the person you were arguing with. Another step from the giantess battered her ass meat across your face as if to remind you once again just how much more powerful this woman was than you, and you sighed in defeat. You could only pray that she would change her mind at some point and let you out, or better yet Cassie would finally finish with her motherly bonding time and tell Irina to let you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minute walk as well as a brief elevator ride, Irina had finally reached the spa area. She looked around like a kid in a candy shop. There were free massages, mud baths, manicures and pedicures, and personal jacuzzis all available to her. Pondering for a moment she decided that the private jacuzzi would be the right first step, just to relax her entire body from being cooped up in an airplane for hours. Then after that she could move on to the more lavish amenities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina walked towards a large door with a women's sign on it and opened it up to find a secluded room, decorated with dim lighting, small waterfalls over rocks, and tons of foliage. But at the center was what appeared to be an expensive, if not slightly small hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tub better be just for me because if I'm supposed to share it with any other women that come in here then we're going to have quite a tight squeeze on our hands!\" Irina said this out loud and laughed at her own joke before remembering you once again. \"Oh! I guess I mean it's big enough for us two at least! But you're quite the gentleman when it comes to sharing space with a lady, right Jake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina pulled back the thong bikini she had on and peered behind her. At this point you were nearly smashed so badly into her ass that she wouldn't be able to see you, but just barely she did. Your sticker-like form had somehow been steamrolled slightly deeper into her ass, so Irina used her other hand to peel apart her cheeks and get a better look at you. By some miracle from the gods above you put every ounce of effort you had into reforming your face and managed to pop your mouth back open to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irina!\" you shouted up, the sound of your voice just barely reaching her ears after being muffled by the surrounding butt flesh and also overshadowed by the bubbles of the jacuzzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Jake! I just wanted to make sure if I get into the hot tub with you riding back there, you won't like... drown or anything, right?\" Irina's question stumped you to be honest. You hadn't been in the situation of being flat as paper and submerged underwater often, and you honestly couldn't remember the answer. At the very least the fact they she didn't want to kill you inside of her ass was a good sign that this woman at least cared somewhat about you, but still not enough to just let you out of her damn butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I'm not sure, actually\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well how about I just take a seat in the tub for 30 seconds and then hop back out and ask you if you need to breathe or not? Because my body could really use a good soak in this warm water. I mean don't get me wrong you feel quite nice as a cushion between my buns but that doesn't make the rest of me any less stiff from the travel here.\" Irina responded. You were annoyed at how Irina was talking about you as if you were some sort of tool to make her more comfortable, but once again you were in no position to be arguing with the giantess. Before you could even give an answer to her question Irina had already begun her descent. She dropped her robe nearby and plunged one foot into the water, smearing her ass over you with the cautious movement. Then, she followed up with her second foot, letting out a satisfied \"ooh\" as she sunk deeper into the water. Finally came the moment of truth, the water lapped at her massive rear end before she plunged all the way into the tub, up to her neck. Immediately she found a seat and dropped her ass onto it under water. The act spread her cheeks out nearly consuming half of the tub on their own, as they tried to spread equally towards each other as well. You felt the pressure multiply on your body as well as the searing hot water reach your tattoo-form in her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally settled in, Irina immediately succumbed to the inviting warmth of the tub, letting all of her stress melt away. You, found out quickly enough that in your flattened state you actually didn't need to breathe! It was a welcome discovery, but at the same time it made you furious that despite not needing to breathe you still were able to smell every horrible smell in Irina's ass on the way to the hotel. But at the very moment thanks to being underwater those smells didn't exist, and to be quite honest the whole situation was rather comfortable! You planned to tell Irina this when she stood up after 30 seconds, but soon enough that 30 seconds passed by. Then a minute. Then 5 minutes. Then a half hour. Thankfully you didn't actually need to breathe or else this oblivious woman would have just sentenced you to your death with the simple act of relaxing in a hot tub! You anxiously imagined how horrible of a fate that would have been, drowning without being able to move deep in the crack of a woman you had just met. You shuddered, further imagining if Irina had discovered your lifeless form, still plastered flatter than paper inside of her ass. She would be remorseful for sure, but you knew ultimately she would just pick your body out of her butt like an old temporary tattoo and dispose of you before resuming her everyday life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your mind out of this terrifying existential crisis and forced yourself to stop thinking about such a horrible fate. The reality of the situation was that you were actually just relaxing in a hot tub, even if you specifically were inside of an ass that was inside of a hot tub, but that was just nitpicking at that point. You relaxed your nerves and accepted whatever fate would come to you in the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stretched and stood up clenching her cheeks together and feeling a slight squish in her crack. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Was I keeping something... Oh no Jake!!\u201d Irina hurriedly pulled her bottoms back and reached in to check on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely and utterly squashed flat by this time. To complicate matters the long soak in the hot tub had completely relaxed your body to the point that you could not physically move. You felt a hand start pulling at you and ripping you out of your ass prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease be ok, please be ok,\u201d Irina worriedly muttered as she removed you. She held you up to her face to examine you. You were completely squashed but what concerned her was how limp you felt. She had no experience with you previously but she assumed you would be able to move or stiffen up while squashed. She held you up to her ear to listen for any sign of life. There was no sound escaping your body. You tried to speak but the combination of flatness and relaxedness made it impossible to move your mouth or  even make a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina brought you back in front of her breasts and had a look of worry on her face. \u201cI killed him! I had to, I was supposed to check after 30 seconds to see if he could breathe but I fell asleep and now he is drowned. What am I gonna tell Cassie! Gasp and Kimberly would never forgive me for killing him her daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9. What should I do...\u201d Irina rambled on. It seemed to you she was more worried about losing her friendship than you as a person. Oh well once you reformed you would explain everything and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only choice I have is to dispose of his body and just say I left him in my room while I went to the spa. Yeah, that sounds very logical. Then I would just say when I came back he was missing! It is the perfect plan! I am so sorry little guy, but this is for the best.\u201d Irina said very quickly. It was the best idea she had for dealing with the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe she would go so far to lie about you! You tried like crazy to give some sort of indication that you were still alive. Irina  had begun to walk out of the jacuzzi area and was pondering what to do with you specifically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to put him somewhere he will not be noticed. His body seems like a sweat rag so I could leave him with other sweat rags. Who knows maybe his body will just stay this way? At least someone would get some use out of him. Or I could just toss him into the first open room I pass, that would make more sense if my story was he snuck out of the room. That way it would be someone else\u2019s fault he was dead.\u201d Irina thought both of her ideas seemed like a good way out of this bad situation. Ultimately she decided to,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would have no idea what happened to your body that way and it would make it easier to stick to her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been trying to reform this entire time and you were finally feeling your muscles start to respond to your thoughts when you felt yourself fly through the air. Oh no you were too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sailed through the air and then landed on a bed. It was hard to tell if anyone was in the room or not. You continued to try and reform. Maybe you would be able to leave before you were even noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were popping back into 3D, you saw a woman standing next to the bed. She was stunning! She had red hair put up In two long braids, and a very fair complexion. Her breasts were very decent and her butt was amazing! You were sure it was at least as big as Irina\u2019s if not bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point you saw her ass was getting bigger, headed straight for your position on the bed. Oh no, not again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh, vacations are nice but there is nowhere like home! I cannot wait to be back home in Scotland! Plus I really miss my tiny daughter. I hope she kept out of trouble with me gone, though honestly she ends up in trouble with me around a lot!\u201d The mysterious lady said out loud to herself. She gave a slight giggle at the last part. You were able to make out most of this with a little difficulty. One thing that was for sure you needed to get off of her before she left for home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady wiggled her butt in the bed and gave another giggle. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like my daughter is here right now. At least I know that is not her since I made sure to video chat with our friends after I arrived. Still it feels just like her...\u201d With that thought, she stood up and looked back at the bed. By this point you had again flattened out and could not speak. \u201cErza!!! How in the world did you get here! How did you manage to fool me with the video chat! Sigh what am I gonna do with you...\u201d the woman said. You were confused until it dawned on you that this lady\u2019s daughter must have the same condition as you did! Huh who knew there was another person like you in the world, that is kinda cool to know you were not alone and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErza, I am going to go ahead and pack you first so we don\u2019t have another mishap. I wonder how you packed yourself by security, hmm, ah I bet I know how you did it! Though how you snuck back out of there for this week and stayed out of sight I will have to ask you later!\u201d The lady said with a slight laugh. Then she picked you up and began moving you behind her, to face her enormous ass again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dear, get back in mother\u2019s booty. I am just about done packing and then I have to catch my ride to the airport!\u201d The lady then pulled back her waistband and pushed you between her enormous cheeks! You couldn\u2019t believe how in the space of 2 days you had spent the majority of your time in a strange woman\u2019s ass crack! If she was getting back on the plane you were in for another long torturous plane trip! How could she do this to her own daughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady let go of her waistband and it snapped back into place. She then very gently compressed her cheeks together until your body was compressed between them. You did notice she seemed to be especially gentle so maybe she was just trying to be a caring mother. It still seemed odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmmm! Alright you feel good in there dear,\u201d the woman gasped out, \u201cDon\u2019t worry mother will let you out when we get there. If you can handle a 12 hour flight here I know you can handle the same back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally groaned hearing that not only was she enjoying this which again put her back up on the weird charts, but it was also goin to be four more hours than your last plane trip. You tried to squirm which only succeeded in eliciting another moan from the woman you were trapped by. \u201cNow now dear, wait until we are at home at least!\u201d She said this as sensually as she could with a huge smile on her face. Erza must have not been able to get enough of her and had to sneak along, such a sweet naughty girl! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing but endure the pounding of her cheeks as she finished getting ready. Then there was a great amount of pressure applied as she sat in her ride to the airport. It was hot in here, already some sweat dripping onto you. You hoped you would just be knocked out for the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it to the airport, the lady walked to the staging area. She made it through security and made sure to walk in such a way that every step slid her cheeks across you. It actually felt good, it wasn\u2019t too much but still all kinds of pressure. Like an experienced masseuse, you were treated to an amazing massage of your entire body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into the plane, the lady made sure to sit so that all her weight was not bearing down on top of you. This did mean her cheeks completely closed together since she was leaning to the side. You were impressed, it was like she had a lot of experience doing this... \u201cOh my God,\u201d you thought, \u201cShe must do this with her daughter on a regular basis! That is the only explanation for why this is feeling so good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was pleasant, you did fall asleep for some of the trip it being because it was so comfortable. This woman knew how to use her ass when it came to a foot tall person! You were not even thinking about Cassie due to how nice this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady sighed as she stepped off of the plane. It felt like her sweet daughter was asleep in her ass, she did enjoy it so much! She was supposed to stop by their friends house to pick Erza up but she already had her so she decided to just go home. If Erza  was still asleep, she would just leave her in her crack and go to bed as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She feels this and gives a giggle as she shuts the front door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel you are awake dear! We just got home so let me get you out of there,\u201d the lady said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls her pants and panties down and begins to free you from her voluptuous cheeks. It took her almost a minute to get a hold of your flattened form which was pretty amazing all things considered. She was very experienced it seems with removing flat people from this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing free, but still flat, you quickly try to take in your new location. You see you are in a huge room with a fireplace, television, and couch. This seems to be the living room. It was a very welcoming room, very warm reds and oranges. You aren\u2019t given long to look this over as the lady starts moving through the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next room you find yourself in is a beautiful room. There are again predominately warm colors, though they tend toward red and strangely blue. It seems too work. A few things that stand out is how sparsely furnished it is. In fact the only furniture in this normal sized room is the far corner. It has a two foot long bed, a very small chair, a miniature television and computer desk. Then you notice several suits of armor and a multitude of swords?! All very miniature in size so to you the perfect size. This must be Erza\u2019s room! You admired that even though she had a daughter only a foot tall, and she did weird things with her, she had tried to give her as much normalcy as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright sweetheart, I\u2019ll leave you here on your bed to reform after that trip! I believe my big ol booty was just a bit too much for you that time! If you need anything just let me know the usual way!\u201d With this cheery statement, she left you on Erza\u2019s bed and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you laid in this bed you had a multitude of thoughts. First you had been transported by a beautiful woman back to her home and she thought you were her daughter. That was gonna be a problem most likely. Second, Cassie would have no idea what had happened to you. Irina would just tell her she had left you in her hotel room and then you disappeared. You felt horrible thinking that her trip would most likely be spent searching frantically for you and not having any fun. You had to try and make contact with her hopefully through the lady of this house. If she didn\u2019t freak out about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you almost two hours to unflatten and start moving again. You debated on what you should do next. The most logical choice would be to try and make contact with the mysterious red head and see if she can assist you. Plus she probably would actually want to get her daughter home from wherever she is staying. You could also just try to find a phone and make that initial call just to set Cassie\u2019s mind at ease. The other choice you had in mind was to leave a note for the lady to explain you were not her daughter and just vacate and see if you could wander into town and maybe get a nice stranger\u2019s help with calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up your mind you proceed to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting up in the first appropriately sized bed of your entire life, you felt a bizarre mixture of complete unease as well as comfort. On the one hand you were 4,000 miles away from your loving girlfriend and her family without them having a clue as to your location. But on the other hand the knowledge that there was someone else out there in the world with your condition was incredibly interesting. That combined with all of the correct sized amenities that you would get to experience for the first time convinced you that you couldn't simply run away from the now second woman to have housed you inside of her ass on a long journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hopped down from the bed, appreciating that it was actually closer to the ground as well, before starting your trek towards the door. However, it seemed your cautious side was beginning to creep into your mind. While it is true that this woman does have experience with having a one foot tall daughter, you have absolutely no idea how she is going to react to finding out about you. After all, the only thing stranger than shoving someone between your ass cheeks for twelve hours is finding out that you didn't even know the person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this reason you took a second look at the suits of armor lining one wall of the room. There were a number of them, all appearing to be exactly the right size for you! They were made of various materials and in a number of different styles, each one at least appeared to not only be rather ornate but seemingly functional as well! With your trepidation in mind and the insurance policies of the armor lined up in front of you, you rationalized that it would be stupid not to take some precautions when approaching a total stranger that was practically six times larger than you. Carefully grabbing pieces of what looked like typical knight's armor from a rack, you slid each one over your body, fiddling with the harnesses until finally they were all on your body. Looking in a mirror you saw your reflection and thought that you honestly looked pretty cool in the whole getup. Even though your face was completely obstructed by the helmet you felt like the suit made you look like a real knight in shining armor! You took one more glance at a matching sword that laid next to where the suit was but decided against it. Approaching a total stranger from inside of her house with a weapon in hand seemed like a surefire way to start things off on the wrong foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the door you notice that it had two doorknobs on it, one at average human height and one perfect size for you to turn and grab as well! You smiled and told yourself that you would need to make all of these size appropriate accommodations to wherever you were living... if you ever managed to get back. Cracking open the door you heard some television coming from the living room where you previously were. Figuring that your best bet was to just approach this woman directly rather than risk sneaking around her house and getting caught somewhere you shouldn't be. So after a brief walk you finally saw stunning red hair dangling over the backside of a couch and knew you found your current captor. Figuring out what to say as you rounded the corner of the couch, the first thing you noticed was that the woman was wearing only underwear! Here bare feet were propped up on an ottoman in front of her and the rest of her smooth, pale, and curvaceous body was sprawled out on the couch. For the briefest of moments you thought to yourself how lucky you were to interact with nearly exclusively gorgeous women throughout your life, but before you could pat yourself on the back for such luck you heard the television pause!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at the woman's face you saw her staring back down at you! She immediately opened her mouth and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t just a knock knock but rather a specific pattern of knocks. The lady looked at the door confused and then turned to look back at you with an expression on her face that seemed to be a mix of surprise, confusion, and possibly anger. This doesn\u2019t look good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm \u201cdear\u201d could you please see who is at the door since I am underdressed at the moment,\u201d she finally got out in a semi normal voice. You felt that it would be better just to do as you had been bidden instead of trying to argue now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the front door and saw that just like the bedroom, there was a smaller door set into the front door. The knocking seemed to be coming from there. You hesitated for a moment before opening the door and looking outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside the door with her hand still raised stood a young woman the same height as you. She had long flowing red hair, fierce determined eyes, and her mouth was set with a stern frown. She was dressed in a white blouse that hugged quite a large chest, a dark blue skirt that came down to her knees, and armored boots. All in all she was a beautiful lady that immediately struck you as determined and honestly scary at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing someone in a suit of her armor on the other side of the door, the girl did not hesitate to lower her shoulder and charge at you full force! This resulted in her shoulder meeting your chest plate square on with enough force to launch you backwards! You tumbled after hitting the ground before rolling to a stop at the back of the couch. Your ears were ringing and the wind had been knocked out of your lungs. Shaking your head with some difficulty you did notice that your body did not seem to be very squished even though from that much force it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl at the door now stormed into the room. She was massaging her shoulder somewhat and you noticed it had sunk in quite a bit from her attack. Her eyes darted around the room quickly before spotting the lady standing by the front of the couch. At this point you noticed her breath out a heavy sigh of relief and though her eyes stayed fierce when looking  back at you, the tenseness of her body seemed to dissipate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother! I was so worried when I didn\u2019t hear from you! I was all ready to go by the door and you never came by. I thought something had to be wrong and you were not answering your phone so I snuck out of Aunt Cordelia\u2019s home and made my way here. Seeing the light on made me think something dreadful had happened to make you forget me. I expected your kidnapper to answer the door and then I was going to take them down and save you!\u201d The girl declared in a very commanding confident voice. You blinked in awe at this woman standing before you. She had to be the most headstrong confident person you had ever met! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my well thank you my sweet little Erza, so brave! And I see you immediately overpowered whoever this is...\u201d the lady said trailing off as she looked down at you. She thought back to everything she had done with you and blushed deeply.  \u2018How could I have been so dumb,\u2019 she thought to herself, \u2018I mean I have never seen another person with this condition and the doctors said there were no records of this...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know quite what to do at this point. Looking at Erza she still seemed ready to take you down, she still had no idea who or why you were here. Looking back at her mother, she seemed lost in thought and her face looked crimson red. \u2018Oh gosh she must be thinking about what she did to me a total stranger. This might not end well, I should probably explain myself.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been incredibly nice to you but that was due to her mistaking you as her daughter. She could potentially be very upset with you for not doing something to alert her though that had been impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way out of Erza\u2019s room, you found yourself in a hallway. It seemed this room had been at the very end of the hallway. Straight ahead you could barely make out the reds and oranges of the living room. There seemed to be a single lamp on in there lighting up the room dimly. There were two other doors in this hallway. The one to your right was open and dark. The floor looked to be tile from what little light made its way into the hallway. The room to the left seemed to have a tv on from the way the light looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively went towards the room to the left. Most likely this would be where a cellphone is. You would just have to be careful not to alert the lady of your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly entered the room, you saw a very nice bed, and could definitely make out the beautiful red head resting on top of it. There was a tv against the wall that was tuned into some late night news channel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tell if she was asleep or not but did notice a set of stairs at the foot of the bed for someone your size. You could climb up those and see if she was awake. If she had her cell with her you would need to go up there anyways. It was probably on the nightstand next to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly crept into the room, and made your way to the small set of steps. Slowly climbing these brought you onto the foot of the bed and you then saw that she was stretched out on her stomach. She had a sheet over her body so you couldn\u2019t tell if she had anything on or not. Straining your eyes to the front of the bed, you could make out her face and her eyes were shut. You let out a small sigh of relief and looked to see if you could make out her phone on the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were looking you suddenly saw a phone light up on the nightstand! She must have just received some sort of message or something. Now knowing your target you proceeded to step onto the bed and make your way towards the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey took you right beside the sleeping beauty. You were careful not to move too quickly or make any noise. You kept your eyes on her mainly to watch for any hint of her waking up but also to take in the sight of her. She was definitely a very fine looking lady. If circumstances were different you could definitely see yourself dating someone like her. Well what little you knew of her anyways. Passing by her hips you stopped to take in the sight of her gigantic ass, covered by the sheets but still clearly defined in shape. You couldn\u2019t help but give a small whistle of appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady stirred slightly, and started shifting around. With a start you saw she was rolling towards you! You took off running, if you got caught under her ass again chances were you would be there til morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you could see her ass had passed the halfway point and was now above you and continuing to get closer! You redoubled your efforts to get clear of it but it was quite a large butt and you had stopped as soon as you were next  to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final effort you dive forward. You brace yourself for impact as</span></div></div>",

This caused you to meet the ass crashing down on top of you, but at such an angle that you were sent flying off of the bed. With a crash you were flattened on impact to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady murmured in her sleep, \u201cErza, be careful around my big booty or you\u2019ll...,\u201d then she rolled back onto her stomach. You groaned from the wall. If you had just been faster you would be at her phone now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at where you had ended up. Flat against the wall, you strained to see what was around you. You could just make out a dresser right beneath you. That could be good! If you could fall down to the dresser you may be able to still get to the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to reform off of the wall. It took about 10 minutes but you finally popped free and fell, straight into an open drawer!! Not good, you hadn\u2019t been able to see that a drawer was open and could do nothing to change your trajectory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a soft landing at least. Shaking your head, you looked to see that this dresser drawer was very deep. You sighed, it would be pretty hard to get out of this. Maybe you could see what was in here and use that to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that everything in this drawer was very lacy and fancy. Some of these items had more material than others. There was no mistaking what they were though. You sighed as you realized you had fallen into the panties of this lady. \u201cGreat, now when she wakes up I\u2019ll really look like I was up to no good. Can\u2019t I catch a break?!\u201d You complained to no one in particular. You thought about what your options were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried climbing out a few times but only succeeded in falling back into the lacy articles over and over again. Finally resigning yourself to being stuck, you tried to strategize what your next move would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can either try to get her attention in the morning and explaining everything, or I can try to catch a ride the next time she grabs something. I could always stack this up so that hopefully she just grabs whatever is on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weighing the pros and cons of these options you decide to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the lady finished thinking on what to do with her daughter, she was surprised to hear a familiar ringtone coming from her phone. It was a special ringtone reserved for the most important person in the world, the one currently riding in her ass crack. Confused, the lady answered her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello you have reached Ceraza, may I ask who is calling?\u201d the lady said as normally as she could. She was actually concerned thinking who would be calling her using Erza\u2019s phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm it is Erza Mom, who else would it be?\u201d asked a very confused girl on the phone. Ceraza was also confused... How could Erza be calling her when she was flat currently. I mean she was amazing but no one could do that could they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza decided to carry on the conversation and squeeze her cheeks together while Erza  was talking. \u201cI was just joking dear, ha ha, how have you been? I don\u2019t think we have ever been apart so long, how ever diid you staaand it?!\u201d  Ceraza said this as sensually as she could. She also made sure to sway her hips from side to side as well. She smiled as she heard Erza\u2019s breath catch, she could almost see her face blushing. Then as she started replying, Ceraza made sure to clench her booty together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was hard to be away from you but I know you were really looking forward to it and I knew it was only gonna be a little while. Plus I always want to be able to make you happy. And I may have looked at some of your old modeling work to help me through um the loneliness uh yeah,\u201d Erza  broke off at that point. Ceraza smiled warmly but noticed that there was not any  interruption at all to her daughter\u2019s response. She even did her last squeeze with enough pressure to turn her daughter into nothing more than a sticker in her ass crack but Erza continued talking. This lead Ceraza to realize that she didn\u2019t have Erza in her big butt but rather someone or something else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell dear it is good to hear you have been ok and coping as best you can. Which modeling pictures were you going over I wonder? Hmm well maybe you can show me later, anyways I will be there soon enough to get you and then we can relax at home together, or if you would rather do something we can as well. I\u2019m not too tired so I can manage to do something. Maybe a little modeling show just for you?\u201d Ceraza said with another smile on her face. She could just imagine Erza\u2019s cute little face trying to be serious but failing as the blush crept up her cheeks and her mouth twisted with a range of emotions. She was always so much fun to tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm w-well we can figure that out later. I have all my stuff ready to go when you get here. I l-love you and can\u2019t wait to hug you!\u201d Erza  said as steadily as she could. She was having a hard time not just breaking into sighs and giggles. Her mom knew just how to get to her. She looked back at a picture on her phone of her mother bending over a stool with nothing but fancy  lingerie on and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dear well I\u2019ll be there soon! Lots of love and kisses! Bye,\u201d and with that Ceraza ended the call. She smiled thinking of cute little Erza then her thoughts drifted back to the stowaway in her rear. She was curious as to who exactly this was as she had never heard of anyone else having the same condition as her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile, were awoken when Ceraza had been swaying her hips. It took a moment to get your bearings but everything rushed back to you. You could barely make out what Ceraza was saying and you were lucky enough to get her name. Then when she started squeezing her cheeks together you were reminded of why you hated being trapped in a woman\u2019s rear end. The first few weren\u2019t so bad but by the time she got to the seventh squeeze you were basically completely crushed flat and stuck to her butt flesh. You groaned to yourself, how were you ever going to get out of this one? Plus Cassie had no idea where you were now! You had to get in touch somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk, Ceraza arrived at the house where her daughter had stayed. She smiled thinking of all the activities she and Erza would need to catch up on. Her thoughts drifted back to the current passenger she had. What should she do about that person or thing? Maybe she would have Erza help her get it out, maybe she would just deal with it later. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving at her friend's house, who had been looking after Erza for the duration of her vacation, Ceraza was utterly confounded about her current situation. She had been completely certain that whatever was in her ass at that moment was her daughter, but after hanging up a phone call with her actual daughter she was now a bit nervous to find out what or who her little stowaway was. For that reason her greeting with her friend as well as reunion with her daughter was quite rushed. She could have sworn she at her friend saying something about going out on the town to celebrate being back from her vacation, but she was far too in her on head to really listen. Erza a tight hug before picking up her tiny bags and the two of them began their brief walk home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza's mind was absolutely racing at this point. In the best-case in she had stuffed some squishy material between her butt cheeks and kept it there for over 12 hours which would be rather gross but at least an easy fix to remove. In the worst-case scenario, and unfortunately the one that she felt was more likely, she had come across another human with the same body compass as her daughter and simply kidnapped them. She gasped lightly to herself, worrying about what sort of punishment she would receive for taking another human and imprisoning him or her inside of her ass only to take them across the world. It was a nerve-wracking possibility, and as soon as the duo had closed the front door, Ceraza felt like she had to come clean to her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erza, I don't know how to tell you this but I think there is another person in the world with the same condition as you.\" Ceraza said in a rather grave tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza looked a bit confused at her mother, she felt like this information would be incredibly exciting to the both of them. Why was she acting so strange about it? Ceraza continued before Erza could interject, \"And I believe I have that person trapped in my ass right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Erza's mouth dropped in shock she tried to process the situation. After a moment of thinking she spoke up, \"How did this possibly happen? Why would you just take another person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza grimaced as she felt her daughter judge her slightly. She quickly responded, \"I was in the spa at the resort and I sat down on a lounging bed and immediately felt the unmistakable squish of what I thought was your body! I mean, side note here, I've sat on a lot of things in my life but you and now this person take the cake for comfiest cushions under my ass! I stood up immediately but it seemed like my buns had already pounded him because he was totally flat and his features were indistinguishable. Anyway I figured you must have stowed away on me somehow and kept yourself hidden from me for the entire trip up until that point. I know, I know, that sounds stupid but it seemed more believable to me than thinking that there was another person like you! I figured that the only way you could have stowed away with me there was in my ass so I just shoved him back in there! A little over twelve hours later I was home and needless to say I was shocked when I got a call from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Erza was too stunned to speak momentarily. Ceraza evidently was incredibly nervous even admitting to her own daughter what she had done, so out of habit she continued talking. \"Oh God I kidnapped a human being and now he's squished like a sticker in my ass crack! I'm going to go to jail if anyone finds out about this! Erza you have to help me peel him out of there please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Ceraza was finally done with her nervous rant and Erza had her chance to respond. \"Mom, take a deep breath and relax. I'm sure if this person really does suffer from the same condition that I do that he will understand this mix-up.\" In reality this was a total bluff but Erza felt like it was the right thing to say to calm her mother down in the moment. She continued, \"Now please take off your pants and back your butt up to the table. I'm sure I'll have him out in no time!\" Erza displayed a sense of confidence that at least relaxed her mother slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, Ceraza picked up her daughter in one hand, even squeezing her body a bit too tightly out of nerves has she dropped her on the table. Then with some effort she peeled the waistband down off of her hips and over her enormous ass. Erza was now standing on the table, which was conveniently right at butt level with her mother, and staring at Ceraza's tremendous moons. Even completely naked, Erza could not see a trace of this so-called kidnapped man nestled between her ass cheeks. It was only when she grabbed one meaty globe in each hand and spread them apart that she finally got her first glimpse of you, compressed to a sticker lining the giantess's inner right crack. For the third time in only a few minutes Erza's eyes went wide with shock. There really were two of you in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were not privy to the exchange of information that just happened. Ceraza's tons of ass flesh had nearly soundproofed your prison cell. You could only catch bits and pieces of the with your captor and her daughter, but as you felt the pressure on your body lighten you also felt a glimmer of hope. That glimmer grew into a fully blinding light as Ceraza had evidently peeled her cheeks apart. Your eyes took a moment to adjust the light after being confined to darkness for more than half a day, but once they did you saw the most shocking sight of your life. It was a woman who was your size. The two of you locked eyes, you were incapable of speaking, but it seems the other girl was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, you weren't lying.\" Erza declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you!\" Ceraza shouted down while glancing over her shoulder. The sight of her own daughter staring so intently into her butt crack almost brought laughter to her lips, but the dire situation prevented that. \"Please just peel him out of there so we can figure out what to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza nodded her head and immediately walked further into her mother's cavernous crack. She felt an overbearing warmth emanating from the area, and as she reached one hand out towards where she believed your head ended and Ceraza's skin began, she felt a layer of sweat transfer some moisture to her hand. Meanwhile, you were ecstatic to feel anything other than crushing weight and jiggly butt flesh bouncing around and pummeling you. Erza was having a hard time distinguishing your body from her mother's ass, but after a moment it seemed she had found an edge. She just managed to hook her fingers underneath your head and began using all of her might to separate what was effectively a tattoo from Ceraza's rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo an outside perspective the situation would look absolutely ridiculous. There was a large, rather curvaceous, woman standing next to a table peeling butt cheeks apart. In between those cheeks that were not only one but two human beings. One of them was flattened into being two-dimensional, and the other was giving all of her effort to free him. But to all three people involved, it was pretty much normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Erza succeed or does something interrupt your rescue?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A number of minutes had passed and Erza had successfully peeled about a quarter of your body off of Ceraza's enormous right cheek. You were incredibly grateful for the tenacity of this girl, and you had already decided that despite the horrible situation you would not blame your captor for an honest mistake. However, tragedy struck has three sharp knocks rang out on the front door. This was followed immediately by the sound of the door opening as Ceraza realize that she had failed to lock it in her panic earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, the friend who had been looking after Erza while Ceraza was away on vacation threw the front door open. She shouted, \"Who's ready to party!? You've had time to relax now let's get crazy!\" Neither you nor Erza had even a moment to react, as in that same split second that her friend opened the door, Ceraza also clenched her ass involuntarily. As her right and left cheeks made an audible clap upon contacting one another, so did you and Erza. You two were immediately compressed face to face, steamrolling the two of you onto opposite sides of her crack. All progress made on your body was immediately undone by this giantess's involuntary nervous response. Seeing another person decimated the very same way you are so often made you think about just how powerful a single body part of a normal sized person was compared to you and apparently this girl too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza's eyes went wide as she realized what she had just done by squeezing her glutes. She took another quick glance over her shoulder and couldn't see a trace of either you nor her daughter, just pale ass. She didn't even have time to process that however, as her friend continued talking and she turned her attention back towards her. \"Girl, why aren't he wearing any pants? Our reservation at the club is in 15 minutes! Get changed and get that big booty shoved into something fun, we're going out with the girls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, Cara! I didn't forget I was just running a little behind changing!\" Ceraza shouted in response. Her mind was running a million miles a minute. Not only did she still have her kidnapped man between her buns, but now her daughter was stuck back there as well! What's worse was that she couldn't tell her friend about either of her ass prisoners because she was still afraid that she would get in trouble for treating another human being like a thong! Thinking on her feet, she continued, \"Just let me run into my bedroom and throw on a dress real quick then we can head out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard just barely enough of the conversation to understand what was happening, but what you did hear stunned you. This woman was content not only to keep you trapped in her ass but also condemn her own daughter to the same fate for the foreseeable future. From the little interaction you had with her when you met her, you knew she wasn't a bad person. But it seemed like she was incredibly flustered at the current situation and simply didn't know what to do. At that moment you felt her buns begin to slide back and forth, slamming into each other as she went into another room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, Ceraza ran immediately to a full length mirror on the other side of her room and spread her ass cheeks apart once again. Looking over her shoulder and into the mirror she saw the unmistakable outline of both of you and Erza's bodies squished completely flat against her butt flesh. Her heart sunk and she mentally kicked herself at her stupidity. She then spoke quietly down to you two, \" I am so incredibly sorry that both of you are stuck in my ass right now, but I just don't have time to get you out! Erza and mystery boy, I hope you two understand I don't want to be torturing either of you but I don't have any other choice! You guys will just have to hang in there as my little butt stickers until I get back or else Cara will start to suspect something! I just can't let it get out that I kidnapped a man and took him across the world inside of my buns!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza paused for a moment, clearly thinking, before continuing, \"Oh god my ass always gets so sweaty when I go out to clubs too! I mean, I know you know this Erza but mystery man I'm just warning you it's going to feel like a water slide in there pretty soon. I promise I'll try not to shake it too hard with you two in there, but in reality if I'm going out drinking I'm not totally sure how I will act the rest of the night. Again, I'm so sorry I didn't mean for any of this to happen but it'll be over before you know it. Okay!?\" It seemed like Ceraza I was expecting some sort of response, but the immediate pounding that her buns had put on you and Erza prevented you two from speaking. Ceraza seemed to realize this rather quickly has she slapped her on forehead. Unfortunately doing this caused her to let go of her left cheek, which sent Erza and the massive orb that was carrying her swinging towards you. Both of you slammed into each other, the ass meat surrounding you jiggling and moving from the impact. Ceraza once again realized what she did too late and cursed herself in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that nothing else could be done in the moment, Ceraza ripped off her top and threw her closet door open, reaching for the first dress she could find. It was unfortunately a incredibly tight and incredibly short, black cocktail dress. As she slid it up her legs she felt it compress her thighs, hips, and ultimately her ass greatly. Once again realizing she picked the absolute worst thing for the well-being of you two, she groaned but knew that it was too late. Now stepping into some black pumps she was ready to hit the town. Before she opened the door for bedroom and returned to her friend, she whispered down to both of you once more, \"Sorry again, don't hate me!\" You didn't know if this was directed towards you or her daughter but it didn't really matter. Somehow you did not hate this woman, you simply wished that you could have been freed so you could have explained that to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Ceraza's dress was so absurdly short that the slightest bit of light was flowing all the way into her ass crack. This subtle lighting was just enough to illuminate both of you and the girl residing on the opposite cheek. Of course as soon as Ceraza took a single step, the two of you were thrown into each other over and over again. But at the very least you could see the person suffering the same torture that you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the rest of the night go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her final apology, Ceraza directed her attention back to her friend Cara. She walked back into the living room, her hips swinging back and forth causing you and Erza to be smushed back and forth between her cheeks. This was the first time you had company in a woman\u2019s ass crack, and it was a strange experience. You and Erza were looking at each other and effectively were being rubbed together as well. Thanks to being squashed flat it wasn\u2019t quit the same as an embrace but you still were very aware of what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza had a look in her eyes that seemed to show a slight bit of annoyance as well as... happiness? There was a certain gleam in her eyes and you really couldn\u2019t tell if it was because of you or Ceraza. You hoped you would have the chance to reform your face enough to maybe get in a conversation anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car door opening followed by all the weight of Ceraza coming down on both of you. You and Erza were compressed together as Ceraza sat down. Her enormous ass being squeezed tightly by her dress and change of position. You couldn\u2019t see anymore due to the light being blocked by her sitting but you imagined Erza was right next to you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you felt warm air in your face. It had the smell of cinnamon and possibly wine but you were not sure. It took a few moments to realize but your eyes widened with the realization that Erza\u2019s face was directly in front of yours! This was a whole new level of awkward. As you struggled to reform enough to at least say something, you heard Erza give a small sigh. \u201cWell I guess we have to make the most of this. I do apologize that you were inadvertently brought back with my mother. I also apologize for not being quicker with freeing you. I should have trained more..\u201d Erza trailed off and let out another sigh of frustration. This then changed to a slight chuckle as she said, \u201cWell at least you got to experience the finest ass in Scotland! You honestly are one lucky guy, and I hope you don\u2019t hold this against mother. She would never have kidnapped you purposefully and rest assured after tonight\u2019s festivities I am sure she will work to get you home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were impressed by this little speech and touched by Erza\u2019s thoughtfulness. You also noticed that she blamed herself for not training enough, you wonder what kind of training she does. It didn\u2019t seem to stop her mom\u2019s ass from decimating her, but that was understandable from how big it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by Ceraza exiting the car. As she twisted to get out, you and Erza were squished once again into the inside of her ass cheeks. Erza was silenced by this action and all of your progress was set back again. You could feel the cheeks quiver as Ceraza started walking towards the place that had been selected for the festivities. There were several of Ceraza\u2019s friends here and they were all happy to see her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Erza could barely hear the music playing from inside Ceraza\u2019s butt. It was amazing how much sound huge butt cheeks could block! You heard enough to surmise that there was a party here and you heard different types of alcohol mentioned. This worried you, as one time Cassie has gotten drunk and you had completely slipped her mind next morning. It had taken the better part of the day before she had noted your disappearance and if it hadn\u2019t been for a friend who hadn\u2019t  gotten drunk to remind her she may not have even checked for you. Hopefully Ceraza didn\u2019t drink too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking this you noticed Erza\u2019s eyes widening with worry it seemed. After about five minutes you heard her voice again, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good! I have heard at least five different drinks that mother will not refuse, which means she will get drunk tonight... and we are still in here. We should try to unflatten and get her to go to the bathroom so we can work out a way to be noticed in the morning. If not this might turn out like that week long modeling trip I was stuck on in here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and you redoubled your efforts to unflatten when you heard the music increase in volume as the walls around you began to shake! You and Erza were again pulverized by Ceraza\u2019s gigantic ass as she started dancing to the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was a hot sweaty shaking blur! Neither you nor Erza were able to unflatten the rest of the night. It was a constant dance party it seemed, when Ceraza wasn\u2019t dancing she was drinking while sitting on you both. All thoughts of you had disappeared and she barely remembered that Erza has come along for the ride. Both of you were completely exhausted after 3 hours and had fallen asleep from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeraza continued to enjoy her party and by 5 in the morning was finally ready to go to bed. Cara had made sure everyone got a cab back to their houses, as she was not  a big drinker. She had danced with Ceraza the entire night though. As she saw her friend into the cab, she said \u201cBe sure not to wake Erza up when you get home. She probably went to bed early tonight, she had trouble sleeping while you were away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that parting, all remembrance of bringing her daughter along were dissipated from Ceraza\u2019s mind. She had left her at the house and she obviously had went to bed. Ceraza smiled thinking of her sweet precious daughter all tucked in at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabby made sure that Ceraza made it to her front door safely and wished her a good night. Ceraza stumbled inside and made it as far as the couch before collapsing on it. She tossed back and forth trying to get comfortable before kicking her pumps off and twisting out of her dress. Finally unconfined she collapsed onto the couch face first and descended into sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke in the morning, Ceraza had a hangover unsurprisingly. She stumbled into the kitchen to make some coffee. As it was brewing her thoughts turned towards her daughter, but does she remember where she actually is? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026think the safest bet would be the suitcase.\u201d You offered, not entirely confident in your choice. You hated the fact that being stuck in a suitcase would further cement your image as nothing more than an object, but it would certainly prevent any mishaps while crushed by Cassie\u2019s feet or squashed under her butt. You loved your fianc\u00e9e, but eight hours trapped in places like that was a bit unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie clearly agreed, as she breathed a sigh of relief at your choice. Kimberly and Irina nodded, agreeing with your choice too, though Kimberly seemed ever-so-slightly less enthusiastic. Your wife-to-be then dragged her suitcase into the room, laid it on its side, and popped the clasps open. The suitcase was only half full, as Cassie had only packed what she explicitly needed, and your clothing didn\u2019t take much room at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly left to go grab her suitcase from upstairs, and Irina headed outside to start the car for her best friend and load her own suitcase. Cassie took a quick second to sprint upstairs and grab a few bathing suits, before returning to the living room. She rearranged the contents of her suitcase a bit, leaving a pair of lacy silk panties on top. Gently, she folded your body in half and compressed you a bit flatter than normal, but not totally squished, and dropped you onto the silky-smooth lingerie bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope this is comfy enough Jake, it\u2019s the best I can manage.\u201d Cassie whispered to you, affectionately tracing a finger over your face. \u201cSee you in ten hours, sleep well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold that suitcase!\u201d A loud voice called from the bottom of the stairs, as Maddie rounded the corner. Looking at her in confusion, Cassie was about to ask what her sister meant when Maddie leaned past her and dropped three pairs of blue compression shorts and two green sports bras into the suitcase. One of the bras landed on you, covering half of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cassie could protest, Maddie pressed her hands into the suitcase and packed down the clothing, squeezing it flatter, and by extension, crushing you flat as well. She didn\u2019t notice a thing though, and Cassie was too startled to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maddie finished, she leaned back and grinned at Cassie. \u201cThanks sis, my suitcase was stuffed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maddie!\u201d Cassie stammered. \u201cThat was for\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise attack!\u201d A girlish voice cried, as Sophie jumped over the couch, landing in Cassie\u2019s lap. The giggly blonde wasted no time dropping two pink stylish t-shirts and two purple thongs into the suitcase. One of the thongs flopped onto your other half, and before Cassie could even fully comprehend what was happening, Sophie squeezed her new additions, Cassie\u2019s clothes, and your body, flat like a pancake, then slammed the suitcase shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSophie! What?!\u201d Cassie exclaimed, not even able to speak properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister flashed a childlike smile. \u201cHooray! Now I can bring everything I wanted. My own suitcase is about to burst!\u201d Sophie hoped off Cassie, and lifted her suitcase into a standing position. Maddie, in turn, guided Cassie onto her feet. Kimberly had also reached the bottom of the stairs with her own suitcase by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, we\u2019re leaving now! Let\u2019s go!\u201d She declared, heading for the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie patted Cassie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got your stuff, sis. Let\u2019s go!\u201d She pumped her fist and grabbed the suitcase, racing for the door. Cassie was totally taken aback for a minute, and had to be practically pushed to the door by Sophie. What had even just happened in the past five minutes? How had it all spiraled so crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie grimaced as she slid into the car beside Sophie and Maddie, thinking about the position you were in, but reasoned you\u2019d be fine. She\u2019d simply apologize to you later that day, and it\u2019d work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically, you were fine, if a bit painfully flattened. Your comfy underwear bed was no longer the pleasant sleeping place it once was, replaced by Maddie and Sophie\u2019s additions to the suitcase, and now that everything was packed in tight, you had no room to move at all. You were a bit frustrated, but otherwise unharmed. You could survive for ten hours of this, you\u2019d just come out of it a bit stiff. Good thing the resort had a massage spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoading the suitcase at the airport was bumpy and a bit awkward, but once your suitcase was on the plane it was relatively smooth sailing for six hours. Your position had been flipped and flopped a bit, and in the total darkness you didn\u2019t have a clue where you were. Still, it wasn\u2019t so bad, all things considered. The suitcase smelled wonderful, for instance. You drifted off to sleep for most of the flight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026only to be rudely awoken near the end of the flight as the plane hit a bit of turbulence. Cassie\u2019s suitcase trembled and bounced erratically, and everything inside began to shift and jostle, including you. You tumbled around in darkness, smacking into various articles of clothing, before finally finding your head pressed firmly into some soft fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, a heavy object slammed into your back, squeezing you firmly against whatever article of clothing you\u2019d hit. You faintly recalled Cassie\u2019s jewelry book being inside her suitcase, and it had no apparently fallen on you, acting like a heavy weight keeping you pinned against the fabric of the mystery item you were trapped against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the temperature had slowly risen inside the suitcase, and your body was sweating slightly. Your sweat, combined with the heavy jewelry book squishing you down, was applying exactly the right pressure to begin gluing your malleable body to the fabric. As the minutes passed, you felt your body adhere like glue to the mystery clothing item, sticking so tightly it\u2019d take over an hour of help from Cassie to pry you free. You cursed your awful luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the plane landed, unloading the suitcases was frustratingly calm and quick, preventing the jewelry box from being dislodged, and continuing your firm pressing into the fabric, like a cruel prison torture device. Any noise outside the suitcase was muffled, so you couldn\u2019t pick up the sounds of each Smalls giantess and Irina grabbing their suitcases and hailing a taxi to Atlantica. Nor did you hear them arrive at the jaw-dropping resort and check in at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie rolled you down the hall to their suite, which was a sprawling lodging containing a living room and three bedrooms. One for you to share alone with Cassie, one for Sophie and Maddie, and one for Kimberly and Irina. Cassie took her suitcase into her room, propped it up onto her bed, and unclasped the case, propping it wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh, my jewelry box.\u201d Cassie\u2019s eyes widened, spotting her box on its side, and trapping some clothing underneath. She dutifully moved the box out of her suitcase, but kept her eyes firmly on the box as she placed it beside the huge queen bed. You were once more revealed to the world, but unseen by Cassie. Truthfully, you were hard to spot anyway, crushed into a small flat blob and nearly ironed into the fabric of the clothing item that was beneath the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cassie could return to her suitcase, Kimberly poked her head into the room. \u201cI enjoyed our mother-daughter talks on the flight, dear.\u201d She smiled warmly. \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too mom.\u201d Cassie grinned. \u201cReady for something to snack on? I don\u2019t know about the others, but I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course dear. Lead the way.\u201d Kimberly gestured outside of the room. \u201cAnd yes, I think Maddie and Sophie might be doing something else first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie shrugged. \u201cMore mother-daughter time then!\u201d She strolled right past her suitcase without a second glance, gave her mom a hug, and headed to leave the suite. Kimberly hesitated for one second, looked over at her daughter\u2019s suitcase, and smiled. Then, she turned and followed Cassie to the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft all alone, you put all of your efforts into reforming as fast as possible, unsticking yourself from the fabric you\u2019d just about been engrained into. As your face was mashed into it, you couldn\u2019t tell what it was, or what color. You begged any gods that were listening for it not to be tan colored, otherwise you\u2019d blend in almost imperceptibly, which was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes passed, and you made no discernible progress. Then ten. You were much, much more pressed into the fabric then you\u2019d first thought, and you began to doubt that you could get free without Cassie\u2019s help. Even if everyone left you alone and nothing touched you for the next ten or fifteen hours you might not get free. That was bad. Very bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen or so minutes later, you heard someone walk into the room. Their footsteps drew near, and you were soon paralyzed by their cool hands reaching into the suitcase, brushing against you, and pulling whatever clothing item it was that you were stuck to out of the suitcase. You tried to thrash and move, to no avail. You could only beg the being holding you to spot you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could speak up to continue telling any stories, the melodic jingle of the doorbell ran out throughout the house. Sophie bobbed along to the fifteen second tune, and Kimberly stood up and dutifully went to check the door. You looked at your fianc\u00e9e and raised an eyebrow, wondering who it was. Her clueless expression let you know that she hadn\u2019t been expecting any visitors either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other room, you could just barely hear Kimberly say, \u201cWhy, Irina! Isn\u2019t this a surprise! And you\u2019ve brought Selena and Persephone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose names meant nothing to you, but the Smalls sisters immediately stood up and smiled. Sophie beamed. \u201cOh my gosh, the Briarwoods! Eee! Persephone\u2019s such a cutie too!\u201d She rushed off giggling towards the front door and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a week since we last saw them.\u201d She called after Sophie, and trailed along out of the room. Cassie was the last to go, turning to spare you a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Briarwood family are our next-door neighbors.\" Cassie said. \"Our families hang out all the time. Miss Briarwood, Irina, is mom\u2019s best friend. Let me go say \u2018hi\u2019 really quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cSure thing babe.\u201d Winking at you, Cassie strolled out of view, leaving you alone on the table. Or at least, alone for two seconds, before Sophie tore back into the room at full tilt. Sparing you a quick grin, she ran to the couch, retrieved the cell phone she\u2019d apparently left behind, and sprinted back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on her way out, Sophie\u2019s foot kicked the corner of the table you were on, creating a mini earthquake. Unprepared, you stumbled forward and fell off the edge, falling to the carpet two feet below. Your face impacted on the ground, slightly mushing your head, and you weakly looked up in time to see Sophie disappear around the corner, oblivious to her blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you made a mental note to be careful around her in the future. Though obviously a nice, caring, and happy girl, she\u2019d demonstrated more than one airheaded and ditzy tendency in the short time you\u2019d known her. Picking yourself up off the floor, you dusted off your shirt and pants, and only looked back up when you heard footsteps drawing nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, lean girl slowly meandered into the room, looking around aimlessly. Her pitch-black hair fell down her back and in front of her face like a curtain, shrouding her features with a veil-like quality. Past her long locks, you could just make out two blue eyes highlighted by black eyeliner, a cute nose, and plush lips coated in black lipstick. The girl\u2019s skin was such a pale white color it almost looked porcelain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting her hair and choice of makeup, the girl\u2019s outfit was almost entirely black, with white and purple highlights. She was wearing a loose-fitting t-shirt torn away in the middle to show off some midriff, and tight black leggings. She was certainly less well-endowed than someone like Cassie (or even her entire family), but the girl\u2019s smaller breasts cute butt, and long legs were nothing to scoff at either. She looked to be eighteen or nineteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew near, you noted two things. Firstly, you noticed she hadn\u2019t taken off her shoes yet, though calling them shoes was hardly appropriate. The girl\u2019s towering black boots went past her calves, and were quite eye-catching. Of course, part of the reason they were eye-catching was due to the second thing you noted: the girl kept looking at the paintings on the wall, and the TV, but never at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoolishly, you realized this a second too late, and as soon as you opened your mouth to call up to her, the girl took another step, the black boot of her left foot hovering over your body. Your cry died in your throat, and the girl stepped down, burying you under her boot and squashing your body into a pancake, accordion style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t inattentive enough not to feel that though, and the girl quickly stepped off of you. Peering down at you from behind her sheet of hair hanging in her face, the girl spotted your squashed facial features. Even though she had no idea what you were, she knew she\u2019d stepped on something she shouldn\u2019t have. The girl drew back into herself, biting her lip in an outrageously adorable expression of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you thirty seconds or so, but your miraculous body unfolded from its crushed state and reformed back into 3D. Once more you dusted yourself off, and then looked at the girl. Her eyes were wide with wonder, and she actually brushed aside the hair in front of her face to get a better look at you. You gave her a friendly wave, and opened your mouth to introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m\u2013\u201d Was all you got out, before a high-pitched voice squealed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH! What a cute dolly!\u201d The childish voice cried, and your attention snapped to another newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance to the living room was a much shorter and younger girl, though she still obviously dwarfed you. Her bright features exuded childlike innocence and naivety, from her bright brown eyes to her black hair styled into wavy ringlets and hung around her shoulders. She was wearing a simple little girl\u2019s dress that flowed around her as she walked, white fabric with red floral roses printed on. She couldn\u2019t have been older than seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily confused what the little girl was talking about, you were taken aback as she rushed forward and scooped you up into her arms, her strength surprising compared to her petite frame. You struggled in her arms, but she only gripped you tighter, her squeezing embrace squishing your limbs flat slowly. The little girl held your head against her shoulder like a baby and spun in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught the eye of the older girl, and her face was panic stricken. She looked at you intently, appearing almost afraid of the sudden change in her introduction to you. Closing in on herself, she seemed to be trying to say something to the little girl, but couldn\u2019t find the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your knight in shining jean shorts arrived, as Cassie rushed into the room and knelt to the little girl\u2019s level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie put on a friendly smile, though her eyes kept darting to you. \u201cUh, hey there Persephone. Remember me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl, Persephone, nodded happily. \u201cYep yep! You went to school, right? I go to school too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie patted Persephone\u2019s head, eliciting a happy giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I went to big kid school, but now I\u2019m back. And, that dolly you\u2019re holding is actually mine. Can I have it back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone\u2019s smile vanished instantly, and her hold on you tightened even further. A strangled gasp escaped your lips. The tiny giantess shook her head. \u201cBut I like him. He\u2019s squishy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, he is.\u201d Cassie agreed, voice growing more stern. \u201cBut, Persephone, he\u2019s not your dolly. He\u2019s mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone was resolute. \u201cBut mommy says big kids like Selena don\u2019t have dollies. You said you went to big kid school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s eyes widened, and she swore softly under her breath. Her patience lessened. \u201cYes, Persephone, but my dolly is\u2026uh\u2026for a friend. It\u2019s a present for a special friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone titled in head in contemplation, and then her eyes lit up like the night sky. Nodding over and over, she relinquished her grip on you and handed you to Cassie. You were a bit crumpled up, so Cassie shot you a fast glance of sympathy before setting you down on the couch behind her. The tall girl, who you now assumed to be Selena, also caught your eye, and her eyes conveyed a relieved sense of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie thanked Persephone for handing you over, but was totally unaware of the truly horrific conclusions the seven-year-old was jumping to in her mind. Having rationalized that Cassie didn\u2019t need a dolly since she was a big kid, and figuring that Cassie knew how much Persephone liked playing with you, the little girl had decided that SHE must be the special friend Cassie had mentioned, and the you must be a present for her. As such, she\u2019d had no problem handing you over, figuring Cassie would just give you to her later.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Cassie thanked Persephone, the rest of the Smalls and Briarwood family walked into the room. Sophie and Maddie took up positions near Selena and began engaging her in conversation. The poor girl looked utterly panicked by the social interaction, but soon lowered her defenses because of Sophie\u2019s sheer radiant joy and Maddie\u2019s genuine earnestness. Kimberly settled into her favorite recliner and gestured for the last Briarwood family member to sit, then turned to talk to Persephone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last Briarwood member was Irina, the mother of Selena and Persephone. A huge smile filled her face as she strolled into the room, her demeanor and appearance suggesting the perfect picture of a caring and fun-loving mother. Although, at first glance, you barely noticed her black haired framed into an alluring bob cut, her warm blue eyes, or her flawless skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamefully, you had a harm time not noticing Irina\u2019s more\u2026prodigious\u2026assets. Close to Kimberly\u2019s age, Irina was actually quite similar in body type, along with all that that entailed. Colossal breasts seemed to strain against her low-cut purple blouse, and the surprisingly indecent mini-skirt she wiggled her curvaceous rear end into seemed fit to pop at the seams. Thick thighs further complemented her appearance. She had some weight to her, but in all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in all this visage academically, of course. Irina was undoubtedly a vision, age certainly not slowing her looks down, but you noted this fact purely on a base level. You acknowledged her as attraction, but shook your thoughts back to Cassie. She was the one for you, and no other giantess held her level of appeal. You glanced in her direction, and basked in her beauty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026which was ultimately your undoing. Turning your gaze from Irina to Cassie distracted you as to just how close Irina was getting. Her back was to you, and her motherly gaze focused squarely on her daughters. It was only as she began to sit that your predicament dawned on you, but your distraction had cost you. You weren\u2019t nearly reformed enough to wiggle out of the way, let alone cry up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft \u2018whump\u2019, Irina\u2019s plump buttocks clapped down onto the sofa. Your tiny body squelched under her immense weight, flattening out and conforming to an imprint of her left cheek. Her monumentally sized ass squeezed your very soul flat, and you could only mutely whimper and pray for someone to notice what had happened. As it was, you were totally incapable of reforming, moving, or talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina\u2019s fleshy booty totally absorbed the feeling of squishing you, however, and the black-haired goddess remained content and unaware. Around this time, Cassie turned from Persephone, and noted Irina sitting directly where she\u2019d placed you earlier. Frowning, Cassie crossed the room and slid onto the couch beside mother Briarwood. Irina smiled wholeheartedly at her, oblivious to the brunette\u2019s conflicted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie coughed. \u201cEr\u2026Miss Briarwood, did you\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina put her hand on Cassie\u2019s shoulder, stopping her. \u201cCassie, please. You\u2019ve gone off to college for years and come back with a degree. You\u2019re an adult now, and certainly as beautiful as one. Call me Irina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fianc\u00e9e blushed at the compliment. \u201cUh, right\u2026sorry. Irina, d-did you notice my\u2026uh\u2026fianc\u00e9 when you sat down? Was he here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina looked confused for a second, and then laughed uproariously. \u201cHeavens, Cassie! I\u2019d sure hope not. He\u2019d be stuck under all THIS if he was sitting here.\u201d Irina appreciatively slapped the side of her big butt appreciatively, and bounced in her seat for emphasis. Each bounce further cemented you to the slick fabric of her mini-skirt, and ground you more and more against her curvy rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took a deep breath and smiled. Unfortunately, Irina\u2019s innocent joke had the exact worst reaction with Cassie. Interpreting Irina\u2019s mention of being stuck under her ass as acknowledgment of your diminutive size, Cassie found herself with no reason to assume you\u2019d been painfully squashed under Irina\u2019s derriere. Instead, she figured you\u2019d reformed and left the room for some reason, perhaps to use the bathroom. So, she let herself forget about you for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, everyone else took a seat around the room, and began chatting and conversing. Most of the conversation focused on Cassie and her experiences in college, although Cassie certainly had her own slew of questions for Irina, Selena, and Persephone after being gone for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina discussed her thriving career as a fashion designer, creating and sewing her own women\u2019s outfits and lingerie from her home studio. She was an expert in her craft, and the whole neighborhood sought out her talent. Selena managed a few concise and whispered statements about how her summer between senior year of high school and freshman college was going. Persephone happily described all her friends and toys, and was looking forward to second grade. Since you weren\u2019t in the room, and therefore not in everyone\u2019s immediate mind, the discussion didn\u2019t sway to you for over an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat this meant was that you spent an entire lengthy hour pinned under Irina\u2019s hefty, globe-sized ass cheeks. The heat was sweltering, to say nothing of the buckets of sweat that poured off of your body. Due to your squishy body, the sweat only succeeded in further sticking your paper-thin form to Irina\u2019s miniskirt, your body hugging the curve of her left cheek like a sticker. Thankfully you were on the outside of her mini skirt and not the inside, but that was hardly consultation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Irina yawned and looked around the room. \u201cBoy, Cassie\u2019s lucky man must be taking a long time in the bathroom. I really wanted to meet him. Is he shy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly frowned. \u201cHe went to the bathroom? Must\u2019ve slipped past me.\u201d She peered at Cassie. \u201cDo you think something happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie began to sweat. \u201cUh\u2026I hope not. I\u2019ll check.\u201d She jumped to her feet and rushed out of the room, heading upstairs. Irina looked at her quizzically as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d Irina wondered aloud. \u201cHow could something happen in a bathroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie stared straight at Irina. \u201cUh, you did see him, right? Dude\u2019s only a foot tall. It\u2019s actually pretty crazy. I mean, he\u2019s a chill guy, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina raised an eyebrow. \u201cOne foot tall? You mean, twelve inches? You\u2019re joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie giggled and rocked in her seat. \u201cNope! Cassie\u2019s caught the cutest little guy in the entire world! He\u2019s adorable, and super nice, and funny, and really awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner seat of the room, Selena imperceptibly brushed some hair out of her eyes at the mention of your apparently \u2018cute\u2019 traits, and hid a small smile. As much as her mother, she certainly wanted to meet you too\u2026at least in a meeting that didn\u2019t involve stomping you with her boot. Dwelling on that memory caused Selena to shrink back again with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other corner of the room, Persephone was idly walking around the room, and hadn\u2019t heard a word about Cassie\u2019s fianc\u00e9, nor said fianc\u00e9\u2019s doll-sized height. She was bored, and impatiently wondering when she could get her hands on that fun little dolly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina shook her head. \u201cOkay, I still think you\u2019re all trying to play a trick on me. I might be getting more scatterbrained and forgetful as of late, but I can smell a prank a mile away.\u201d She began to stand up. \u201cStill, I\u2019ll play along for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her cue, Kimberly, Sophie, and Maddie all stood up and headed upstairs after Cassie. Irina peeled herself off of the couch, stretched her back, and began to follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you had expected, your squishy body conformed uncannily to Irina\u2019s plump left cheek, sticking nicely in place. Your face was pressed firmly into her skirt, and you could feel every little jiggle and vibration as she took a few steps after Kimberly and the others. Desperately, you tried to tug and pull your body away from Irina\u2019s own. You could barely manage a slight twitch after an hour of pulverized butt crushing, but you still put all your heart into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Irina followed the rest of the Smalls family upstairs after Cassie, her prodigious rear shaking back and forth as she meandered up the stairwell. Each tiny movement jiggled her gargantuan derriere, jostling your pancaked body about in a dizzying manner. It felt like an eternity as she scaled the steps to the second floor, and you felt about ready to puke from the constant bouncing and swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time you fought and pulled with every ounce of strength you could muster, desperate to pry your body off of her butt. After an hour of crushing and intense pressure, your flattened body stubbornly refused to budge initially, adhered to her shapely ass cheek like a sticker on her miniskirt. Your flattened state was so fine and thin that your mere presence on her booty was barely noticeable even if someone were to run their fingers along the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the second floor, Irina poked her head into the spacious bathroom, where Cassie, Sophie, and Maddie were scouring every cabinet and basket, seemingly searching for something. Leaning against the bathroom wall, Irina\u2019s plump butt smashed into the tiled wall, fleshy cheeks squishing together as she did so, and firmly planting your body between her ass and the wall, trapped and unable to move or reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to how she\u2019d pinned her tiny prisoner, Irina crossed her arms and frowned. \u201cWhat on earth are all of you searching for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly, who was standing in the middle of the room, sighed. \u201cCassie\u2019s lost her little fianc\u00e9. The one foot tall one, remember? She thinks something might\u2019ve happened to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cGoodness, you all are taking this prank so far!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie whirled to face her, glaring. Tears dappled her cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s not a prank, Irina! He\u2019s my precious fianc\u00e9, and he\u2019s lost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotherly instincts kicking in, Irina stopped laughing and brought Cassie in for a hug. \u201cThere, there, sweet girl. I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t quite grasp a handsome young thing being so tiny.\u201d She stroked your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s head lovingly, while Cassie buried her face into the older woman\u2019s massive tits. She pulled back a minute later, still upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s only been here two hours, and now he\u2019s missing!\u201d Cassie said, distraught. \u201cI\u2019m the worst, why would he ever marry me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019d be a fool to turn you down, darling, Gorgeous, caring, kind, funny, and a brilliant student?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, the poor thing must\u2019ve gotten\u2026squished, right? I believe I heard he could be flattened and such. Let\u2019s try looking for him in another room, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing a small smile, Cassie nodded and trailed out of the bathroom towards her bedroom, while Irina dutifully followed. Sadly, the other three Smalls women had turned back to scanning the bathroom, their backs to you as Irina sauntered away. As such, not a soul saw your painfully mashed form glued to Irina\u2019s buttocks as she followed after your wife-to-be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Cassie\u2019s room, Irina dutifully looked into cabinets and drawers for any sign of you, while Cassie checked thoroughly under the bed. As Cassie was preoccupied, you once more went unnoticed, but you didn\u2019t waste this chance. You fought tooth and nail to wiggle and pry yourself free from the curvaceous milf who\u2019d entrapped you, until finally you managed to peel your squished head free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisaster struck right then, however, as Irina plopped down onto Cassie\u2019s bed with an exhausted sigh. Her big booty slapped onto the bed, smashing you firmly into place and rendering all your earlier progress moot as you were pounded. Wiggling a bit for comfort, Irina\u2019s miniskirt clad ass ground you to a pulp, smearing your recognizable human features into indecipherable blurs of tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, goodness dear, where has your man run off to?\u201d Irina inquired, wiping beads of sweat from her forehead. Cassie retreated from under the bed, tears springing to her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know!\u201d She cried. Her panic brought the rest of her family into the room a moment later, and Kimberly and Sophie buried Cassie in a big hug, promising her that they\u2019d keep looking for you. All the while, Irina stayed seated, unaware of how her most eye-catching asset was slowly but surely claiming you, and hiding you from the one who sought you the most, standing just a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Selena and Persephone entered the room. Persephone ran up to Irina and took hold of her hand, grasping it firmly. Selena stayed near the door, nervously biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, mommy! Can we go home now? I want a snack!\u201d Persephone asked excitedly, bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispering, Selena looked nervous. \u201cY-You had work to do\u2026right, mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina slapped her forehead. \u201cOh, of course! I have a few more work orders to fill before tomorrow.\u201d Standing up, Irina brushed herself off, not in the least feeling your presence on the back of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the Smalls family, Irina presented you to the doorway, effectively keeping you hidden from the four giantesses who could save you easiest. This was compounded by Selena grabbing Persephone\u2019s hand and leading the young girl back downstairs, the two heading away from you and not seeing you on their mother\u2019s butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to head out.\u201d Irina apologized. \u201cI hope I can meet your delightful little fianc\u00e9 next time I come over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie mumbled a response, and Irina backed out of the room while waving, her infuriatingly simple gesture once more keeping you away from the sight of your beloved Cassie and her family. She didn\u2019t turn around until she was by the stairs, and each of the Smalls women had already looked away. As oblivious as ever, Irina headed down the stairs, met up with her children, and left through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house was right across the street, so Persephone raced wildly across the road, Selena scurrying after her to watch for cars and keep the rambunctious girl safe. Irina trailed in the back, smiling at her daughters and their energetic relationship. Her large rear end continued to bounce and sway as she walked, but sadly no one was out and about in the neighborhood to stare at Irina and potentially see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her house, Persephone disappeared into the kitchen, Selena retreated into the living room to watch TV, and Irina headed upstairs alone. The second floor of her house had a bathroom, and then each of the Briarwood women had their own bedroom. However, Irina also had a work room, a spacious room at the end of the hallway filled with fabrics, dyes, paints, sewing machines, chemical solvents, art utensils, two clothes lines, and a few mannequins of varying sizes. Irina often referred to it as her \u201cstudio\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into her studio, Irina approached a neat stack of papers on a side desk. Her fashion designing services were immensely popular, and she was frequently recruited by the neighbors for work. Her prices were fair and her commitment to quickly fulfilling orders was commendable. Each paper in the stack was an order from a customer, organized by date received. She\u2019d been meaning to do at least three more orders by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the first paper, Irina then walked over to her work station to sit down and begin. Meanwhile, you\u2019d spent the last ten minutes prying and twitching against Irina\u2019s huge butt cheek, pleading with any god above to save you. Slowly but surely your squishy skin unstuck from Irina\u2019s sweat-caked miniskirt, and time seemed to go into slow motion as she neared her chair. You knew full well you\u2019d lose all your escape progress if she sat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty, mute cry of frustration and determination, you wiggled your body a millimeter, and your lower half finally unstuck from Irina\u2019s shapely booty. Drifting free, your body brushed along the black-haired giantess\u2019 leg and fluttered to the ground, lying in a small heap. Far above you, Irina plopped into her seat, cracked her knuckles, and leaned forward over her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment, the scatterbrained goddess accidentally knocked over a small jar of paintbrushes, sending the art utensils clattering to the ground. The jar fell down onto your face, while the brushes dropped around your mangled body. Laughing at her own clumsiness, Irina bent over and scooped the brushes back into the cup, but in doing so uncovered your lumpy, battered body, and made eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Irina scrapped you off the floor and lifted you up onto her desk, scrutinizing you under the brighter light. Stroking your skin, she titled her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026some sort of stretchy fabric?\u201d She said, her warm breath washing over you. Panic filled you in an instant, and you tried to jerk and twitch in her hands, but to no avail. You could see light dancing dangerously in Irina\u2019s eyes, and a moment later the colossal woman parted her luscious lips to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGoodness, this fabric would be perfect for that bikini thong Sophie requested!\u201d Irina beamed, her smile wide and her eyes shining brightly. Your own eyes widened in abject terror, and you fought to quiver and shake violently to alert Irina to your true nature. Sadly, the oblivious woman slammed you down onto the desk a second later, rubbing you flat with her palm while still smiling from ear-to-ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you came from, mystery fabric, but you\u2019re perfect!\u201d Irina happily declared aloud. \u201cI bet it was a sneaky gift from Selena, the shy darling. I\u2019ll have to thank her later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing to rub your body flat, further smearing your facial features until you had been reduced to nothing but a featureless blob of tan, Irina used her free hand to pull a large Tupperware bowl closer. She popped off a cap of a nearby bottle, and poured a generous amount of red liquid into the bowl, filling the bowl nearly to the lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay, let\u2019s see here\u2026\u201d Irina flicked through the paper sheet outlining Sophie\u2019s request for the bikini thong. The paper was decorated in the margins with happy faces and glitter, much to Irina\u2019s amusement. \u201c\u2026okay, that precious girl just wants a solid red dye for the fabric\u2019s base layer. Easy peasy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an innocent grin masking what she was about to subject a poor innocent man to, Irina grabbed you and tossed you right into the bowl of red liquid. She pushed down on your chest, submerging you completely under the sea of red, and once you were fully dunked in, she sealed the lid back onto the bowl, entrapping you completely in the bowl and fully under the liquidy lake of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention away from you, Irina used her phone to start up a playlist of carefree pop music, then returned to looking at Sophie\u2019s work order. Sophie also wanted a matching bikini top, so Irina dug around in her fabric drawers and containers before producing a squishy tan fabric frighteningly similar to your body\u2019s own unique properties. She proceeded to fill a second bowl of red dye and dunk you in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour after that, Irina went to work on her second order, a simple request from a neighbor down the road for two matching pink bows. With uncanny skill and ability, Irina danced along to the music while finding just the right strips of fabric, cutting them to size, adding in glitter, ornately tying them into a pristine position, and then placing them in a box, sealing up the box and writing the recipient\u2019s name on the top. Every so often she\u2019d grab your bowl and the other bowl and shake them a bit, swirling you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Irina removed the top of your bowl and pulled your soggy body out. Still unaware to your true nature, Irina walked over to a sink in the corner of the room and wrung your body dry, squeezing you painfully until every last drop drained from you. You winced at the pain, and renewed your struggle to reform, though a small part of your brain recognized it was barely helping at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Irina walked back to her desk, you caught a brief glimpse of yourself in the mirror, and you mentally screamed, your mute cries unable to escape your badly flattened lungs. Your body, after soaking in the bowl, had been dyed entirely bright red, every last inch of your bare skin bright red in tone. Not a single spot of tan remained, and to make matters worse, the red dye also insidiously hid your human features from view almost entirely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping you back onto her desk, Irina perused her work order. \u201cOkay, next comes\u2026little purple flowers. Oh, guess I should reshape you before then! Silly me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother Briarwood grabbed you up into her soft, warm hands, her gentle and caring demeanor morphing into sheer horror from your perspective. Having done this hundreds of times before, Irina began molding and stretching your body into the perfect desired shape, all while you struggled in vain, desperate to free yourself from this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina squeezed your chest tighter and flatter, pinching your legs and head and stretching you out into an elongated shape. Gripping what was essentially your arms and legs, she pulled them away from the rest of your body and smashed them together at the ends, kneading your squishy left hand and left foot together, and your right hand and right foot together so badly they stuck like glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your arms and legs, which now formed two semi-circles connected to your chest and head, she pulled them out at the sides, widening them ever so slightly. She also widened your face and chest area a bit. Your body was being stretched to its limits by this woman, and each passing second you felt your body growing more and more numb, the blissful dream of escape fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Irina finally paused for a breath, sitting back to admire her work, you caught sight of yourself in her mirror again. Sure enough, Irina had molded you into the perfect shape for a revealing yet not too risqu\u00e9 bikini thong. Your head and chest made up the centerpiece of the thong, while your arms and legs looped together would serve as the leg holes for Sophie, your apparent future owner, to slot her legs into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, Irina glanced back at the work order. \u201cRight\u2026right\u2026little purple flowers should be all that\u2019s left!\u201d The motherly giantess clapped her hands together and grabbed a paint brush from her little jar. She also squirted a bit of specialized fabric paint onto a small plate, dabbed her brush into the purple goop, and began getting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an immensely odd feeling as Irina drew intricate little purple flowers all over your body, the soft brush practically tickling you, and the cold wet paint sending shivers across your thong-shaped body. You tried your hardest to reform or even move, but your efforts were so pitifully miniscule they all went unnoticed by Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes, Irina had painted flowers all across you, covering up your crotch, hands and feet, mouth, and stomach. However, it was her last flower that most terrified you, as the unaware woman lowered her brush a final time, directly onto your right eye. Mentally crying out in surprise, Irina went on tracing the purple flower\u2019s petals straight over your left eye, coating both eyes in purple paint with a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you\u2019d closed your eyes at the last second to avoid the unspeakable pain of a paint brush jabbing your pupils, but the consequences were just as bad. The paint was layered on right over your eyelids, and as the wet goop settled and began to dry, it hardened, fusing to your eyelids and keeping your eyes squeezed shut. You were truly unable to open them and see again, no matter how hard you tried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her brush away, Irina gently blew air over your body, cool breeze chilling you. She then used a special key from her pocket, unlocked a small cabinet, and retrieved a unique spray bottle. The bottle contained an expensive fabric paint sealant that Irina only used on special occasions, and providing a gorgeous two-piece bikini set for darling Sophie was one such occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpritzing the chemical mist over your entire body, Irina made sure not to miss a single spot, dousing you thoroughly. The mist settled onto your body, the particles stinging as they touched your skin, before solidifying into a single thin and imperceptible layer over your entire body. The thin layer of mist coagulated and hardened as it settled, finally drying off and sealing your entire body in a protective shining sheen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t fully recognize it at the time, but it was now that your fate had been sealed. The fabric sealant acted as a permanent layer of protection for the purple paint and the red dye, keeping the colors from washing or fading away from laundry cycles or usage wear and tear. This, in essence, ensured that for as long as the layer of sealant remained, your body would stay bright red, and the purple flowers would never chip or fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still, the sealant layer hardening around your body was physically encasing you inside. Obviously, the sealant had never been intended for use on humans, and it wouldn\u2019t have worked on you without the dye and paint already in place. Now, the sealant mist had cooled into an invisible bubble across your whole form, literally trapping you in this thong shape and preventing any reformation or movement at all. On top of that, you couldn\u2019t see or speak either! You were, for all intents and purposes, just a simple, if gorgeous, thong now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up after a few minutes, Irina daintily pulled on your arm-and-leg fused loops, testing your stretchiness. Satisfied that the sealant had worked its magic, Irina grinned happily. If she\u2019d messed up, the only fix to the fabric paint sealant was an expensive acidic solvent, and she was currently plum out of any. Another batch of solvent was due to be shipped in a week, just in case she needed it, and assuming Persephone didn\u2019t accidentally spill it like she had the previous batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting you aside, Irina retrieved the squishy fabric from the second red dye bowl and went to work, molding it into a stylish and revealing bikini top perfectly suited to Sophie\u2019s measurements. You could do nothing but wait on Irina\u2019s desk and wallow in despair as she worked, unable to move, reform, or do anything. After an hour, the beautiful bikini top, your partner, was laid down beside you, and Irina reached for a pink gift box under her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sophie will adore this!\" Irina gushed. Opening the box, she gently dropped your thong body and the top into the box, sealed the box up with wrapping paper, and addressed it to Sophie. Pleased with a job well done, she left the room and headed downstairs for dinner, figuring she\u2019d just deliver the bikini set tomorrow morning. She also wanted to thank Selena for the squishy fabric gift. Left all alone in her room, the nightmarish reality of your current fate dawned on you, and you drifted into an unpleasant slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens in the morning?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up at some point in the early morning you realized you found yourself incapable of moving or even opening your eyes. For the briefest of moments you had forgotten the terrifying reality of your current situation, but soon enough the realization hit you. You had lost voluntary functioning of all of your senses, only maintaining the the ability to hear and, sadly, smell in your current situation as the lingering scent of Irina's fabric paint hit you. You figured this must be the closest thing to Hell that anyone could experience, your humanity being wiped away unwittingly by a woman who in all other respects seemed quite lovely. Without the intervention of another giantess you were nothing more than a cute, decorative thong for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours must have passed by as you cycled through phases of existential panic and unbelievable boredom before you finally felt your surroundings be lifted high into the air. The slight jostling of your thong-form inside of what you assumed to be some type of box as well as the footsteps of your current carrier were all that you could perceive at the time until you heard a door open and shut. Assuming that this must be Irina delivering you to your future sister-in-law, you only prayed that something would happen to interrupt this nice gesture between neighbors and alert someone to your presence. But from what you could tell it seemed like Sophie had nowhere near the critical thinking skills to make this connection. Soon enough Irina rung a doorbell and waited for a moment before someone came to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Irina it's good to see you again\" the voice of Kimberly traveled through the walls of your box to you, \"Is that the bikini that Sophie asked for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is! Where's she at I wanted to give it to her myself.\" Irina responded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's upstairs putting on her makeup I believe. That girl really loves her photo shoots. I don't get the whole social media influencer thing to be quite honest, but it seems like she really enjoys it and makes some money on the side so I guess it can't be all bad.\" Kimberly responded warmly to Irina. It ground your gears slightly to hear how nice and welcoming Kimberly seemed to be towards her neighbor compared to how cold and critical she was of you. But that was a worry for back when you were human-shaped, if that day ever came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly motioned for Irina to come in and closed the door behind her. Once again the stomp of her footsteps indicated you two were on the move as she headed upstairs to surprise Sophie with the gift. Reaching her room, Irina stepped in and knocked on her already open door before saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sophie, here's the bikini bottom you wanted! I hope you like it, I had a lot of fun making it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie turned around from her vanity mirror and flashed a brilliant white smile before responding, \"Wow thank you so much Irina! I can't believe you just make clothes for us for free! You're a lifesaver!\" Nearly running with excitement towards her neighbor, Sophie excitedly took the box from Irina and began opening it. You finally felt some light filter onto your body, despite your eyes being sealed shut you could still sense the influx of some light through your closed eyelids. Sophie took one look at your thong shaped form, there was no indication that you could possibly be a one foot tall person. To anyone you would have looked like just a thong, let alone a ditz like Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it's literally perfect! I had a request to post some pictures on Instagram with a bikini bottom just like this by the end of the day today, but I kind of lost it. So this is a perfect replacement! Thanks Irina\" Sophie's enthusiasm was palpable, and so was your trepidation. At that exact moment you began to lose hope in ever being rescued, as neither of these two women had any shadow of a doubt that this article of clothing was just a thong. However, at that exact moment you heard the angelic voice of your beloved Cassie from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he, Where is he, Where is he\" she repeated as she raced past Sophie's room, scanning every single inch of the floor. Both Irina and Sophie took a moment to look at her as she raced by before Sophie spoke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie has seriously been panicking since you stopped by yesterday. Her adorable little fiance has been missing and she stayed up all night searching practically every square inch of the house for him. She even searched each of us! Checking underneath our feet, boobs, and butts both with our clothes from yesterday and without them.\" Sophie detailed her sister's worry to her neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Irina responded, \"Is he really that easy to lose? That's absolutely horrible I hope nothing bad happened to the guy! I didn't even get a chance to meet him yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Cassie said if you squash him hard enough he could just stick right to you like a little sticker or tattoo or something. She told a story of this time she accidentally sat on him back in college and only found him when she brushed her ass off after sitting down to tie her shoe hours later. She said she noticed his nearly two dimensional body on the ground next to her and practically fainted. It's especially common around girls like us with, well, pretty big butts, she said.\" Sophie filled in her neighbor with the info Cassie had given her the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gears began to turn in Irina's head with this influx of information. Sure she wasn't a genius by any standards but she wasn't a complete airhead either. She thought back to yesterday when she sat down on the Smalls' couch and Cassie asked her if she had noticed her fiance when she sat down. A tinge of discomfort began to grow in the back of her mind as the possibility of unknowingly doing something terrible to her neighbor's new tiny fiance. Nervously she spoke up, \"Sooooo, I mean when stuff like that happens though he still looks like a little two dimensional person though right? Just squished slightly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie said not necessarily, actually. Depending on the angle he gets squashed at he could get totally folded over onto himself! She said a few times he had been crushed in such a weird way that he just looked like a tan little towel or something after! It's really crazy but she said anything is possible with his bizarre squishiness!\" Sophie responded, not sensing the panic in Irina's voice. But this last statement was the nail in the coffin and Irina was now mentally freaking out, connecting the dots between finding the strange squishy fabric in her house and her plopping her big butt down on the couch earlier that day. Her mind was racing as she considered the very real possibility that she had just turned a human being into a thong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you couldn't believe that Sophie had revealed all of this information to Irina, but you were ecstatic. Thinking about how worried Cassie was for you and the incredible extent she was going to in order to find you warmed your heart further, but for the time being you only prayed that Irina would have the wherewithal to bring up the possibility that you were, in fact, the bikini thong that Sophie was now holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Irina break the news to Sophie?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Author's Note before the intro</b> - I'm pretty sure this concept won't be as popular as the typical \"one inch to a few inch tall\" giantess stories like my other one for example. But I occasionally enjoy writing from the perspective of a main character a bit more noticeable/substantial than the usual tiny guy who is crushed and forgotten about without even being felt. I still plan on adding to both this story and \"A Shrunken College Student\" as regularly as I can, so for those of you who may be a fan of one of my stories and not the other, don't fret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Introduction</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Jake Bigg (24) - In nearly every aspect of your life, you are a completely normal guy. Moderately tan skin, brown clean cut hair, a slender but athletic frame, and what you would consider a handsome face. All components of a typical young, attractive guy other than one thing; you are only one foot tall. Doctors and scientists alike have been stumped for the entirety of your life, trying to figure out how you can manage to exist at this height but without any of the typical health concerns or modified appearance of other humans who have been this size. The strangest part of all, however, is the fact that your miniature frame seems to be significantly more durable than that of the average regular sized human. You weren\u2019t a superhero by any means, but it seemed like some characteristic exclusive to you meant that your body was incredibly malleable. You could bend, flatten, stretch, you name it to ridiculous proportions, all while (eventually) returning to human shape with no permanent injuries. At the risk of sounding morbid, this special quality may be the only reason you have lived to see age 24. Because at a height of exactly 12 inches you are no stranger to dangerous situations with the regular sized people of the world. You\u2019ve been kicked, stepped on, sat on, thrown around, you name it and unfortunately you have experienced it. Nonetheless, you came out alive and through it all managed to meet the love of your life, Cassie Smalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie Smalls (24) - Your fianc\u00e9. From the moment you two met in college you fell head over heels for this girl. She is beautiful, compassionate, funny, the perfect partner in every way. When you first met her in class you two spent the entire period just talking and having fun without her mentioning your height even once, something you could count on one hand the total number of times this had happened in your life. Physically she is stunning, standing rather tall at 5\u201910\u201d with long brunette hair and an angelic face. Her body is equally as incredible in your opinion, sporting a toned look on the upper half while maintaining just the right amount of thickness around her hips, legs, and butt. She\u2019s a complete 10 and you can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of your life with her, the only thing possibly standing in your way is winning over her family. The story begins with you two heading to spend a month in her childhood home where her mom and sisters currently live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other main characters</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly Smalls (42) - Cassie\u2019s mother and hopefully your soon to be stepmother. Rather skeptical of you as it is your first time meeting her and she was not expecting to meet a 1 foot tall guy. She isn\u2019t cruel but isn\u2019t exactly warm to you either. Physically you can see where Cassie got her looks as she is a complete stunner as well, albeit with even larger but somewhat less toned assets than her daughter. 6\u20190\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie Smalls (20) - Cassie\u2019s youngest sister. Dyes her hair blonde to stand out from the rest of her family, claims to be something called an instagram influencer for her job. She seems genuinely nice to you but also quite ditzy, bubbly, and even forgetful. 5\u20198\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie Smalls (22) - Cassie\u2019s middle sister. Short, brown hair often tied up in a ponytail. She seems to be the real athletic type, incredibly competitive at everything and always training for something. She seems nice as well but there\u2019s no telling how she might act if you get in between her and winning. 5\u201911\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to write in more characters too! They can be friends, neighbors, whatever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interactive is written in second person perspective so use you, your, etc. when referring to the main character of Jake.That being said, feel free to shift to third person occasionally for the giantesses of the story, for example writing out thoughts that might be running through their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t kill Jake and try to avoid hardcore/graphic violence overall really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one word to one sentence bridge chapters, try to aim for somewhere around 1,000 characters or 200 words at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Topics I will delete:</b><br>\r\nAnything explicit with waste/scat is a no-go. Alluding to it or involving it in a chapter is okay just don't go overboard with explicit detail about the toilet stuff (farting in general is cool too, again just don't go too heavy with the nastiness)<br>\r\nAny insertion/heavily explicit sexual material. Keep it softcore if it needs to be sexual not hardcore.<br>\r\nOther men in the story. They can be referenced to but no male characters.<br>\r\nDon\u2019t write Jake to be some type of perv, he can totally be attracted to any of the women in the story just don\u2019t have him start jacking off or anything.<br>\r\n</td>",
