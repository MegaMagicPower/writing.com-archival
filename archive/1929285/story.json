(Note: Direct throws will only lead to her catching it before turning you into a Pok\u00e9mon and then capturing you with it before you could tell what you turned into. You must trick her into being hit by it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoal 6 subgoals:<br>\r\nGet back to Mew with the Pok\u00e9ball<br>\r\nWake up Arceus<br>\r\nDecide your reward - either to become a new Mewtwo to take the place of the old one, to become a Gijinka so that a middle ground can be found, or to become an embassy of peace between humans and Pok\u00e9mon. Either way, the story ends with success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
