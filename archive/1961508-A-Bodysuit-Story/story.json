The seats were still tacky, and the world outside of the moving bus was bleak and lifeless, not counting the odd individual walking somewhere. It was a friday, although looking at the passengers wouldn't tell you that; apart from a bunch of younger kids loudly talking about something Curtis didn't pay much attention to. The only thing in his mind was the thought of getting back home and spending the weekend doing absolutely nothing important, instead just fart around. Besides, all of his friends were going to be busy; and even if they weren't, he wasn't up to hanging out with any of them.  He didn't have any plans, nor did he want any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stop came closer, and soon enough he was out on the wet asphalt, the cloudy sky releasing driblets on everyone and everything. Another reason to get home as soon as quickly, he thought. On his way however, something lying in the middle of the road made him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly anything that stood out, just what looked like a pen; what made him stop was its surprising quality. It seemed to be a pen, but even for a pen it looked like it was incredibly expensive, nothing to mention the stellar quality. Its surface was pitch black, which made it stick out on the grey asphalt. Something about it just made it feel like it was... Out of place. Without hesitating, Curtis picked it up; he usually wouldn't pick random things up from the sidewalk, but this time he felt... Compelled to. He had a hard time taking his eyes off of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, when he pressed the button he figured would make the pen usable didn't do anything other than emit a vague buzzing noise, and what looked to be a blue dot appeared from the other end of the pen. Maybe it was a laser-pen somebody had dropped? The pen didn't have a name or signature on it, not even a logo belonging to the corporation that created it. Nothing! Just a black pen-like object that he was fairly certain was a laser-pen. But who would just carry a laser-pen around like that?</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, he didn't have a far way home, so he wouldn't have to stay out in the rain for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes had just begun to soak when he eventually arrived underneath his homes patio, the rain pouring down over its sides in steady streams. The device still in his left hand, he dug through his pockets to find the house-key and get inside from the rain, his mind instead clouded with questions instead of rain. With some effort, he managed to find and put the key in the lock and finally get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" He shouted, closing the door behind him as he stepped into the hall. The rug had no traces of water apart from his own, so he was the first one home, which explained why he didn't get a response and the total silence apart from some whirring from the machinery in the basement. Curtis went up the stairs to his room, and closed the door behind him and threw the device on his bed as he began to dress out of his rain-soaked clothes, getting a pair of dry jeans and a blank t-shirt. If he was going to test the device, somebody needed to be there, but he didn't feel like he was ready or stupid enough to try it on himself. Maybe he could find out something about it on the internet? He knew there was a lot of weird obscure stuff to find, but actually having something like it right there on his bed... Things like weird bdsm-kinks weren't so weird when they happened on a computer screen, but when it happened before your very eyes, well...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't be the only guy who had stumbled upon this device; somebody must've found something similar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so where to start? The device reminded him quite a lot of a type of laser pen, but \"Laser Pen\" was too generic of a term to search for. By the looks of it, it was just a laser pen, but something just felt... Off about it. But what? Was it magic? Was there such a thing as records of legit magic laser pens in history? Maybe. There wasn't much to go on, so he'd have to make do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, nothing. Lots of topics about magic tricks you could do with a laser pen, but nothing about a explicitly magical laser pen. Was it some kind of alien technology? It looked far too much like just a normal laser pen you'd see in stores, the difference being the weird luring effect it had. Laser pens that made you want to buy them? No, that really wouldn't give any credible results. At best, he'd get a couple of reviews of laser pens, at worst something more... Depraved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device laid where he had left it, not having moved an inch, so he didn't have to worry about it having a form of sentience or the like.

He pointed it to the floor and flashed it a couple of times. It could certainly pass as a laser pen, but the quiet buzzing noise it made was puzzling. Curtis continued walking through the spitting rain towards his house, and he kept studying the thing he had found. \"Hi Curtis!\" a voice suddenly grabbed his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis saw one of his neighbors, Natalie Finch, getting out of her car, which made him realize just how close to home he was. Natalie was an au pair/nanny by profession, 28 years old and with two young sons of her own, she looked after children at her house now and then. Natalie had a decent figure but wasn't model material, having given birth twice she was a tiny bit on the chubby side, but not much. She was 5' 6\" tall and her brunette hair was shoulder length with the tips dyed blonde. Natalie's breasts were average for someone her stature, a small C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nats!\" Curtis returned the greeting to his neighbor, who was dressed in a red t-shirt, a pair of three-quarter length jeans and black ballet flats, which was her usual, casual attire. \"Lovely weather huh?\" he then sighed, holding a hand out, feeling the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the rain isn't too heavy!\" Natalie mumbled as she locked her car up after getting her purse out of the passenger side. She then drew Curtis' attention to a break in the clouds not far away. She always did look on the positive side of things. \"Besides, it'll blow over soon.\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're right!\" Curtis shrugged, then he looked at the 'pen' in his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity was getting the better of him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe, but if something did happen nobody would suspect a pretty inconspicuous pen, now would they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating at first, he pointed the pen at her back when she begun to turn around, heading back to her house, and put his finger on the little indentation that made the buzzing sound. As soon as the blue dot appeared on her person, it was like for just a second her body and the world around her just stopped. A second after, her body just collapsed in on itself, now a empty heap of skin and clothes on the pavement. \"S-Shit!\" he recoiled, staring terrified at the results of using the pen. What had it done to his neighbor?  He couldn't see any blood, and when he dared to touch it the heap of skin still felt warm to the touch, as if it was still alive. Sorting through the clothes, he noticed a weird... Slit that ran along where her spine was meant to be. Pausing, he began to try to puzzle the pieces together instead of just scream and run away from what he just done. Had he turned her into a wearable costume? It was a bit of a stretch, but it reminded him all too much of a full-body latex costume, only not latex. Either way, he couldn't just leave her here; hesitating at first, he scooped up her belongings and looked around to find a good hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she had a key to her car, and he was right next to it... Fishing for it, he managed to find it and press the button, unlocking the car once again. Quickly, he got into the backseat and closed the door behind him, laying the pen and \"Natalie\" on the seat. What was he meant to do, anyway? Could he actually talk with anyone about this? Probably Michelle, if she was home and had her phone with her. But then again... He looked down at the suit, and began to think. Maybe it wouldn't hurt a bit to try if his guess about a suit was true? It was incredibly unnerving to even look at, but at the same time it drew him with just how weird it was. Did he seriously dare to do that, though?</span></div></div>",

Then he just sat staring at the pile of skin and Natalie's clothes and personal effects on the seat next to him. Part of him was horrified at what had happened, but the bigger part was amazing. The new 'pen he had found had turned his neighbor into an apparent wearable costume... a skin suit... or a body suit, however you wanted to describe it. Suddenly Michelle picked up her phone and Curtis her familiar voice. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, its me, I need you to pop down the street, you know Natalie's house.\" Curtis said, cutting to the chase. \"And don't tell anyone you're coming, especially not mom and dad.\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but... why should I come down there?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see what you get here.\" Curtis answered, before hanging up on her. \"This is too big for me to keep to myself.\" her sighed, again looking at his nbeighbor's deflated skin beside him. He had no idea if he could even turn her back to normal with the device he'd found. And he wasn't about to try yet anyway, not until he'd shown his sister Natalie's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Michelle appeared in sight, and Curtis stepped from Natalie's car and waved her over. \"Hey sis, over here.\" Michelle seemed genuinely confused as to why her brother was in Natalie's car, apparently on his own. Her first fear was that he'd broken into it, but as she approached, he waved the car keys at her, as if to show he hadn't committed a crime. \"So what's the big deal?\" Michelle asked, letting out a slightly irritated sigh as she walked up to the car.Curtis immediately drew her attention to the pile of clothes and skin on the back seat. \"What the hell? Are they Natalie's clothes?\" Michelle frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis smirked. \"That's Natalie... and her clothes.\" he said, before explaining to his sister what he had done and showing the pen to her.

Her eyes were sparkling with wonder, and soon enough she glanced at the skin, then to you. \"Alright,\" she began, \"so we know it works. Did you just want to show it off to me or was it something else too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uhm... I figured you'd maybe have a good idea on what to do?\" You weren't exactly dumb, but compared to your sister you were kind of lazy. If you were the Brawn, she was the Brains of the crew, always coming up with clever ideas and pranks for whatever the situation required. Your sister earned the title of the \"Mischief Princess\" she'd pull at kindergarten, but as she got older she became wiser and bringing it up would give you nothing but a stern look of disproval. If there was anyone you'd actually trust with this, it would be your sister. After knowing each other for so long, you knew about all her little quirks and vices, and she yours. Because of that, both you felt it was better to just trust each other instead of fighting - both of you knew exactly what to do to really piss the other off, and making each other angry wasn't that fun anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" She didn't give a immediate answer, but you could tell she was thinking as hard as she could, taking in the situation while at the same time doing something logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could...\"</span></div></div>",

He did entertain the thought of having sex with his sister while she was wearing Natalie's skin. It wouldn't really class as incest, though it would be weird from Michelle's POV probably. He decided against suggesting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, go for it.\" Curtis nodded to his sister, handing Natalie's skin to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it out here doofus.\" Michelle berated him, before entering the back seat of the car and slamming it shut. \"Close your eyes.\" she told him, before proceeding to strip out of her clothes, after making sure nobody was walking by of course. Then with great excitement, she held up Natalie's still warm skin... before struggling to put it on in the cramped confines of Natalie's own car. As her legs slid into Natalie's empty ones... she felt a tingling as they became hers. Then as she pulled up the skin, her ass grew slightly and she felt a tingling in her crotch. Higher up, Michelle's boobs filled Natalie's empty boob sacks... and she acquired your neighbor's bigger breasts too. Curtis opened his eyes a little and glanced in the rearview mirror.. just in time to see Michelle's pull Natalie's deflated head over her own. She then fastened up the skin and competed her transformation into Natalie. \"Oh wow... that felt so hot!!\" Michelle admitted, rubbing her thighs together as she noticed her pussy was instantly wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" Curtis asked, pretending not to have seen anything at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can look now, I don't mind you seeing Natalie's boobs and pussy, just not mine.

Do you know what it means?\" Curtis says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching an intersection, the car slows to a halt at the red lights. Cassandra leans forward slightly as if she's spotted something.<br>\r\nCurtis frowns, ahead of them, a car starts up on the pavement, a black Mercedes-Benz. It suddenly accelerates and speeds towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Cassandra spits, turning the wheel and slamming down the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car hardly moves out of the way as the Mercedes-Benz slams into the side of it, sending it sliding into the other lane, the Benz spins slightly. Curtis catches a glimpse through the windshield as his car takes off down the road, two men in suits with ear-pieces, one with his hand to his ear. He seemed to be talking.<br>\r\nPiling on the speed, Cassandra's going at about double past the speed limit, dodging side to side to avoid traffic. Eventually approaching a roundabout, she swerves right and then angles left to approach the curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, oh shit ohshitohshiiiiiiiiiiit!\" Curtis yells as they drift around the roundabout's curve in true Fast And Furious style, almost hitting another poor driver on more than once. Re-angling the car down the highway, the engine screams as it's not letting up, the speed meter rises from 90 to 140 KM in less than 5 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead, a black helicopter follows the car moving to the left in order to get a good view of the passengers inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a teenage male passenger and an adult female operating the vehicle.\" An agent yells into his headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lethal force authorized, make sure she's dead by the end of it.\" A voice comes through everyone's headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy. Engaging.\" He cuts the transmission as he grabs the handles of the side door's machine gun, swiveling it to aim down at the road in front of the car.<br>\r\nThe barrel spins slowly, picking up momentum until it begins to fire round off in a blaze of mechanical hell. Tracer rounds light up the highway in streaks of yellow raining down on the road, for one car in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet christ, Mom, they're shooting at us! They're trying to fucking kill us!\" Curtis screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know! Now shut up and sit back!\" She yells at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at her in shock and promptly obeys, pressing himself into the seat as hard as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car continually swerves left and right to avoid the stream of rounds, up ahead there's a police blockade. To the right of the road there's a split where the highway leads off, tall trees provide cover from the skies and tall fields on both sides block vision from anywhere else.<br>\r\nDown the road, two black cars speed towards Curtis' car as they approach, aiming to cut them off from the side road. The stream of bullets stops as they draw nearer to the road and the other two cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, they're trying to cut us off. Hold on, kiddo.\" Cassandra looks at Curtis and quickly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why? What are you doing?\" Curtis starts up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason I've had this car forever.\" Cassandra smiles, passing her thumb over the BMW logo on the steering wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she presses the logo, proving it to be a button in actuality. Hissing sounds through the frame of the car and mechanical noises following suit.<br>\r\nThen the car lurches forward, the speed meter needle batters the red zone. The resulting G-Forces throw Curtis and Cassandra into their seats, surprisingly, a huge grin plasters itself across Cassandra's face, and she soon starts laughing. In no time they arrive at the turn off and the car spins to the right immediately, Curtis instantly slams into the door window with the turn, apart from the excruciating pain, he notices jets of blue fire coming out of the side of the car.<br>\r\nThe car skids across the road as Cassandra pulls the hand-brake, steam rises from the road as Curtis sees time slow down around him, the car slides perfectly into position infront of the turn off's road. Suddenly, Cassandra slams down the hand-brake handle as well as the gas pedal. Lurching the car forward, Curtis almost strangles himself on the seat belt. Slumping into his chair, dazed, the chopper's noise fades away. Glancing into the rear mirror, nobody's followed them yet. <br>\r\nThe road leads down the path between two fields, trees conveniently planted along the sides of the avenue. Leaning over to the built-in GPS screen inbetween the AC vents on the dashboard, Cassandra pushes a button. The screen comes to life as what looks like a holographic keypad literally projects itself off of the glass.<br>\r\nShe taps a few numbers and it flashes green, then bringing her to a menu. She navigates through quickly, glancing up at the road and back to the menu several times over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voice verification, please.\" A computer generated woman demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra reaches behind her head, her fingers find hold of something as she pulls it down quickly. Digging her nails into her skin, she pulls up, her neck peeling up, the rest of her head follows as she pulls it from what lies underneath. Curtis stares in both awe and horrifying surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agent Drake, activate jump module, location X 349, 577, Y 109, 772.\" A man's voice commands the computer. A man with short black hair and the manliest jawline you'd ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis stares for a few moments at the man, not bothering to car about the blue light speeding down the road ahead of them, then up two trees further away down the road. A large blue sheet of energy spans the road between the trees as they speed towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra\" turns her head to face Curtis and smiles, or rather, he smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, son?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis nods, and then promptly faints. Slumping into his seat, Drake laughs and shakes his head. The car speeds through the blue portal and promptly vanishes. Then, as quickly as it was made, the portal winks out of existence as a black car speeds towards it. Passing through the area the portal previously was, the black car skids to a halt, spinning to the left. A man opens the door and quickly gets out, pulling off his shades. He slams the door shut in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! SHIT! We almost fucking had them! God damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls his phone out of his coat pocket as it rings and answers it, putting it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You failed. It is time for penance.\"<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

Even though it's only just turned mid-day you've been in your room for most of the day and haven't heard of or seen your sister or mother for that matter since you'll usually hear her around the house cleaning. The last you saw of her she went into her room when you left the bathroom, and the last you saw of Michelle you saw her walk into your mother\u2019s room asking her a question when you shut your bedroom down while walking away from the bathroom. And then nothing since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you get a reply from your sister reading  \"Hey Curtis, I've got something to show you, be in your room in a min.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmmmmm...\" you quietly hum out loud. You're then filled with curiosity and excitement as whatever this is Michelle is going to show you will relieve you of your boredom. After a minute you hear a knock on your door. \"Come in!\" you say out loud now moving yourself into a lounge position to where you're facing your room\u2019s door to talk to whoever it is coming in your room now. And to your surprise it's your mother that comes in wearing a navy blue casual dress with black tights and flats, a strange outfit for your mom to be wearing, she usually wears way different clothes. You also notice her hair is a little messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh... hey mom, do you know where Michelle is at?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here Curtis.\" she tells you with a cheeky grin that almost seems sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is this some sort of joke mom? Come on now, seriously where\u2019s Michelle at?\" you ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'm right here dufus. I'm mom. I got this pen device thing from online that says it allows you to turn people into wearable skin suits, at first I thought it was a joke so then I just bought it for a laugh, when I got it I decided to try it on the only other girl in the house just to be safe, and well.....turns out it works. And now I'm wearing moms skin Curtis.\" she explains to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come onnnnn mom, you can't expect me to believe that right? How much did Michelle pay you to say that haha?\" you say in disbelief. \"Is there any way you can prove it to me then?\" you ask her. Just then she unexpectedly lifts up her skirt showing you her panties through her black tights and holds it for about 5 seconds. You shocked by the sudden move don't have enough time to look away as you strangely endured all of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would mom do that Curtis? Or how about this?\" She then starts groping her large breasts and playing with them in front of you for about 10 second before stopping. \"Have I made my point or do you still need convincing?\" she says a little frustrated. <br>\r\nWith all of the sudden sexual things your mother did in front of you while wearing that more attractive outfit has strangely got you slightly aroused. You aren't fully convinced by the facial expressions you give to your mother and she notices it and decides to....</span></div></div>",

Doesn't matter I've got a better plans now, I was going to let you in on this pen and let you share in the fun but since you're boring me I think I'll just zap you and have a try of what it's like being a guy for the first time.\u201c your mother says to you which makes you believe more and more than it's your sister underneath her.  You try to bolt for your room door but you see your mom firing the pen at you, the last thing you see is a flash and then it turns to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POV Cassandra/Michelle*<br>\r\n\"Sorry Curtis but I'm just loving this device too much and I'm too curious for my own good\" you say grinning as you place the pen device on Curtis\u2019s computer desk and walk over to his skin pile. Picking it up like you did with your mother\u2019s skin you quickly undress it off its clothes and examine his naked skin suit. \"This is going to be strange, but fun....\" you say in your mother\u2019s voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndressing yourself out of your mother\u2019s clothes you put them in a neat pile on Curtis\u2019s bed and give your mothers naked body another looking over, \"Damn! Mom your bodies fucking great!\" you said out loud which sounded strange to hear your mother\u2019s voice say such a thing. After a short fondling session with your mother\u2019s huge tits you decide it's time to wear Curtis. Before you started to wear him you just remembered you're still in your mother\u2019s skin, \"Oh shit almost forgot\" you say. Just as you're about to unzip your mothers skin the idea hits you, can you wear more than one skin over another? You are a naturally inquisitive girl and always liked to experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you choose to...</span></div></div>",

Continuing with his legs you do the same for his left leg and then begin to pull his hips &amp; ass over your wide motherly hips and big mature ass, it was a little bit of a struggle but you eventually fit it in there and replace it with your flatter hairy male ass, you begin to push your crotch into Curtis's and you begin to feel a strange tingling sensation as you feel your mothers mature pussy being replaced with your brothers six incher and his balls \"Whooooa that is seriously strange!\" you say surprised by the feeling  of having a penis for the first time. You reach downwards to your new piece with your mother\u2019s hands and start feeling it, which to you now feels amazing as it's a women\u2019s hands feeling up a guy\u2019s penis. You move your brothers torso and rest of his skin that\u2019s dangling in front of you with your left hand and grab your new cock with your mothers right hand \"Ohhhh this feels amazing...\"  you begin to jerk your new cock and soak in the delightful feeling as you're giving yourself a hand job technically. Your new cock is now rock hard as you pump your member with your mothers hands \"ohhhhh... I-I need to stop for now. Need to continue putting him on..\" you say in a  Horney Cassandra voice. Grabbing curtisis right arm you slot your mothers arm into his and then pull his right shoulder over your own, continuing you do the same with his left arm, then pushing your huge tits into Curtis's torso your chest is now replaced by a toned male one. Zipping up the zipper you make sure none of your mothers long hair is snagged on the zipper as it comes up to the bottom of your neck \"time to complete the change\" you whisper, holding his head you place it over your own and then align the eyes with your eyes until you feel it meld and then it doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask anymore, you finish by zipping the zipper up to his head to which the zipper trail disappears until you're left with the zip hidden in your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, I'm actually Curtis now....\" you say with your big brothers voice. Looking over your new body you course your manly hands over your new abs and then notice that your dick is still erect from jerking it off a little before. \"Oh wow, it's so big.....\" you look in awe and then blush over your new piece in between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I've got to do something about it with how it is.....\" you say grinning. You walk over to Curtis\u2019s bed where your mothers clothes are on in a pile you reach for the box of tissues that he uses when masturbating and take out a few. You then grab your new member and then start jerking it off again, it feels amazingly new to you and so much easier than how it is as a girl in a way. Jerking your cock for about 2 minutes you then explode and then cum into a handful of tissues and when clean off your new dick as you make sure to get every last bit of cum with the tissues \"Ohhhhhh oh.... god that.... that was amazing...\" you say still breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the tissues into Curtis\u2019s bin you get up and the eye up your brother\u2019s body in his full body mirror. \"Well Curtis, guess it's time to see if I can get you laid...\" you smile devilishly as your next objective is to figure out what it's like to have sex as a guy. Getting dressed in Curtis\u2019s clothes you take your mothers clothes and put them back into her room, you then walk down stairs, get something to eat and drink and get ready to go outside taking both your phone and Curtis\u2019s in case you need to contact either of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to your front door you laugh as you realize you're technically wearing your whole family besides your dad as you're wearing your mothers skin and Curtis's skin over it. You open your front door go outside and give a call to....... </span></div></div>",

Michelle meant to run Thursday, but got caught up in errands instead. Her friends weren't planning on anything anyway; no parties to go on, no new movie coming out, absolutely nothing. It was a completely bare and dull week for just about everybody. In other words, a perfect time for going out for a run or two. Nothing was going on anyway, so why the hell not? A little rain wasn't going to stop her, she planned on keeping to the sidewalks anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roads were strangely empty; she didn't live in a very busy community, but there tended to be at least SOME activity. It struck her that she had been able to get home fairly early, presumably unlike the rest, which would explain a thing or two about the lack of moving cars and bright lights emanating from the windows. She didn't mind of course - taking a stroll by yourself like this was pretty calming in a way. A bit further up the road, something caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a car, or even the first individual she had seen in a while; it was a black, pen-like thing, just lying there in the middle of the sidewalk. She stopped as she came closer to it, and pulled it up from the wet asphalt, studying it as she held it between her fingers. It seemed to just be a pen, but something about it put her off. Was it the fact that such a fine pen was just lying out here with nobody around? Was it the fact that it didn't even seem to be a pen since pressing the button only made it produce a faint buzzing noise and a blue dot appearing where the edge was aimed? Or was it the fact that there was absolutely nothing to indicate who it could've belonged to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what put her off so much, but decided to stick it in her pocket anyway. No harm in keeping a nice-looking pen around, right? A bus passed by her along the road, and she could barely make out the numbers and address on its front. Wasn't that Curtis's bus? Seemed like he was coming home early too.</span></div></div>",

It was a very bright blue, which was what made it stick out from the background. If she looked close enough, she could notice the faint line of what appeared to be a just as blue laser. So it was a laser-thing! ...Maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, something that really differentiated the \"pen\" from any pen she had ever used was the button. Instead of being on one of the edges to press forward the tip, it was a small, metallic indentation on its side. Suffice to say, she had never really seen a ballpoint-pen that had something like that. Was it some weird custom-made creation? It couldn't be, who was that serious about pens of all things? Pens were important, but that was just too absurd for anyone to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was focusing on the \"pen\", something caught her attention and moved it away from the device in her hands...</span></div></div>",

Say could you come over to my house with that pen, I really could use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Michelle asked as she held the pen tighter in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this presentation Monday and I could really use someone to listen to, and perhaps I could use that pen to point things out on the big screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, I don't have anything else to do anyway.\" Michelle puts the pen inside the pocket of her yoga pants as she and Sarah walked over to Sarah's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the subject about?\" Michelle asked curious.

Michelle quickly changed the subject, otherwise she would have to hear another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later they were in front of the house of Sarah. Sarah grabbed the extra key from underneath the door math. Sarah's parents were away as well as her sister. Stepping inside Sarah's bedroom Michelle was amazed by the sparsely decoration. The only things inside her bedroom were a bed, a desk and chair, a wardrobe and a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Michelle sat on the bed, Sarah fired up her computer to start the presentation. Michelle grabbed the pen from her pocket, she could test it out on Sarah. She had the feeling it would do something, though she wasn't sure what. Or perhaps she should give the pen to Sarah, to let her try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end.....</span></div></div>",

The blue light emitted again and hit Sarah. The next thing Michelle knew, Sarah was gone. Instead there was lying something on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" Michelle said. She looked around panicked. She quickly shut down the windows and raised the shutters. What happened to Sarah? Did she kill her? Something inside her said she didn't, but where else could Sarah have gone to? There was something lying on the ground where Sarah was standing. It was dark in the room , now that the shutters were raised. Michelle hit the light switch and turned around. \"Eek\" Michelle shouted. There! Lying on the ground were Sarah's clothes. And something else too. Michelle approached it and touched it quickly. Whatever it was, it wasn't alive. Somehow it was wearing Sarah's clothes. Sarah pulled the clothes off. The thing was soft, it felt like skin, but it was like there was no skeleton inside it. Michelle held the thing up. Sarah's face was directly looking at her. Michelle let out another shout as she dropped it. Did the pen cause this? Did the pen turn Sarah in a skin like thing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle picked it up again as she studied it more. It was just like the real Sarah, only without a skeleton it would appear. When Michelle studied the backside, she saw an opening from Sarah's bottom to her neck. She could see there were holes in the inside, allowing her to put her arms and legs inside the costume too. Could Michelle really do it? Should she step inside Sarah's skin?</span></div></div>",

Michelle first took her clothes off to make sure there would be enough room inside the skin for her. It felt odd undressing herself inside the room for Michelle. She expected any moment that Sarah's parents would walk inside and see her naked and their daughter as a skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Michelle was standing there naked in the room she grabbed the skin. She found the opening in the back and took a look inside. From here it just looked like the costume was made of rubber. Odd, Michelle thought. Then she decided to stick her hand inside it. She carefully puts her hand inside the costume. For a moment she stood still. Nothing seemed to happen. She was almost afraid it was like a horror story and she would end up as a suit. Luckily it didn't happen. She then proceeded to stick her hand further inside the arm hole. Michelle kept an eye on the suit from the outside. The further she pushed her hand inside the hole, the more her arm began to look like Sarah. When she couldn't move her hand any further, she took a look at her hand again. Michelle jumped a hole in the sky as she saw Sarah's hand instead of her own hand. Her fingernails were covered in the same pink nail polish Sarah used. Michelle quickly drew her hand back. She breathed relieved when she saw her own hand back again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit Michelle. This pen she found just actually made a suit out of Sarah's body. She could just practically wear Sarah. With that knowledge Michelle decided to go further. She puts one of her feet inside the costume. She was marveled as she saw how legs had changed. Michelle always complained of having thick thighs, it was the one thing she hated of her figure and what she tried to reduce. Nothing helped so far. Except now, as she possessed Sarah's perfect thighs. Michelle then quickly puts her other feet and her arms inside the costume. Slowly she changed into Sarah. There was only thing left. Michelle moved her head inside the suit and then pushed up. For a moment there was darkness and the next thing there was light again. Michelle quickly turned to the mirror in Sarah's room as she walked cautiously over to it. In the reflection of it, she saw Sarah walking towards the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really worked.\" She said hearing Sarah's voice speaking. </span></div></div>",

She was actually wearing her friend's skin without them even noticing it. Michelle was amazed by Sarah's figure, Michelle knew Sarah was slender but not this much. She was even more slender than Michelle, which made Michelle a bit jealous when she thought about it. But here was her chance to be inside her friend for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle thought what to do now. Sarah's life wasn't that much different than her own. Her eyes than rested on the workout clothes she just removed. Maybe she could test out how much better Sarah's body was. Michelle opened Sarah's wardrobe and looked around for some workout clothes. She found some yoga pants, a sports bra, a plain shirt and some running shoes she used during P.E. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle put on the clothes quickly and soon she was ready to go out. She naturally wanted to tie up her hair, but with Sarah's bob hairstyle she didn't have to worry about her hair getting in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle locked the door when she went outside and put the key somewhere safe. She wondered which route she should take. She didn't want to overwork Sarah's skin. Michelle then decided on a route through the park and then back to Sarah's house again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the jog Michelle noticed the differences between her and Sarah. She was amazed how light she felt, sometimes Michelle thought she was running on the air instead the ground. But she also noticed that while Sarah had a slender figure, she didn't have the muscles Michelle had thanks to her weekly jog. She felt tired earlier than she normally would. She was halfway through the park, so she decided to sit down on a bench and take a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have a good body Sarah, you just have to jog more often.\" Michelle said to herself. She was amazed she even sounded like Sarah. That pen was really amazing. It was then that Michelle realized she left the pen on Sarah's desk when she decided to take a jog. She didn't need it now of course, but it somehow didn't feel safe like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was still thinking about this when Brian ran by. Brian was a hurdler on the school's sport team, a senior he was always getting attention from the girls though he didn't seem to care about it. Michelle was attracted to him as well, but sadly he didn't look at her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Brian suddenly noticed Michelle sitting there. That was when he waved his hand and smiled at her. Michelle quickly waved back at the boy, who just continued to run. Michelle smiled, she was never noticed before and now Brian waved at her. Perhaps she should jog next to him? Or she could go back to Sarah's house.</span></div></div>",

Michelle instead made a note to herself to make sure she would be here next week around the same time. That would work out much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as there wasn't nothing else to do here, except to enjoy the sun of course, Michelle decided to hurry back to Sarah's house. There was still this worrying inside her, like she knew something bad would happen, the feeling you would get when you were watching a horror movie and knew when the guy with the axe was behind the cute couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stood up and jogged her way back to Sarah's house. While underway she began thinking about the problems she might face, perhaps she couldn't find the pen, or someone took it for themselves, or she couldn't pull down the zipper of Sarah! Michelle didn't want to think about it and just concentrated on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning back to Sarah's house Michelle was relieved to see Sarah's parents were still not back yet. That would mean things were okay for now. She only needed to get upstairs, get out of Sarah, put on her clothes and find a way to turn Sarah back again into a human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house it was awfully quiet, Michelle didn't notice it before. She quickly locked the front door so nobody could come inside. She would make some excuse when someone would question about it.

Michelle thought it was enough adventure time for today, and decided to take off the suit. Michelle felt around the back of her head looking for the zipper, she couldn't feel anything in the beginning, but as she began more concentrated on finding the zipper, she somehow felt it. She quickly took it down, and as Sarah's head nodded forward, Michelle was standing upright with her own head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so good to be back.\" Michelle said as she felt around her own face again. She then took off the rest of Sarah until she was standing there naked in Sarah's room. She quickly put on her workout clothes, her sports bra and the yoga pants. Not seeing as how she could dress Sarah up in her clothes, Michelle decided to let her be stretched out naked on the bed. She then grabbed the pen and hoping that this worked, she pushed the button on the pen again. The blue light shined again and where once lay Sarah's skin suit, was now Sarah's full grown body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was happy to see the pen worked like that, easy enough to use. Michelle quickly sat next to Sarah and felt her pulse. Everything looked normal again. Michelle was only hesitating about what to do.

If that was a reason to be afraid of her friend what was not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Sarah woke up she was rather confused, Sarah told Michelle about what kind of a weird dream she had.

After that she could only tell that she felt like she had jogged around for a while, but that didn't make sense at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true I'm afraid.\" Michelle giggled as she explained Sarah about the pen and what it did. Sarah didn't believe Michelle at first, but when she described every tiny detail of her body Sarah knew it had to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used this to turn me into a skin like of suit?\" Sarah asked Michelle as she held out the pen in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I didn't know it would do it of course, so I tried you on.\" Michelle said rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did everyone think you were me?\" Sarah asked unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I looked like you yes, but I didn't see or talked to anyone I know.

Sarah thought as she saw how Michelle's body suddenly deflated into a skin. This was unbelievable. Sarah came closer to where Michelle was standing and carefully touched the skin that just was Michelle. \"Freaky, she just feels warm and just like how skin would feel.\" Sarah said as she grabbed Michelle's skin from underneath the pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt how she became excited at the thought of wearing one of her best friends. She couldn't believe it, as she stripped down off her clothes lying them neatly on her bed. Sarah then grabbed Michelle's skin and first put her feet into the skin. If Sarah didn't believe already, she was believing now as she saw Michelle's feet wriggling as she controlled them. She then put the rest of her legs inside the skin, then her chest and arms and lastly Michelle's head. She was a bit afraid of being stuck inside it, but without putting on the head the thing wouldn't work. So Sarah bravely forced her head inside Michelle's. When she pushed her head inside Sarah was surprised as she didn't feel wearing a mask over her own head. In fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" Sarah shouted as she pulled Michelle's hair.

After all she was all American teenage girl Michelle Burrell now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at her reflection in the mirror. It was so weird seeing Michelle's face instead of her own. The color of her blue eyes, her skin even her hair. Sarah touched her long brown hair. She always preferred having her hair short, but having long hair might have it's advantages. Sarah could imagine the ways she could do her hair now, which were more than she usually had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes then looked down at her chest. While Sarah didn't mind having A-cups she sure didn't mind having Michelle's C-cups for now. They looked so good on her. Sarah has a tanned skin and only the lines of her bikini were pale which made her breasts look awesome. Sarah's hand grabbed her grown breasts and held them in her hands. She always wanted to know what it feels like to hold them like this and now she could feeling them jiggle and being pulled down by the gravity. It was chilly in the room and Sarah found her nipples reacting to the cold. They begun to grow a little. Sarah ever curious could not resist giving them a flick. She found her body reacting to it enjoying it. Slowly she began to play with her breasts, kneading them, pulling her nipples until she felt a familiar region at her nether regions. She felt herself getting wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took a finger and slowly stroked the area around her vagina getting some of her vaginal fluids on her finger.

For once in her life Sarah wanted to do something she wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sarah slipped one of her fingers through the bush surrounding Michelle's vagina. She then slowly rubbed around the area, trying to get it more wet. When she felt it was right she slipped her finger right in not being able to resist letting out a moan as she felt her finger inside. Sarah wondered if Michelle had masturbated before. It not, it would explain how tight the feeling was inside of her. Sarah's other hand made her way to Michelle's breasts; her fingers traced around her areola; feeling the tingling sensation coursing through her body. Sarah squeezed Michelle's nipple and got a little shock from it. Sarah couldn't help herself anymore; wriggling her body one of her hands began playing with Michelle's breasts while the other was pleasuring her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't think straight anymore except for one thing; Michelle had an awesome body. If she was Michelle she would have turned to masturbation instead of running to take care of her figure. Sarah then felt the familiar pressure coming as she heaved her legs, her right hand scratching her vagina faster and her moans louder as she finally got her orgasm. Sarah felt how the fluid escaped her body and dripped down the sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lay back grinning as Michelle. This was amazing. If she could only stay as Michelle then she could have killer orgasms like this forever. Her grin disappeared in an instant. Michelle was still Sarah's friend. She wouldn't steal her body like that. At least not yet. Sarah thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then looked around herself. She wanted to continue her orgasms, but something told her, her parents would be home soon. And seeing their daughter's best friend masturbating in her bed wouldn't be the best option probably. Sarah thought of two things to do. The first thing was the most honorable thing and was to return Michelle back. Second thing was to stay as Michelle for the rest of the day and go back to Michelle's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?

Sarah felt a little flustered at the thought of all those men looking at her like that, her belly exposed and her breasts and butt emphasized in the outfit. But to her surprise most ignored her. She didn't need to feel uncomfortable at all and soon she didn't think about it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the Burrell's house she stood there for a long time.

But now she was <i>home</i>, she looked around Michelle's room before sitting down on the bed. Sarah knew she had to get a shower, her body stank pretty heavily after the work-out. Sarah looked around the drawers inside the room and found a fresh pair of panties and a bra. She took the pen with her. If possible, Sarah wanted to take a shower without Michelle's skin as well.

Michelle!\" you say out loud frantically. Looking at the pen and looking back at the pile of clothes and what seems to be Michelle\u2019s skin you assume the pen is to blame for that happened to her, placing the pen on your computers desk you stand up and slowly walk over to your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the pile of clothes and skin you grab hold of it with two fingers of your right hand like it's a wet rag you want minimal contact with since you're still unsure about what it is, you grab what seems to be Michelle\u2019s deflated head and look at the skin face now in your hand. Its definitely her, so if she\u2019s become some sort of skin suit can she be worn? This is the question that crosses your mind, you being naturally inquisitive and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping Michelle\u2019s skin of her clothes which consist of a floral dress, light cardigan, black tights, burgundy flats and matching black lace underwear you neatly fold her clothes on the other side of your bed. Continuing you quickly scan Michelle\u2019s deflated body, she\u2019s a little thicker than you in general, her thighs are thicker, arms, she hasn't got a flat stomach but her breasts are bigger than yours and of course she\u2019s white American, compared to you being Asian American. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably have to be naked too..\" you assume, since it'd be pretty uncomfortable to wear a once piece skin suit with clothes already on. Quickly stripping yourself of your clothes you put them on your office chair all folded and neat. Picking the skin up, it's still warm and it feels strange to touch, like touching someone\u2019s skin but it's all loose. Looking for an entrance into the skin you flip it around to see a thin slit spanning the top of the neck to the bottom of the spine, stretching it open slightly you begin to don the skin. Starting with your right leg you slip it into Michelle\u2019s thicker feminine leg with little ease until you can no longer feel your own leg but can feel yourself in control of Michelle\u2019s leg as you're wiggling her toes, you do the same for the left leg. You then pull her hips and ass over your own along with her pussy, you quickly examine your new lower half as you now have a chubby ass and Michelle\u2019s pussy with a small bush above it compared to your own clean shaven one. Continuing on you slot your arms and hands into Michelle\u2019s until you can move her fingers, then you pull her shoulders over your own. Pushing your chest into her chest you notice your breasts being replaced by Michelle\u2019s bigger breasts along with her chubby stomach, you then zip up the zipper making sure all of your black Asian hair is inside and not snagged on the zipper. With just the face left hanging on your new chest you take it and pull it over your own face, and after a second you don't feel any skin over your face anymore as it's become your own face now. Fully finishing the process you zip up the rest of the zipper to the top of your neck and notice the line where the zipper is fades away into your skin magically but you can still feel the top of the zipper buried inside your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your full body mirror you see your close friend Michelle Burrell in that reflection \"Whoa.....\" you whisper, \"Oh wow, I even have her voice too... this is so cool....\" you say out loud in your new voice. You have donned Michelle\u2019s skin suit and have now physically become her. You then chose to.... </span></div></div>",

Before she could even begin with a court \"Hello\", her mum interrupted her. \"Hey hun! I'm pretty sure you've quit school by now, so I wanted to ask if you could go down to the store and buy some groceries? I forgot to buy some yesterday, and since I'll be coming home late I figured I could ask you to do that? I'll mail you the list, don't worry!\" \"...Alright, sure.\" \"Thanks hun! Love you! Byyeee!\" And just like that, she was back to work. Judging from her voice, she seemed stressed - which wasn't exactly a surprise, but it seemed worse than usual. Eh, probably the groceries she forgot. Stuffing the phone and the pen down your pocket, you continued down the street to get to the closest store. The list wasn't what clouded her mind though, but the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the point of the pen anyway? You wanted to pass it off as just a laser-pen, but every laser-pen you had ever seen was much more simplistic and smaller, and not this bulky. The dot wasn't even that easy to see! Nothing had happened when she aimed it at the concrete, but what about something more organic? It was an odd thing to do, but with something this weird she was willing to try her chances just to see what the hell it even was - because really, what really was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew your brother liked to talk about weird porn he found on the internet, and you faintly remembered him mentioning something involving pen-like devices and \"bodysuits.\" Maybe?... They had to get that idea from somewhere, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe it was best to ask Curtis if he remembered anything about it. Of course he'd tease you for suddenly being interested in weird fetish porn, but you had thick skin - you could handle it. </span></div></div>",

While checking up on every last single social media site you're part of and every important app you have still doesn't keep you occupied or burn enough time. You're hopelessly bored on a Saturday, but thankfully you have an older brother who you usually go to if you need something to do or just someone to hang out with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up out of your bed and make your way to Curtis's room, peering through the gap in the slightly open door you scan around his bedroom to see if he's there, he isn't. But that doesn't stop you from being a typical nosey sister and snooping around his room because you're bored. Which you do. Looking around his room you see how messy it is, clothes are on the floor, bed isn't made and you can see the tools to Curtis's favourite pastime just behind his bed by his desk, a small tub of Vaseline and an extra-large box of tissues. Gross, but I guess it's to be expected, besides you're not stranger to masturbation either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his desktop is still logged in you decide to have a snoop on his computer for the heck of it, you sit down in his office chair and look at the page he was last on, it's some sort of sketchy strange website, selling something from the looks of it. \"Skin suit pen\" you read quietly. \"Point and aim with device and watch as person is turned into wearable skin\" it reads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting....\" you thought. Looking more into it you can see example videos of the device being used, being a naturally curious learner you decide to check out the videos, the first one shows a man pointing the pen at what looks like his girlfriend. You can't believe your eyes at first, thinking it's elaborate CGI or something but the women upon being shot by the device crumples into a pile of flesh. You continue watching as the man quickly undresses and then starts to slide the women\u2019s deflated skin over himself until his whole body is that of the women\u2019s, even his voice is like her's too. \"Woah.... this is amazing...\" you whisper to yourself, from the looks of it the people in the video are Russian and there are many many more example videos, from Son to mom, daughter to dad, brother to sister, guy to guy, women to women and vice versa for all of them. There was an example of nearly all situations of people being shot and worn, age doesn't seem to be a factor nor does gender or size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 15 minutes of watching as many as there was on the sketchy and underground site you began to feel a damp patch in your underwear as you've become strangely hooked on them and the idea of wearing another person\u2019s skin for your own. Is this your undiscovered fetish? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear noises coming from the stairs and from the thumping sounds you can tell it's Curtis, and you're in his room feeling yourself up to videos on his computer, he's going to freak out when he finds out. \"Shit\" you thought \"Gotta hide quick!.\" you think to yourself as you quickly hide in his closet. You hear him calling for your name while you're crouching in his closet, you can't exactly leave his room to go to respond to him now, you've committed to hiding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Curtis come into his bedroom you see through the slits in the wardrobe door that he's walking in with a backpack and something in his hand. He tosses the backpack just below his bed and throws what looks like large pen type of device, upon a squinted look you notice it's the same pen device you saw on Curtis\u2019s computer. \"Guess he went ahead and bought one for himself then..... Wonder if he's used it yet.\"  you thought to yourself. Sitting there silently you listen in to what Curtis is mumbling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I can't believe I've actually got it haha! Now where the hell is Michelle, I'm itching to use this thing on her and finally get to experience what it's like from the other side.... oh yeah.... it's gonna be awesome.\" He says out loud. Looks like Curtis has got plans including you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cheeky little perverted jerk....\" you mumble under your breath. \"So he thinks he can just zap me and take me for a joy ride or something.... well we'll see about that.\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.... if Michelle doesn't show up soon I might have to zap mom and make do with her..... hmmmm, she does have bigger tits....hmmm...\" Curtis mumbles to himself as he continues looking at the website. <br>\r\nSince Curtis has left the pen on his bed and he's now glued to his monitor for the time being this is the perfect opportunity to snatch up the pen and turn the tables on him before your perverted brother has a chance to use your body for a masturbation marathon. As silently as you can you slowly open up the wardrobe and place one foot out starting your silent approach to the pen, slowly but surely creeping your way to his bed, hoping you don't make any sounds since you're thicker than other girls.  <br>\r\nGrabbing the pen you decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Walking to his chair you swivel it around and stare at your brother deflated flesh for a second before picking it up with his clothes barely attached to the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Curtis, I guess you could say that now I'm 'itching to use this thing and to experience what it's like from the other side' hehe\" you chuckle quoting him. It should be relatively easy impersonating him as you're quite aware of his character and demeanour and if mom gets suspicious you can just tell her that 'your sister' has gone out to a friend\u2019s house, and if she gets too nosey and suspicious you can always turn her into a skin suit too. Since your father is on a fishing trip you don't have to worry about him finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to undress Curtis\u2019s skin taking his clothes and throwing them on his chair besides his bed until his skin is naked, you look over his body for a few seconds and begin to blush. You don't get to see many guys naked in real life, and especially not your brothers naked body, he isn't lacking in package size from the looks of things.

His breathing is now a little more nervous and you can see a little shaking coming from his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You say impressed as your threat has paid off from the looks of it. \"Now Curtis, have you used this pen on anyone yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.... no one yet...\" he says forgetting to mention you were his first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In a friendly neighborhood, a rather big and happy family are about to have their lives changed around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe basics are that a character (or a few of them) in the story (you can add new characters as you go along, and they'll be added on the Character List, although I'd appreciate it if you send me a description of how they look if you're going to!) happen to come across a mysterious device, resembling a ball-point pen - except it isn't actually a pen. Instead, the mysterious device (of unknown origin) has the ability to turn anything organic and sentient into a hollow, wearable skinsuit! Of course, characters in the story start to use it for various reasons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- About the Device -<br>\r\nThe device, when pointed at something sentient and living, turns it into a wearable suit. When put on, it turns the wearer into what the suit originally was physically. It doesn't give memories or anything of the sort, nor does it let the user change their attributes. It is removed via a zipper at the back, which can easily be hidden due to its skin-color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please do not write short entries! You don't need to write a short novel in every entry, but please try to fill it out as much as possible, within your abilities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please check your grammar! I won't be hard on this, but if the writing is absurdly bad it'll be removed, I'm afraid :c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please do not kill any of the characters in the list off, but if you want a character removed from the series you can talk to me about it and I'll try to work something out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- While this will of course contain explicit content, you're free to do entries that contain none of it and some that contain nothing but! Please keep it a bit realistic and/or sensible, as with your characters (a \"bombshell with DD in breast size with a huge butt\" is not an acceptable character, for example). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please, no rape or anything of the sort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- CHARACTER LIST -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurtis Burrell (17) - While he is a kind spirit, there isn't much about it him that's genuinely remarkable. He has brown, unkempt hair that hasn't seen too much styling, coupled with a light tan, some freckles on his cheeks and emerald-green eyes he jokingly states he 'borrowed' from his mother, whom he shares it with. He cares for his sister (and the rest of his family) very deeply. He's the Male character for the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle Burrell (16) - She isn't very optimistic, but like her brother she's kind and friendly. Compared to her brother who isn't much on exercise, Michelle has a well-trimmed body she tries her best to keep in shape. Like her brother and mother she has brown hair, but much longer than what Curtis's is. She's often seen carrying it in a loose ponytail, especially when she's not up to anything special. Unlike the rest of the family, she has eerily blue eyes, but her skin shares the light tan that Curtis also has. Like her brother, she cares for him deeply. She's the Female character for the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra Burrell (38) - Curtis and Michelle's loving mother, and the wife of James. A loving matron, nobody would look at her and not take for someone's mother. Reaching middle-age, she has a very motherly look to her, with smooth curves and a well-developed chest and butt. Like Curtis, she has emerald-green eyes and the practically iconic brown hair, but hers is much more curvy and fluffy as compared to her children's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Burrell (40) - The father and husband of the family. A strong, well-built man, James keeps his head shaved, but one can often see the shades of his dark blonde hair when he forgets to do so. Unlike the rest of the family, he has hazel-brown eyes, quite big and filled with an evident warmth to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Stevenson (17) - A longtime friend of Curtis's. He can be a bit of a prick, but still has a heart of gold which is why Curtis still keeps up with him. While he isn't much of a looker, he isn't unattractive either - he has brown eyes and light-brown hair kept in a rather boyish haircut, which coupled with his constant grinning and antics paints him as a bit of a menace, but he's never been out to harm anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Dwight (16) - A mutual friend of Curtis and Michelle, Sarah is a shy but friendly Asian-American with family hailing from Vietnam. She bears a rather femininely cut haircut, a bit like a more 'natural' bob, coupled with brown, almost black eyes and a slender figure. She's often seen with Michelle, but she comes along with Curtis just as well as she does with Michelle. </td>",
