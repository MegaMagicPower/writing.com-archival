She was becoming bored, standing in line, waiting for her turn to check in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line to check in at the service desk wound in and out of belted stands, moving sporadically as one or more passengers were registered for their flights.  As the balding middle-aged exec in front of her moved up, Kanya grabbed her dufflebag and dragged it a few feet further in line.  As she straightened, she untangled her chestnut shoulder-length hair from the earbud wires and checked the departure board.  She still had time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she wanted to do was get out of Minneapolis. Away from the cold, to lie on the beach and forget the last two years of her life ever happened.  She needed to disappear under Raul's radar for a few months and recharge her battery.  The gems she had hidden in her clothing would finance her trip if Raul had somehow discovered her offshore bank account and hacked it.  It was the least she deserved for all the work she had done for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dropped her dufflebag, the man behind her bumped her legs with his suitcase and apologized profusely.  He was handsome, with dark red hair and a happy sprinkling freckles across his nose.  He looked like the grown-up version of a 50's family television show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin Avery's smile and easygoing demeanor hid his aversion for public places and close contact with crowds.  As a scientist, he was aware of how quickly viruses could spread in such close quarters.  All it takes is one germ breathed into the air by an infected person and...well, he just didn't want to think about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in desperate need of some downtime after spending 18 months buried in his research.  His assistant quit on him, right before he submitted his final work, claiming she'd been flirting with him for a year and he never noticed.  Apparently she wasn't as enthused about his research as he was.  It was ironic, now that he had some time to take her out to dinner, she was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple in line behind Justin were Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Rollings, waiting to check in and depart on their second honeymoon.  Things had been rocky in their marriage for quite some time and Victoria was hoping this would help to bring them closer.  Edgar didn't see her pack the new lingerie in the suitcase and as she stood there in line, she was relishing the thought of Edgar's reaction when she brought it out.  Vicki lost some weight recently and was eager to show off the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them was Festus Wheatear, who has saved just enough cash for a trip to someplace warm and is on his way to a vacation of a lifetime.  He's been saving all his spare change in coffee cans since 1978 and cashed it all in last week.  He borrowed Aunt Hilde's old cardboard suitcase, packed up his spare pair of overalls, a few changes of BVDs and had his brother Richard drop him at the airport.  He promised himself that one day he would get off his tractor and see some of the world <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman behind Festus was desperately trying not to catch another whiff of his cologne, for the first one had proven to be quite overwhelming.  She wondered if he had broken the bottle and was splashed.  He was quite odoriferous.  She grasped her tote with long, peach-lacquered nails and tugged it along.  She was on her way to a photo shoot, her itinerary said the photographer was meeting her there.  Cameron Ruger was an esteemed photographer, so Taffina Marks was looking forward to this particular trip.  In her eight year of being a top model, she was quite accustomed to flying in and out of locations at a moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~As each person in line reached the customer service counter, they stated their desination:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raul will never think to look for me there. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticket agent took Kanya's ID to verify her identity. Kanya could tell she was trying to reconcile the picture of the blond-haired, blue-eyed woman in the photo to the chestnut beauty in front of her. She typed a note into the computer and handed her ID back. \"Your flight will be leaving from gate A23. The security checkpoint is to your right. You'll need to show them your paperwork and ID. Have a nice flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya smiled and thanked her as she walked away, leaving her bag with the agent. She couldn't believe she was on her way out of the country. She had a two-day head start since Raul didn't expect the hospital to discharge her for a couple more days. She got in line at the security checkpoint, excited about starting her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the front of the line, Kanya noticed an increase in the number of police.

The police (they were mostly faceless, like Raul) bustled around Kanya, tugging her aside until she was in the middle of them, smothered by them like a cotton ball in the middle of a deep, dark night. She had no doubt that somehow Raul had extended his reach while she'd been gone. These were his goons, of course they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaul had a practical hierarchy. When he was present, he was in charge. When he wasn't, the goons organized themselves according to size. It was best that way. The big guys always took charge, while the little guys kind of hung around the edges of the action like flies circling, or maybe like moths flapping against the scalding surface of a lightbulb, singing their wings. Of course nothing had changed. Raul was nothing if not predictable. Kanya was held in check by the big guys while the wee scrawny ones (they all had slicked-back hair, real bullet-headed goombahs) circled slowly around, cutting off any possible avenues of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the big guys spoke. He was, apparently, not only big but dumb, as he was crossing Raul too. \"Listen,\" he breathed into Kanya's ear. \"We both know you're had, you've had it. But I'll tell you what. Let's all of us keep playing cops and robbers for awhile, and you give me those goodies you got up under your dress, and maybe I'll see what I can do about getting you out of this thing alive, whattya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing for this big goon bastard that the other goons couldn't hear him, Kanya thought, and that was what gave her the idea, the trick to pull to get out of this mess. That littlest bastard, for example, he looked like he could be particularly greedy. He looked like a wet rat in a small blue suit. Kanya shook herself with dignity. Her eyes gleamed, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big goon took the hint and grinned hugely. He really was dumb. \"I want half, too,\" he said. \"What you got from Raul, I want half of it. Elsewise me and the boys do what he says, take you down to the rivah and fit you for a Hefty bag.\"</span></div></div>",

The big fellow sneered, \"they'll do what I tell them to do.\" Kanya shrugged and considered the mans words for a moment, \"Well I guess I have no choice but to give in and give them to you.\" The big brute smiled before Kanya carried on, \"The only problem is that the jewels are in my bag, and it has already passed through security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaul's thug had failed to notice previously that when Kanya had placed her bag down earlier that she had placed it on the conveyor belt that led to the other side of security. Kanya noticed his look of unhappiness. \"I could go get them for you if you wanted. The large man shook his head. \"I'll do it\" He quickly flashed a badge to the security at the airport and they let him across to the other side. Kanya not wanting to lose her advantage passed through the metal detector leaving the rest of the goons behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin watched the pretty young lady pass through the metal detector before himself. There seemed to be a security officer hassling her, and he wondered what was going on. He put his own carry-on luggage onto the conveyor and watched the two. They seemed to be arguing about the girl's bag. Justin didn't want to get involved though so he tried to avoid eye contact. as he passed through the metal detector. He was about to grab his own bag when he saw the security officer grab the womans bag and open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya watched the Thug peer into the bag with anticipation. Dust flew out of the bag and into the goon's face. Kanya quickly turned around and lost herself in the crowd. She heard the Large man sneeze and then she heard a scream but by that time she was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had his face covered so that he wouldn't catch any diseases from the sneeze. He had accidentally let out some noise from surprise of the event. falling out of the girls backpack, which was now laying on the floor because the security officer had dropped it, were large clumps of dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin really didn't want to be involved so he quickly grabbed his own bag and headed toward his gate. Once on the plane, Justin looked at his seat number to decide where he would be sitting. He walked down the little isle until he neared the back of the plane where his seat was. Justin opened his eyes in surprise when he got there however. In the seat next to his was the girl from before.</span></div></div>",

She was hot, sweating, and feeling quite claustrophobic while she sat in her seat, waiting, begging, willing the plane to just take off, Please! Take Off! she muttered to herself, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.  A rather large Samoan woman with a bundle in her arms was making way down the aisle, a flight attendant and that curious gentleman following close behind, though Kanya felt all eyes on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't take the heat any longer, it was suffocating her; she shrugged off her knee-length calf-skin sweater and exhaled with relief as the cool re-circulated air streamed over her clammy, sweat-soaked forearms.  The jewels were still securely sewn into the lining of the sweater, tucked safely under her as the large Samoan woman took her seat across the aisle, her baby cooing and gurgling in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight attendant approached Kanya, Justin Avery standing behind her, a confident and cocky smirk across his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss...\" the flight attendant summoned, as another pair of armed security officers boarded the plane and made a beeline downthe aisle.  \"I'm going to have to ask you to deboard the plane and return to the terminal with these men...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Kanya glared at Justin, who shrugged off her death-ray vision, still flashing that smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Germs...\" Justin mumbled. \"You're spreading disease.. you are a disease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kanya was escorted from the plane, Justin took his seat, 17B, next to hers.  It was only then that Kanya and Justin both came to the same realization: Kanya had left her jewel-laden sweater behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin watched along with the other passengers as the men escorted Kanya from the plane.  He collected her sweater from the seat next to him, noting its unusual heft, and a few odd lumps in the fabric of the lining.  He also noticed Kanya's panic-stricken glances back into the cabin, and her every attempt to free herself from the custody of the security officers, but she remained quiet.  She couldn't give away the fact that she had left the jewels, Raul's riches, behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSewn into the collar of Kanya's sweater, Justin found a tag with a 10-digit number embroidered upon it. 481-516-2342... a code? a combination? a telephone number??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fugitive was securely removed from the plane, the jet began to slowly taxi away from the jetway.  In a few minutes, the pilot would request that all electronic equipment be stowed, cell phones turned off, and Justin would be unable to take any further action for the next 9 hours, while the plane was enroute to Bermuda.</span></div></div>",

He was shocked when the call went through, and a phone rang on the other end of the line.  Equally stunning was the sparkling jewel which fell from the hole in the seam where he had pulled the loose thread.  Even more surprising than both of those events was the voice when the call was answered; it was that girl he had spoken to briefly in the check-out line, THAT girl... the fugitive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, it's Kanya... I don't know how you got this number, but if if you're hearing this message, then you've probably got my life in your hands...\"  Justin palmed the crystalline blue stone and listened further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Captain has asked that you extinguish all smoking materials and turn off all cellular and other electronic devices, return seat backs and tray tables to their uprght and locked positions...\" the flight attendant's command meant that Justin's call would have to end, while the mystery of this girl was only just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had big plans in Bermuda, grand dreams, world-changing ideas regarding his research; but, this girl, Kanya... she sounded so sincere: her life was now in his hands!

Justin quickly raised his laptop from his lap, and the doped-up dope's fist crashed hard into the silver computer-casing.  Justin lowered the case and pivoted his arms back upward sharply, catching the rasta-man beneath his fuzzy chin with the leading edge of technology in Justin's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the melee could continue, 2 flight attendants descended from either end of the aisle, along with the on-board air marshall, who helped to detain the combatants until airport security could be summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the airport, Kanya could see the sky-cap rolling out to the plane, though Kanya herself was taken into the security holding area before she could ascertain what the further fuss was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya looked for any opportunity to make her escape from the holding room, and when the security forces were called back to the concourse outside, she thought she'd found her moment.  She wasn't worried about being arrested for theft, since the evidence of theft was left on the plane, and would be confiscated by the flight crew or some passenger in Bermuda. But Raul would still have plenty to say and do to her once he was contacted by his people; she was caught between a rock and a hard place, cooped up and cornered.

Right?\" he passed her back the sweater, and Kanya smiled back at him, uncertain of his honor and honesty, but certainly caught unguarded by his candor and poise.  Maybe there are still Good Guys left in this world, she thought to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WRONG!\" a booming voice growled from behind the two, as several no-neck thugs dressed in black suits-and-ties strolled in, followed by a shady-looking Latino wearing Hawaiian print shirt, khaki capri shorts, white deck-shoes and a white fedora.  \"You! Who the hell are you to be talking to MY GIRL?! You be Wrong, that's What you be, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Raul...\" Kanya sassed, stepping between Raul's thugs and Justin, as Raul approached with such swagger it was sickening.  Before he even stopped swagging back and forth, Raul lashed out with a hearty backhand across Kanya's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You calm down, bitch!\" he snarled. \"Don't be getting all up in my face! Not after I get pulled off the yacht at the marina and come all the way out here in the middle of Nowhere to collect ya... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in Minneapolis, Raul... not Miami...\" Kanya laughed off his attack,  \"Nice threads, papi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing in Minneapolis, chica? Who you running from?\" Raul wondered, no longer even interested in Justin, which is exactly as Kanya had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not running FROM anyone, Raul!\" Kanya lied with the ease and experience of a politician or priest. \"My sister, I told you she was in the heart-hospital up here... I was just on my way back Home when I ran into some trouble with the locals, that's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaul stroked the goatee on his chin and nodded while Kanya explained herself.  <br>\r\n\"Oh really? How's your sister's health then? She still breathing in-and-out, I take it?\" it seemed a rhetorical question, as Raul kept right on rambling his way unevenly toward his point. \"You know, I had a bit of a scare myself, Angel-Eyes... seems we had a break-in of sorts, a robbery... plenty of valuables gone missing from the vault, and You, gone missing as well...\" he grabbed her by both wrists and wrestled the sweater away from her with a gruff tug.  In one quick motion, he wrapped the light wrap round Kanya's neck, twisted it in his fists and tugged it taut against her throat.<br>\r\n\"Funny how that can be taken for granted sometimes... breathing, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya's face flushed bright red as she struggled to maintain consciousness while Raul strangled her with her sweater.  Justin stepped back slowly, away from the leering Latino and his hit-squad; he was digging deftly through his satchel, and finally found what he was after: a small vial of vile, vitrious liquid, a virus, in aerosol form.  There were 7 thugs though, including Raul, and Kanya in the middle of them all; not real great odds, not a great time to be a Good Guy, not at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut still...</span></div></div>",

Check these out!\" Justin suggested, offering a small plastic container filled with 6 2-inch long 1/2-diameter metallic cylinders. \"But, please, be extremely careful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" Kanya wondered, examining the case. \"They look like CO2 cartridges, like the kinds used in seltzer spritzer bottles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly like those!\" Justin explained.  \"Those atomizers contain highly concentrated and specially-formulated strains of germs, from an advanced form of the common cold to an especially nasty strain of the felsh-eating virus...

It is a six-hour flight and the passengers settled in for the duration, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was already busy reading a fiction story called, \u201cCool Elevation\u201d and apparently enjoying the read. Kanya\u2019s eyes were heavy and her body ached from the airport race to safety undercover. She adjusted the back of her seat back as far as it would lower without disturbing the passenger directly behind her. Closing her eyes she became lost to the world in sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours Justin also felt the droop of his eyelids. He pulled the shade on his window and also fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stewardess began passing out the passengers meals around four hours into the flight. Both Kanya and Justin had awakened from their naps earlier and were ready to receive some nourishing substance. Receiving their meals they were pleased to see the supper was to their individually liking. Kanya exclaimed delight at opening hers. For fried chicken and mashed potatoes was her favorite meal. This meal also contained a small lettuce salad along with a dinner roll, and green beans. There was a small container of frozen ice cream and a package of mini-chocolate chip cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks delicious, Kanya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen yours and see what you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo surprise the dinners were alike. They ate quietly savoring each bite. They both had awakened to starvation. Not really, but it sure felt like it at the time. The stewardess had taken orders for drinks and was delivering the covered drinks to the passengers as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if the stewardess\u2019 get to eat a meal or if they have to suffer till after we reach Bermuda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, they are behind that partition. They eat their meal there and if any need arises from the passengers they get up and offer assistance. They probably don\u2019t get to eat a meal through without at least one interruption.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if you will be in the same hotel I\u2019m going to be at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to be staying at a cottage right on the ocean. It is in my travel package. I plan to take advantage of the sightseeing tours that the island offers. I want to see everything there is to see. I also plan to sleep late, eat well and stay up late. I\u2019m on vacation; I\u2019m going to live it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kanya speaks a bit sorrowfully, \u201cvacation and live it up. I want that too, but first I\u2019m going to just enjoy a good long sleep. I am so tired. I only got out of the hospital yesterday. My body is healing from an operation. I feel great but am so tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stewardess came and took their trays away; Kanya settled back against her seat and took a long luxurious nap. The next thing she knows is that the plane is descending to make the landing.</span></div></div>",

Her cheaks felt warm matching the heat she felt when her eyes flew open realizing it was Justin's arms wrapped around her.  Touching her face, she became aware it was a sunburn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo evaluate her suroundings, she shifted her body. Every muscle in her body seemed to scream in protest. What felt like bruises, ached against the hard surface she was laying on.  When she tried to move her head, a sharp muscle spasm ran up her neck, causing a painfull ponding in her skull. Yet, she forced herself onto her back, reveling the clear blue sky above her and she covered her eyes with her arm in avoidance of the sun's  blinding rays. A cold chill ran up her spine in realization that she was in the ocean, only a large metal fragment of the plane shielding her from drowning in the endless ocean below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was afraid you would never wake-up.\" There was a mixture of relief and concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I remember was an explosion and then everything went black. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused about it myself.\" There was a pregnant pause. \"We were gathering the children and then there was this man, he was holding something in his hand, and looking in your direction, screaming something about the secrets dying. Next thing I knew there was an explosion.  While I have been laying here, I've been trying to piece everything together. I remember you telling me you were a Scientist and my gut tells me that you are the one with the answers. So tell me, what secrets was he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Raul</i>!<i> Yes, Raul had done this</i>. \"I don't know, maybe he thought i was someone else. \" She hoped her lie would be sufficient enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also remember you saying you can't  swim.\" His eyes narrowed and he smirked. \"How about I just push you off of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't  do that! I promise, I really don't know.\" She grabbed onto his shirt, as he pushed her slightly, obviously threatening her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her grip free and shoved her closer to the edge. \"Hmm, we'll I guess the secret really does die here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in fear. If she told the truth, he might push her in the water anyways, because he might be one of them, so she scrambled for another lie. \"I-I just work for a pharmaceutical company that studies migraine prevention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused in contemplation and she slithered her body closer to him, farther away from the edge. He shoved her back, this time she slid down the metal wing all the way to the edge. Sharp metal dug into her flesh as she gripped the rugged, broken edge of the plane's wing, as the held on, avoiding falling into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is the name of this company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced in pain. \"Misssion, yes, Mission Pharmaceuticals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked her, causing her to fall into the water, but one hand retained a grip on the edge.  \"I'm not an idiot! You called him by name right before you passed out! Tell me the truth before I kick your hand free!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe pulled her other hand up, grabbing the metal edge for more support. \"Look, my hand is bleeding. You're going to attract sharks! I really don't know anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I watched everyone die, innocent people-- children's body parts everywhere.\" Tears pooled in his eyes. \"I want answers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al-al-right. I-I work for the CIA. Pull me up and I will explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, explain now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dirt I was carrying was evidence about a secret project for population control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Population control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The government has been poisoning the soil in rural areas, causing infertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what were you going to do with this sample,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually share it with the public, but the CIA caught on before I could. I've been running from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for her hand. \"Take it, so that I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed onto his hand, pulling herself up.  He removed his shirt, exposing his muscular form. Heat rose into her already burning cheaks and she turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, while he wrapped the fabric around her hand \"It appears that we'll be stuck here for who knows how long. Kinda silly getting embarrassed by me taking off my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what your talking about. It's not like I haven't seen a shirtless man before. You just tried to kill me, so I'd say we have gotten to know each other well enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have killed you. I'm a mechanic, not a murderer. Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were one of them, you could have been lying about me saying Raul's name. Then you would have killed me for sure, the secret dying with me. I figured if you were, maybe you would believe me to be just another innocent civilian. After all, it is strange that a trained CIA agent wouldn't know how to swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, about that, why don't you know how to swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered as the memory of her childhood family car submerging into the water invaded her mind. Her father grabbed her, pulling her out of the car, leaving her mother to drown. She shook off the image of her mother stuck between the seat and dashboard drowning. \" I almost drowned when I was a kid and I have had a fear of water ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, while he laughed. \"Well, what better way to fight your fear than to be stuck in the middle of who-the-hell-knows, floating on a hunk of metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure news of the crash is known by now. They'll be searching the Atlantic for us soon enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"I'm thinking not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed up with his pointer finger. \" Have you looked at the sky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, but still looked up to investigate what she might have missed. That is when the cloud moved revealing what looked like a second moon. \" What the-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly! Apparently we are not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in shock. \"This isn't real. I'm dreaming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that were so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did we get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I tell you, then you will really think it is all a delusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after the explosion, you and I floated for a while in the Atlantic on this very same hunk of metal. Just as the sun was setting I began to drift off to sleep. That is when it happened.\" He paused. \"The ocean opened up into what looked like a whirlpool of sorts. It was like we were sucked into a vacuum that spit us out in this strange place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sore body and throbbing hand was proof of the realness of the situation, but she hoped otherwise. \"This can't be real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I throw you in the water again to prove it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart began to race. \"Please don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, but she could see the sadness in his eyes. \"No worries, I'd rather not die alone. No plans on ridding myself of you anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord count: 1202<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He ran hard towards the exit, heads swivelling to watch him. Kanya was impressed by his speed but it was a futile attempt; before he'd gone five paces the police were on him like a pack of vultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was dragged away by two large police officers, his bags being collected by a woman in a dark blue suit, the other passengers turned away with a buzz of excitement. Kanya, with no one to talk to but herself, pondered briefly on what he might have done but was more occupied with her own troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed her recently-styled hair, still marvelling at the change in her appearance since that morning. She had left the hospital, the concussion gone surprisingly fast and the superficial bruises healed up on her arms and legs. Only the cut across her stomach was yet to fade, but even that was less painful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya forced her thoughts in a different direction, trying not to remember the pain of that last, hopefully forever, beating. Amazingly she was feeling confident and full of energy. I'm going to be fine, she thought. I've done the hard part now. I've left him, and I'm not going back. The buzz of excitement filled her mind again and she couldn't stop the smile bubbling over her lips and spilling into the atmosphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man behind her cleared his throat loudly, causing her to notice that the queue had moved up quite a way while she was lost in thought.</span></div></div>",

It's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya overheard this exchange as she boarded the plane to Bermuda. She was relieved to have gotten past checkout, but was detemined to mind her own business. Nevertheless she couldn't help wondering who this Jason character was. She soon got her answer. She found her seat in row 22, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ma'am\" a polite, quiet voice said in Kanya's ear,  \"but I've got the window seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya looked up from the aisle seat of row 22 to see a big man standing over her. He was about 6' 4'', broad-shouldered, blond-haired, and heavyset. The voice belonged to Jason. Kanya got up carefully and let the man by her. Jason sat down in the window seat. Kanya sat back down in the aisle seat, and returned Jason's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Jason Abraham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kanya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya shook Jason's huge hand. For a moment his grip reminded Kanya of Raul, and she shuddered. But she was determined to forget Raul on this trip. So she tried to make conversation with this charming stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the checkout lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an aircraft mechanic. I know alot of people who work at this airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your carry-on bag was to big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I should have known better, but i misjudged it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you carrying in there, bricks?\"<br>\r\nJason laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No books! I'm a bookworm. I like to read. When I fly, I spend all my time reading. I never sleep on an airplane. So I read or just enjoy the flight. I even stay awake on the red-eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya laughed at that. She was starting to like this guy and was starting to relax. Before they could continue the conversation, the stewardess leaned over and spoke to Jason.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir but you'll have to move.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya didn't want Jason to move, but reminded herself to mind her own business....</span></div></div>",

Fortunately all attention seemed to be on Jason and the stewardess..<br>\r\n\"Please, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"Is it a window seat?\"<br>\r\n\"You'll sit where I tell you to, sir.\" The stewardess said sounding definitely dictatorial.<br>\r\nJason got up muttering \"Shit!\" under his breath.<br>\r\nThat forced Kanya to get up, too. The plane was filling up fast but there were still plenty of seats empty. Kanya got into the aisle, jostling passengers as she did so. Jason was so big he seemed to fill the entire aisle. The stew moved him back three rows to row 19. She did point him to the window seat across the aisle from where they were sitting before. Kanya was being forced further and further back, until she felt like she was being forced off the plane altogether. Another passenger jostled Kanya, and she nearly jumped out of her skin. She was getting very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I should get off the plane, Kanya thought glancing back at the door. It was blocked by boarding passengers. The passenger behind her bumped her again, harder this time. Kanya stumbled forward, into Jason Abraham who was trying to get into his new seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me...\" Kanya felt Jason's breath on her ear, and nearly jumped a mile. The last time she felt like that nearly 2 years ago....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced back at the door nervously. Kanya again thought of getting off the plane. But she wanted to go to the Bermuda Triangle to disappear from Raul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya was starting to stew in her own juices.</span></div></div>",

And she still wanted to talk to Jason, so she sat down in the window seat. Jason was sitting in the middle seat, giving suspicious looks to the stewardess. Kanya  didn't know what was between them, but she didn't care. She had problems of her own. Glumly she looked out the window. <br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Jason said in her ear, so suddenly she was startled out of her reverie.<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" she answered.<br>\r\n\"I think we'll be ready now, barring anymore delays. This is startin' to get to me, too.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you mean back there about the weight-and-balance thing being bullshit?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that,\" Jason answered in surprise. \"Well, I'm an aircraft mechanic. I've calculated weight-and-balance before. She was lyin' to me about that, and I don't even know why. All I know is that if the plane isn't fully loaded, they can make you change seats. But there's nothin' normal about this flight. We're going to Bermuda, if this flight even leaves the ground. We'll I've always wanted to disappear in the Bermuda Triangle. So I guess we'll be together there, whether we want to be or not. So I guess we should talk. We'll have plenty of time to do that between here and Bermuda. And I promise I'll listen even if I don't talk enough myself.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jason took her hand. When Jason's huge hand touch her small one, Kanya felt a spark, like high voltage electricity! Wow! Kanya almost fainted. She hadn't felt this way since she'd last talked to Raul. She couldn't tell Jason about Raul. She just couldn't! And yet she might have to anyway! She sighed in confusion.

She caught Jason's eye, and thought he looked miserable there even in the window seat. She exchanged his forlorn look. Now the flight was going to be boring for both of them even with other passengers to talk to. But he was seated now, and the other passengers in row 19 sat down too. That cleared the way for Kanya to return to her aisle seat in row 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kanya moved forward going past her seat and stopping. Standing in the aisle, she waited for the other passengers to be seated. She didn't want to get up again if she didn't have to. But then she heard somebody cough behind her, and she moved herself to row 22 to let the man past. She didn't sit down, deciding to stay standing until the passengers had all boarded. She glanced back at row 19, wondering if she could trade seats with somebody. But it looked like a family was sitting by Jason. Even if it wasn't, Kanya doubted anyone would let her move. Kanya didn't want to draw attention to herself, and that might just do it. Kanya also wondered if someone else would get the window seat beside her. But it remained empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So finally the last passengers boarded the plane and Kanya sat down with a sigh.

She was lucky to get them past the security checkpoint, but now that she had, she would be home free once the plane took off. Trying to relax she fastened her seatbelt and waited impatiently for the flight to get underway. She briefly wondered  what that stewardess meant about that weight-and-balance thing, and what Jason had meant by his remark about there not even being loaded yet.

As they did so, Kanya looked out the window, wishing Jason was still in the window seat. She hadn't asked him whether he was going to Bermuda like her or getting off somewhere along the way. Perhaps she could ask him when they took off and the seatbelt signs went off. Kanya guessed it was enough that Jason was still on board. Kanya was surprised at the speed of the taxi. The speed, whatever it was, seemed faster than a run. Kanya couldn't judge it from where she was sitting, but she'd read somewhere that these airliners could taxi at 25 MPH. Kanya couldn't recall where she'd read that, but she believed it.

She supposed she should pay attention, but she felt that once she took off, the rest of the flight would go without incident. There was still a chance that the Director of Operations could still detain of redirect the flight for any number of reasons, but that was unlikely, and Kanya hoped it wouldn't happen. The stewardess finished speaking, and the plane was stopped on the runway. Kanya expected the engines to rev for takeoff, but there seemed to be trouble in the air. She gripped the sides of her seat and closed her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Abraham knew that takeoff could be a nerve-wracking experience, especially for those passengers who were afraid to fly. Like Kanya, Abraham thought. He could just picture her in row 22, the aisle seat across the aisle from Abraham, gripped the sides of her seat, awaiting takeoff. Abraham tried not to laugh at the thought. The woman in the seat beside Abraham was gripping the sides of her seat, too. She seemed to be with her husband, who was in the aisle seat of this row.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oh, well, thought Abraham looking out the window, watching the plane take off. At least they were off the ground now. There'd be no turning back for this flight. Maybe there'd be trouble in the air later, but the takeoff was routine. Even that bitchy new stewardess couldn't keep Jason from enjoying this flight. Abraham didn't know her, and he knew everyone on this airline. Maybe she was a new employee. Jason Abraham himself only got this job last year, and was on his first vacation since he'd started.</span></div></div>",

Maybe she should just give in and tell him about the diamonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he gave her the back of his hand across her face.  \"Silence!\" he exclaimed.  \"If you think I will listen to anything you have to say, you are a fool.\"  He snapped his fingers to two of his men.  \"Once we land, take her onto our private plane, and if she tries to sweet talk any of you, tie and gag her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back on Kanya, who was stunned by the slap.

A couple of Raul's thugs went down first, then Kanya - as she had no choice - and a few more of Raul's men.  Then, Raul himself climbed down.  No one noticed that a man climbed out from beneath the plane from one of the rear wheels.  He ran off and dove into some bushes before anyone could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaul and his thugs, two of them practically dragging Kanya with them, moved off the private runway and they watched as the plane took once more to the skies.  Kanya watched it go with a lump in her throat.  Then, she received another shocker.  Raul was holding her bag.  With a smile, he looked inside, finding what he came after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well...It seems all has been returned to me.  My diamonds...\"  He grabbed a hold of Kanya by the hair and pulled her head back.  \"My girl...Do you know what you cost me?  The trouble it took to find you...?  You shouldn't have left the hospital early, chicita.  I believe it will be the death of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raul, please, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her head back harder.  \"I told you to be quiet.  You see, the only reason you are alive right now is because I have not thought of a suitable death for you.  Once I find a way to prolong your death so that your suffering is great...then the fun will begin.  Eh, chicita?\"  He laughed.  Then, he let go of her.  \"Put her on my private plane.  We have to leave, eh?  The pilots will tell the authorities of this landing site, so let's move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed for the private plane.  Kanya was surrounded by thugs, two of them were still dragging her with them.

The man was none other than the crazy guy who'd tried to kidnap her at the taxi lot.<br>\r\nBut he'd already pushed the door shut, and now they were alone again sighing with relief.<br>\r\n\"That was a close call\" Kanya said.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's get goin'.\" They both started pulling on their trousers guickly. <br>\r\n\"I was so sure he'd recognized us.\"<br>\r\n\"These uniforms are an effective disguise.\"<br>\r\n\"You recognized him, too?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. I was just glad I was able to bluff him. I thought he was down for the count. I guess I didn't hit very hard after all. He looked all right to me.\"<br>\r\nKanya had to laugh at that. Here that man had probably tried to kill them both, and Jason was worried that he'd hurt him defending them both. This was a guy after her own heart. Totally unlike Raul. They finished dressing. Now they were finally ready to come out of the closet. They were ready to leave the airport now. In their new disguises they had a good chance of making it. But was the airport willing to let them leave? Events seem to be conspiring against both Kanya and Jason both.</span></div></div>",

A shiver ran down her spine and she shuddered, suddenly cold. She zipped her hoody right up to her neck and slid down in her seat, she didn't want to see who was coming her way. She knew she wouldn't like it. She closed her eyes and tried to zone out. She heard mumbling and muffling, Jason was saying hello to the late passenger and the stewardess was seating the stranger in the aisle seat just opposite Kanya and Jason. Again a shiver ran down her spine as she heard the new passenger thank the stewardess. She knew that voice and the voice make her feel sick. <br>\r\nSlowly Kanya opened her eyes and peered across at the passenger next to her. The minute she caught sight of the floppy black hair, the brown battered leather jacket and the square jawline that jutted out at a funny angle Kanya began to sweat. She gripped the seat and tried to resist the urge to throw up.<br>\r\nJason leaned over her and regarded the passenger. <br>\r\n\"We better land on time mister, I have a very stressed baby sister waiting on me at the other end.\" Jason was joking, Kanya knew that.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, this is a kind of last minute thing. I didn't think I would make it. My name's Raul by the way.\" His voice pierced into Kanya's mind like a blade. <br>\r\n\"Jason. Nice to meet you. Now let's get this show on the road.\" Jason clapped his hands as the engines started roaring. <br>\r\nKanya looked away, she didn't want Raul to recognise her, that would be fatal. She had gone to such great lengths to change herself, she couldn't fail now. Her newly brunette hair, her green contact lenses to change her eye colour from blue, her spray tan to hide her truly recognisable pale skin and her newly manicured nails to disguise the fact that really she was a tomboy who loved to dig around in the dirt. She had even worn a dress, the second dress she had ever worn in her life. The first was the one she had worn to her mother's funeral, but that didn't really count.<br>\r\nShe felt Raul's eyes on her and this made her skin crawl, she wanted to scream, to run, to disembark but the plane was already speeding down the runway. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss...\" Raul was talking to her. She couldn't believe it, what the hell was he doing on this flight?? Could she not go anywhere without him following her.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" He persisted. <br>\r\nShe fumbled around trying to come up with a good accent, she wasn't much cop at accents but she had to try, he would know it was her if she spoke normally, no doubt about that. <br>\r\n\"yes, can I help you?\" She finally said in a rather rusty English accent. She noticed Jason giving her a funny look but thankfully he ignored it and fished for a book in his bag. <br>\r\n\"Have we met before? I'm sorry, but you just look very familiar but I can't put my finger on it.\" Raul said charmingly. <br>\r\nKanya tried not to look right at Raul as she spoke, she couldn't give anything away.<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so sir, I have never met you in my life, and this is my first time out of England so I don't think that would be possible to know you. Have a nice flight.\" Kanya said again in her English accent and at that she turned away from Raul and tried to occupy herself with something else, she knew though that her nerves would be on edge the whole flight and she was worried he would try and talk to her more. <br>\r\n\"Did you say your sister is waiting for you Jason?\" Raul addressed Jason obviously taking the hint that Kanya didn't want to talk. <br>\r\n\"Yes yes, my little sister is getting married.\" Jason said rather suspiciously. He was an odd character, Kanya thought to herself.<br>\r\n\"In Bermuda?\" Raul laughed.<br>\r\n\"My sister has her quirks. What about you Raul? Business perhaps?\" Jason quickly changed the subject. <br>\r\n\"My ex girlfriend, she's in Bermuda, and she has something of mine, so I'm going to get it back.\" Raul said rather sinisterly. Kanya's immediantly flew to her pocket and she was relived to feel the small bag  still buried there.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...relationships, waste of time don't you think?\" Jason said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they make you want to go crazy. I'm going to kill Kanya if I get my hands on her.\" Raul laughed like it was a joke, but Kanya knew that it wasn't and it made her catch her breath. <br>\r\n\"Hey isn't your name...\" Jason began but Kanya coughed to stop him from continuing. <br>\r\n\"Kandy, my name's Kandy, a little similar I suppose.\" Kanya covered up quickly. <br>\r\nThis was going to be a long flight.</span></div></div>",

Jason, his own mask back in place, jammed hers over her mouth and nose.  So the thumping wasn't just a dream, then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd lost you there for a moment,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya blinked away the black spots swimming before her eyes and realised how close it really had been.  She let him help her get the strap behind her head and took a few deep breaths.  Bremuda Triangle.  Figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Jason, getting to his feet,  \"Now that you're okay, I'm going to see if I can help out.  Aircraft engineer, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya nodded and scrunched up as best she could.  Jason squeezed past her knees, winking when he got stuck between her legs.  Kanya blushed and looked away, unable to hide a small smile.  Just great.  Finally meet a nice guy, a hero even, and they were both going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason hauled his way forward from seat to seat, grabbing breaths of air from loose oxygen masks every couple of rows.  Jen the stewardess was working her way back towards him, a bottle-fed mask like her own in one hand.  The two yelled at each other over the screaming wind.  Kanya could only catch a few words from Jen: ...strike... ...first class...  ...thousand feet... ...hundred miles... ...dead!  Jason nodded grimly and followed Jen forward past the curtain into the next section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya looked around and wondered how many of the unconscious passengers in the other seats were asleep, and how many were dead from lack of oxygen by now.  The handful of other people wearing masks were clearly thinking the same thing.  The family two rows ahead were okay, the children wide-eyed with panic and their parents in a not much better state.  A young couple a few rows back were helping an old woman get her mask on.  Two men in suits and yellow masks sat side-by-side in white-knuckled silence.  But whole rows of people were unconscious.  There were a lot of people with empty seats next to them, and in other rows everyone must have been sleeping.  Nobody awake to get their masks on and wake the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just sit here waiting to die,\" thought Kanya, \"Not after what I've been through.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and another stewardess were systematically moving from one passenger to another. Someone else was with them. It was the man with red hair that had been at the airport. Jen thought, \"He must have been seated in first class . . . how many people were hurt? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had been working in research for so long that tending to the medical needs of these passengers was a bit of a challenge but the captain had told him that he was one of the two people on the plane with medical training. He was doing his best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin pulled one of the passengers that looked unconsciousness out of his seat. Kanya recognized him as the fella who had bathed in the cologne. Justin started CPR on that man and he called for help.By now the stewardesses were at the far end of the plane. A small slender woman pushed through the curtain from first class and started helping Justin perform CPR on Festus Wheater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya noticed that the woman's face was tear-streaked. It was Victoria Rollings. Kanya had no way of knowing that Victorian's husband Edgar laid dead from injuries on the other side of that curtain. Victoria had been pressed into service in spite of that because she was the only other person with a medical background. Like Justin, in spite of her BSN, it had been many years since she had done direct patient care. This was a challenge for her in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya watched as the two of them performed CPR on Festus Wheater, she suddenly recognized Victoria. She had seen her before at the hospital in Minneapolis,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya's problems with Raul seemed insignificant compared to what was happening right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then Jason re-entered the cabin. He stepped around the man on the floor and the couple working so hard to help him.. That was not an easy feat for the big man to do. He motioned to Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya looked back in Jen's direction and was relieved to see that the stewardesses had gotten oxygen masks on most of the passengers and they were reviving . . . reviving to face this horror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain's voice was coming over the loud speaker again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thins are under control. We are heading to the nearest airport. We are confident we can make our destination. Please stay calm. Stay in your seats. Follow the instructions of the staff.

Apparently she passed as a resident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught up to the resident.  He was sitting on the ground in front of a small grass shack.  He looked very dejected.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"  Kanya knelt down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled from behind his arms, which were crossed over his knees, with his head resting on his forearms.  \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do?\"  She felt sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up his head and stared at her.  \"Did you follow those cops down the airport ramp?\"  He grabbed her arms tightly.  \"Tell me you didn't.\" Desperation crept into his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.

I need to catch a flight.\"  She stood and looked around.  All she could see was jungle and a glimpse of beautiful white sand beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted in her face. \"There is no exit!  They closed the one I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya shrugged.  \"Well, this isn't the worst place to be stuck.\"  She slung off the backpack from her back.  She had a bathing suit in there.  \"I never have time to sunbathe, I guess I do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, do you?\"  He screamed.  \"It's forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmly turned and looked at him.  He was tall, well muscled and his beard was a shade darker than his blonde hair.  \"Is that so bad?\"  She looked over his shoulder at the shimmering blue water.  Could this be any worse than the life she left behind when she fled to the airport?  \"How long have you been here...uh, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick.  Rick Norrison.  I've been here four years, from what I could figure, once I got through the exit portal.\"  His eyes were pained.  \"And yes, it is.

Kanya spent the rest of the ride watching the sun set, hoping that they'd get to their location soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the car came to a stop in a densely forested area, little light existed since the sun had already disappeared behind the horizon. \"Here we are\" Nale said yawning. Kanya got out of the vehicle and looked around she could barely see what he was talking about until she saw a little tiny house. It looked as if it was falling apart, windows were boarded up, the grass went up to her knees, and half of the front porch had collapsed. Ths place was familiar to Kanya however, she recognized it and she felt sick to her stomache being in its presence</span></div></div>",

It won't be long til Raul's goons find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How does he know about Raul? Why is he so familiar?</i> She hesitated as he went in, leaving her standing outside.<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'm coming!\" she said as she picked her way up the rickety porch. For some reason she knew she had been in this very place before, but she just couldn't remember when and why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house looked more like a shack than anything. The inside was in as much disarray as the outside was. A small living room looked like it had been ransacked. Kanya walked quietly through the living room, into a small kitchen. It had some dirty dishes in the sink and a small refrigerator that was in need of a good cleaning. The whole place had a rauncy odor. <br>\r\nThere was only one bedroom. It was small with a regular sized bed. The bed was made, but Kanya had serious doubts to how clean the bedding was. There was one bathroom that was tiny and dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like the help hasn't arrived to clean,\" she said as Nale came up behind her. <br>\r\n\"Yup, listen, you can take the bed and I'll sleep on that couch. I think I need to be near the door. You know, when Raul figures out you're missing, there's going to be hell to pay.\"<br>\r\nKanya shuddered. She didn't want to think about it. This was not what she had intended when she made her escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were the cops wanting with me...do you know?\" she said as she found something to clean the bathroom with.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but you can bet it had something to do with Raul. He's been on their radar for quite a while,\" Nale said as his dark eyes watched her intently.<br>\r\nKanya cleaned, but carefully looked at Nale. He was extremely good-looking.....tall, muscular build, dark shoulder-length hair and piercing dark eyes. He took his shirt off, revealing a tanned set of stomach muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, my gosh, I remember now! I know who you are! You're that FBI man who Raul wanted killed! Here....we came down here so Raul could do 'business' and you were going to bust him..us!\"<br>\r\nKanya's eyes went to Nale's right shoulder and she saw the scar, \"He shot you!\" Nale nodded, \"And as he was going to finish me off, the cops showed up..\"<br>\r\nKanya's face was animated, \".....Raul was scared and left in the boat, telling me to finish you off, but I drug you behind this place and hid you....then I lied to Raul and told him you were dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me....back from your past to rescue you, this time,\" Nale's dark eyes sparkled.<br>\r\nKanya's stomach churned, <i>If Raul finds out about this lie, he will not be happy with me.</i>. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, the secret is safe with me. I've gained a few pounds in the last three years, and I wear my hair long.\"<br>\r\nKanya's heart was pounding, but she tried to sound undaunted, \"That's why I didn't recognize you earlier!\"<br>\r\nThe sound of the ocean crashing against the shore broke the silence, but in the distance they could hear the roar of a vehicle coming up the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go quickly into the bedroom and grab the Nine Millimeter out of my night table.  I know you know how to use it, stay low and I will handle the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sleekness, Nale made his way to a closet and grabbed a suitcase.  Within 12 seconds he had assembled a small Uzi like custom machine gun and was now by the front window jamming in one of 5 clips from a satchel by his left side.  The security threat would be coming from the front and possibly the west side of the dwelling, otherwise different alerts would be beeping, buzzing or flashing.  Nale knew these guys would approach slowly as thugs will do unlike an assault force from the military or police. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he switched to full auto he noticed Kanya take a position on the west window and carefully peer out from a side vantage.  \"I've got 2\" she said.

I saved your life !\" I Kanya said. Nate smiled at her, and laughed. Kanya pushed down a smile also. \"Look, why don't you get some sleep.

You are an FBI agent.\" \"Look, there are some rumors, but nothing big.\" \"I was a teenager, when I met Raul.\" Kanya started. \"We were young and dumb. I had always been interested in the marital arts and had my hunting permit since my father owned a gun.

And who was that Nale character? How did he just show up and how did he get her here. As if in answer to her internal questions, there was a knock at the door. Without thinking, she opened it to reveal Nale, who was now dressed like a bellboy. He was pushing a food cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you wanted this,\" he said, brandishing a bottle of wine from the cart, \"I also have lobster fettucine and garlic rolls. I believe these are your favorite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya's stomach clenched in hunger but she didn't move toward the food.

Vito has to go along because he thinks I'll get lost in the airport.\"  He scoffed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold finger of dread trailed down Kanya's spine as she recognized just who Josh was.  She saw the headlines last week.  One of the top men in the mob syndicate was cleaning house and the dom bumped off one of the major players in-house.  His wife had been killed along with him when their car blew up.  The cops knew who was responsible, they had their connections too, but did nothing about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was running from Raul and ends up on the same plane as the little heir.  Dumb luck, wasn't it?  The guy with Josh couldn't know who she was, could he?  He was handsome alright, in a big meaty way, his hair was dark and slick but he didn't look like he had much of a sense of humor.  He was delivering Joshua Verone to his uncle, Marco Pinciato aka Pinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTremulously, she smiled at the boy.  \"You seem mature enough to fly alone, but I'm sure your family just wanted to be sure.\"  Her smile grew as the boy nodded sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, kid.\"  Vito's eyes were telling Kanya to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slumped back down into his seat, he knew that tone of voice.  If he didn't listen, Vito would give his arm a hard squeeze and make him do it.  His arm was sore enough from learning that lesson.  He looked over at Kanya.  She smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a vibration started shimmering through the plane.  Josh could feel a grinding and shaking under him. The plane tilted wildly and Josh slid in his seat toward the aisle.  He looked over at Kanya, afraid.  Her eyes were real big too.  She reached out and grasped his hand.  \"It's okay, honey.  Sometimes planes run into bumps in the air.\"  But her eyes looked scared too.  Josh held onto her hand real tight.</span></div></div>",

She heard Vito and Josh screaming as well and turned to them. Vito growled something uncomprehensible at Josh as they hit the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Kanya treded water easily for a few minutes and looked around trying to see if she could see Josh. She spotted him a few feet away but couldn't see Vito anywhere. She swam towards Josh and pulled him into her arms, telling him everything would be ok. She should have known better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   They were completly surrounded by thick fog, and there was nobody around but the two of them. Suddenly the fog began to clear and an island with a large sandy beach with mountains and a jungle came into view. All she could say was \"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I can sw-swim Kanya,\" Josh whimpered wanting to be put down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Are you sure?\" Kanya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kanya let Josh go and they swam towards shore. What seemed like hours later they arrived at the beach and laid down. Suddenly the sound of a barking dog reached their ears and they looked around wildly trying to see where it was. The barking stopped however and they could see nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Where are we?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm not sure Josh,\" Kanya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There was nothing they could do about thier situation though and they both knew it.Suddenly they spotted a black bag floating in the water. Josh ran and pulled it out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kanya and Josh crossed their fingers and then she opened the bag to find a whole bunch of food. They pulled it out hoping there was something besides food in it. They found a lighter, credit cards, and a large brown envelope. Kanya opened the envelope and smiled at all the green stuff she couldn't use on the island anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Meanwhile, Riley watched through the trees as the first woman he'd seen in years grabbed the hand of her young male companion. They didn't look related. Where did they come from? He ventured out of the jungle and went to see what they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Kanya gasped at the sight of the gorgeous bronze man with no shirt or shoes on. Josh stood in front of her protectivly and asked the man what his business was.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Riley gave the boy a friendly smile and said,\"Why don't yal come up to meet my family? You can get out of those wet clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Kanya smiled back at the nice looking stranger with a sweet southern draul but Josh broke her from her thoughts and back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"NO!\" Josh exclaimed evenly kicking the tall stranger in the shins. Hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Kanya cringed but it didn't seem to bother the gorgeous stranger one bit. She had to divert her gaze from his caring face and focus on what they were going to do. The man after her had been kind and caring when they first met, fixing her car when it broke down on the side of the road one rainy night. Then he'd taken her to a resturant and ordered her a hot meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Kanya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Kanya was pulled out of her memories by their voices and back to reality. The stranger asked if she wanted to come to his place again.</span></div></div>",

It is me, Josh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, I guess,\" Kanya whispered.

The plane crashed over there.. Vito pulled you out before everything blew up. I helped him to bandage your leg.\" Josh told her enthusiastically.

Then she saw the calm figure of Vito standing beside her. \"Thanks for saving me,\" she told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kanya heard it. It was faint yet distinct, and seemed to be growing louder. It was like the beat of a hundred drums together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya caught a glimpse of Vito's face as it looked ashen white. Then he caught hold of the boy and helped her get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run,\" he whispered to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed no prompting.

She squeezed Josh's Hand as the drums beat louder and louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her shoulder and saw a group of maybe ten scarcely dressed men, obviously natives to this environment.

When he didn't she'd shrugged, leaned her elbow on the window and dozed off.  She was curious about his grumpy demeanor, but since she technically should still be in a hospital she was exhausted.  The escape had taken a lot of effort, and she hadn't been able to stop running until she boarded the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was a small wonder that she had been able to sleep at all.  She'd been looking for signs of Raul or his workers constantly ever since she'd left the tiny apartment he'd let her have.  Even when she'd boarded the plane, she kept glancing into the other rows for hauntingly familiar faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she felt more rested that she had in days.  A smile on her face, she put her small carry on over her shoulder, waited for the usual rush of people to pass her in the aisle, and then left the aircraft.  She was in baggage claim minutes later, the man with the kid who wasn't his coincidentally by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her lone, small suitcase, she checked her watch.  The Bermuda Triangle hadn't been a random or rash decision.  Her distant cousin lived in a flat nearby, and Kanya was supposed to meet her out front in ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, she quit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya jumped at the exclamation, whirling around to face the man who'd said it.  Big surprise - it was the man she'd been sitting next to.  The kid was sitting in a nearby chair, a bored look on his face, while his traveling companion screamed into a cell phone.  \"Well, find a replacement, or I'll be needing to get a replacement for you, understood?\"  He then angrily closed his phone and shoved it in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was rude, but Kanya couldn't help but stare at the way the man had carried on line that in front of a small, apparently scared young child.  Shaking her head, she almost turned to go when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling around, Kanya tilted her head in surprise.  \"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone else my eyes are looking at?

Now, the man, Mickey Rivers, was here for a connecting flight from Traverse City, Michigan.  Kanya could not help staring at his physique.  His frame was very muscular, he could have been interpreted as a very tough guy, but the dimples in his smile made people feel comfortable in his presence.  He smiled at the baggage clerk and gave a wink.  \"Fine, here stow it, but you had better not loose it.\"  Mickey looked around at the others waiting to board the plane.  I have plenty of time, he thought to himself, I'm going out for a smoke.  Mickey lit the cigarette and took in a deep drag.  He looked around, careful not to blow smoke on or around anyone else.  Mickey pulled his ticket out of his gray $3000 dollar suit and looked at it.  First class, no expense spared, not for me he thought.

The way he had approached her was brazen and the job offer unexpected, but now he was quiet, almost moody.

She looks around and find that practically the airport is vacant and there is no one in sight, she started getting afraid, she started weighing her options; whether to go back into the terminal and find someone or should she wait for taxi here for some time.<br>\r\n5 minutes passed: still no one to be seen, rain drops are banging an empty tin container making a strange sound, she believes that she can listen to some body talking in some strange language though it can be sound of water splashing some where. All of sudden direction of wind changes and rain drops hit her with a force of blow, she falls down and at exact moment electricity in the terminal fails. Linda is down and it's dark, she believes that she can listen to more people speaking in strange language. Voices are moving in her direction, some one touches her shoulder and makes her shout, on listening the shout the voices of people speaking in strange language stops, Linda is perturbed but then the soothing voice comes<br>\r\n\"Are you okay\"<br>\r\n\"hmm... who are you\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Kanya and I've landed here in the same flight as you\"<br>\r\nJust then headlights of coming taxi falls on them and Linda takes a good look of Kanya, she is relaxed and gets up.<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Linda, I was so afraid.. everything is so strange here\"<br>\r\n\" At least taxi is here\" <br>\r\nKanya and Linda starts moving towards taxi, taking the luggage with them, when they reach the taxi, it moves in reverse and before they can do anything just moves out of sight.

I don't know why I've taken this flight\" Kanya nods in agreement.<br>\r\nThey sit down on their luggage, starts chatting, both come to know that they both are running from bad relationships. They actually find many similarities between themselves.<br>\r\nJust then there is a lot of noise because of many taxis moving in their direction, head light of no car is on, when cars come really near then only their lights are turned, cars are moving really slow but they are honking and bright light is shining on Linda and Kanya. <br>\r\n\"Who's this?..\" Linda shouts but there is just the honking of tens of horns, Linda and Kanya starts moving backwards.<br>\r\n\" What is this happening\" Kanya asks to this Linda replies <br>\r\n\"I know why this is happening\".. just then one of the taxi crushes the luggage of Linda, she continues<br>\r\n\" (I) haven't told you the full truth, actually I have killed my fiance before running away but his father somehow comes to know about this.. and he is really strong and strange person\"<br>\r\nKanya looks towards Linda whose face is looking rather weird in so much light.<br>\r\n\"Kanya!

He had no family to speak of and the deal with Mr. Lereaux had gone seamlessly.  Not only had he finished his finest work yet, he'd made a load of money in the process.  All he wanted was to disappear in to the abyss of none-existence.  Unfortunately whomever was calling didn't give a rip about what he wanted.  He resigned himself to that fact and ended the incessant ringing. \"Hello?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of plans, Avery.  Our transport has gone missing and the boss wants you back here ASAP.  We need that antidote.\" \"Looks like you'll be sticking around for awhile after all.\" He added with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic gripped Justin in the gut and almost bowled him over.  He had finished some incredible work in the last eighteen months, but there was no way he wanted mixed up with these people any longer than absolutely necessary.  Besides he had a \"friend\" waiting for him on the other side of the ocean to leak all of his newfound knowledge to. The rest of the world deserved to know what he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya couldn't help but overhear the terse conversation the handsome \"man-sized Opey\" was carrying on.  He definitely was not talking to a friend. Kanya though he might pass out right there in the airport ticket line.  The man was trying to whisper, but even with her ipod on one ear she could hear enough to tell something was up with this guy.  His face was the color of snow and the fear in his eyes made even her a little nervous.  Not that she wasn't used to being around scary types or seeing fear in the eyes of her father's business associates and clients alike.  Just as they were nearing the ticket counter Kanya was surprised by the firm grip on her arm and shocked to see who the culprit was.  Mr. 50's himself had a lock on her arm and was pulling her out of line and away from the counter she'd waited to get to for the last 45 minutes.  \"What in God's name do you think you're doing,\" she insisted.  \"I don't know who you are, but if you don't let go of my arm right now, I'm going to make you wish you'd been standing next to someone else in that line.\"  \"Now I'm going to miss my plane you jerk...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up lady.\"  Her abductor sneered in a tone that belayed his anger, or was it shear desperation she saw in his face?  he stopped long enough to face her and utter,  \"Do as I say and we'll both get out of here alive.\" He looked to be almost pleading with her, but before Kanya could argue she was being pulled again in a manner that was really beginning to annoy her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look buddy, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in, but I'm not really inclined to be any part of it.\"  She yelled, \"Let go, now,\" and drew more than one glance from passersby as they nearly sprinted through the airport with \"Opey\" dragging her like a rag doll, baggage in tow.  He was definitely stronger than he looked at first sight.  He must work out when he wasn't kidnapping innocent travelers.  As they neared the exit out to the drop off/pick up area Kanya spotted a couple of faces that aren't easily forgotten. Two of her father\u2019s thugs were sprinting after them, the looks on their faces nothing less than menacing.  How on earth had they found her here and who was this guy?  She\u2019d never seen him before today, but suddenly she was more than obliged to aide in their escape.    Her heart plunged as the goons got closer.  There were little more than 30 yards between them and a certain untimely death as unsuspecting travelers were tossed and shoved out of the way.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Go, Go.\u201d  She yelled, now more eager than her captor to get out of dodge.  Obviously he hadn\u2019t seen the two gorillas bearing down on them.  \u201cRight there, an open cab, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d  Now she was pulling him as he tripped over their forgotten bags and practically fell into the back seat of the taxi. \"Ugly and Uglier\" had just busted through the exit doors and out into the road as they pulled out of the drive, a little too close for comfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth got into you?\"  Opey demanded.  \"I thought I was the one begging you to help me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just wait a minute.  I'm the one that's going to be asking the questions.\" I said.  \"Who are you and why did you grab me?\"  \"Those two thugs back there chasing us are friends of my father and none too friendly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpey stared at me as if my eyeballs had fallen out of my head.  \"Do you mean, you know those guys?\" He was incredulous at her confession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, unfortunately.  My father is in a line of business that requires associates that don't mind to do some dirty work, if you know what I mean.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear Lord.\" Opey looked as if he might pass out again.  What was with this guy?  Kanya would've worried about this interesting guy more, but her head hurt to bad. Right now, she just wanted to get far away from the airport and figure out where to go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kanya was jostled out of a restless sleep by the honk of a car horn out the right window of the cab.  As she came too she was assaulted by the acrid smell of cigar smoke.  She sat up from her slouched position and straightened her now crumpled jeans and button down shirt and noticed that they weren't in the city anymore.  They were traveling along a country road that didn't appear to be heavily traveled.  What she had assumed in half wakefulness to be a car horn was actually the call of some bird that she'd never seen before.  She cursed herself for sleeping for so long.  She couldn't afford to trust anyone at this point and here she was sleeping with a complete stranger determining her destination. At some point, she now noticed, she'd been transfered to a different vehicle, this one by no means a cab. As well, her traveling companion appeared to have run off on her. She was now sitting on a leather seat.  Her surroundings reminded her of being in her father's island mansion.  The thick black leather appeared to be heated, unless she was running on warm and the wine bar was stocked abundantly with cognac and crystal, a pricey collection.  Apparently she'd been left to fend for herself.  Or maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is someone up there?\"  She knocked on the window separating her and her driver.  A tiny crack was allowing clouds of smoke to fill the space she now occupied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she insisted, this time a little louder and with a little more attitude.  She was really beginning to get frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be arriving shortly.  Don't worry.\"  This came from none other than Opey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uhh, arriving where?  I don't remember talking about where we were going in the first place...Mr.\"  She stopped herself before calling the man Opey to his face, or at least to the glass.  He still hadn't lowered the glass partition. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We didn't discuss our destination, however, given the circumstances I thought it prudent on my part to get us out of harms way to someplace that might offer refuge for the night.  I had hoped you would be rested and ready to discuss our next course of action once we arrived.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all fine and dandy, but where are we going? And what is your name?  I'm sure you don't care to hear my nickname for you and if we're going to be stuck together for the night, I should at least know your name.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was silent for so long she though he might not answer her question, then the glass began to lower and she was met by two sets of eyes staring her down from the front seat.  The sight of Opey's friend made her nervous.  They were not supposed to be here.  All she'd wanted was a quiet escape to a beautiful island and warm weather.  She was beginning to wonder it she'd ever get her simple life with no criminals and no father to mess everything up.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"My name is Justin and I'd be obliged if you'd tell me yours as well.\"  He sat silently, she guessed he was waiting for her name so she decided to cooperate, he was being polite after all. Her cooperation, however, was only partial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Abby,\" She lied.  No need to give too much information.  She was running from some pretty powerful people and the last thing she needed was some goof telling the wrong person where she was.  The sooner she could get rid of him the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we're on a first name basis, would you mind telling me where we're going?\"  She bemoaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" he replied.  \"We've arrived.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was shocked by her surroundings.  While she'd been focused on Opey, or Justin as it was now, and eyes, also the possessor the cigar that had choked the air from her lungs, they'd driven up from the south and were now emerging at the top of a hill where the road turned into a drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be an orchard.\"  She thought to herself.  With the sun setting over the far mountains to the west and the radiant collage of color to the east she thought she'd never seen a more glorious sunset.  And that was only the beginning.  The road they were now traversing wound down into the valley with the trees lining both sides in full bloom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blooms, a bright pink and white, were littered over the entire road in a burst of color.  The limbs of the trees were so thick with flowers that you couldn't see beyond the next bend.  The air smelled of blossoms and apples and had a crisp touch that refreshed her parched lungs of the fresh air they desperately needed.  As they continued along she was able to see a house ahead some distance, or better described, a mansion that looked to be old and in shambles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the huge structure was both formidable and elegant at the same time.  It must have been quite a sight in past years.  As they pulled into the circle drive in front of the house and came to a stop, Kanya noticed another suv tucked away to the side of a detached garage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of anyone else seeing her made her nervous and for some reason she couldn't shake a feeling of dread overtaking her.  As beautiful and peaceful as this place was, something didn't feel right and she didn't like the idea of waiting around to find out why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She cringed as the door on her left opened up and a strong arm reached in and jerked her out of the car. \"Hey, watch it! I thought we're in this... \" Kanya choked off in midsentence after meeting Justin's cold hard stare. His freckles didn't seem too friendly now as his icy green eyes stared into her brown eyes. <br>\r\nJustin grabbed her arm, just above the elbow, in a vicelike grip and lurched towards the drab, rundown mansion's doors with Kanya in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front foyer, Kanya was pleasantly suprised at the drastic change in decor. The front foyer was awash in the bright orange glow of setting sunlight. She felt as if she had stepped into Tara, the southern plantation from \"Gone in the Wind\" There were gilded mirrors and filagree sconces lining the walls, dark mahogany panels lined the lower halves of the walls down to the bright marble floor. Justin stood and fumbled with the keyring but kept his grip on Kanya, he nimbly fingered a single key apart from the rest and tugged Kanya down the hallway. \"Just stay cool and you'll stay alive\" thought Kanya to herself. They stopped at a narrow mahogany door and Justin slid the key into the lock in the doorknob, twisted his wrist, and pulled open the door in one smooth motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement stairs looked dark and omnious and a feeling of dread and panic washed over Kanya again and she stiffened up and recoiled. \"Now just wait! Whatever happened to discussing our next course of action?\" she protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya's primal 'fight or flight' reflexes kicked in and she jerked her elbow back as hard as she could and wrenched free of Justin's clenched fingers. \"No, please listen...\" Justin started to plead but was cut off as the palm of Kanya's flat hand rammed his nose with a sickening crunch. He dropped to his knees and held himself up on one hand while the other hand fingered gently over his now throbbing face, blood trickling between his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya spun around towards the entrance and bounded out the door like a deer escaping hunting hounds. She started towards the SUV parked in the curved drive when she suddenly remembered that Justin still had the keyring, she abruptly changed directions towards the carport where she had spied the other SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya yanked open the driver's door and clambered inside. She checked the ignition for a key, but there was none. She pulled down the visor but nothing happened. \"Life is certainly not like the movies\" she muttered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the windshield she glimpsed a Honda XR 350 enduro motorcycle leaning against the side of the ramshackled carport. \"Just like home\" she muttered as she jumped out of the van and raced around to the bike.</span></div></div>",

She was quite familiar with riding motorcycles, but with the fear of her captors still in her mind, her fine driving skills were shaky at best.  Kanya looked over her shoulder waiting for one of the SUVs to come into view.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes with no sign of her kidnappers she started to relax.  She was still on the country road and she was not familiar with her surroundings.  Panic begin to creep back into her mind as she looked for signs of the city or at least a paved road.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea where she was or where she was going and she had lost all of her belongings or at least she thought she had.  There was still a possibility of the her luggage being picked up at the airport and taken to the lost and found.  That is if her father's thugs hadn't picked it up to search through.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think Kanya, you are trained to handle these things!\"  She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if by fate Kanya drove right onto a highway. Maybe she was not as far away from the airport after all.  She still had a chance to escape her nightmare life of crime.  Kanya slowed herself and looked around.  To her left she could see the what looked like the city skyline. She was in luck.  Before heading toward the city Kanya checked her chest for her hidden gems.  Still there.  Her pouch were she kept a back-up copy of her passport, driver's license and extra credit card were still in place as well.  Having a criminal mastermind for a father did have its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind she raced toward the city and back to the airport hoping that her father was not there waiting for her.</span></div></div>",

Kanya's spirits were beginning to lift, but as she approached the airport Kanya kept a keen eye out for anything unusual.  She drove her bike up to the passenger drop off and casually parked it.  Then she quickly raced into the main lobby.  She kept her head down, but remained alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late and she would not have many options in choosing a new destination.  Kanya made her way to the ticket counter.  The only available flights out of the country were to South Africa, New Zealand and Mexico.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she did not have any contacts in South Africa or New Zealand and that would make it difficult in trading in the gems.  However, Mexico was out of the question as her father had many business partners spread throughout the country.</span></div></div>",

This made her a little nervous, her passport was fake and even though she had never been sussed out before it still made her catch her breath everytime she used it; as if anyone could read right through her. <br>\r\n\"That's perfect. Thank you.\" Kanya smiled, trying to be as relaxed as possible. There was no way she could screw up now, not this far into the game.<br>\r\nKanya paid, stashed her tickets in her pocket and left the desk, going towards the departure lounge. Once through security, she decided to get a coffee and some breakfast; suddenly she realised how hungry she was. <br>\r\nWith a large coffee in one hand and a bacon sandwich in another, Kanya picked her way through the waiting people and seated herself next to a young, black man who was listening to his ipod. Safe enough, she thought to herself. A quick scan of the departure lounge confirmed she was on her own, nobody was interested in her today. No one had any idea where she was, this made her sigh with relief, she could relax.<br>\r\nTwo relaxing hours later, Kanya full, refreshed and cleaned up the flight 407 direct to New Zealand was announced \"boarding at Gate 4.\" Getting to her feet, Kanya made her way to Gate 4.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...Miss...Excuse me.\" A deep voice from behind Kanya made her jump. She span around and came nose to nose with the young black man she had been sat next to, minus the ipod and holding up a passport.<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, didn't realise you were that close behind me.\" Kanya flustered and took a couple of steps back, the man smiled and held out the passport.<br>\r\n\"I think you left this behind.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Would forget my head if it wasn't screwed on!\" Kanya gushed, relieved someone as nice as him had retrieved her passport, real or fake.<br>\r\n\"Lydia right?\" The man asked, Kanya frowned for a second wondering what he was saying, then she clicked, he had looked at her passport, her fake name was Lydia Renolds.<br>\r\n\"Yes, hi. Lydia Renolds.\" Kanya tried to cover her puzzlement and stuck out her hand for him to shake. <br>\r\nHe took it and shook it firm. \"Conrad Bennett. And sorry for looking at your passport, very invasive of me, but had to be sure it was yours!\" Conrad grinned again.<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for returning it, I wouldn't be getting anywhere without it. You boarding for New Zealand also?\" She asked politely, she didn't really want to be held up but he had been a gentleman.<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, going to visit family out there, business or pleasure for you?\" He ushered her to continue walking.<br>\r\n\"Bit of both really, although I've never been to New Zealand.\" Kanya replied, aware he was watching her.<br>\r\n\"Nice place, my brother and his wife and kids live there, haven't been for a good two years, but decided to tear myself away from work and make an appearance.\" Conrad chuckled, she liked his laugh, made her relax and feel at ease.<br>\r\n\"Well, enjoy your flight Conrad, and thanks again.\" Kanya waved her passport at him in thanks and turned to the boarding staff.<br>\r\n\"And you.\" She heard him say behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSat at her window seat, Kanya watched other people board the plane. A tired looking mother, a crying toddler in her arms and twin boys fighting over a colouring book were being directed to their isle seat, great a noisy flight, thought Kanya. Behind them, a couple, the man tall and muscly, the woman blonde and petite, obviously on their honeymoon from the twinkle in both their eyes. Kanya smiled at the sentiment. A short, thin man came after them, talking rapidly on his mobile phone, he looked angry, agitated like he wasn't meant to be there. Kanya hoped she wasn't seated next to him, she couldn't stand huffers and blowers. <br>\r\n\"Ma'am...\" A flight hostess was upon her all of a sudden, a pretty Asian woman with a sweet smile. \"Ma'am, a Mr Conrad Bennett has requested you sit along with him in first class for your journey, would you like to follow me?\" </span></div></div>",

I just didn't want you thinking you could bully someone like me around, like you were doing,\" she mouthed off in a firm yet sarcastic voice. She almost slipped on the \"Opey\" nickname, but she caught herself, and Justin was none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept looking around the house. Something was strangely familiar. she reached for the doorknob, and then backed away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we? What is this place?\" Kanya demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin reached around Kanya to open the door and quickly pushed her over the threshold. He wasted no time in closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes the best place to hide from someone is right under his nose! Go pick a room and get comfortable. Don't touch anything you don't need to touch,\" Justin warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya proceeded uop the stairs, and upon reaching the landing at the top, saw something she had not seen since she was just a little girl. It was a painting, a portrait of a beautiful young lady, in a traditional formal gown from the late 19th century. It was a pale blue gown, with a full pettycoat, and lots of intricate ruffling, in variable layers on the skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya knew this painting. Kanya knew this dress. She had tried it on when she was little. She had a fight with her father, and had run off to the attic. The dress was in a cherry stained wooden trunk, with elaborate metal work, and fanciful artwork engraved into the wooden sides. Yes, Kanya knew this house. That picture could have been her, but it was not. It was her great, great grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya was worried if Justin saw the portrait, he would know her secrets. What should she do? If she removed the painting, there would be an obviously empty place on the wall from where the painting had captured the dust. If she let it hang, she would have to find a way to cover the painting, or keep Justin downstairs until it was time to leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin handed it to her and said,\"Chivas rocks for the lady if I'm not mistaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sip Kanya looked up \"O.K. you know my name, you know what I drink and I now realize you know exactly where you brought me.

I know this because I was here too.  Not the whole summer of course I just visited for a week or 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fffflippin God!\"  Kanya screamed.  \"You are THAT JUSTIN????

When eye to eye with the portrait, she released all the anger and despair stored up in her heart to her deceased great-great-grandmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, her heart focussed on all the pain she had to endure from that side of the family. And the portrait first changed into her great-grandmother, then her grandmother and finally into her father - all of whom shared the same green eyes not matching the brown, thick hair, giving them a cold and mysterious look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile keeping her eyes on the portrait, she let her hands reach out for items around her. She found an old-fashioned, over-sized phone sitting on a dark desk with a bench. She aimed for the drawer, where she found something she was looking for: a reddish knife made in Switzerland. She did not hesitate for long and pierced the knife into her relative\u00b4s portraited eyes.

More than anything, she hated to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin bent down to pick up the knife, Kanya spoke.<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?\" There was no emotion in her tone.

Much prettier than Abby, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" she asked as she rubbed har aching wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pretty much told me so yourself, back at the airport. 'Those men work for my father.' He sent them there after me, not you, Kanya. Your father knows who you've been working for, and what you've done. But he hasn't got a clue about where you are. At least he didn't. You think those two guys recognized you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony and Lamar? Oh, yeah. They worked for my father since before I was born. Live-in bodyguards. You fixed me real good,\" she finished in that same flat tone. She fixed her gaze on the portrait, her eyes sad and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your father's eyes. And I guess he has hers,\" Justin said, gesturing toward the painting. \"When we moved you to the limo, I knew for sure. You have a scar on your forehead. Your dad told me how you got it. Bicycle accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny laugh escaped Kanya, \"Is that what he told you? Did he tell you what he did to the other kid on the bike? Dear ol' daddy broke his wrist.\" Anger crept back into her voice, \"We were eleven years old, for God's sake! We wiped out. It was my fault! Daddy yanked him off the ground and threw him through the air... I thought he was going to kill him...\" she trailed off, her eyes wide, lost in memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was silent. He knew all too well the kind of man Luthor Lereaux was, he didn't need to hear any more horror stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why here?\" Kanya asked. \"Why did we have to come here, of all f***ing places?\" The question didn't seem to be directed at Justin, but at fate itself. Then her eyes fixed on Justin's. \"I had forgotten this place even existed. Which was just fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Kanya. I... we needed a safe place to hide. This was all I could think of. It's the last place he'll look. I burned your father, Kanya. Burned him bad. Now he'll think you're in it with me, that I've turned you against him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Kanya interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, he might figure I'm with Raul, somehow. If that's true, Raul is dead meat. He'll never know what hit him, or why. Jesus, what a f***up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanya's eyes turned cold as she spoke, and Justin saw the resemblance more than ever. \"Well, every dark cloud has a silver lining. No loss, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response chilled Justin. \"I need a drink,\" he said, changing the subject. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't drink. But I am starving. I can't remember the last time I ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or slept, I bet. You were out like a light for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, things have been a little crazy, lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kanya did laugh, and Justin joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, smart guy, show me how good a cook you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" he said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe went down to the kitchen without another word.

She looked again at Justin, this time he was looking down at her, he was about to say something. She waved her hands, mouthing \"NO!\", then she put her fingers to her lips and looked upwards. Justin followed her gaze, again the footsteps sounded and this time Justin heard. The colour drained from his face and Kanya could see the fear in his eyes. Quietly Kanya closed the cupboard and stood up, she gestured for Justin to put the bottle down. Slowly she tiptoed over to him and he held out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that isn't your friend who was in the limo with us?\" Kanya whispered, the feel of Justins fingers wrapped around hers unsettling her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin shook his head. \"He left. It's just us. Well, that's what I thought.\" Justin looked terrified and Kanya felt how he looked but she had to get them out of there, she knew that house like the back of her hand. The intruder, whoever it was, was in the top bedroom, her fathers room. To get to them in the kitchen, they would have to come back onto the hall and down the stairs and through the double doors, there was plenty of time for them to make their escape. But where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the escape plan coming?\" Justin mumbled in Kanya's ears, the footsteps were making their way across the room, any minute now they would be out the door and onto the landing. Kanya shot Justin a look, she was thinking and didn't need him interupting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two choices......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing that popped into her mind was the jetty she had fond memories of diving off as a young child. She remembered her father had a number of boats but she hadn't been to the mansion in so long, and wasn't sure if her father had either, that she wondered if there was anything there at all but there wasn't a lot of time to wonder as the footsteps were now out on the landing. <br>\r\nKanya's eyes went to the back door, it was getting dark outside and this proved ideal, there were plenty of bushes beyond that door so even if the boat idea proved to be a dead end at least they could hide out in the garden until their intruder went away. <br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Kanya hissed jumping up from her position and pulling on Justin's hand. She yanked him hard towards the back door trying to be as quiet as possible. <br>\r\nThere was a key in the lock and Kanya turned it with ease opening the back door and walking onto the veranda. The cold wind began biting at Kanya's body and she wished she had had time to grab her coat which she knew was drapped over the back of the chair in the kitchen. She shivered, partly from the cold but partly out of fear. <br>\r\n\"We're not going to stand here forever are we?\" Justin leant over and whispered in her ear. <br>\r\nKanya snapped back into the present and hurried them both off the veranda leading Justin down the garden as close to the hedge rows as possible just in case they needed cover. Thankfully the sky was turning black now so they were unlikely to be seen. <br>\r\nShe remembered the jetty being to the left of the house, through the paddocks that led straight to the water. There was a small boathouse off the jetty and Kanya hoped it wasn't occupied, she really had no idea how her father handled the mansion anymore. It was long in the past. <br>\r\n\"Are we headed for the water?\" Justin asked in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n\"My father owns a few boats, there is a jetty on the water I remember as a child, I'm hoping that one of those boats is going to be there.\" Kanya didn't know if she was trying to convince herself or Justin.<br>\r\n\"There's a boathouse there right? I think I know what you're talking about? Didn't that jetty burn down in a fire a few years back?\" These were words that Kanya didn't want to hear. <br>\r\n\"A fire? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure, your father has many enemies Kanya, you shouldn't be surprised.\" Justin was close behind Kanya now, she could feel his breath on her neck, it was a little un-nerving but she was glad she had someone there, the darkness wasn't exactly her best friend. <br>\r\n\"Well if you're right then I've made a bad decision in coming down here, there isn't anyway back without going back through the house.\" <br>\r\nThey had just reached the paddock and Kanya breathed a sigh of relief to see it had overgrown and that they would be able to seek cover if need too, the long grass provided enough camouflage. <br>\r\n\"Let's hurry it up a bit.\" Justin said taking the lead and clasping Kanya's hand tighter. He was looking behind him a little too nervously so Kanya was only glad to be rushed along.<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't long before Kanya could smell the sea breeze and taste the salt on her tongue. It flashed images through her mind taking her straight back to her childhood. She saw her father tying up his little dory after a early dawn fishing trip, she saw her mother dangling her legs over the side of the jetty smiling as she watched her children swim in the cool water, and then she saw her brother, Marcus dive bombing from the edge of the jetty but not returning to the surface. She shivered at this last memory, her sweet thirteen year old brother took from them so young. One of the many reasons Kanya had locked away the mansion from her mind. <br>\r\n\"Kanya look, the jetty...\" Justin's voice splintered through her thoughts and stopped the tears that threatened to spill. She hadn't thought about Marcus in so long.<br>\r\nKanya opened her eyes wide and turned towards Justin's pointed finger, there was the jetty....</span></div></div>",

Justin had been missing for 12 hours now and she had just narrowly escaped capture at the hands of two goons. She couldn't believe father tracked her down in Geneva, Switzerland of all places! Kanya's plan seemed flawless: master hacker Dante Simms rerouted her phone call, placed to her father, in such a way that the call appeared to be coming from Vancouver - if the call was being traced. While father sent his thugs into Canada, she and Justin took a relaxing, leisurely flight into wealthy, gorgeous Switzerland. England was out - Justin's friend across the pond was at the very least, under father's surveillance, if not already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God - Dante!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree possibilities: Dante freely gave up Kanya and Justin to father, Dante gave up Kanya and Justin after some violent persuasion, or Dante was harmed into giving up Kanya and Justin, then killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first seemed unlikely - Dante and Kanya had been lifelong friends and even romantically linked for a while. Dante would sooner die than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kanya broke down crying. Everything caught up to her: father's inhumanity, the uncertain fate of Justin, the certain end of Dante - there was simply no action she could take that wouldn't endanger herself. There was no way to make a phone call or comb the streets looking for Justin without sticking her neck out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly couldn't ride the city bus indefinitely. What's more, money was running out and to attempt to tap into the secret account was, at the very least, risky. Recovering the gems was out of the question - that hotel room was positively unsafe to return to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lengthy cry, Kanya collected herself and waited as the bus came to a stop a short walk across from the <i>Parc des Bastiones</i>. She disembarked the bus and made her way over to the park, where many passers-by and pedestrians were enjoying the cool, overcast afternoon. It didn't seem like the best idea to get out in the open like this, but other options seemed even worse. <i>Besides</i>, she thought, <i>they may think twice before trying something in front of all these people</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few short moments after she arrived, Kanya heard a familiar male voice call her name.

They came to a spot where they were completely surrounded by trees and shrubs. As he looked around, Justin licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turns out, I don't really like travelling on my own. I got as far as the border and came straight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his feet and unease crept over Kanya. \"But, why would you do that? If you can make it into Germany, you can go to the Liebwitz Hotel, and they will take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer, his voice was barely more than a whisper when he spoke. \"They followed me, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenya's heart pulsed in her neck. \"You mean my father's goons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Who else? I stayed at a Premier Inn in Zurich. I figured, it was a big city, and they would never track me to there. So I stayed overnight. In the morning, the guy on reception had a message for me from my \"friends.\" Apparently, they came to see me, but I was sleeping. So they ask him to tell me they would catch up with me the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gasped, Kanya threw her hand in front of her mouth. \"So, what do we do now? Heck, forget that. Did they follow you here? What are doing getting me somewhere isolated, like this? Oh, God.\" She glanced around and a sweat broke out on her forehead and top lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's okay. I've been careful about every movement, doubling back on myself so many times I've felt dizzy. They don't know we're here, but they do know we're in Switzerland. That's why I came back. I had to let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crow flew overhead, cawing loudly, as though he was a messenger, proclaiming their whereabouts. Kanye swallowed hard. \"Actually, they kind of already knew we were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin took a step back and tipped his head to the side. \"Wh\u2014what? What do you mean they already knew? Have you seen them, Kanya? Where were they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen them. But they were at the hotel. The gems . . . well, they got them. I didn't even leave my hotel room, but when I checked in the safe this morning, they were gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. We have to get out of here. They might not have touched us yet, but I take back my former statement. They know we're here. They probably have eyes on us right now.\" He kicked at the ground and exhaled loudly. \"Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her by the hand and walked her back through the park. When they reached the coffee shop two block from her hotel, he told her to wait while he went to get her passport and a few clothes. When he returned, she asked if he had seen any of the suits, searching his face for any sign of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I didn't see anyone. I haven't checked you out with reception. I thought it will be best to make them think you're here as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So, where to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"London.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"London. But, I thought\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right. I've been in contact with my friend, and he said he hasn't seen any signs of your father's employees. He's sure we will be safe.\" As he spoke, he gently ushered Kanya out of the coffee shop and onto the street.</span></div></div>",

'The Honolulu flight leaves from gate C9. Have a pleasant flight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you,' said Justin. 'I'll try.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk frowned; Justin winced at his unintended sarcasm. 'Sorry, I didn't mean... that is, I... ah, right.' He picked up his traveling bag, hitched it over one shoulder. 'Sorry,' he concluded, redundantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe destination board showed about an hour before his flight boarded. Time enough, then, to find somewhere in this overpriced rabbit warren to get something to eat and to get his head in order. The last two weeks at the project had been rough; and the steady flow of Justin Avery's life was becoming a maelstrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the project was over, and his mind wasn't focused on the minutiae of the work, things about his time with the Ararat Foundation were coming back to him, things that somehow didn't stack up. In every research facility he'd ever been at, there had been funding problems, shortfalls, meetings with the people who held the purse strings. Every tech type knew the drill; it was a different angle, but the same 'civilians just don't get it' mentality that he saw in his brother (and he wasn't relishing the fact that Thad was coming in from the air force base at Hickam to meet him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ararat, it had been different from day one. No request was too difficult, no equipment too esoteric or too expensive. Everything he'd asked for, he'd got, often within 24 hours. Yes, he'd had to report progress, but only in written form, and there'd been no arguments. For a scientist, it was a dream environment, but in budget terms it made no sense. Yes, he was well respected in his field - immunology - but he wasn't a Pasteur or a Salk by any means. He didn't rate that kind of carte blanche. And only now, after eighteen months of hard labor, was he being summoned to Honolulu to meet Ararat's secretive paymasters. It defied logic; he and Betty had talked about it often, and come to the same conclusion each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes; Betty. How had he screwed up so badly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd thought she was kidding when she said her name was Betty Cooper, given that she'd pegged him as a ringer for Archie Andrews (that had annoyed him a little; he'd have called it as Jimmy Olsen). It had given the two of them a hook on which to hang a relationship outside work; and they'd passed the time in long late-night shifts when things weren't working out in happy comic geekdom. Who was your favorite Green Lantern: Hal, John, Guy or Kyle? How many ways did the X-Men movies differ from canon? Betty even admitted to crying at the wedding of Wonder Girl as much as if she'd been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that last ugly scene last week had had a fanboy tinge. The final accusation, as she stormed out of the lab, stuck in his mind. 'You know your problem, Justin?' she'd yelled. 'You have the face of Archie Andrews and the people skills of Reed Richards.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Justin felt in his pocket for the boarding pass; instead, he felt the outlines of a folded piece of paper. That shouldn't be there... He withdrew it, unfolded it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image on it was one of Archie, in his late Sixties guise as Pureheart the Powerful. Underneath the picture, in Betty's cramped and spiky handwriting, was a one-line message: 'Sorry I was so hard on you. Good luck in Hawaii.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked at his watch. Lord, where had the time gone? They'd be calling his plane for boarding. He grabbed his bag and headed for the gate; but to his right he noticed a bank of pay phones. Did he have time to call Betty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd did he want to take the risk?</span></div></div>",

He wasn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi, Betty here!' Betty's voice on the answering machine sounded absurdly cheerful. 'Sorry I can't come to the phone; I'm probably away somewhere having way too much fun right now. But, hey, I'll be back soon enough, so let me know who you are and why you're calling, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks. Byeee!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bleep startled Justin for a moment before he plunged in. 'Hi, Betty, it's Justin; I'm at the airport. I can't talk for long, they're calling my plane, but... I found the picture you gave me; thank you. I...' Deep breath. Calm, he thought. Center yourself. 'You got it wrong, Betty. I'm hardly Mister Fantastic - which is why I've been such a bloody fool treating you like the Invisible Girl. That stops. Right now.' Focus. Say what you mean. 'I really must run now; I'll try to catch you once I've got to Honolulu. I... Take care, Betty. See you soon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCretin, he cursed himself as he replaced the receiver. You knew what you wanted to say and couldn't say it. Go. Get on the damn plane and pray you haven't blown things completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting his traveling bag over his shoulder, he had to run most of the way to the departure gate, fumbling his boarding pass out of a pocket as he went, and blowing like a steam engine by the time he bounded down the ramp and into the aircraft. The flight looked almost fully booked; too flustered to even look at the boarding pass, he settled for the nearest spare seat. This did little, though, to minimize his sense of embarrassment as, the last passenger to board, he stowed his bag into the overhead locker with what felt like four hundred pairs of eyes firmly on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Justin let himself slump into his seat, closing his eyes as the plane began to taxi down the runway, waiting for that familiar lurching sensation as the Boeing lifted off the tarmac. No going back now. With a four-hour time difference to account for, they should touch down in Honolulu in the early evening; if I'm lucky, Justin thought, Thad will remember that, take pity on his poor jet-lagged brother and not insist on showing me the town. If I'm lucky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excuse me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice poured into Justin's sleep-fogged consciousness like Jack Daniels over ice. He shook his head quickly, forcing himself awake. 'Sorry. I was miles away,' he yielded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing in the aisle alongside him favored him with a bright, cheery smile. 'I know. I apologize for having to wake you, but I can't get back to my seat. I got out okay, but you seem to be sprawled out a bit more now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin shrugged. The drawbacks of being that bit oversized in a one-size-fits-all world. It was probably just as well that he'd been awakened, anyway; he had some reading to be done before he met with the Ararat people tomorrow, and this was a good time to take care of that. 'No need for apology, ma'am,' he said, rising from his seat to allow the woman to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached for the locker, he paused for a moment. The woman's face seemed familiar from somewhere. Maybe he should ask? It'd bug him to death if he didn't. But he needed to be fully on his game for tomorrow, and that meant preparation...</span></div></div>",

He sat down and pulled out his laptop, placing it on the drop-down tray in the seat back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get comfortable in the cramped space, he slid his right leg into the aisle, keeping it out of the way of passengers and flight attendants who passed by. \"Pretty soon these planes are only going to fit little people!\" he griped to himself. He settled back and began reviewing the documents, making notes his legal pad. He was so absorbed in his work that he didn't notice the surreptitious looks the woman in the next seat was giving him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the passenger in the seat in front of Justin reclined his seat, jamming the drop-down table with the laptop on it into his belly and jamming his left knee into the seat back. \"Oooomph!\" he grunted as he attempted to untangle himself. He extricated the laptop and closed the drop-down table. He sighed deeply as he found himself gazing into the bald spot on the top of the passenger's head, and to make matters worse, the passenger began to snore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Just great.\" he muttered to himself. He opened his briefcase and stuck his laptop inside, growing more irritated by the moment. Its not bad enough that the airlines try to save money by cramming every last seat they can into the plane, he thought to himself, but making the seats recline is just ridiculous! He huffed out a breath and settled back into his seat, trying to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes it seems worth it to pay more for a first class ticket, doesn't it?\" commented the woman next to him, with a friendly smile, indicating the passenger's intrusion into Justin's space. Before he could answer, she stuck out a hand with long, elegant fingers and immaculately manicured nails. \"Hi. My name is Taffy.\" She deliberately shortened her name to avoid recognition. Justin, startled, looked at his seat mate and once again noticed that she was one of the most arrestingly beautiful woman he'd ever seen. He gazed into her warm brown eyes and took her hand in his, and they shook politely. Her skin was warm and soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin here. Nice to meet you.\" he told her with a polite smile. Justin felt a blush creeping up his neck and into his face. Silently he cursed the fair skin that accompanied his red hair and freckles, and caused him to blush like a schoolboy at inopportune moments such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to sound cliche,\" he said, trying not to stare, \"but don't I know you from somewhere?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffina smiled and withdrew her hand from his. She said casually, \"No, I just have one of those faces.\" She hoped he wouldn't pursue it. The last thing she wanted was some star-struck fan slobbering all over her during this long flight to Honolulu. Hopefully he wouldn't make the connection that she was one of the top models in the world. When she traveled, she wore no make up, and while she was still beautiful, she bore only a vague resemblance to the lacquered and air-brushed photos in the magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could pursue further conversation with his beautiful seat-mate, the flight attendant stopped at the row in front of Justin and was taking food orders, awakening the man in front of him. Justin breathed a sigh of relief as the man straightened his seat, giving Justin some much-needed breathing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. As much as he'd like to chat with Taffy some more, he needed to prepare for tomorrow. Resignedly, he pulled out his laptop and powered it up. As it was booting, he pulled out his pen and legal pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffina returned to her magazine, regretting the interruption to her conversation with the handsome Justin, he of the cute freckles and endearing blush. TO Taffina -- who was used to jaded playboys, gay male models, and groupies who only wanted a chance to brag that they had \"made it\" with Taffina, the hottest model around -- it was refreshing to just be \"normal.\" As much as she loved the lavish, jet-setting lifestyle, with all the money she could need and more, sometimes she briefly wondered what her life would have been had she taken a different turn, with husband, children, and a white picket fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eight years in the business, at age 24 she was well aware that in the modeling world, she was on the cusp of being \"old\", and she was squirreling away money for the day in the not-too-distant future where she would no longer be in demand. By the ripe old age of 30, she would be well past her expiration date. She sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was peripherally aware of Taffy's sigh as he powered through the documents he needed for tomorrow's meeting. He wondered briefly what a beautiful young lady such as Taffy, who appeared to not have a care in the world, could be sighing about in such a world-weary manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, his attention was brought back to his laptop, as he frowned at his computer screen. Those figures didn't add up! He looked at his notes, and back at the screen again. He pulled computer printouts of those same accounts from his briefcase that were printed last week. It took him awhile, but he found the transaction, buried in the communications with Ararat. He puzzled over this development and its implications. Something niggled at the back of his brain, but he couldn't quite grasp it. He decided to ignore it for now, knowing that the more he tried to think about it, the more elusive it would be. Justin put that document aside, and continued to review other documents, leaving the anomaly for another time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After five minutes of pouring over his notes Justin was sure that someone had replaced his notes with these fake ones. Some of the crucial details of his work were definitely missing. Sentences were changed, added, and deleted. \"This isn't possible.\" Justin muttered to himself as he looked down at his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Taffina asked, her face full of confusion. She looked down at what he had written and pondered what could have given the cute man beside him such troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked up at her \"These aren't my notes. someone's changed them\" Justin stared back at his screen willing the words to change back into the ones he was looking at before. Taffy's puzzled look increased and she looked over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you rewrite your notes\" Taffina asked him. He looked back at her and frowned \"I can try but I don't have all my results here, so it won't be exact.\" Taffina noted the stress on Justin's face and frowned \"does it need to be exact?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin put his hand up to his face \"If it's not and someone notices then my whole research could be for nothing.\" Taffy shrugged then calmly replied, \"What happens if you don't have the real thing.\" Justin slumped in his seat \"I don't know.\"</span></div></div>",

He was as security-conscious as his employment contract with Ararat required.  He didn't write down his screensaver password, and he always locked his screen, whenever he stepped away from his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to leaving work for this trip, he'd transferred the necessary files directly from his workstation to his laptop.  He hadn't checked them first; why should he?  He'd completed his work and closed down his work computer the night before, then come in to get the files on his way to the airport.  There was no way anyone could have accessed his computer overnight.  Ararat took site security <i>very</i> seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight was well over the Pacific, by the time Justin had determined the scope of the problem.  Although the notes showed that he had made significant progress in researching and testing a specific virus, it was the <i>wrong</i> virus.  Even worse, the notes indicated that the likelihood of determining an acceptable means of delivery, not to mention producing an antidote, was months away; perhaps, it wasn't even possible at all.  The true situation was exactly the reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began their descent into Honolulu International Airport, Justin realized he had almost completely neglected Taffy.  He felt badly about it, especially as the beautiful woman had initiated the conversation, something that was almost completely beyond his experience.  The situation with his notes had to take precedence, though.  He had to find a way to explain to his paymasters, that he was not to blame for the missing and corrupted data.</span></div></div>",

'I hope you don't mind,' he began, 'but I have the feeling I've seen you somewhere before...' His voice tailed away on the last word as he mentally kicked himself yet again. Not only did that sound like an opening line, but a lame opening line into the bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the woman thought he was trying to pick her up, she at least seemed to be merely amused by it. 'That could be,' she replied. Closing the copy of Harper's Bazaar that lay open on her lap, she turned the cover toward him. The lady's own visage stared back at him. Lips slightly parted, hair artfully tousled in that just-got-out-of-bed look, but definitely not airbrushed in the slightest, Justin conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Taffina Marks?' The scientist frowned. He knew the name - he was always better with names than with faces - but where... 'Of course. I saw something about you in People magazine last month. You were being courted for the new Wonder Woman movie.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know. God knows where they got that from; I'd have to be five inches taller and three cup sizes larger to do the role justice. And my friends call me Taff, by the way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh. Oh, yes, I'm Justin. Justin Avery.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Charmed, I'm sure.' Taff leaned back toward the plane window, studying him with a strange half-smile playing about her lips. In his work, Justin was well used to examining specimens under the microscope; now he felt as though he was sitting in a Petri dish of his own. 'Let me guess, Justin. You don't look as though you're going to Hawaii for the surfing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No; I'm a scientist. My - that is, my employers are in Honolulu. I have a meeting with them tomorrow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lord, how tedious. Stuck indoors all day playing with your Powerpoint presentation. You poor man. At least I get to work in the open air.' Taff tapped the cover of the magazine with one peach-coloured fingernail. 'Cameron insisted I come to Honolulu. Positively threw a fit when I tried to demur. Well, of course I gave in - gracefully, you understand. If you're working with genius, you have to accommodate its - little foibles. I'm sure you understand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin shrugged. 'A little. Forgive me, but I don't know Mr. Cameron's name.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's his first name, darling. And as for Cameron Ruger's reputation, well... let's just say that in my business he has the clout of, say, Stephen Hawking in yours.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's some heavy hitter.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even so.' Taff raised an immaculately plucked eyebrow. 'I know; why don't you come and see for yourself, once your dreadful little escapade is done? After all, there's really no point in going to somewhere as lovely as Hawaii if you don't enjoy yourself, is there?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin's eyes widened. 'Ms. Marks - Taff, I really don't...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nonsense, darling, I won't hear of it.' Taff tore a strip off the edge of one page, used the magazine as a rest as she scribbled something on the paper. Folding the paper into three, she pushed it into Justin's shirt pocket. 'That's the hotel where I'm staying. Come find me. It'll be fun.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excuse me, Ms. Marks?' The stewardess leaned slightly over Justin to address Taff more closely. 'There's a gentleman in first class who asked me to find you. A matter that he needs to discuss with you, he said.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaff sighed. 'Yes, I know what that will be. Do excuse me, Justin. A woman's work is never done, you know...' Carefully, she picked her way past Justin and disappeared toward the first class section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin realized, perhaps a bit too late, that his mouth was hanging open and closed it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Justin couldn't help but feel dismayed as he shambled through from the luggage carousel into the main concourse of Honolulu airport. The human species had an unerring capability for taking the beautiful and unspoiled and turning it into the soulless and enervating. Even in Shangri-La, it seems, we must have a Starbucks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis watch said eight-thirty; well past midnight by his body clock, and he felt as though he was running on instinct and prayer. Probably another hour before he could get to his hotel; half an hour to unpack, wash and have dinner (and not necessarily in that order) and then get some much-craved sleep. In keeping with the rest of their set-up, Ararat had not stinted when it came to accommodation for this trip; from the look of things from their website - not least the prices it showed - the Kapalama Star was a five-star establishment only because the system didn't allow for seven. Justin thought for a moment about those large, inviting beds and almost sighed. Just what this particular doctor ordered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'BOO-YAAAHHH!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stentorian bellow was almost enough for Justin to lose his footing. As it was, he recovered his presence of mind to turn around and yell, 'Thad! You dumb lummox, are you trying to kill me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big, beefy hand slapped down hard on Justin's back. It hurt. 'Hell, no, man, just trying to wake you up. Damn, but you look like something the cat sicked up!' Thad Avery grinned. Three years older than Justin, he had the same red hair and scattering of freckles, as well as an extra four inches and forty pounds. 'Still glad to see you, even so. Here, let me grab that,' he added, snatching Justin's suitcase from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You too, Thad,' Justin conceded. 'I hadn't thought you'd be able to make it. Demands of duty, and all that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You kidding me? The first time my little brother gets all the way out to Hawaii, and I can't get even a lousy 48-hour pass? I thought you were supposed to be the brains of this family. I'm a goddamn Master Sergeant, Justin. I say who gets passes and who doesn't.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, well, the brain's a little fogged at the moment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, I got the cure for that. Great place I know off Kapiolani. Blow your socks off, man.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin shook his head. He knew his brother's capacity to raise hell well enough; and from the sound of his letters, he'd been giving it full rein since he and Diane got divorced last year. 'I don't know, Thad. I'm jet-lagged to hell, and tomorrow's going to be pretty heavy-duty. I...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All the more reason for you to relax and chill out while you've got the chance. Check out these beautiful Hawaiian babes, bro. Out-standing.' The beam was back on Thad's face as he contemplated the prospect. 'Just trust Thaddeus Nicholson Avery, my man. TNA's the name, T &amp; A is the game.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin closed his eyes for a moment. If he didn't get some sleep soon, he'd be a zombie tomorrow morning; but Thad on leave was not so much a man, more a force of nature...</span></div></div>",

I mean, look at me, I've been traveling all day and I'm falling asleep on my feet. I need a hot bath, a hot meal and a warm bed before I can even think of anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" conceded Thad, a little too quickly and completely for Justin's comfort. \"Sorry, man, guess I wasn't thinking about it from your side. So - where were you staying, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place called the Kapalama Star. You know it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By name. That's some place. You need to be making 200 large a year just to get in to take a whiz. Someone's looking after you okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraffic was light at this time of the evening, and even Thad's elderly Chevrolet made good time into the city center. The Kapalama Star looked everything that its website had suggested, and then some. The brothers entered the lobby - having left the car in the hands of a valet parking attendant who looked astonished at the thought of something so manifestly below the salt alongside the Rolls, the Bentleys and the Lamborghinis - and Justin felt humbled and just a bit uncomfortable in the midst of its opulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in room 407, Dr. Avery,\" said the desk clerk, handing him a room key attached to what looked like a dollar-bill sized chunk of marble. \"And there's a message for you.\" Justin pocketed the key, took the proferred envelope with a murmur of thanks. Thad, glaring at the porter who was eyeing his brother's suitcase with a view to a substantial tip, was already halfway to the elevators as Justin slipped the envelope into his jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was on the fourth floor, practically opposite the elevators across a wide corridor. Justin quickly opened the door and stepped inside. \"Wow,\" he almost whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow is right,\" said Thad. \"You could play football in a room this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not football. Basketball, yeah, that I give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin hadn't established to what standard Ararat were accommodating him; but this was a mid-level room, so it probably wasn't top of the line in terms of accoutrements. It still looked a street - no, a freeway above anywhere he'd ever stayed at any time in his life. Cobalt-blue carpets of a dense pile, heavy furniture in what looked like mahogany and leather to match the floors; cream-painted walls and lighting in sconces set into them. Behind the three-seater sofa in the center of the room, Justin could see a balcony; he strolled over towards it while Thad headed for the bedroom and somewhere where he could set the suitcase down properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view would be superb come morning, he considered; even now, with the sun gone and only the street lighting to go by, he could see the dark rolling breakers of the Pacific beyond the beach. This would be an experience to savor, Justin thought. Betty would love it. And she should be here to share it; she'd worked hard enough for it, heaven knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought reminded him; he'd intended to try to call her again once he'd arrived - but it'd be the middle of the night in Minnesota by now. He'd have to make that call tomorrow, once his business at Ararat's HQ was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his pockets looking for something on which to make that note - he always felt better with things written down - he felt the envelope that he'd been given at reception; withdrawing it, he slit it open with a thumb and pulled out the single sheet of paper inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Dr. Avery,\" Justin read aloud. \"Imperative I see you as soon as possible re your appointment tomorrow. A crucial development of which you need to be apprised.\" A phone number - a cell phone, at a guess - followed, as well as a signature. \"Signed, B. Brand,\" he closed, with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThad emerged from the bedroom. \"That's funny?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the name. Only 'B. Brand' I know of is Boston Brand, otherwise Deadman.\" Thad looked blank. \"Character out of comic books,\" Justin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThad nodded. The ebullience that had been in his voice all the way from the airport had vanished. \"Well, that makes sense. Given that there's a dead man in your bedroom, and all.\"</span></div></div>",

He lay as though he were merely sleeping, sprawled diagonally across the bed in a posture that suggested a hot, restless night. And the sight was oddly clean; no indication of struggle. 'Thad, this will sound dumb,' Justin admitted, 'but... are you sure he's dead?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kid, I've done tours in Iraq and in Somalia in my time. Believe me, I know from dead when I see it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure, of course. Jesus, we'd better call the police, or something...' Half-dazed, Justin picked up the receiver of the phone on the nightstand. 'Hello, this is Dr. Avery in room 407. I need you to call the police immediately.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh?' responded the male voice at the other end. 'Is something amiss, sir?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, there's a corpse on my bed; I'd say that that's pretty damned amiss, wouldn't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh.' It surprised Justin that the fellow on the front desk didn't seem more perturbed; but with the number of guests that must pass through a hotel this size, he reasoned, purely by the law of averages some people must die during their stay. 'Of course, sir. I'll contact them at once. Do you need any assistance yourself?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no, I'm fine. Just... thank you.' Justin replaced the receiver, noticing the slight tremor in his hand as he did so. 'They're coming,' he told his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. In the meantime, get yourself out here and sit down.' Thad was rummaging through a small cupboard alongside the TV. 'Ah, I knew there had to be something in here that'd suit. Here, get this into you,' he said, handing Justin an opened bottle of Coors. Ignoring his brother's attempts at protest, the airman went on. 'This is the first time you've seen a dead body, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... yeah, it is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then drink the beer. Trust me, it helps. For the first one, anyway.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin took the beer, sipped it cautiously. Alcohol usually hit him hard, although that might not be a bad thing just now. Thad picked out an imported Guinness for himself, took a long pull from the bottle. 'Ahh... I needed that,' he sighed. 'You mind if I ask you something, bro?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Course not. Shoot.' Justin winced; foot-in-mouth disease again. 'Sorry. That was just wrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThad ignored the faux pas, possibly didn't recognize it. 'You know that guy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never seen him before.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay. It just seems strange, there's none of his stuff here, from the look of it. If he'd had this room before you, shouldn't there be some of his clothes, at least?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd guess so. I'll go check in the closets; maybe there's some...' The phone rang in the bedroom, disturbingly loud over the brothers' hushed voices. 'Maybe the police have got here. I'll get it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin plucked the receiver and had barely got it to his ear when the voice at the other end spoke. Not the desk clerk; and evidently not the Honolulu police, either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good evening, Ms. Marks. I trust you're settling in suitably well? The view from your room should be excellent; I recommend you try to be up early to enjoy the sunrise.' Justin was about to speak when he registered the surname. Taff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh. Not speaking?' the voice continued. 'I suppose you must have found Mr. Dressler. He wasn't overly enthused about coming to meet you, but I talked him around in the end. He's told me a lot about you, you know; I almost feel as though we know each other very well already. But I do look forward to making your acquaintance.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin couldn't stay silent. 'Who the hell is this?' he shouted. The voice on the other end fell silent; after a long five seconds, he heard the click of the line going dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin's hand went to his shirt pocket. Yes, there inside it was the scribbled note that Taffina Marks had given him. She was staying at the Kapalama, too, it seemed; and she'd given him a cellphone number, in case he wanted to take her up on the offer she'd made him on the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police would be here shortly; they'd need to know everything. But from the way that the mystery man was talking, Taff and Dressler - assuming that the dead man was Dressler - knew each other. She'd want to know, surely?</span></div></div>",

Seeing the dead man's body next to him on the bed reminded him anew of the events that enveloped him, and Justin gagged, lurching from the bed in mid-heave.  Thad side-stepped his haggard brother as Justin teetered into the adjoining bathrom, collapsing over the commode and retching his guts out.  Fatigue and shock finally took its toll on the younger Avery brother, and Justin keeled over sideways from the toilet, and sprawled across the bathroom tiles....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awakened some time later, by the gentle nudge of a hard-soled shoe against his ribs.  \"Mister... Avery?\" the crooked-nosed, plain-clothed cop snarled down at him. \"I'm Detective Daniels, Hawaii Homicide. This is your wake up call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh yes.\" Justin smiled weakly as he righted himself.  \"Am I glad to see you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I'll bet...\" Detective Daniels' monotone baritone cracked.  \"Justin Avery, you are under arrest for the murder of Calvin Dressler...\"  \"What? Murder? I killed someone?\"  It all came crashing back inside Justin's muddled mind; the flight, Taffita Marx, the body in the bedroom... \"Wait a minute! Thad? Where's my brother?\"  Detective Daniels stopped Justin from leaving the bathroom with a forceful shove backwards. Two uniformed officers converged on Justin, quickly spinning the confused scientist against the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have time to contact your loved ones and a laywe once we get you booked and processed...\" Daniels promised.  \"Right now, you're not going anywhere but out of here, while we secure the crime-scene, sonny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but I...\" Justin stammered as he was escorted from the bathroom under duress. \"How could I have killed him?

On the way out of the hotel lobby, Justin and his escorts were met by a 14-foot golden limousine which pulled up outside.  As the chauffer exited, Justin was being funnelled into the back-seat of a waiting police cruiser.  As the chauffer and hotel door man opened the  rear passenger door of the limo, Justin's heart raced when he noticed Taffina Marx shapely form slide out of the gold car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..

She paused and turned her attention to the commotion that was unfolding before her.<br>\r\nThere were two police officers both in uniform, one short and stumpy, the other tall, skinny and pale. The stumpy one was talking into his walkie talkie while the other was pushing a man into the back seat of the patrol car.<br>\r\nTaffina narrowed her eyes, squinting in the sun to make out the figure.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Marks, please. We must go inside.\" Felix, her bodyguard once again gripped her upper arm. Taffina didn't much like Felix, he hadn't been working with her long and she made a mental note to talk to her agent about a replacement.<br>\r\n\"Let go of me please.\" Taffina growled, a scowl on her face. She shrugged Felix off but his grip tightened.<br>\r\n\"I'm here to protect you Ms. Marks so you must do as I say.\" Felix looked at her fixing an agressive, \"Dont.Mess.With.Me\" look.<br>\r\n\"TAFFINA!\" A voice Taffina definately recognised turned both her's and Felix's attention away from each other. <br>\r\nThe man, being shoved into the patrol car was shouting to her, his free arm, which the officer was trying to get into handcuffs, was waving in her direction. Still Taffina could not make out who the man was though. <br>\r\n\"TAFFINA!\" He called again, this time with an urgent tone to his voice. He needed help. Roughly pulling away from a stunned Felix, Taffina began marching towards the patrol car. Everyone was looking at her, Felix especially. She tossed her long bleach-blond locks over her shoulder and approached the officers.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me officer, is there a problem here?\" Taffina purred, the short, fat officer stopped talking into his walkie talkie immediantly, mouth hanging open, tongue lolling out like a dog in the heat, the other, taller officer looked over his shoulder at her, her prettiness stunning him and he began fumbling around with the handcuffs.<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Taffina glanced at the man half in and half out of the patrol car. Justin Avery, the sexy redhead she had encountered on the plane. What a coincidence!<br>\r\nWaiting for the officer to answer her she placed a manicured hand firmly on her shaply hip and pushed her sunglasses from her eyes into her hair, her sparkly blue eyes on the officer.<br>\r\n\"Nothing for you...for you to worry about Miss.\" The policeman stuttered.<br>\r\n\"What is this man accused of?\" She asked, giving the officer her trademark smile.<br>\r\nHe blushed. \"Do you know this man Miss Marks?\" <br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact I do, and I would like to know the reason you are shoving him into a police car, you will make him very late for our date.\" Taffina could see the effect she was having on the poor man, and she watched Justin, his mouth open in awe.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's classified miss,\" a voice from behind made them all glance towards the hotel, \"if it isn't Taffina Marks?\" A laugh escaped the mans lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick Daniels...Is that you?\" Taffina smiled, a warm smile at Dectective Daniels who was making his way towards her. Once he reached her he leant in and kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n\"Hello Taffy.\" He said, a twinkle in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were a dectective now. Suits you.\" Taffina grinned up at him, a man she used to hold so fondly in her affections.<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, these things happen. Looks like you're trying to make my job harder though.\" Patrick nodded towards Justin Avery who was now stood, unhandcuffed watching both Taffina and himself.<br>\r\n\"I always did get in the way didn't I...I was just asking your officers here what was going on, Justin is a friend of mine.\" Taffina winked at Justin, this was going to be easier than she had first thought. Especially now Patrick was on the scene.<br>\r\n\"Justin Avery has been arrested for a suspected murder Miss Marks, I must take him downtown.\" Patrick said professionally.<br>\r\n\"That's impossible Pat, Justin is with me, has been since we got off the plane.\" Taffina explained.<br>\r\n\"Then how do you explain him being in a room, alone, passed out with a dead body lying on his bed.\" Patrick asked playfully.<br>\r\n\"I asked Justin here, to go up to my room to check that everything was ok, me being a big celebrity and all, the REAL killer must have knocked Justin out.\" Taffina said matter of factly.<br>\r\n\"Is this right Mr Avery? Is this your alibi?\" Patrick turned towards Justin.<br>\r\nJustin nodded, \"I'm innocent Dectective. I was just looking out for Taffina, then this guy out of nowhere...\" Justin began.<br>\r\nPatrick held up a hand to stop him, he turned back to Taffina. <br>\r\n\"Is he staying with you?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, we will now be staying at my uncles beach house, you know it Patrick. If you need to question him, please feel free to drop round.\" Taffina stated.<br>\r\n\"Yes yes, ok, Mr Avery you are free to go, BUT and I mean but...do not under any circumstances leave the country. You will be hearing from us.\" At that Patrick hurried his officers back into the patrol car, nodded his goodbyes to Taffina, got in the drivers seat and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank me later, FELIX, change of plan.\" </span></div></div>",

They hadn't spoken since getting in the car and this made Justin nervous. His head was a mess, he was still trying to take in everything that had happened back at the hotel, and he was mystified to the whereabouts of Thad, his brother. <br>\r\nTaffina finally cleared her throat. <br>\r\n\"You didn't kill that man did you Justin?\" Taffy asked quietly.<br>\r\n\"What kind of question is that? You know exactly who killed that man Taff and don't play dumb with me, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. What the hell have you gotten me into?\" Justin yelled a little too angrily he thought once he had finished.<br>\r\n\"Please calm down Justin, shouting isn't going to help the situation.\" Taffina twiddled her thumbs and didn't once look up at Justin.<br>\r\n\"Are you really a model or is there more to you? Please, just tell me what's going on.\" Justin pleaded a little bit more politely this time.<br>\r\n\"Right now Justin, I don't think you're ready to hear it. All you need to know is that I'm sorry, my guy said he knew of someone he could set up for the murder, someone who would take the rap and leave me out of the picture, I didn't know it was you. This was not meant to happen.\" Taffina put her hand on Justin's shoulder but he shrugged it away.<br>\r\n\"I was being framed? If you hadn't have met me on the flight would you have let me go to prison?\" Justin was confused and angry.<br>\r\n\"Please Justin, I said I was sorry, I stopped that from happening didn't I? Now I just need to get to the beach house and we can work something out.\" Taffina looked deep in thought.<br>\r\n\"Where's my brother? Thad? He was with me at the hotel, where is he?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n\"Thad is your brother?\" Taffina looked puzzled, shocked even. \"But your last name is Avery...\"<br>\r\n\"So is Thad's.\" Justin was even more confused, Taffina knew Thad.<br>\r\n\"Well he doesn't use Avery, I know him as Thad Evans.\" Taffina explained. Evans...that was Betty's last name, things were getting stranger by the minute.<br>\r\n\"How do you know my brother?\" Justin questioned, he had to get the bottom of this.<br>\r\n\"Justin, Thad is my guy, the guy that said he knew someone to frame for the murder...Thad set you up Justin, I'm sorry.\" Taffina began putting the pieces together.<br>\r\n\"No I don't believe you! Why would my own brother do something like that?\" Justin yelled, he was getting angry again, nothing made sense. He was meant to be in Hawaii for a routine business trip, this was definitely a nightmare.<br>\r\n\"I don't know Justin, but you can ask him yourself....\" Taffina nodded out the window.<br>\r\nAs they pulled up in front of a very expensive looking beach house Justin noticed his brother stood on the balcony sipping a beer. He waved as the limo pulled up but little did he know Justin, who should have been in prison by now, was sitting in the back seat with Taffina Marks.</span></div></div>",

The beer bottle that was in his hand dropped to the floor with a thud and a crack, breaking clean in two. <br>\r\n\"What the hell is he doing here?\" Thad's voice came out in a whisper.<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing don't you think?\" Justin growled. He curled his fingers into a fist. He still couldn't get to grips as to why his own brother would set him up, he still didn't have a clue what was going on. <br>\r\nAs Justin took a step towards his brother Thad turned on his heel and ran. Away from Justin, away from the beach house and away from the consequences. Taffina and Justin watched him go.<br>\r\n\"Let's go inside, I'm sure he will be back.\" Taffina said calmly.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Justin spat.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean no?\" Taffina turned to face Justin, a serious look in her eyes. She made a gesture to her body guard and Felix came around the limo to stand next to Taffina. <br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere until I get some answers. I don't have a clue what is going on, I don't know why my brother is involved with you or why there was a dead man in my room. I'm not moving from this spot Taff until you talk to me.\" Justin was adamant. <br>\r\n\"Justin, I am not going to explain all this stood out here. Let's go inside, make ourselves comfortable and then we can talk.\" <br>\r\n\"I mean it Taffina, I'm not moving.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe not willingly.\" She clicked her fingers and Justin was grabbed, both his arms twisted into a lock behind his back.<br>\r\n\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way Justin. I'm trying to help you, I'm not the bad guy here.\" Taffina purred. <br>\r\n\"Fine I'll go inside, but I want answers. Now get your muscle to let me go.\" Justin was released and he rubbed his wrists to get some feeling back. <br>\r\nJustin followed Taffina up to the beach house, Felix the body guard stood right beside him obviously to make sure he didn't run off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Taffina led Justin through a series of rooms. Each one as modern and glamorous as the last. They eventually ended up the kitchen which had a wall of glass looking out to the beach below them. In any other circumstances Justin would admire the view, he had always wanted to live by the beach but right now he was just focused on getting the truth. He didn't give a damn about the view. <br>\r\n\"Felix, could you get some drinks for Mr Avery and myself.\" Taffina ordered her bodyguard who looked less than pleased to be making refreshments. \"Take a seat Justin, I'm sure you have lots of questions.\"<br>\r\nJustin sat at the dining table that was situated right in front of the glass wall. He sank into a leather dining chair and it made him realise how tired he was and how much his body ached. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure Thad will be back?\" He asked gruffly running his hand across the growing stubble on his chin. <br>\r\n\"Well if he wants to get paid then I'm sure he will.\" Taffina sat down opposite Justin and began examining her nails. Justin took this moment to really look at Taffina. She was a model and it certainly showed but looking at her now in harsh light he could see the signs of a serious women underneath all that make up. He glanced down as she crossed her perfectly tanned legs and as her skirt rose a little he got a glimpse of a gun in a holster wrapped around her upper thigh. He shuddered a little. <br>\r\n\"My brother is in the army, I don't understand why he's working for you.\" Justin asked perplexed at his brother's involvement.<br>\r\n\"Your brother used to work for the army Mr Avery. He got discharged over misconduct almost a year ago, we met quite by chance but Thad was just what I was looking for. He fits in well with us here.\" Taffina smirked.<br>\r\n\"Why did you save me Taffina? If Thad was using me as a set up then why not let me take the fall? That's what you had planned wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Firstly I had no idea Thad was setting up his own brother, and secondly I need you. I did a little research after we met on the plane Justin Avery. Your more renowned than you let on.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm just a scientist Ms Marks. Nothing more.\" Justin glugged down the water that had been put in front of him by Felix. He was nervous and confused and certainly didn't want to be there. <br>\r\n\"I think you're a little more than just your average scientist Mr Avery. You've been working on some big projects recently haven't you?\" <br>\r\n\"Ask him about Ararat Taffina...\" Both of them turned their heads to the kitchen doorway where Thad stood, a little out of breath and with a hard look on his face. He couldn't meet Justin's eyes.</span></div></div>",

You know I would have helped you out, and now look where you've ended up. Seriously Thad, I thought you were smarter than all of this.\" Justin gestured to Felix and Taffina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThad was sweating, he didn't know how to answer his brother. He loved Justin, he admired Justin. His brother had always been the one to look out for Thad even though Thad was a year older. But deep down inside Thad knew he was jealous of Justin, the son that had achieved more and was the favorite in their parents eyes. Maybe that was why he had framed him, he didn't really know but he knew now that he had lost his brother's trust and respect and this hurt. <br>\r\n\"Justin please, just tell Taffina what she needs to know and then we can sort this out later, I need that money Justin.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm bound in a contract with Ararat Thad, if I release what I'm working to anyone I could lose my job and my status. I have a lot riding on this contract Thad.\" Justin ran his fingers through his hair and sighed.<br>\r\n\"They will kill me...\" Thad whispered.<br>\r\n\"Who will kill you Thad? What have you gotten yourself into?\" Justin had reached Thad now and reached out to him, Thad grabbed hold of him in support. <br>\r\n\"Justin, your brother owes someone very powerful, much more powerful than me, a lot of money. He got in to deep on a job that went wrong and now there is a price on Thad's head unless he gets this man his money. You can help him out here Justin, if you co-operate with me then Thad gets paid.\" Taffina stepped in. <br>\r\nJustin glared hard at Taffina.<br>\r\n\"So what will it be Mr Avery?\" She pouted.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know why, but something in the pit of his stomach told him that Taff had something to do with all of this mess.  Suddenly, he began to wonder what had happened to Thad.  Where did Thad go?  Did the killers come back and find Thad?  Did they take him away?  He knew Thad would never have left him if there hadn't been a good reason.  He also knew that his brother wouldn't have been taken easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin pounded on the protection screen between him and the cops.  He needed to ask them about Thad.

His head ached, his mouth tasted sour and he needed some water in the worst way.  Plus, he still hadn't had a chance to talk to the cops or anyone who might be able to tell him where Thad was and what the hell was going on.  Justin knew he hadn't done anything wrong, but how to prove that to the police?  He needed to think, but the throbbing between his ears was making it difficult.  He couldn't focus or really make any sense of all that had happened in the last 18 hours.  He knew he hadn't had a lot of sleep, but come on, he stayed up for days working on a project and could focus.  What was wrong with him?  He tried to think back, had he drank something or eaten anything out of the ordinary?  The only thing he remembered was drinking the few sips of the beer Thad had given him in the hotel room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin heard people talking down the hall as they were coming towards his cell.  Before he could see him, Justin knew it was Thad with one of the Detectives.  Thad telling the Detective about his last tour in Iraq and how much he hated the dust and dirt there.   Justin yelled for Thad through the bars, \"Where the hell did you go?  I don't know what's going on Thad.  My head is killing me.  Get me OUT OF HERE!\"</span></div></div>",

Better to call Betty when things were not so hectic; there would be time enough once he'd got to Honolulu, and before the Ararat meeting. Reluctantly, he hitched the carry-on bag over his shoulder and set off at a half-jog towards the departure gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a fair few waiting to board as he got to the gate; Justin fell in at the back of the queue, and within the next five minutes or so was stepping through the hatchway into the plane. He glanced at the boarding pass; seat 11D - he'd insisted on an aisle seat. The last time he'd been on a long haul, it had been in a window seat on a red-eye flight, and he'd been in near-agony because he couldn't get past a sleeping woman to use the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was his seat; and there was someone sitting in it. The occupant looked perhaps early twenties, lank brown hair and pinched, pimply face over a Green Day T-shirt and jeans that looked like goodwill store salvage. The faint hiss coming from the plugs in his ears left him screened out from the world. Justin tapped him on the shoulder. 'Excuse me?' he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey? Que pasa, man?' One earplug was removed for better understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry. I think you're in my seat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh. Sure, no problem.' The young man hitched sideways into the middle seat of the group of three. 'You always kind of hope you've got space to spread out on these things, y'know? Flying like this, you kind of get to know how sardines feel.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ain't it the truth.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For sure, dude. Hey, grab the seat, man, you're blockin' the aisles.' Justin nodded, quickly stashed his bag in the overhead locker. 'Pleased to meet you, man. Name's Eddie Gallardo, but most people just call me Spider. It's the legs that do it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin nodded. From the way that the kid was hunched up, he couldn't be much less than six feet six standing up, enough to make even him look a little short. 'Nice to meet you, Spider. I'm Justin Avery.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his slumped position, Spider tossed him an attempt at a leisurely high-five. 'Hey, Justin,' he said, putting the stress on the second syllable and making it sound feminine. 'You snore, man?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe non-sequitur made Justin frown. 'Snore? No, don't think so.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider grinned. 'Bummer. I do; probably keep you awake, man.' With that, he replaced the stray earplug and settled back in his new seat, eyes closed, losing himself in the music again. As the plane's engines kicked into full forward-thrust roar, Justin sighed quietly. Well, it could have been worse...</span></div></div>",

He had been saving his pennies for decades, and he had finally gone and done it. He was ecstatic beyond belief. Wouldn't Aunt Hilde be surprised right now if she could see him? He leaned back in his seat and looked out the window.  He was lucky enough to get a window seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the woman sitting beside him.  Auburn hair, mid twenties, legs that went on forever, and a beautiful face. He was sure his Allspice would have got her attention by now, but she seemed to be purposely ignoring him.  \"I'm sure I'm getting to her, but I'll play her game for awhile,\" thought Festus. He felt like a kid again.  Festus sighed and shut his eyes and dreamed of dark-haired beauties with leis awaiting him as when he stepped off the plane 6 hours from now.  \"What to do first? Should I check into my motel and then go find a classy restaurant and bar and dine on fillet mignon with a glass or two of bourbon  Or should I just bask in the beauty of the ocean waves rolling to shore from my motel window as I lie on my bed,\" Festus pondered in a dreamlike trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFestus had just fallen asleep when he heard a loud commotion at the front of the plane.  He jumped off his seat and knocked off the magazine that had been on his lap to the floor.  He saw two men yelling and cursing at each other, and a stewardess quickly came out to assess the situation. Festus decided to put on his headphones to block out the noise and listen to music, when suddenly he saw something that shocked him senseless.</span></div></div>",

It all began when Eddie started eyeing his documents. Despite clearing his throat and hinting at Eddie that those were private, the Spider kept irritating him with questions.

The plane took an extreme nose-dive, the engine noise increasing dramatically, whirring turned to grinding as the engines went into overdrive while the pilots most-surely tried to right the craft from its suicidal spinning dive.  Passengers screamed, Justin's briefing documents scattered throughout the cabin, luggage fell from the overhead bins, and the oxygen masks deployed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane buckled and quaked, winds and rain pounding outside, the forces of nature and gravity ultimately shearing the wing from the plane as Justin looked out the nearest window, horrified as the wing ripped free.  The angle and speed of the dive was too much to safely recover from, the bucking forces of the turbulence as determental to righting the craft as everything else.  There was nothing the pilots could do, though they tried their best.  Just when they got the plane near-level, lightning flashed and struck the remaining wing, the fuel tank exploding in a fireball, sending the plane into an unrecoverable roll!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the plane was ripped apart, two huge sections free-falling toward the ocean. <br>\r\nThe cockpit, First-Class and Business-Class at the front of the plane fell harder, faster away while the Coach-Class and tail section caught the rushing winds and slowed slightly in its descent, drifting back away from the front section of wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it wil matter much, falling from 35,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean, somewhere between LA coast and Hawaii, but, which section are you seated in?</span></div></div>",

Terrible screams and shouting were barely audible above the rushing wind and rain. A woman in front of him was screaming at her panicking husband not to take his seatbelt off. Justin never saw what happened to his seatmate, Spider. When the plane broke in two, Spider and the red-headed flight attendant were sucked out into the night sky, never to be seen again. Justin grabbed the oxygen mask and it on his face. At 35,000 feet, he knew that without the oxygen mask on, he would black out. A few people have already passed out from the thin air. It was hard to judge how fast the plane was falling, but Justin knew that once they reached the 10,000 feet mark, the air would be easier to breathe. Justin's mind raced with possible scenarios of how to survive the plane crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew they were somewhere over the ocean, and thanks to his photographic memory, he recalled a lifejacket was stowed under his seat. The slide/raft was actually part of the door near the front. Justin did not want to unbuckle his seat, but someone had to get to the front door and deploy the raft just before the plane hit the water. Justin tried to look down, but the night sky and the ocean were one and it was impossible to discern between the two. He said a quick prayer under his breath, took the oxygen mask off, and wrapped his feet around the seat legs in front of him. He unbuckled his seat belt and crouched down close to the floor, grabbing the seat legs as he made his way up the aisle. It became strangely quiet as they hit the warmer air above the ocean. People have stopped screaming. Most have already passed out. A few were just frozen in their seats, unable to move. Justin knew time was running out and he had to time it exact. Too early, and the raft will go flying out in the sky. Too late will mean a watery grave for those still on the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge fireball exploded in the sky. Justin correctly assumed it was the back half of the plane. It lit up the whole sky, and Justin quickly looked for the ocean through the front door. They were barely a thousand feet away. He shouted to everyone that he will release the emergency exit raft just before the plane hits the water. Justin counted under his breath. He would have to get the raft out when they're barely 100 feet above the ocean. Otherwise it would end up being too far to swim to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman with brown hair and pale freckles in the front row unbuckled her seat belt. She came up behind Justin and grabbed his waist. Justin could feel her hands and arms shaking.  Everyone else remained in their seats, watching Justin. They were too scared to unbuckle their seat belts, and Justin couldn't believe they have already accepted their watery fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to go. Justin closed his eyes and hoped this would work. If not, at least he knew he tried his best. He released the door handle and activated the slide/raft. The slide/raft inflated within two seconds.</span></div></div>",

To Justin, it was just like one of those skydiver films, when one chute deploys and seemingly yanks the person upward and away from the camera at terrific speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the scant seconds before their own impact, they watched the nose of the fuselage smash into the ocean and send a huge spray of water in all directions.  A glint of yellow at the edge of the spray captured their attention; the life raft!  The storm's wild winds had combined with the falling plane's slipstream to carry the life raft almost to the point of impact.  Horrified, they saw the plane tip sideways and directly onto the raft.  Their only hope of rescue was gone!  They slammed into the water and the woman screamed as the waves closed over their heads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin jerked upright.  His heart was racing, he was panting in terror, and his shirt and pants were cold and wet.  He looked around wildly, trying to make sense of his surroundings.  What happened to the plane's disintegration and the plunge to his death in the cold ocean waters?  Then it came to him.  The storm had bounced the plane around in the sky so much, he had taken an anti-nausea pill, then stupidly tossed down half the drink he'd ordered before the turbulence had interfered with in-flight service badly enough to stop it altogether.  The turbulence had bounced the glass out of the tray table's cup-holder and into his lap, weaving itself into the disastrous scenario that had just been a terrifying dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Justin, get a grip! he told himself.  He glanced over at Spider; the man appeared to be sound asleep.  He looked around the rest of the First Class cabin, and saw that, now that the ride had smoothed out, the droning of the plane's jets had finally put everyone else to sleep, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to go the the lavatory and try to get some of the booze out of his shirt and pants, as he had no wish to smell like a bum the rest of the way to Hawaii, unless absolutely necessary.  He climbed carefully over his seatmate, then headed up the aisle.  As he reached the stairway to the upper deck lounge, he paused.  Do I dare?  How long could I look around, before someone shepherded me back downstairs?</span></div></div>",

Why just two days ago, he happened upon his wife's BMW in the parking garage at the Four Seasons in Boston.  That in itself isn't so bad, but just 2 days before that she had left for the airport telling Tom she was meeting a group of women at a spa in Sedona.  Tom had parked his Lexus in the same garage with permission from the chief valet who worked out at Fit-Corp with Tom. They had a similar schedule and often spotted each-other in the weight room and even played a bit of racket ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard was a large African American and saw Tom coming through the lobby.  \"Hey Tom, we workin it out today?\"<br>\r\n\"Not likely Bern, whats with that Beemer on Level One in preferred parking?\" Tom asked. <br>\r\nBernard looked at Tom with dark eyes and eyebrows heading southerly and said, \"Well, let's see, that fine automobile belongs to the general managers newest squeeze and let me tell you..\"  \"That's all I needed to know Benard, thank you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom started running for the front desk, Bernard had to stop him and almost throw him into the street.  \"Wait a goddam minute Tom, this is my job you fuckin with, now tell me what the fuck is up an I will help you make it right but don't come in my hotel and start thinkin of bustin shit up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine Bernard, let go of my neck and I will explain, deal?\"  Tom asked, barely able to speak through the stranglehold.

She looked at them intently, trying to overhear what the younger man was saying, but her own thoughts intruded and kept her from really focusing on the outside world. She could not stop imagining the smell of the orchids and pineapple juice she knew would attack her nostrils the moment she stepped off the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could almost taste the sweet yellow liquid as she sipped from the paper cups the airport offered to it's guests. She would hold it in her mouth for a moment and then let it slid slowly down her throat savoring every drop. This made her think of the plate lunch she intended to buy the moment she got her rental car. She would head off for Grace's Lunch wagon the only intended stop, on the drive to Coco Head and the house. His house. No! It was her house now and her new life. A new life in familiar territory. Free of chaos and the hectic lifestyle she had lived since she graduated from the University of Hawaii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if she still retained the distinction of a local, which was quite prestigious for a haole. She tried to remember how you spelled the Hawaiian word for it, K A M A I N A? or was it K A M A M H I N A? Neither was right, but she didn't recall if she ever knew how to spell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her to realize she had a crossword puzzle in her bag and she decided to avoid anymore thoughts of the island she grew up on by diving deep into the puzzle or maybe even some Sudoku. She loved numbers, and numbers were how she made her living since college as the head accountant for a law firm on the mainland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, considering all that her father had left her, the house, the cars, and the money, she would never have to do anything again except count and manage her inheritance. She was set for the rest of her life, you would think she would be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would the rest of her life bring? Would it include Victor or should she seek out someone new? Should the whole slate be cleared? Should she rid herself once and for all from the control he had over her mind and body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man the kid across the aisle was talking to looked interesting. Maybe she should start up a conversation with him; he seemed disinterested in the conversation which had been forced upon him. Maybe she should just pull out the Sudoku puzzle and spend the next 5 hours oblivious to the others on the plane. Why would the man be interested in talking to her anyway. He didn't know her from Adam and probably didn't care to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason despite the fact that men always seemed more than interested in Helen, she herself did not feel attractive. This made Helen even more attractive to men. She did not see or hear what they saw or heard. She did not understand why anyone found her special in any way, especially Victor. Victor who had it all. A great law practice, a lot of money, a beautiful wife and daughter and Helen, who was there everytime he beckoned her. Yes, Victor. She knew Victor was her biggest mistake thus far in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her bag and removed the Sudoku puzzle book and promptly dropped her pencil on the floor of the plane and it rolled toward the men she had been watching.</span></div></div>",

Spider broke the moment of ideal silence, \"Yo, Helen, the name's Spider, but you can call me whatever you want.\"  Justin could not believe that people actually said things like that in real life and burst out into laughter.  His new, not so refined, airplane pal was one of the cheesiest people he'd ever met.

Or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Justin cleared his throat and spoke to her once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looked over and smiled at him. <i>He is really cute.</i> \"Hey,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're heading to Hawaii too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you been before?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll love it. Beautiful beaches, great night life,\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled back at her, \"Sounds like you've been before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could show me around?\" he suggested. His eyes sparkled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Helen could answer, a rather loud snore, which came from the middle seat, startled both of them. It was Spider who apparently had fallen asleep and was now shocking most of the passengers in the near vicinity with occasional, but for a tired, over-worked scientist like Justin, much too frequent breathing vibrations. The next one sounded a bit like a very tiny chainsaw, which one would use to cut a branch in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin, fascinated and a bit concerned at the same time, was just about to put his hand on Spider's shoulder to wake him up, Helen quickly but gently grabbed Justin's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Let him sleep.\", Helen said. \"... At least we won't have to hear him talking then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin smiled. It was hard for him to keep it that way, since he was fighting the urge to let out a more noisy laughter. So, he just nodded to her and said: \"You're right... He is somewhat of a big talker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh... I mean, don't get me wrong. People like that do have their charms, but all in moderation I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Feels like, he has been talking to me for hours, but we've only been in the air for about half an hour, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I couldn't help but overhear some of it. I was sitting here, thinking 'Shut up and give the other man a chance to participate in the talk'... Anyway, you asked, if I could show you around on Hawaii, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes, I did.\", Justin confirmed. But just as he had spoken the words, he thought of Betty. He hadn't called her, since he read that note, and now this woman who was standing and chatting with him had enchanted him completely, although just for a few seconds. But then he thought to himself: <i>I don't need to feel bad about this. All, I did, was ask for a tour guide, and Lord only knows, I could use someone who isn't hyper focused on work for Ararat to show me around in my spare time. This is, after all, hopefully going to be more vacation than work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is a lot to see on Hawaii...\", Helen said after a short pause. \"... But sure. Do you have anything in mind, in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin thought about it for a while but couldn\u2019t come up with anything. The truth was, as a scientist, studying Immunology, he had never really taken an interest in a lot of new places nor had he bothered to go anywhere special. It just occurred to him now that maybe, this was one of his shortcomings with Betty. He thought of her note again. It flashed before his inner eye. <i>\u201cSorry I was so hard on you. Good luck in Hawaii.\u201d</i> Was this reconciliation? Regardless, he knew, he had to call her as soon as he got to the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d, Helen asked politely. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet for a while. Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin snapped out of his thoughts, as if he had just been awakened by a sergeant, throwing cold water in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, eh\u2026 Yah, right! I\u2026 eh. It\u2019s just. Apart from having looked forward to go to Honolulu for over a year, I haven\u2019t actually given it that much thought, as to what I in fact wanted to see.\u201d Justin chuckled with a just slightly awkward smile on his face. \u201cHonestly, I am just glad, I get to clear my head from work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, that\u2019s okay.\u201d, she said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut hey\u201d, Justin continued. \u201cyou know the Island, I suppose. Maybe you just pick something, we could see? I trust your judgment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. What is your name, by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin. Justin Avery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen. Helen Garner. Nice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't hesitating on purpose, wasn't displaying a face that said, \"I don't know, if that would be worth our time.\" In fact, he was still somewhat nonplussed that a woman of Helen's beauty would not only talk with him, but volunteer to give him a sightseeing tour.  Eventually, he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great! I've come across references to it in movies and books, so it'll be fantastic to see it live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled.  So far, so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's settled, then. Perhaps we can visit one of the restaurants on Kuhio Avenue afterward.

Every few minutes, one or the other of them would glance over at Spider.  Each time, they were pleased to see that he appeared to have slipped into a deeper slumber.  His snores still filled the area, but at least they had decreased in frequency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jetliner continued on its southwest heading, indifferent to Spider's snoring and heedless of the activity just beginning at the rear of the coach section.</span></div></div>",

The perfect chance, I considered, to investigate the carry on luggage. I was intrigued as to what was in the bag that was stored beneath the aircraft. The corriders were surprisingly wide and I was comfortable in my search. After an exhausting stroll from one end of the plane to the other end, I discovered a miniature set of stairs that led to the underbelly of the aircraft. I slowly inched my way down and had no problem finding the luggage in question. Shocking! There was no locking device on it. I opened the zipper. <br>\r\n\"Miss?\" I jerked my head toward the sound. It was a small child I had talked to on the tarmac. \"Are we in trouble?\" She inched toward me, her eyes wide. Inside the luggage, my fingers had detected a faint vibration. I winked at the child to stay my own fears as well as hers. I glanced down into the luggage. There was definitely some type of electrical device. <br>\r\n\"Come here,\" I whispered to the child. She obediently moved toward me. I glanced quickly all around  until my eyes locked onto one of the emergency parachutes that were placed randomly throughout the aircraft. <br>\r\nShe would never have a chance if she had to dive from an aircraft in motion. But if there was an explosion and the aircraft lost its forward motion, the child might have a chance of survival. I locked the tiny chute around the even tinier body. Wordlessly, she nodded as if she understood and stood very still at the emergency door I placed her in front of. I looked directly at the chute cord. I held up each finger on one hand and mouthed slowly, \"One...Two...Three..\" while my other hand tightened on the cord of her parachute. She nodded with each count. At \"five\" I pressed her fingers against the metal ring of the chute-pull and she nodded quickly and repeatedly. As I looked away to mentally challenge my next step, \"BOOOOM!!!\" The little girl was instantly sucked out of my grasp and out the vacuum of the emergency door as it blew out. I witnessed the child as she nodded each count to \"Five\" and pulled hard. My heart soared as the red, white, and blue silk unfolded in brillant declaration of rescue. The little girl looked directly at me, her tiny hand, now empty, opened and closed her fingers in her grateful goodbye.</span></div></div>",

I frequently went out for a drink so I took out the yellow pages and immediately say Delight\" , a bar for the curious\"  525 Michael Street.<br>\r\nIt was 9pm by this time so I threw on a clean t shirt, brushed my teeth ,checked my face for stubble and then headed out. I park my car in the back of the apartment building so I took the service elevator down the 10 stories.  Living in a city such as Minneapolis gave me the opportunity to use public transportation but I have always enjoyed driving my old<br>\r\nCadillac ,a relic  from the past.  It started easily and I eased it out into traffic.   MIchael Street was a main street in a area we called \"the  dolls and dives\" which may say it all. It wasn't an area I went to often . <br>\r\n   Delights was  there as promised, lit up by neon signs with flags on the sign . That was kind of strange for a  club I thought. But I was feeling a little adventurous. The  yellow pages had said\"for the curious\" and I was.<br>\r\n   I parked my old beauty about a block away and carefully waked . <br>\r\nEntering the club I noticed a faint smell of incense.  I wondered if this was to cover up someone smoking weed or what else could it be?<br>\r\nI was immediately approached by a tall , very slender blonde-haired woman. <br>\r\n\"Hello.Welcome to Delight\"<br>\r\nOh brother I probably have walked into a pickup bar or  an outright  Madam's bar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" I replied \" I just  stopped in for a beer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we can start there. Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed toward the middle of a large dark room that had many candle on many tables. But they were tall candles ,like dinner candles and they were mostly black.  I was curious why  but just kept looking. I also noticed folders on the tables. I wondered if this was a resturant?<br>\r\n\"Do you serve food here?\"  I asked.<br>\r\nShe giggled and almost started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we could if you really wanted that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then I was becoming worried...black candles, menus on the tables that probably weren't for food choices.

Why would you ask about my parents?\" Justin's face turned white and, for the briefest moment, his mask of complacency slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I, ugh. Sorry. It's just, everyone on this flight seems to be with someone. You know, partners or parents, and you don't look that old, so I just guessed parents. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight attendant broke up their conversation, and Jessica breathed a handful of deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duty free? Would you like perfume, cigarettes, alcohol?\" The attendant smiled and pointed to her display trolley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jessica and Justin said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the attendant walked away, Jessica leaned in toward Justin and said, \"That stuff might be duty free, but it's still way more than I can afford. Did you see that Black Opium? $68! It's a shame because it's my favourite. But that's ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Justin smiled, his amber eyes flashed fire. Nodding, he replied, \"It's daylight robbery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence followed that made Jessica feel uncomfortable. She was about to ask him about his family, then remembered her faux pas with his parents and thought better of it. In the end, she squeezed past him and said, \"Excuse a moment. I'm just going to the rest room.\" He didn't move; didn't make way for her to exit her seat. She was acutely aware that her butt almost touched him in a place she didn't want to touch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queue for the toilet relaxed her a little. It was the first time she had ever been glad of such a queue on an aeroplane. She guessed ten minutes must have passed by the time she got back to her seat. While she was gone, she had tried to find a list of conversation topics to make the flight more bearable: music, TV shows, sports, pets, work. She wanted to speak to him. She had been raised to always be polite and not upset other people. But there was something about this guy. She couldn't put her finger on it. His dark red hair brought out the colour of his huge, almond shaped eyes. Yes, he was good looking. But something just seemed . . . <i>off</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I reacted badly when you mentioned my parents,\" he said, before she had a chance to refasten her seatbelt. \"It's bit of a difficult subject for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin prickled as she looked at him. \"Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry I said the wrong thing. Just forget\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents died. Eighteen months ago. There was an accident and, umm, I survived, but they didn't.\" She followed his gaze to his lap, where he was absentmindedly scratching the back of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. That's terrible. Let's talk about something else, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my fault. I did nothing wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, so we are going to talk about this. Great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a scientist, you see. My work involves experiments that involve chemicals. I can't really speak about my actual work; it's top secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I don't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an experiment that had the potential to be explosive. I urged my parent to stay away from the house. But they didn't.\" He snapped his head up to face Jessica. \"Oh, you're probably wondering why I was conducting the experiment at home. It had to be that way. That's really all I can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded and a strand of chestnut-coloured hair fell across her face. She watched Justin flinch and, for a horrible second, she thought he was going to move it away for her. She leaned against the window, her heart pounding in her chest. The more this guy spoke, the less attractive he became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I saying? Oh yes. They shouldn't have been at home, but they never listened to me. Never! And so, they came home just as everything went wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her hand in front of her mouth, Jessica tried to hide her horror. \"They died? Oh my God. Were you injured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head twitched and she sensed that, once again, she had said the wrong thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't there. I knew what could happen. They shouldn't have been there either. Well, they won't disobey me again, will they?\" He let out a laugh, then looked back to Jessica; deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the age of 15 they eventually died and I had to spend the rest of my days back at my house, hungry and misrable. My life had taken a turn to the worst, so I had to walk about 100 miles to my Grandma's. I told her the news and she took me under her wing. A year ago she died aswell, leaving me all her possesions, as I was the only person left in my family.

You don't have a boyfriend to love, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica froze in her seat, moved by the tale, beliving every word. Eventually, she spoke up, saying \"No... Listen, I am staying in my holiday home, you can visit if you like? I will make you feel at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank You\" Said Justin, wiping away his sinful tear.

Such cruelty and disrespect for human life was a threat to national security, growing more intense every minute that it was allowed to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Jessica continued to walk up the aisle with the pretense that she was searching for a friend who got a seat mumber that was far away from hers.

Now for the hard part, tracking the target through the plane, and out into the airport, with no support on the ground yet. Her backup would be flying coach on the next flight, which would take quite awhile, so she had to work on her own. The doors opened, but one was specifically opened for the target and his crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had only two choices: Go through the door with the other first-class flyers and hope to catch up with him, or try to blend to penetrate the cover of the infamous, international gangster.</span></div></div>",

There were tapestries on the walls and heavy brocade curtains at the french doors (or were they just doors here) onto the tiny balcony.  The carpet was thick and luxurious and reminded her of the scene from Die Hard where Bruce Willis learns to make fists with his toes.  She heaved a sigh.  No time for that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slung her battered carry on bag onto the hand-stitched, quilted bed-spread and thumbed the tumblers of the combination lock.  Flipping the bag open she pondered her options.  In the bag she had a small but specialised make-up kit; a black lycra cat suit, complete with mask and gloves; a lightweight crumple-resistant business suit, hopelessly crumpled; the indispensible little black cocktail dress; a pair of stylish black pumps, with a reinforced titanium low-rise spike heel; a couple of changes of basic underwear; a set of seduction lingerie including regular and fishnet stockings; a coil of light but strong silk rope and basic toiletries.

She stood for a moment in her bra and panties, looking at herself in the dresser mirror.  With one hand she scrunched her hair up on top of her head, cocking it to one side.  Hmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped, letting her head settle and listening in case anyone had heard.  There were rodents scratching in the walls, but no sign of people.  Better make the most of the opportunity then.  Lurch, scrape, stab.  Lurch, scrape, stab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 17 agonising lurches to get close enough to the bread slicer to get her ropes to the blade.  Getting the ropes moving across the blade was no easy feat either, but after a couple of minutes struggle she was free.  She rubbed her wrists and ankles to get the circulation flowing again and looked around.  At one end of the warehouse was a large freight door, with a smaller access door cut into it at ground level.  At the other end there were two doors; one marked EXIT in large green letters, the other marked OFFICE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill rubbing her wrists, she headed for the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a short moment of listening to near silence, with only the sound of a rickety old ceiling fan turning overhead, she determined that the office was empty, void of any living soul. The handle rattled in her touch but it opened without much more effort than a twist and cautious push. All the while, she made ready to defend herself should her judgement prove wrong, a palm open on her free hand to catch anything that might be thrown at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, her stroke of luck continued. There was nobody here.... or least, no one alive. On the floor laid two men dressed in expensive suits, faced upwards with their eyes closed, each wearing her enemy's badge upon the lapels of their crumpled jackets. Most likely that they might have been her guards, which explains why she woke up alone and unguarded. From the looks of it, there was no blood, only a violent struggle from how tossed over the room seemed. A quick step over and tap of fingers upon their necks confirmed her suspicions. No pulse. Dead for at least a few hours. Whoever did them in was a highly skilled unarmed combatant, considering the visible damage on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath of the scene confused her. If this was a rescue mission, the Agency must have completely forgotten about her. Perhaps one of Reimmere's enemies? A rival? Another organisation? Whatever it was, they certainly did not seem to have any interest in her. Turning her attention elsewhere, Jessica set her eyes around the room and immediately discovered the nearest window smashed open. The fire escape outside the window was simply in clear view for her to make her exit out of the building and onto the street, as if left there in plain sight for her convenience. Turning again, she looked for anything that might help to make sense over what was happening, but there simply did not seem to be much. There were a lot of things messed around in the drawers, evidence that someone had definately been looking for something. She did manage to find out from a ledger that Reimmere used this old bakery warehouse to smuggle in some very compromising materials. It'll prove useful once the Agency finally puts him behind bars. Besides all the fluttering paperwork everywhere, she also managed to find a map with some post-its plastered onto it in the far wall of the room. Instinctively thinking there might be something there, she took a close look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a map of Europe, covered in little dots as if there had been a lot of things pinned onto it. One point had a post-it on it, marked by bright red pins, reading clearly in English: \"Delivery\". It looks like Reimmere might have an interest in delivering something to a certain city in Spain. Might be worth checking out, but then again, considering how much time she was out, Reimmere could still by in Paris....</span></div></div>",

She would have been even more stiff and sore if it had been longer, and she'd be a lot hungrier.  Not that she wasn't hungry.  These guys couldn't have been dead all that long either, or their own people would have found them and she wouldn't have woken up alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then, chances were Reimm\u00e8re was still in Paris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, even if that note was a genuine signpost to a genuine delivery, there was no indication of timing and no guarantee that the white-haired psychopath would go to oversee it personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lost her purse and her carry-on, and along them her credit cards, cash, passport and phone.  At least they'd left her her clothes and her shoes.  She winced as another stab of pain jabbed through her head.  First things first, water and aspirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore down the pin-holed map and rolled it up, taking care to keep the post-it in its place.  She tucked it and the ledger under her arm and made for the door marked EXIT.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously shoving it open, she found it opened onto a concrete-paved yard, surrounded by a chain-link fence.  Beyond the fence was the dingy underbelly of Paris.  Every major city has one.  The gates were closed and locked, of course, but a line of links near the gate had been recently cut, presumably by the assassin or assassins who had killed her guards.  Right now Jessica wasn't complaining - it saved her from having to climb the damn fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouldered her way through the fence, turned to note the warehouse number, then looked up and down the street to get her bearings.  To her left the street ran slightly downhill toward what looked like might be a river.  To the right the street rose gently toward a road that was moderately populated with heavy traffic - trucks and vans of various sizes and the occasional car or motorcycle courier.  There were no pedestrians to be seen in either direction, nor any shops, restaurants, or homes.  Nowhere likely to offer water and painkillers.  She'd just have to guess which way to go and try her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set off in what she hoped was the direction toward a more salubrious and accommodating part of town.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From her short session on desert training in Iraq back in her Academy days, she had been drilled on never wanting to see one of these highly venomous snakes even from a distance; yet, here it was inches before her. As she wriggled on her side in the sand, she realized why her back was so stiff; she was sitting in a chair on her side with her hands tied behind her and her feet bound to the chair's legs. The snake's hissing grew louder as it loomed closer and her chances of escaping it grew more futile, until a Desert Eagle owl flew down and snatched it away for its lunch. Recently returned from the edge of her death, she squinted at the image of the eagle flying away with the snake in its claws and felt that she should spend a moment of silence thanking her small percentage of Aztec ancestors and their currently convenient beliefs. \"Thank you, Great-Aunt Raquel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she thought of her immediate escape and slowly stretched her hands into the back pocket of her jacket where her wallet was. Feeling around behind her back, she found the slot where her credit cards were and slipped out her library card. Jessica had not stayed in one city long enough to visit a library nor had much time for casual reading. She had carefully glued a razor blade, so small that it passes metal detectors and the grimy hands of Mafiosos yet still sharp enough to slice rope or possibly even necks, to the bottom of the card. This she slipped out and slowly tore the knots around her hands to shreds. The ones around her ankles fell similarly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, she looked at the outward, sweeping, circular contrails in the sand and concluded that she had been dropped from a low-flying helicopter. After methodically loosening the crick in her back and thinking about the Desert Eagle owl's close swoop, she added that she had also probably been laying unconscious and still for at least a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sand cleared out of her hair and pockets and her wallet back inside her jacket pocket (the thugs had even left the money; they must be well-disciplined), she looked in all directions and saw nothing but sand dunes for miles. Blocking some of the sun from her eyes with her hand, she looked up at the hot sun and knew that she needed to find shelter soon. She whipped out her cell phone to try to make a report to the Agency and to try and get help. Her International Dialing Plan would work here, but she had a horrible habit of forgetting to charge the phone. As it dialed, she prayed that it had enough charge left for just one call...</span></div></div>",

He had used the secret code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps I could show you around, can you hail us a cab?\".  Her words were quick and emotionless.

The boy giggled back nervously.<br>\r\nHe began tapping away at the computer, Jessica glanced around. Phil was still at the checking in desk and there were still no bodyguards to be seen, she was safe. For now.<br>\r\n\"Miss Remmiere?\" Her attention snapped back to the porter, \"your father is in Suite 101, thats on floor 5. He has asked for no distubance this evening, but he is having breakfast at The Lily tomorrow at 8am.\" <br>\r\n\"That's fantastic thank you.\" Jessica leant down and kissed the boy on the cheek. At that she sauntered away, making sure she swayed her hips for him to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're room 206, Level 6.\" Phil joined Jessica in the queue for the elevators.<br>\r\n\"Target is one level below but he's not leaving the hotel tonight. Breakfasting tomorrow. We have time. Plus back up will be here by then, we will send them straight to the restaurant.\" Jess didn't look up at Phil, she was dreading spending the evening in the same room as him if she was honest. They hadn't been alone together since before the divorce and Jessica didn't feel like being alone with him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside room 206, Phil put the luggage down and went to make the call to back up, telling them of their plans so Jessica decided she needed a much longed for shower. She stripped down to her underwear, grabbed a towel and closed the en-suite bathroom door. Once inside, she turned on the shower, hot water blasting from the showerhead, filling the bathroom with steam. She sighed, she could relax a little now. Taking her underwear off, she stepped into the hot water, letting it run all over her body and through her hair. Bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rubbing herself dry, Jessica wrapped the towel tightly around her body, she couldn't risk it coming off in front of Phil, even though he had seen her naked (and made her naked) plenty of times in the past, she didn't want him thinking she was comfortable with him. Then she proceeded to make her way back into the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Hide the bag and lie. She boldly put her novel down(page was well marked) and stode up to the flight attendant, apparently talking with the man who's checking bags and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, ma'am?\" that got her attention. She blinked at her and responded, in a rather jerky sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how can I help?\" she asked as she pointed to the girl's bag, the smoke that was attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard earlier that the man was planting something in the poor girl's bag. I did hear it before I was shown to my seat,\" she said, and done it with conviction. The flight attendant blinked at her and motioned for the man to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This woman says that she overheard someone planting the smoke bomb in the girl's bag. Should I?\" the flight attendant asked as the man shook his head. Apparently, Jessica noted, that there were people who has the appearence of an agrumentive nature. And she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt the conviction of her words. I don't foresee...\" he began and sure enough, an argument was shortly about to follow of who's right and who's wrong. Perfect. Jessica took the girl's bag, take the bomb and planted it in the man's bag when everyone was focused on the argument. By the time the yells died down, she went back to her seat. 17a. Yawned, she buried the bag, the girl's bag, into her case and continued to read. However, she wasn't that discreet enough. The man saw her, and glared at her, as though he was reading 'traitor!' across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, nice show. You did it to divert everyone's attention away so that you can hide the bag. What do you have to say for yourself?\" the man asked, his coolness clearly indicated.

She needed to get this kill, after all she had been through over the past few months, her work had really suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gone back to his seat now, and Jessica got to thinking. Only a few months earlier, she was top of her game, the best assassin in the whole team, and everyone knew it. She was flying high when another of life's winners joined the team. She was sensationally beautiful, 5\"9 with jet black, glossy hair and the most piercing blue eyes that had the ability to bore into your soul and know exactly what you were feeling. Lucy Diamond captivated Jessica from the very first moment she clapped eyes on her, and there began a whirlwind romance. The two top killers were also the two top lovers, matching each other on every level and Jessica was completely smitten, head over heels in love. For four fabulous months, they worked and played together, and Jess was happier than she could ever remember being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until she came home from an assignment a day early. She pushed open the door, the roses and champagne meant as a treat for her girl. Well, the bottle turned into the weapon she used on the sickening pig she found with his hands all over Lucy, and the roses were flung at her, as she was thrown out of the door, in just her bra and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Jessica had fallen to pieces, hardly working and putting off speaking to anyone. This was only her second assignment after she had come back. Lucy, of course, was desperate to work with her again - it was all a mistake, she still loved Jessica, if she could only have one more chance, she would prove it. The problem was, Jessica was still mad about Luce and she knew she couldn't resist. Only, now, she was faced with a choice. Jess couldn't do anything now that the plane was taxiing down the runway, it would be too dangerous. She would have to take him out at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other marker at the airport in Paris was Lucy, there in case Jessica failed to secure the target before take-off. Jessica had to decide - should she get a message to Lucy, telling her she needed her help in Paris, or should she risk the target getting away, so she wouldn't have to see her again?</span></div></div>",

She could easily bag her target and disappear in the winding streets of Paris.  She just needed to map her plans more carefully before the plane reached the Charles de Gaulle Airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her well worn novel and began to twirl her fingers in the strands of her hair.  The marked up novel was actually her plan b.  No one would ever guess the underlined words were instructions and cue words for the stealthy assasin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was honest with herself, deciding to bag the guy on her own was exactly the thing she needed to get back on her game.  The debacle with Lucy totally obliterated the small shred of trust she had.  She had forgotten the first rule of being an assasin 'trust no one.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan formulated in Jessica's mind perfectly.  She knew the man's kind nature would play to her benefit.   Jessica searched her tote for her stationary and pen.  She penned a quick note to the man in 15b, folded it twice and wrote 'The Man in 15b' in on the top.  She smiled a sweet, cloying smile and asked the people to pass the note to the man.  It was a little high-schoolish but Jessica threw in a blush and a nervous twist in her hair to give the impression she was smitten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him intensely as he opened the note.  He read it and smiled. But it wasn't the smile she expected.  It was sinister.  Not what she expected.   He scrawled something on her note and passed the note back.  Jessica's eyes never left his cool stare. His eyes were the oddest shade of violet she had ever seen.  But it wasn't the color that threw her off, it was something else, something dark, yet something she knew she could identify with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the note, her worst fear came to reality.  The note said: \"I know who you are and what you do.  Care to play cat and mouse?\"  She had never had her cover blown before!  Now she was in danger.  She knew she should make that call to Lucy, but that wasn't going to happen.  She had never backed down from a challenge.   She was either going to make sure he never left the plane or take him down in the Paris airport.  </span></div></div>",

Jessica grabbed a parachute.<br>\r\n       The plane, at the moment, was the most dangerous thing you could imagine. There was turbulence; people were panicking, against the wishes of the pilot and the attendants. A man, an assassin's current target, was standing during this turbulence, heading towards an innocent little girl. A woman was grabbing a parachute, with flight attendants ceaselessly attempting to persuade her to return to her seat. Attendants were getting shoved by the woman. <br>\r\n       Jessica began to put the parachute on, but a man's voice and a child's squeal caught her fleeting attention. \"Hey you, Little Miss Assassin Chick!\" The man called. Jessica disliked the stupid derogatory remark made by her target. Jessica's eyes widened when he saw the girl, hanging by her shirt collar from the locked fist of the man. <br>\r\n       \"If you don't put down your parachute right now, the girl goes bye-bye!\" He yelled. Jessica looked at the beautiful hazel eyes of the little girl. Any other time someone would call them beautiful. But right now, they were filled, a hundred percent, with fear. Jessica was an assassin. She was used to death, threats, and death threats. She had no problem killing, or others being killed.

It appeared that they were \"in love\" or something. He didn't care, he just wished they'd shut up. Then, she seemed to put a fist in his stomach, now they were finally getting interesting, but the man just drooped down. He was dead. Somehow, she'd killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica noticed that there was a little boy sitting behind her with his mouth hanging open. It appeared that he had seen what she had done. When she looked at him, he averted his eyes. He definitely knew. Still, he was just a kid maybe no one would believe him.</span></div></div>",

In a matter of minutes they were in the air and cruising steadily at a high altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to feel very warm.  She wasn't nervous but rather concerned.  If this mission failed, she might not be able to stay with the company.  Making sure this guy was killed was the only way she could stay.  Normally, she would play the role of the spotter but lately she had been itching to perform the kill.  She had already called her people and informed them to meet her at the next airport.  But if she succeeded in performing the deed before they landed, it would put her in a very high light in the eyes of the directors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up in her seat and looked over her shoulder at the man who at that same moment caught her eye.  He knew she was looking at her but he didn't know why.  She cocked her head to the side indicating the lavatories and he nodded his head in agreement.  He slowly stood up and made his way to the bathroom.  She watched which bathroom he entered, waited a few minutes, then got out of her seat and made her way to the back.  She knocked once and he opened the door so she could squeeze herself in with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what he expected but was planning on something very different.  She needed to perform a quiet kill so as not to alert the crew and to give her time to distance herself from the victim.  He was getting nervous so she kissed him hard on the lips while waiting for her moment.  Suddenly over the loudspeaker, however, she heard the pilot voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention passengers, unfortunately, we are approaching a very large storm that we are unable to pass around.  Turbulence is expected to be very rocky and I am asking all passengers to return to their seats and buckle.  The seatbelt sign is between turned on as we speak.

Above Jessica's head a hatch flew open and almost hit her in the face but all it did was give her an idea. Taking the gun from her target's side holster and sliding it into the back of her jeans and taking the knife between her teeth, Jessica gripped onto the opening of the hatch and began to hoist herself up. If she could find a way back into the passenger bay and back to her seat then no one would be none the wiser. A bang on the toilet door told her she didn't have much time. Kicking her legs up, Jessica shimmied herself through the hatch. Once she was inside, she leant down and pulled the hatch closed, to leave no trace of her being there.<br>\r\nNow she was in the top part of the plane and she had to find a way back down. The plane had seemed to settle now so Jessica was able to steady herself. Glancing around she decided to slip down into another hatch, hoping it lead into another bathroom cubicle. Then she could clean herself up and leave as if she had just used the toilet. Crawling over to one hatch she slowly lowered it down but quickly shut it again when she saw the top of bald guys head, he was sat on the loo and she definately didn't want to lower herself into there. <br>\r\nLowering the next hatch, Jessica found the cubicle empty and smiled to herself. Her escape. Putting her legs over the edge, she lowered herself cautiously down into the cubicle, one foot on the sink and the other on the toilet seat. Once she was down, she locked the cubicle, as if she had been in there the whole time. She quietly shut the hatch behind her, straightned her clothes and washed her hands and face. Perfect.<br>\r\nSafely back in her seat, Jessica allowed herself to glance over her shoulder at the toilet cubicle that held her dead target, there were now two hostess's in front of it, one of them was putting their ear to the door while the other one was whispering to her. Jessica smirked to herself. They would be landing soon and no one would know what she had done. She hadn't planned on killing the target right there on the plane but she had been left no choice, besides she had completed the kill. Her 200th kill to be precise.<br>\r\nPulling out her blackberry she punched in a message and clicked send.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTARGET SECURED. BULLSEYE.</span></div></div>",

Jessica got in one, hauling her suitcase in after her and gave the name of her hotel to the driver, the one she would be staying in until the morning to catch her delayed connecting flight to Paris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, from the states are you?\" The taxi driver said to her smuggly, as though he had just produced the answer to a very difficult sum.

She paid the driver, the strange bank notes she had changed her dollars for seemed odd, like they were not real money. She was trying to mentally calculate the exchange rates in her head but it made her feel irritated so she handed him one of the notes and told him to keep the change. He seemed pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel, to match its surroundings was another grey and fairly nondescript building, the something lodge, she made out through the drizzle, shivering in her thin jacket.

She cleared her throat, now even more uncomfortable having lost control of her own vocal cords, \"Yes, that's all, thanks.\"<br>\r\n  \"Of course.\" the receptionist replied gruffly. Jessica swore the woman was almost sneering at her.  She shifted her bags and stumbled out of the foyer.<br>\r\n  So much for Mary Poppins.  Weren't the British supposed to be jovial, dancing about, musical types?  Struggling down the halls searching for her room, she wasn't sure if she could stomach eighteen hours of caustic foreigners.  Rounding the corner she tripped over a man passed out in the hallway.  She lost grip of her largest bag and it landed dead center of his stomach.<br>\r\n  \"Oh!  I'm so sorry!  Are you alright?\"  Jessica said dropping the remainder of her bags.  The man hadn't flinched when the bag fell on him.  She wondered if he was dead.  The image of her behind bars for murder in an alien country made her stomach sink.  She lowered herself to her knees and began desperately shaking the man.<br>\r\n  \"Please don't be dead.  Wake up!\" <br>\r\n  Finally giving him a firm smack across his cheek the man came to.  He sluggishly lifted his head trying to focus.<br>\r\n  \"What the blimey hell is wrong with you?\" he spat.  No, he hadn't fallen down, not unless it was into a liquor bottle.  His acrid breath filled Jessica's nose.  It smelled of vomit and bourbon.  Great. A drunk.  This was the sort of people she'd have the pleasure of sharing board with.  <br>\r\n  \"Look, I'm sorry.\" she said grabbing her bags once more.  Feeling contaminated, she coughed trying to clear her nostrils.  She turned to proceed down the hall only to realized her room was right in front of her. <br>\r\n  It just keeps getting better, she thought to herself.  <br>\r\n  Eager to be in her room and away from the hazy eyes of the drunkard, she fished for her room key.  She jammed it in the lock and swung the door open.  Jessica tossed her bags in the room like men in a fish market, then quickly slammed and bolted her door.  The room itself was sheathed in tacky flowers and nauseating english countryside tapestry.  <br>\r\n  That's it!  She would first clean the film of bourbon from her face, then she was finding the nearest pub.  And hopefully she would pass out on her own bed and not next to the drunk in the hall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica was really hungry and wanted to relax. She threw her largest bag of luggage onto the bed and started searching for that \"just right\" dress to make her stand out in a dark pub. If she was going out, she was going to make it memorable. She dug to the bottom under the stack of pink apparel to match the mood of Paris. She did not want to wear pink now. She was look for the purple go-go boots and the matching 60's style dress that cuts up to her thigh. She pulled out the dress and decided it needed to be ironed. No porlbme there, she knew every place in London had to have one. In England she wanted to stay in bed and breakfast not this place. The least they could have done was have modeled the room after a Lora Ashley design. She ran to the closet and presto, there was an iron. She plugged it in in the bathroom and returned to get her boots dugg out. Now which bag was her shoes in. Oh yeah,In the little on next to the foot of the bed. Her boots where her most prized possession. They were purple suede and had pointed toes and nine inch heels. They went to her knees and zipped up the back. She had black hoes to match the purple, white and black swirled dress. She pressed it in a moment and dashed the dress and the boots on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was about to exit the room with her purse in toe her cell phone ran. No now she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the phone she had just pulled out of her purse. The LCD screen read Sarah, her friend back home. Originally, she was from Houston. In fact, she had just returned to check on the damage to her parents home from the recent hurricane to come through. She had bought their house for them and let them pay her rent ever since their adjustable rate mortgage had gone up with the latest intrest rate hike. She was greatful to help out but wanted to get the house payed off to atart her own life. Ever since graduating with her civil engineering degree and moving away from home, two mortgages was not her idea of a happy, healthy life. So she rented.  Sarah knew buying her mom's house was a good investment, and that her parents relied on her, yet she felt a little trapped. Jessica had recently had to talk her into staying saying that in July it would be her two year anniversary at the firm and that meant an 8 percent raise. It had delayed her urgency to move back home. Jessica feared that her return to Houston now would renew her resolve to go home and stay. Jessica dreaded answering it for that reason but bit the bullet and said, \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jessica, how is Paris,\" squealed from the other end of the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good try Sarah, but I am in London.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"London.\" she screamed. \"What happened? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too long a story for an overseas connections. I am just going out to find a pub and get a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for an Irish pub like our Paddy Malone's,\" said Sarah with a tinge of jeaoulsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I guess that would be correct but finding an Irish pub in England is a little wierd. I think just a pub is what I am looking for. Maybe all pub here have hard cider. I don't think just Ireland has that lable. I may want a Guinness anyway. Can you help me? I don't have internet here and feel lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Sarah said. She pulled out her lap top and fired it up. \"Your in London right. Any preferences?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a historic spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Sarah continued. She went to ixquick.com and typed in English pub. A link popped up saying traditional and historic pubs guide at pubs.com. \"I think I found a place.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Sarah, you are saving me a ton of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the Royal Oak at 44 Tabard Street,  Borough, London. Is reads, 'It seems that time has stood still at Harvey's Royal Oak, the Sussex brewer's lone foray into 'The Smoke'; their range of gorgeous ales a treat for Londoners. This almost plain, classic, two roomed corner pub has a Public and Lounge bar, separated by a former off-sales counter, once commonplace in Victorian urban pubs.' I think I want to go. Oh, the crowd is friendly local and can be an eclectic mix of clientele from far and wide. Just what you need Jessica. If you want some food they offer up Lamb shank. Let me know how this turns out,\" Sarah added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Sarah,\" Jessica added trying to frantically to remember the address to write it down. \"the address was 44 Tabard Street right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. Now don't loose track of time. You might miss your flight,\" Sara said with a chuckle thinking of what might have happned the first ime to land her friend in the center of London instead of Paris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, I have to go now. I owe you a big one. Oh, how is it going in Houston.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good only Windsor is on me again to stay here for good but I am holding strong. I just need to hear your voice again and get some breathing and relief away from his constant nagging. The adjuster comes with the check tomorrow, and I am working on fixing this up with a good contractor and leaving. I have two more interviews Friday afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you hold strong and keep your goal in mind. Then come home! Remember, Widsor is not your husband and you can kick him back home to Houstand anytime. If he wants to return, you are under no obligation to go also. He is your live in and not your life line. Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, got it Jessica. Now take a breather yourself. I want the full scoop when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok dear, You rock girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers dear, and stay out of trouble,\" said Sarah as she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear, Jessica thought. Well, Widsor, the Columbian Sarah had been dating for seven years, was still a thorn in her side. Sarah had wanted him to stay behind in Houston, but he had followed her up and got a job at a local dealership as a mechanic. He was planning on staying with Sarah, and she did not have the heart to kick him to the curb although she could not see herself getting old with him. Sarah just felt like she needed the comfort he had given her as a college student as she stuggled with college and morgage with her parents plight. She had not learned to live on her own and had comfort in Widsor although not happiness. It was not Jessica's problem tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the hallway door and surged into the night being careful to step over the drunk in the way this time. She made it to the street. Just as she was about to hail a cab a wreckless biker sped by and splashed her dress from a puddle in the cobble stoned street leaving her drenched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bicke stopped at the red light up the street a little ways ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you jerk,\"she yelled back. Look at me. What do you have to say for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider looked back. There was no helmet and his jet black hair blew in the night wind. He gave a simpathetic smile and made a U turn to return to her on the curb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry. I did not see you there. I was in a bit of a hurry. Is there anything I can do to make you forgive me? Did I ruin your evening? My name is Andrew,\" he said in a English accent that took her breath away. His smile was wide and full of bright white teeth. How could she be mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she said haultingly, \"I have just had a bad day trying to get to Paris and ended up here. I know you didn't mean any harm. My name is Jessica, and I am on my way to the Royal Oak Pub for a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me take you. It is on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I hardly know you, and this is a long way from my home. I will be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly. I have all but ruined your evening. Hope on. I don't bit. I will even by your dinner. It is all on me. It is the least I can do. I am yours for the evening. You will be a welcome distraction. Andrew had been worried about his job. He was from London himself and was in the newspaper business. Yet, his boss was only giving him obituaries and a few sports stories. Andrew wanted to make a name for himself and was tired of the same old stories. He had been on his way to his brothers for a bit of soccar (football to the Brits), but this lady needed his assistance after his unthoughtful act. I seemed more like fate for them to meet this way. He was likely to have a more enjoyable evening with her. So to the Royal Oak it was. He held out his hand, and she took it. He helped her hope on and they took off into the night. Jessica and Andrew road hastily into the misty London night air full of ehilaration of what awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could feel this muscels flexing against the forces of momentum to stay balanced. It was nice feeling the wind on her cheeks. She just seemed to relax. His black curly hair waved in the wind. She wanted to run her fingers through it. Sarah and Paris were miles from her mind. All wha cared about was that evening and this bike ride. She was not even cool in her wet clothes. She was pulling in his body heat and drying quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came up to another red light. across from them was a black car with tinted windows. It was parked opposite them on the left side of the street. A man came out of a brick building with a package in his hand. He put on his sun glasses and started to open the car door. Just then a shoot ran out and he fell to the ground. a dark figure stepped out of the car and grabed the package from the man collapsed on the sidewalk. The figure was wearing all black and had a dark dirby hat and dark glasses. He turned and hurried back to the car motioning the driver to speed away as he got in. Jessica could not believe her eyes. What were they going to do? Andrew turned his head to talk to her handing her a card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, \"I am going to follow that car. You stay behind and call the police and ambulance. This is my card with my number on it. I will be back to pick you up after I follow that car a ways to see where it is going. It is too dangerous to take you with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Am I to stay here? I mean I don't want go but I don't want you to either,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duty calls,\" he replied. I will be back love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun around stopping to help her off the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, be careful Andrew. I have only just met you and want my drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I live for this,\" he added before he road off into the darkeness leaving her standing their morning the shattered evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He leaned up on his elbow and grabbed the phone from her letting it hit the ground as he yelled in pain. Tossing his head back, she could see his face distort in pain. He had golden blond hair tumbling out from under this cap that fell out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No police,\" he said in a thick Russian accent. \"Call a taxi instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need an ambulance sir.

She checked his pulse. It was so weak. She reached into his pants for his wallet. She opened it to read his name. Nickolas Ivanof was his name. He took a business card from him and backed away as she heard the sirens. She was in no mood to be in interigation all night. She ran to the next block and crouched into an empty door way as the emergency vehicle came. She had left them an anonymos tip about gun shoots and seeing a man hit the ground as she was driving by. She did not say she stopped and would be waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey loaded up the man checking his vitals. She seen the police coming down the street and retreated to the alley.

I am just giving her options. I did not want to tell her anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Ms. Jessica, but you have just witnessed a murder and recieved a diamond from a dying man who you suspect to be part of the Russian Moffia. What part of that story sounds like a invitation to invite a friend with you on such a vacation?\" Andrew replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right,\" Jessica said. She was shoveling in the rest of the food and drinking down the hard cider. It tasted so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tv above the counter there was the local news. A news reporter was standing at a farmilar spot. Behind her was a sidewalk with yellow tape blocking it off and the outline of a man on the concrete. Sarah knew then that the Russian had died. She heard the distant words going through her head again. Suddenly she was snaped out of it. Andrew was softly shaking her. \"They have your description and are looking for you. If they find you you will be implicated in his murder. Let's go back to my place. He motioned for the bartender. Jessica was in shock not to mention feeling the buz from the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew paid and she followed him out to the bike. \"It was too dangerous to talk in there. Let's go to my place,\" he said as she hoped on holding on to him for dear life. Everything was a blur. She was so sleepy. Can she trust this guy? Should she go to the police? She was a little confused and slightly to drunk to decide now.</span></div></div>",

Andrew had hoped that Jessica would help him not think of his dull job but she seemed tired and irritable and Andrew soon left her feigning a head ache. Jessica, who thought Andrew would be able to cheer her up, actually did not find hm very enthusiastic in her company and was not surprised when he decided to leave. Jessica, now alone, looked around the Royal Oak. Her Guinness second drink was nearly done and she had also finished her light snack. Jessica felt better now, in the quiet, friendly chatter atmosphere of the Oak and tried absorbing the English atmosphere. Taking a cab back to her room, she watched a typical  english comedy on tv for an hour before she nodded off to sleep. Jessica just managed to remember arranging the wake up call . <br>\r\nIt was drizzling next morning and Jessica had just settled her room dues and was waiting for the airport shuttle bus. She was now glad that the London stopover had been uneventful and quiet. She was able to get over the irritation at being in London and now looked forward to Paris. The cab driver, thankfully, was not very communicative and gave a grunt when she paid him off and got down at the airport with her baggage. After looking around for the correct airline counters, Jessica briskly moved towards the checking in desk where a bright and happy face greeted her and apologized for the London stop over. Jessica was happy to complete check in and proceed to gate 44 for boarding. </span></div></div>",

Initially she had insisted that it wasn't necessary that she be helped but her request was ignored, or unheard. She couldn't actually tell if the silent, slight person she was following  was male or female. She attempted to make out the name on the gold toned name badge but it was obscured by a large yellow ribbon which read in large blue print, \"We'll make you smile, PROMISE!\" Long tawny brown hair covered most of the employees face which was directed toward the floor even as the large cart hesitated and lurched around a corner of the dimly lit hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room 112\", the employee said as they unlocked the door, still looking at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe luggage was unloaded and Jessica attempted to make some conversation as she searched her wallet for the two-dollar Euro coin she admired at the currency exchange. Placing it in the attendants hand she inquired about the yellow plastic barrier tape she  noticed as they passed the neighboring Suite 110.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, That room is closed for repair-will there be anything else\"  the androgynous figure responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, can you direct me to the  hotels restaurant please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a map on the dresser that lists the pub. Will that be all now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you\" Jessica replied. And with that the figure returned from the direction in which they had come, head still bowed down to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica freshened herself in the bathroom and thought about how strange the bell-person had acted. Maybe there were  just shy,  she thought. She could hear their response about Suite 110 replaying in her head. The only lilt that the bell-persons voice made was on the words \"That room\". Everything else had been flat and monotone with no inflection at all. As she went past  Suite 110 she heard \"That room\" echoing in her head and hoped she would feel better after grabbing a bite to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough there was \"The Pub\" as the sign read,  just where the map had directed her. She was seated at a small cocktail table by a bubbly young Asian woman whose  smile warmed the room and made her feel much more at ease than the bell-person had. \"Rose will be with you straight away.\", she beamed as she bounced off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for a menu she opened her book which slipped out of her hands to the floor. I have heard of not being able to put a book down, she thought to herself, but not being able to hold onto one? As she knelt  to scoop up the book a piece of a paper that appeared to be a torn and folded ticket stub from British Airways fell out.  The words, \"Be Careful\" were scrawled on it in small, non-descript, block letters. She examined it for any identifying information such as a name, seat or row number but found none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jessica was frightened. Instinctively looking around as if the author of the warning  would be directly behind her, her heart quickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\"  Jessica said as she left, \"The Pub\" nodding to the perky hostess. \"I'm not feeling well, is there a room service menu I can take with me?\"  The hostess gave her a post-card sized leaf that read, \"THE PUB-TAKE AWAY\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica quickly took herself away to her room. As she approached Suite 110 she heard the words, \"That Room\" again echoing in her head. Then she  smelled a familiar,unpleasant smell. She couldn't quite remember where she had encountered it before. Then as she slipped the key into the doorknob of her room she remembered. She had smelled that obscure, cheap cologne while waiting to check in to her flight to London. It seemed like it had happened a lifetime ago.<br>\r\nLocking the door behind her and latching the safety chain in place she grabbed the chair from in front of the small writing desk and slid it under the doorknob.</span></div></div>",

She was in unfamiliar territory and knew no one. But she was accustomed to danger and her sense of adventure governed her actions.<br>\r\nShe glanced at the time. An hour had already passed and she was curious as to the nature of Suite 110, so she dialed the number on the leaf; \"Yes, this is Jessica in room 112 and I would like a bottle of White Zinfandel sent up in a bucket of ice.\"<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before she recieved a reply. \"White Zinfandel and two glasses--yes ma'me.\" The voice was soft. <br>\r\n\"No-no glasses please! The plastic ones in the room will do. I'm not one for ceremony when traveling.\" There was silence and the line went dead.<br>\r\nShe recognized the voice as the Asian woman she had met at the table.<br>\r\nShe pulled the note from her book and placed it on the night stand next to the bed, her hand slightly trembling. She focused on the mystery of room 110 to ease the tension.<br>\r\nOutside her door she could hear voices, someone whispering in the neighboring room; room 110. She took one of the plastic cups from the cellophane wrapper and placed it to the wall. She caught the conversation in piecemeal fashion. Sudden movements blurred out most of their words. <br>\r\nThe gentle rap on the door caused a sudden jerk. The plastic cup flew across the room, landing on the bed. Beads of sweat rolled down her cheeks in rythym with the rapid pulse<br>\r\nthat was now pounding through her ears. <br>\r\nShe opened the door and found her order sitting on the floor. The deliverer had vanished. <br>\r\nShe noticed one end the yellow tape had been unfastened, draped along the door frame. <br>\r\nShe crept over to listen but she heard loud footsteps and muted voices coming from the stairway. She slid the bucket inside the door, reached up to turn off her light and shut the door just enough to enable her to watch room 110 from a crouched position. She often found it easier to manuever away from a door in this manner.<br>\r\nA pair of legs temporarily blocked her view as he stood off to the side of another man entering the Suite. Looking up, she recognized the red hair. <br>\r\nShe wasn't prepared for what came next: two men clad in gray coveralls carrying someone out on a stretcher. The stinch of the cologne wafted throughout the hall. She recognized him as well..... <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The weight of Festes was grossly underestimated by the two men who's second encounter with an awkward bump, as they manuevered the stretcher into a cramped elevator, caused his body to shift sending one of the men to his knees. <br>\r\n\"Bloody swaggert! Assign a gent to a farm and all he does is get fat off the profits and pulls a switch leaving us to clean up the bloody mess!\" <br>\r\nThe second man replied in a calm voice; \"Yeees. It does make one wonder, doesn't it.\" <br>\r\nThe casual tone in his voice felt like icy fingers running through her spine.

She'd be in a Parisian taxi by now, getting a glimpse of the Eiffel tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Instead</i> she was beyond exhausted, smelled like an old carpet, and was stuck in what had to be the slowest moving queue  in Heathrow airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry madam, your flight has been cancelled. French Air traffic control are on strike.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared at the woman behind the counter.  \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have this voucher for you,\u201d replied the woman briskly. \u201cNow if you go to the counter over there,\u201d she pointed with her ballpoint, \u201cthey will find you a room in a hotel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get to see London?\u201d Jessica perked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grinned mirthlessly. \u201cNot quite, madam. We need you to stay in the vicinity. You\u2019re on stand-by which means we need you to be at the airport as soon as possible. So it will be a local hotel. We will call you when we have a seat available. Next please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been wrong about the first queue, Jessica mused. This one was definitely longer. And she hoped the pungent body odour wasn\u2019t coming from her. She <i>hoped</i> it was the shaggy llama-hair coat being worn by the guy behind her. To take her mind of it she focused on the woman behind the counter. Heathrow seemed to be staffed entirely by brisk blondes. This one also seemed perky. It was depressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI'm sorry madam, but we don\u2019t have many rooms left. Let me see what I can do for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jessica mumbled. \u201cAs long as it has a shower.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman wrinkled her nose. \u201cYes. I quite agree.\u201d She tapped away on her keyboard. \u201cAh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica perked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No vacancies I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the woman frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sagged against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. No. Wait,\u201d the woman chirped. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about that, you travelling on your own. There\u2019s the honeymoon suite at the Ashford. They won\u2019t like single occupancy, but I suppose you\u2019re a bit of an emergency. It has a Jacuzzi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jessica mumbled. \u201cShower. Bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t recall the taxi ride to the hotel, only switching her brain on again when she reached reception.  Jessica asked about getting something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry madam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to despise that sentence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch is served until two. There are some complimentary biscuits with the coffee-making facilities in your room. Now let me tell you how to get to your room\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wondered whether the architect for the Ashford Hotel had been chiefly inspired by rabbits. The place was a warren: through a corridor, take an elevator to the third floor, another corridor, down a flight of stairs. She was positive she\u2019d walked through this corridor already, but room 39 remained elusive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned another corner. Finally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried the doorknob and found the door unlocked. Drained, Jessica headed straight to the bathroom where she dropped her clothes on the floor and stepped under a scalding hot shower. <i>God that felt good\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe switched off the shower and towelled herself dry. Yawning, she realised she\u2019d forgotten to ask for an Overnight Kit. No toothbrush. Nothing to sleep in. Normally fastidious, she didn\u2019t care right now. She could sleep naked in a haystack.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However now a toothbrush and tooth paste would seem like life's greatest luxury.

She crept around the door frame, and sneak to turn on the light. As the florescent beam filled the room, a stiffled groan came from a lump in the bed. Jessica froze. \"God damm it Susie, I told you I need my rest, now turn that damm light off\". Jessica felt as if this was a dream, could this be how jet lag feels? Surely not, maybe she was having a break down, some kind of post traumatic stress after the hell of a day she'd had.? But as the lump in the bed jolted up, rubbed his eyes and screamed \"who the hell are you?\" with a dirty Texan drawl, Jessica realised this was no dream, no hallucination... their really was a half naked man lying in her bed. \"Who the hell am I?\" she asked furiously, \" I am the lady who has booked this room, now if you would be so kind would you please put on your trousers and get the hell out of here before I call security!\". </span></div></div>",

As soon as she turned around the corner of the bedroom into the hall, wondering where the man had gone that she had found in the bed, the man cleared his throat slightly and began to appologise for what had happened.<br>\r\n\"It's been a misunderstanding. I know you must be tired as i heared you have just flown in, so i will not bother you with the details. Things have been solved with the other couple and this room is now free for your use.

She looked at her watch. 11.30. Even though she had slept on the plane she felt quite exhausted.<br>\r\nMust be the change of timezones, she thought.<br>\r\nShe realised the man in the hotel uniform was still standing at the door. \"Uh, she closed her eyes trying to think and sighed, okay that's, that's good. Thank you.\"<br>\r\nThe man nodded and left the room. Jessica turned around and walked into the living area of the suite. She looked at herself being dressed again in the same clothes as she had travelled in and grunted. She now wished that she had just stayed in her bathroom towel. She dropped on the nice stylish sofa and stared at the ceiling. What a trip so far. She hoped she would reach Paris soon. Her eyes were heavy.<br>\r\nShe yawned.</span></div></div>",

Jessica stood in a towel with her hand on her hip looking extremely annoyed.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\" The woman asked angrily, holding two cups of coffee in her hands.  She glanced at the man in the bed, shooting him and angry look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you two are, or how we ended up in the same room, but I'm sure the hotel has something to say,\" Jessica said, trying to calm herself and the couple down. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, they better have an explanation, damn London, baby, I knew we should have gone to Italy, its a hell of a lot nicer there,\" the man said, sitting up in the bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went to the phone and dialed the front desk's three digit number.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Asked a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is Jessica up in Suite 39. I believe it was you who took me up here. I came from the London airport and surprisingly there is a couple claiming they booked this room as well.  And we are all a little confused up here,\" Jessica said as calmly and politely as she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh goodness, I am terribly sorry.  Sophie must have already booked the place and not recorded it,\" she said sighing.  \"Jessica, I can understand your confusion, so why don't you come down to the front desk, and I will sort this thing out, so that you can have a nice night's sleep here in London.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Jessica said hanging up. \"I'm sorry to disturb your stay, guys,\" Jessica said a little annoyed.  She shouldn't have to apologize. \"The lady at the front desk said she'd sort this mess out, so I'll be on my way.\"  Jessica waved good-bye to the dumb-strucked couple, and shut the door on her way out.  She heard the woman sigh as Jessica left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little more than annoyed now.  But at least she had gotten a shower in before discovering there were other people in the hotel room.  All she needed now was to be in Paris, or at least in an unoccupied bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door chimmed and opened up.  Jessica was shocked to see six or seven police officers waiting impatiently by the front desk.  The clerk looked scared and a little confused, as she glanced around the lobby. All the officers looked hopefully at the elevator once the doors opened.</span></div></div>",

She sauntered out of the elevator and over to the Main Reception desk tossing her wet hair in the direction of the <br>\r\npale-faced Desk Clerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking a little nervous there Edward\" she said leaning in to read his name badge.. \"and rightly so, I remember you from earlier, you should have been paying more attention to my suitcases and less attention to Sophie The Receptionist, is it any wonder we're in such a curfuffle now....\" Edward looked even more scared and very baffled. He stared at Jessica, then at Sophie who was reapplying her lipstick in quite a prevocative way he thought, then at the 7 policemen who were growing increasingly impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening madam\" interrupted one of the policemen. \"Can you step this way for a moment please?\" \"Certainly officer, I'm more than happy to give a statement. You see it all began when my flight to Paris was cancelled in Heathrow, the check-in girl said she would book me into the honey-moon suite of this hotel, I arrived here, Sophie booked me into Suite 39, I had a shower, was about to get into bed only to find Mr and Mrs Jikarta had already booked into the room\" vented Jessica, staring pointedly at Sophie, relieved to offload her tale of woe to these very understanding gentlemen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica noticed one of the officer's scribbling in his notebook, then the policeman who originally greeted her stepped forward and said \"Madam, is your name Jessica Nora Adams?\" \"Yes, how did you know officer? I'm really flattered you London cops go to such great lengths to make us visitors feel welcome, even if.....\" Her voice trailed off as said officer proceeded to read her her rights \"You have the right to remain silent....\" \"Is this some kind of sick joke?\" cried Jessica pinching herself in the hope that she was dreaming. The policeman continued to read her her rights, as another policeman roughly manicled her delicate wrists with handcuffs and the other five officers followed suit after getting one last look at Sophie The Receptionist who seemed to be in a constant state of lipstick reapplication and eyelash fluttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanked by two of the burlier officers, Jessica was bunched into the back of the white van, which had bars across the rear, a van that was used for only the most hardened of criminials. </span></div></div>",

Here is your key, once you get to the room phone room service to have you bags transferred.\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Jessica grabbed the key and stalked over to the elevators. This better be some room, she thought, as people stared at her as she walked by.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     She jammed the up button and waited until she saw the arrow above the first elevator turn green. The doors slid back and Jessica walked in with another couple and   an elderly man.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     Jessica pressed the second floor button and stood back. Once the doors closed she looked around. The elevator was lined with mirrors. It seemed as if dozens of people were inside. Jessica was staring at the walls fascinated when all of a sudden she was pushed against the side. She felt something against her back and panic seized her. She couldn't move.</span></div></div>",

I...I dont even feel like it. I felt as if I could have slept for days!\" she mumbled to herself, throwing the covers off and sitting up. A few glances around the room prove there isn't much excitement to be found locked up in a hotel room so she decides to go wander around the local area to pass some more time. As she leaves the hotel, she takes her phone out of her pocket to check the time again. She stops dead in her tracks. The date on the small LCD display is showing the 17th of May. A moment's thinking and she strictly recalls it saying the 16th before she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dammit\" is the only word that pops to her mind. Tears try to push themselves out, but she fights them back and makes quite the decision. Her flight to return home should be leaving this airport in about a week. Paris would be nice, yes, but why not try something else? Who knows what adventures London could bring, and as long as she gets to the airport when she's supposed to go home, all is good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A little more cheerful now, Jessica walks out the door and the instant she gets onto the sidewalk, a young man about her age runs into her.

They were carrying the same book, but fortunately they both had inscribed their name on the inside cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stranger brushes his long red hair out of his eyes, revealing a small smirk and a handsome face.

A smile beams from the stranger as he speaks in a light Scottish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, its not a common book, ya know? I figure if chances bring two readers together, you should trade books! Its like buyin' a pair of shoes from a bargain store, or an old peice o' jewelery. You get to use your imagination and create your own past for it...\" he says cheerfully, \"And ours both seem a bit beaten from time. But, who could like a perfect book anyway? I never liked a book that didn't look like it had been read quite a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica's heart stops. Its almost as if he was speaking what she had taught herself her whole life.

I've just never traded a book with anyone.

Well, I better be on me way. By the way you were comin' out that door, looks like you've got a place ta be as well. It was nice running inta ya, Jessica, and who knows...maybe we'll run inta each other again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looks down at her book as the stranger begins to walk off down the street, watching him flip through the pages of her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did you know my name?\" She shouts after him, not realizing the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Its in the front of your book!\" he calls back, stopping to turn around first.

A balding middle aged would be lothario in a rumpled suit a half size too small kept up a constant monologue detailing all too frequently a list of his business accomplishments, his sorrow at the loss of his mistress and the uninvited suggestions that Jessica would be a splendid replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After ditching Mr. Wrong in the airport bar Jessica retrieved her luggage and with the aid of an elderly but energetic porter loaded her belongings in the trunk of a grey Renault taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the taxi pulled away from the curb Jessica heard a shout and turned, fear rising like a fire in her throat, half expecting to see the mysterious stranger from London lunging at the cab. Instead she saw her elderly porter waving his spindly arms in an attempt to hail another taxi for his next traveler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The cab ride was blessedly uneventful. She had chosen a small but well rated hotel a half block from the small boutiques on the left bank of the Seine, Tomorrow she would aim her fashion eye at the myriad offerings from which would emerge a focus point for her campaign to conquer the fashion world. Tonight just a long luxurious bath and a sherry before slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The bath had been refreshing and the sherry calming but Jessica's dreams were horrific. She dreamed she was in a dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, silhouetted by the dim yellow light of a street lamp was a hulking, menacing figure in a semi- crouch as though anticipating combat. As she turned to run she tripped and fell not onto the cold unyielding ground but onto something soft and moving. Glancing up in her panic she saw the tunnel blocked by a thousand luminescent eyes. Gaining her feet she twirled back towards the ominous figure blocking her escape only to find herself staring in the semi-darkness into the eyes of the stranger from London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jessica was startled awake by a tapping on her door. Half afraid of an answer if she called out and realizing by the light streaming into her room that she had left a message with the concierge to wake her at the break of dawn she peered through the peephole into the broad hallway and seeing no one at her door, she opened it. She found a tray of croissants and coffee under which had been placed the english translation of the Paris Gazette. As she dunked and nibbled at the croissant and perused the fashion page of the Gazette Jessica's dream still invaded her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      As Jessica entered the lobby the concierge called out to her \" Mademoiselle I have a message for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" From who?\" a startled Jessica replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" From Monsieur Langerfeld.\" The concierge spoke the name with a reverence usually reserved for the pope or God himself. \" He wants to extend you his warmest greetings and hopes you will stop by his office at your convenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" Thank you. Please relay the message that I would be delighted to visit with him tomorrow and that I will call him today to firm up a time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Jessica could barely conceal her delight. Hans Langerfeld was her most important link to the fashion world in Paris. The right word from him could pair you with Givenchy. The wrong and you might as well close up shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       She was walking briskly towards the Seine, her heart racing with excitement, when a tug at her sleeve brought her world to an abrupt halt. She turned to find the man of her dreams albeit the dreams she would like to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        The stranger from London, his hair disheveled and his face flushed, stared through her like a hungry wolf.<br>\r\n           <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

If you introduce a character, give a good description and background history of that character.<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"cred\">CAUTION:  </span>I, as the Director of Operations at Central International, may do the following to travellers:<br>\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Search your bags and belongings for contraband or illegal goods.<br>\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Arrest you, detain or redirect your flight.<br>\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Accept bribes from my more unsavory characters and look the other way while your character is robbed, beaten, or \"sent to swim with the fishes\".<br>\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bullet.png\" alt=\"*Bullet*\" title=\"Bullet\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">Edit misspellings or delete time line errors.<br>\nNote:<br>\nGenres may be mystery, action/adventure, romance or horror.  <br>\nPlease note the 18+ rating.  <br>\nFetish chapters will be deleted.  <br>\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\n<br>\nAnd now, calling Flight 843, Flight 843 to Minneapolis....<br>\nNow boarding rows 24 to 19...<br>\nSir...that bag is too large for a carry-on, we'll have to stow it below the aircraft...<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><div style=\"position:relative;width:150px;height:150px;\" class=\"noselect\"><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:12.5px;\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><img style=\"position:relative; top: -0.5px; left: 0px;\" width=\"125\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trinkets/ukey/57f317d76b454102125530.jpeg\"></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:0\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools/action/show_object/ukey/57f317d76b454102125530?validator=d777afc1c0acf074f66385bad491a9a2\" rel=\"trinketlightbox\"><img id=\"collectOverlay\" style=\"opacity: 1;\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/trinkets/trinket-collect.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:0;\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools/action/show_object/ukey/57f317d76b454102125530?validator=d777afc1c0acf074f66385bad491a9a2\" rel=\"trinketlightbox\"><img style=\"cursor:pointer;\" id=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/trinkets/trinket-square-47.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a></div></div></div><script></script></div><script>$(\"body\").on(\"click\", \"a[rel='trinketlightbox']\", function (event) { if (event.clicked) { return; } event.clicked= true; event.preventDefault();var options = {onOpen:function(){  if ($(\"#showMyNotifyOuter2\").length > 0) { $(\"#showMyNotifyOuter2\").attr('safeClick','true'); } },  href:$(this).attr(\"href\"), maxWidth :'700px', maxHeight :'700px', innerWidth :'85%', innerHeight :'85%', initialWidth :'300px', initialHeight :'100px', iframe:true, fixed :true, speed :100, fadeOut :50, opacity :.6 }; if (parent) { if (parent.parent && parent.parent.$.colorbox) { parent.parent.$.colorbox(options); } else { parent.$.colorbox(options); } } else { $.colorbox(options); } });</script></div></td>",
