As the camp has already taken your bag and loaded it all you have with you is the clothes on your back and the items in your pocket which include your cell phone, a pocket knife, and your wallet.  As you plop down on your seat wishing you were just back home hanging out with your friends or just playing games in your room the kid you joined turns to you with an idiotic smile plastered to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm Tai nice to meet you,\" he said with an amount of cheerfulness that almost made you sick as he holds out his hand in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, I'm Ian why are you wearing goggles think there will be a strong wind storm on the bus?\" you mutter not shaking the offered hand but flicking a finger against the goggles nestles in his large nest of dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you see I came to camp for some soccer training with some friends and you got to have some protection when you are on the field,\" Tai said still holding out his hand to shake yours.  Rolling your eyes again and thinking the best way to end this conversation and hopefully just be left alone was to shake the hand; you took the idiot's hand in yours and with as much strength you could muster crushed it in your grip and gave his hand two pumps.  You hide a smile as you see him shake his hand as if trying to get feeling back after you let go and the buss started to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while when the buss had left the city and headed to the camp you decided to pass the time as you pulled out your phone, only to find that you had forgotten to charge it and the thing was practically dead.  Putting it away with a small groan of frustration you tried to think of something to pass the time which is when you noticed goggle boy had fallen asleep next to you.  Smiling wickedly to yourself you decide to do your other favorite activity, since your phone was out, which was to bully someone a little.  Making sure none of the camp workers were looking you grabbed the band of Tai's goggles and pulled them away from his face with the thought of letting them snap back painfully into the idiot's face.

Just as you are about to let go the bus hits a nasty bump to which the driver calls out an apology, but you do not even notice for just as the bump is hit you had let go of the goggle band but rather than snapping back Tai who had been leaning forward slid right off the seat and into the foot well.  You look down and see Tai does not even wake up from this making you roll your eyes as you bend down to put him back into place with ideas of messing with him to see what you could do with him before he woke up.  Suddenly you pause as you realize with Tai in the foot well the seat was now yours, so you straighten back up as you move to slide into the center of the bus seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out you spread your legs so that Tai is between them as you begin to enjoy the ride with your own seat.  After a while one of your legs begins to fall asleep making you move it, unfortunately for Tai his body is taking up much of the room in the foot well curled up in a close approximation of the fetal position leaving the only place to put your foot right on his sleeping form.  Lifting your foot free you place it on Tai's thigh as gently as you can so as to not wake him.  He does not awaken though does make you jump when you hear him mutter in his sleep, \"Oh Kari that feels good.\"  Not knowing who Kari was but seeing he was not waking up you decided to see what would happen if you decided to play with his sleeping form a little.  Looking around and seeing everyone else is too into their own business you reach down and take off your socks and shoes, on both of your feet, before placing them both on Tai's sleeping form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your left foot back on Tai's thigh you begin to lightly move it along his exposed skin beneath the fabric covered by his shorts while you place your right foot almost right in his face making him smell your foot.  You smile as you finally found some fun on this trip as you look down at Tai's sleeping form and almost burst out laughing as you see your left foots movement in caressing his exposed lower thigh was causing Tai's body to react as you see a slight bulge grown in his brown soccer shorts.  Thinking this was too good you pulled out you phone for while it lacked the energy to be used as either a phone or connection to the internet you could still use it to take photos.  Thinking this would come in handy latter you quickly snapped off a pic of the sleeping Tai's tented shorts before putting your phone away.

At least she doesn't look she would cause him to go deaf or bore him with stupid \"cutting edge\" trivia and facts. As you got close to her, you saw along with her beanie, she wore an unremarkable pink t-shirt with flowery details around the collar and blue jeans. So you sat down with a rough plop that caused the unexpected girl roughly bump against the wall. Causing a sharp pain to erupt from her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer auburn colored irises threw daggers at the rude boy. Just who does he think he is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch it!\" The girl hissed at the newcomer. Her anger was well justified in her humble little opinion. Her neighbor turns back to her with an ear to ear grin one would find on a someone who works for customer service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious enough, a strange\u2026  scent that wafted off of her that made your nose slightly wiggle. It was a tangy fragrance of sweat and fruitiness. It made your stomach bubble. But you ignore the strange feeling for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Watch It! My name is <i>Shut up</i>!\" You mockingly greeted the girl. Causing her cheeks to be inflamed with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh it's on!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>Shut up</i>, where did you learn your manners from? From a drunk baboon?\" Sora sharply made her comeback to the boy. The surrounding kids started to make <i>'ooooo'</i> sounds and giggle like crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake smile on your face fell as you stared right back at her. Oh, she wanted a fight, huh, well then you are going to give her a <b>war</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did get your sense of fashion. Straight out of a mom store?\" Your barb was flying at your opponent like an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Jackass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takes one to know one, Ugly Betty!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd both sides would soon form a grand concert of childish name-calling and rude gestures as the bus moved along the road. Making the many other kids boom in laughter and egg it on. It was rather impressive honestly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' Thirty years of being a chef and I'm wasting my retirement doing this.'</i>  The bus driver's smile began to twitch up a storm when the argument started. It was getting more and more tempting to crash into a passing car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to be a <i>long</i> damned trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i><u>A rather convenient time skip.</u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, the bus reached the camp. The argument died down into petulant silence and humming on both parties. The rest of the kids easily forgotten about it and rush out of the bus. Ready to have a summer filled with fun and excitement! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the unhappy soon to be campers. With one last glare at the boy, the girl reached to the bus's upper shelf to get her bags. Your luggage was on the floor near you , meaning you could have just walk out of bus like the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is because you was watching the girl gather her things, more specifically her body. Ian's face felt warm as he looked at her body. Starting with her butt. For a seemingly plain looking girl,  she has\u2026a kinda nice ass. Kinda like two little round oranges, an impressive feat considering her age. You <i>knew</i> that you shouldn't be gawking, but lately\u2026you have been finding yourself staring at girls\u2026<i>alot</i> lately. A light slapping sound brought your attention downward, to her feet. To your surprise, she was wearing sandals. I guess would it make perfect sense for her to be wearing them, considering the nice weather outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were one of those flat sandals you hear mom go on and on about. They are mostly brown in color, and has a short wedge. The barely visible straps appear to highly colorful. And thing that really surprised you that her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's feet are pretty <i>big</i> for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to possessing an high arch, they are pretty long. But thanks to her age, they were still chubby and has some plumpness. The heels were rounded and a little dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at my feet?\" The girl quietly ask, snapping you out of your hormonal induced trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because they are s-so big! What are y-you, S-Sasquatch's daughter!\" You quickly squeaked out a half-assed insult? While the girl's blushed in a dulled anger at the insult, she finds your reaction to them to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really</i> interesting indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever Jerk.\" The girl sighed as she began to squeeze through your legs and walk out of the bus. Giving you a glimpse of her slender toes of medium size and their unpainted nails. She gives you one last look, before exiting the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly do the same, and was greeted to a bunch of kids having fun and doing a bunch of games. Noticing they are in pairs. An overly happy looking woman came to greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya I'm Ms.Takahashi! Happy to have you here!\" The woman's voice was like liquid diabetes. It made you want to vomit.\"As you can see. Today kids like you are having fun and mingling with their bunkmates. So you get to know each other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist to scoff at what the doped up woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily for you, lil'guy...\" She playfully ruffled your black hair.\"Your bunkmate will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Author's note: The canon start of the series will in happen in a day or two. So it gives Ian plenty of time to mingle.</b></span></div></div>",

You quickly forgot the name of it and didnt even bother paying attention to whatever mascot theyre famous for in whatever sport they pride themselves in.<br>\r\nSuffice to say you were not excited to be here. Yeah yeah, nobody likes going to school and crap, but that's not it. Let's just say you didnt have a very good time at the LAST school you were forced to sit through for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week (and 6 every other week because Japan). On the plus side, it at the very least gave you some sort of hope that this fancy uppity cleanly cesspit wont have nearly as many roughnecks, druggy punks, or pedophilic weirdos disguised as teachers as the last place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around and leered blankly at all the fellow kids cheerfully socializing, playing, singing, chattering about schoolwork and crushes and the latest trends that dont concern you in the least. Everyone smiling, sunshine, rainbows, and not a spec of graffiti tags anywhere! It just didnt seem right to you! It was too freaking happy! It was so BORING! But boring beats frustrating, right? Might as well enjoy this moment of calm while you can before everything goes wrong and blows up in your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!!\"<br>\r\n\"AGGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everything just blown up in your face! Some jerk just came charging out of nowhere like a stampede and just steamrolled you into the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell actually, the jerk just bumped into you a little too hard and you were knocked into the cold wet dirt...and your head landed on a rock. You were not only a little dirty, you got yourself a nice little aching bump hidden under your hair! Somebody just won themselves a free ride on a stretcher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh!! I'm sorry, are you alright?!\" you made out a nasally female voice call out in the middle of all the ringing. Still beaming with fury, you gritted your teeth and dug your nails into the dirt, ready to scream all sorts of obscenities at your rude agitator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as you jerked your head to said agitator, you somehow didnt have the strength to let out a single syllable. Your eyes gazed unblinkingly at the nearly serene angelic face of an awfully cute brunette with short cut brown hair except for the locks just in front of her ears. You stared deep into her brownish, reddish, hazelish sparkling eyes as she glanced back with a look of worry on her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw geez. Hang on! Let me help you up,\" the angelic brunette grabbed your arm and you blissfully accepted the warmth from it as she helped pull you off the ground. Wow, she's pretty strong... then again, angels are supposed to be. She was even generous enough to brush off some of the dirt on your shirt! Isnt that thoughtful of the angel?<br>\r\nStill kinda blissing out (or fighting off a coma from the blow to your head!), you gave a look at the rest of her. Normally you'd be laughing your butt off at anybody wearing a getup as tacky as a pink and white sleeveless turtleneck shirt, long pink fingerless gloves, pink and white zipper-boots, and tight yay-high yellow shorts... but this girl looked positively breathtaking in that gawdy outfit. You didnt even mind that little whistle she's carrying around her neck even though the sound of loud high-pitched whistles make you wanna shatter a window with your fist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really really, sorry!\" she continued apologizing, \"I hope I didnt break anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... um... uh...\" it took a bit of effort finally mustering the courage to say something to this girl (hopefully because you were bashfully, not because you received a concussion!), \"Um... n-n-no, I'm fine. Thanks.\" You still felt a bit dizzy, but you tried to look strong for this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" she sighed in relief, \"sorry about charging into you. I kinda sorta overslept and now I'm running a little late for class. No excuse not to watch where I'm going, though.\" Been there.<br>\r\n\"Eh, I know what that's like,\" you shrug, \"that was me every single monday back at my old school.\"<br>\r\n\"Old school?\" she tilted her head curiously, \"youre new here?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you nodded, even though the nodding hurt, \"oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm....\" you got awful nervous suddenly after looking into her eyes again, \"uh... I'm.... Ian? YEAH! Ian! Ian Tastuya!\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Ian!\" she smiled, \"my name's Kari. Kari Kamiya!\" Kari, huh? That's a pretty name... you think. \"S-sorry, I'm running a little late to give you a proper welcome to our school! Maybe we can give each other better introductions later once we got some free time?\" Aww... leaving so soon? But you just met!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...ok, s-sure!\" you slightly mumbled in your response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! See ya around, Ian!\" and with that, Kari dashed off again. Wow, she's fast. ...Why does she have to be so fast?! You were really enjoying seeing her comedically dash away like she was Sonic the Hedgehog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gone, you shake off whatever trance you were put in during that meeting and rub your aching head.<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" you muttered to your school, \"I guess I'll give you one point for creativity.\" You exhaled as you pulled out your class schedule and school map to find your classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's first on the list?\" you ask yourself as you look through the schedule.</span></div></div>",

But interpretations and exploration on them and how they react to things are not only allowed but is <b><u><i>ENCOURAGED</i></u></b>.<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*BigSmile*\" title=\"BigSmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. And while I'm straight. You can play and interact with both boy and girl characters. Although I would like more stuff on girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. And while foot fetish is the main kink of this story and will be a little more focused than my other interactives.  It doesn't mean that you blind to a character's other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. Same goes for size and texture. Variety is the spice of life. But it doesn't mean that characters that normally don't have stinky feet and general scent can't have <i>positively</i> barking dogs and same for goes vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Your choices do matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality and develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n11.1. The protagonist and most of the other characters are going through puberty...take that as you will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. One of the major things about this interactive is it focusing more on human interaction. While it doesn't mean that Digimon can't be d interact with or isn't a major part of the overall story (they are). It just that most of them won't partake in the many <i>fun</i> \"relationship\" stuff. But doesn't mean that Digimon like Angewomon and Lillymon can't have their time in the spotlight! Or...Ian could \"bond\" with certain Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. These are a bunch of children that have no adult supervision or authority whatsoever. Meaning they can and will say \"fuck\", \"shit\", and all that good stuff. #LetMimiSayFuck2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Only seasons one thru four. I haven't watched Digimon Savers and I'm ambivalent on Xros and it's sequel. I also did this intentionally to stop choice chapters from overtaking the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Keep it either first person pov or second person pov. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>THE WANTED LIST</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.
