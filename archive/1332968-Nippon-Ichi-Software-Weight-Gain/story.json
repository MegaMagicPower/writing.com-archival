That is until the day that Master Lamington chose her to be his \"secret agent\" and sent her on a mission to assassinate the demon king Krichevskoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said the little blonde angel with a cheer, \"I'm finally here. I still don't know why I was picked to be an assassin. Maybe I've got some kind of a special skill that Master Lamington knows about, oh this might be kind of neat,\" she said as she rushed into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne instantly switched into \"secret agent\" mode and started running through the castle, hiding behind suits of armor, pillars, or whatever else she could find. She thought she was being stealthy because none of the guards noticed her, but little did she know that as she ran she kept making her own sound effects. \"Whoosh, nin nin!\" Because of this everyone she ran past saw her, they just didn't care enough to try and stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she made her way to a massive dining hall that was empty, but full of food. \"Oh look, is somebody having a party. Oh I love parties, I wonder who it's for.\" She looked around at all the tasty snacks and tried to fight the urge to take a bite out of them. \"Wait, I'm not here to eat, I'm here to find Krichevskoy. But the more that I think about it, the stranger I feel about this. I don't feel right killing a stranger. But then again I wouldn't feel right about killing someone I know either.\" Without realizing it she had sat down in one of the chairs, and as she started thinking out loud she had also begun eating.</span></div></div>",

I couldn't have, I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne stood up and walked past a large mirror where she stopped to examine herself. After having eaten all the food that had been layed out for her she saw that her cheeks had become pudgy, her fingers had become rounder, and her body had gained so much weight that she was now starting to fill out her once loose white dress. She twirled around to see that the dress that once hung off her was now folding around her newly formed curves. Flonne giggled to herself and said, \"What a funny mirror.

The Blighted Bachiel are gunning for the top spot so far, but can they compete with tenacious speed of the Lucky Feylnn 13? Stay tuned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand we're clear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep-voiced stuffed rabbit hopped down off his chair, followed behind by his silent companion, Plenair. She never said anything, only \"speaking\" in ellipsis, but something about her presence drew in the viewers like none other. Hell most people just watched the news for her adorable, silent face rather than the actual info. Silently, with an unchanging expression, Plenair walked through the backstage door, hoping to leave. A young intern with a clipboard shuddered and stepped back in admiration as he saw her walk by in the hall. Likewise, a large boar demon in a nice suit, clammed up before he even considered lighting the cigar in his hands, for corporate sponsors long learned not to cross her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door outside, as she walked out on the lot, Plenair was sort of surprised as she was met by a crowd of Demons, all fans, with signs and T-shirts in her name and with her face. All this was well and good, but as she stared, looking for a way by, her stomach growled. She wanted to grab some dinner now that work was done, since sitting in place for half an hour without even a snack didn't really help her appetite. As Usagi, her rabbit companion, came up behind her, she picked him up and threw him into the crowd. Weather she meant to or not, Usagi hit a Prinny within, sending it flying and causing it to explode when it hit the ground, setting off the four other Prinnes within it's vicinity. All the explosions blew away every demon in front of her, leaving them scorched as they lay on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love you Plenair~ <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" A Magic Knight laying by her foot as she walked said to Plenair weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlenair didn't say a thing, as usual.

Even if she didn't need to recover her Hit Points, right now she needed to take care of her Hunger Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vendor, a female red mage, was taken aback as she saw Plenair approach. Holding out a purse with a good 20,000 HL inside, it only took a glance at her face to somehow tell Plenair wanted some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow taken aback in shock by what could be considered an impatient look on Plenair's face, the mage girl presented her with as much as her money would afford: Three plates of flan and a chocolate bar. Plenair just stared, not even smiling but in a way seemed to show gratitude. Yes, she did because we say so now shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Plenair long to sit down and dig into the chocolate, while pulling a spoon out of nowhere and starting to dig into the flan. Whatever the reason, Rosenqueen sweets weren't bad at all even for a mass Netherworlds wide chain but it the sweet flan tasted exceptionally good today somehow, the rich creamy caramel melding with the smooth, milky chocolate as well as the delicious cocoa of her chocolate bar. Her meal passed by in a haze, as Plenair looked down and saw six clean plates and an empty wrapper. Somehow she still felt hungry as she looked down, her stomach growling and her sweet tooth craving more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presented the mage with another payment, this time a healthier sum of about 33,000 HL. A bit puzzled and perplexed, the mage saw no need to protest as business was business and presented Plenair with some eclairs and flan. Plenair tore through them all, a faintest evident expression of delight on her face as she ate and ate, cooing quietly as only she could hear herself while eating. Her stomach seemed to bulge forward as the silent mascot became further stuffed, rising out and sticking out under her white dress. It continued to grow larger and rounder as she ate, more sweets piling inside of it; cake, flan, eclairs, sundaes, candy...whatever she could eat, Plenair would eat! She seemed to eat faster too, despite an expression of what could be considered discomfort on her face and her stomach was so full and stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlenair herself, however, was not unaware of this. However, she felt too hungry to really bother thinking and kept eating, kept shoveling in food, kept on feasting on sweets. She finally stopped herself once she finally felt legitimately full, her hunger pangs subsiding and her belly standing out in front of her by about a good three feet. Plenair sat down on the pavement, feeling her legs get tired supporting her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her swollen gut in an expression barely reading in disbelief. Why was she suddenly so hungry? All she could think of was taking a break on Veldime after she was summoned by that group of adventurers, that Adell guy who was a fan of hers and his companion Rozalin. Ever since then, she felt her appetite increase in droves, working herself up to make sure she didn't pack on weight by tackling the Item World in her spare time. But it seemed now her cravings were starting to catch up with her.</span></div></div>",

With each whimper, the guards outside her room winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I truly feel sorry for Lady Rozalin...\" the first said, his beefy arms crossed over his scarred, bare chest. The chains around his wrists clinked with each movement, and he quickly snatched at them to silence the sound. \"I mean, rejected by Sir Adell for something she couldn't even help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! What a meanie! He needs to get his head out of his butt and screwed on straight!\" the second guard agreed, nodding furiously and bobbing on her furry feet restlessly, almost tempted to do a few flips to get the anxiety out of her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mai...be quiet. Kai...I agree with you.\" a third guard said quietly yet solidly, his eyes hard as he glared over the collar of his steel lined, dark blue trenchcoat. Standing straight up next to the door, he sighed. \"Adell had his reasons. After all, our lord was and now once again is the most feared Overlord in all the cosmos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clicking of boots could be heard moments later, silencing the chatter of the three as the head of all of Rozalin's guards walked around the corner, his arms folded like Kai's, though over a gleaming gold vest. Boots as black as onyx clicked on the marble floors, and his dark blonde hair fanned out behind him due to his swift gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three of you are to shut up NOW. You will be quiet about Lady Rozalin's dilemma, you will not speak of Adell. You will guard the room against attackers and you will do so SILENTLY. Otherwise I will personally hurl you into the Dark Sun. I will not have gossip floating amongst my soldiers. Is that CLEAR?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES LORD FENRIR!\" the three terrified soldiers replied, arranging into a more effective formation for observation. Their stiff straight posture seemed to be adequate, as the imposing Omega Sentinel turned and clicked away, pushing up his sleeve to look at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly time for the chefs to begin preparing the Mistresses breakfast...I just pray that those three imbeciles don't wake her prematurely. I just wish that she would allow me to deal with them. Ah well.

Swinging her slim legs off of the bed, she scratched her scalp and opened her eyes slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A beautiful day, as always.\" she cooed, a smile decorating her face. \"Phooey on Adell...if he doesn't want to share this life with me, then it's his own fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood greatly improved from a few days ago, Rozalin stood and strode over to her closet, flinging it open and humming to herself. A dark crimson skirt was thrown on first, fluttering to her knees and hiding her shapely lower half. After that, a black silk shirt was adorned, her tiny wings poking out and her naturally large bosom accentuated by the clingy fabric. A pair of red satin gloves followed, as well as a pair of gold bracelets to cinch the gloves tightly so they wouldn't fall off. Finally, she set about the task of pulling her hair up into a ponytail, as she had grown so accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rozalin? Are you awake?\" a deep voice called as her door clicked open. A shock of dark blonde hair poked out from behind the door, giving Rozalin a perfect idea of who the person was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thiel...even if I weren't awake when you first came in, I think I would be after you opened your mouth. I swear, your voice is like a gong being struck.\" she chuckled, the figure audibly letting out a relieved breath of air and stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry milady. I've been trying recently to change my voice, but previous lives have a habit of edging in.\" the Omega Sentinel said lightly, his voice now more smooth and sophisticated, more fitting of his race. Striding over to his mistress, he bowed slightly before smiling. \"After all, two lives call for two voices. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily. Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of my most trusted vassal?\" Rozalin asked, her smile fading as she struggled with her ponytail. Thiel took over, gently guiding her hair through the tie and even fanning it out in the manner that most of her servants took as something natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, he stepped back and bowed again, not wanting his mistress to be offended by his presence. \"I'm just here to inform you that breakfast is ready. I personally supervised the chefs this time, ensuring that you would have enough food, unlike yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...stand up. I may have been strict in a past life, but that's no reason to walk on eggshells in front of me.\" she laughed as her stomach snarled more loudly than a Baciel, causing her to blush as brightly as the red sun outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell, especially when you look so adorable and make such vulnerable noises.\" Thiel joked, getting a smack on the head with the lady's fan for his wit. \"Now come on. Breakfast will get cold if we don't hurry.\"</span></div></div>",

Yet she was still hungry. Patting her engorged belly, which was bulging visibly, even with her dress covering it, she called for Thiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thiel! Could you come here, please?\" Thiel Fenrir obeyed immediately, as he had been patiently guarding the door to the dining hall. He strode in, boots thudding slightly on the rich carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, milady?\" he asked. His eyes immediately traveled to her dress, where the taut bulge that was once her flat stomach was sitting quite visibly. She must've been hungry, he thought. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you ask the chefs to make another meal, about twice the size of this one? I'm afraid I'm still feeling hungry.\" She smiled at him. He smiled too, a little uneasily though. It was very unusual for her to be <i>this</i> hungry. And even after she devoured enough to feed two people. Thiel bowed slightly and swept out the door, a worried look on his face. What caused this to happen-? Before he knew it, he was at the entrance to the kitchens, the delicious smells wafting through the corridors. Stepping in, one of the head chefs clapped her hands and bowed to him. The rest of the cooks followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Master Thiel. What does our lady require of us now?\" a plump succubus said, clearly the master chef by her size. She had an impressive bust, each breast about the size of a spherical watermelon. Her thick, wide hips swayed left to right with every little motion of her wings, with her smooth, fat thighs following soon after. Her ponderous belly flowed into her lap, obscuring what little there was in the ways of covering her nethers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our lady asks for another course, Mariana,\" Thiel said. The succubus went wide-eyed. \"Only this time, double it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Master Thiel? That is far too much food for a person such as our lady! She would surely burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThiel shook his head. \"I'm not entirely sure. When I left, her stomach filled her lap, taut with her meal, and yet it continued to roar in hunger. Someone must've put something in the ingredients. But enough of that! Lady Rozalin is possibly starving at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Master.\" He left. The cooks, mostly all succubi with exceedingly plump bodies, exchanged worried glances with each other. Who would tamper with the Lady Rozalin's food? Mariana sighed and shook her mane of blond hair. \"Well ladies, it's time to head back to work...\"<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the food arrived. Rozalin's tummy was roaring up a storm so bad it hurt her. Even though she knew it was filled up, it just didn't register being full. A knock on the door came, followed by the sound of Mariana's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady, we've brought your breakfast. May we enter?\" Rozalin called \"Yes!\" and beckoned them to enter. What they were carrying almost made her jaw drop. But that would be unladylike. Seven different succubi, all of different classes, carried in the largest platters she had ever seen, covered in pancakes and omelets, croissants and french toast, sausages, bacon, biscuits, and grits. Greasy, fatty grits. Rozalin smiled and picked up her fork, ready for her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all. You may be excused.\" \"Thank you, milady,\" they all chanted before flying out, wings flapping ever so often to keep them afloat. Rozalin pulled a plate of eggs to her and tucked in.</span></div></div>",

Carrying her along, Mariana exited the kitchen through a back door, eager to see how her mistress was faring, only to have her face fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, Thiel?\" she asked, noticing the look of discomfort on Rozalin's sleeping face. Her heart fell, her mind wracked with a hint of guilt that it was one of her meals that had put her mistress in such a shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her chair broke. Seems that even ones made for the giant that was the former Zenon can't hold our Mistress for very long when someone tampers with her food...\" he replied, now smelling a faint hint of various non-lethal toxins. Mariana looked shocked as Thiel went on. \"It seems someone wanted to place the new Zenon out of commission, yet not kill her, and they found an effective way to do so. Lady Rozalin never was one to handle poisons very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...who could have done so? You personally supervised the preparation of the food, and you would have caught any whiff of poison. Right?\" Mariana asked, following Thiel as he carried the now-sleeping Rozalin to her chambers. Entering, Thiel set the sleeping girl down and smiled, brushing a strand of hair from her eyes and patting her big, gurgling tummy before motioning for Mariana to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have, though this nose isn't what it used to be. We'll just have to be cautious. I think it's high time that instead of the chefs cooking, they supervise. I've been thinking of outsourcing recently, and I have just the people in mind.\" he chuckled, while Mariana simply looked puzzled.</span></div></div>",

After a swift investigation, Theil chuckled as he hauled the five offenders to the roof of the palace, where he turned and faced them..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The infamous 'Idiot Ais'...I should have known. You do realize that Lady Rozalin was just learning how to use her pistol back then, right?\" Thiel chided, grabbing the Sinner that had guarded Rozalin the night before and hurling him skywards, much to the dismay of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still shot us full of holes!\" the Felynn protested, her ample belly and rear the hint that Thiel had needed to close the case, as was the fact that she was currently munching on a monstrously huge chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not exempt you from your crimes.\" he said, sighing and throwing the Iron Knight towards the east, a comically long yell echoing as he flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should! I mean, we didn't kill her or anything!\" a voluptuous female Fighter said, crossing her arms over her substantial bust. She had added another clue thanks to her blimped hourglass shape., much to Thiel's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it DOES NOT.\" he growled, snatching at the third Ai brother and pitching him downwards, burying him deep in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Spare us!\" Mai yowled, getting to her knees and clasping her paws. \"We'll do anything! We've already been affected by our own poison, and our figures are ruined...we'll serve without pay if we have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai, the Fighter, nodded in agreement. \"Yeah! Heck, we'll be Lady Rozalin's private handmaidens, if she'll have us! I've always been better at dressing people up than slicing them down, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...I'll speak with the Mistress. I have other things to attend to anyways. Dinner may very well be an occasion for the century!\" Thiel chuckled, turning and clicking down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're the Pirate Chefs?\" Thiel asked an especially gruff looking sage with a peg leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chef Pirates, actually. Keeps us from getting sued by riled-up manga-ka.\" The leader of the Chef Pirates responded, a buff Baciel with an especially large chefs hat adorning its head and a peg leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...anyways, I'm skeptical now that I see you. I mean, Baciels and Wood Golems cooking? You only have one arm, and from my experience you're fairly slow.\" Thiel said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as though he had heard the argument before, the head chef turned and grabbed a frying pan, cracking a few eggs into it and holding it over his plasma cannon. Creating a gentle stream of energy from it, he had a delicious looking omelet done in a matter of seconds. \"Slow we may be, but we've got built in tools.\" he said, flipping the egg dish perfectly onto a plate. \"And call me Beff. This is my first mate, Tonji.\" he added, nodding to a blonde haired Sinner, who nodded slightly and said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet all of you. Anyways...is there any chance you can begin preparing dinner? I'm guessing Lady Rozalin will be ravenous when she wakes up, thanks to treachery performed earlier in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! A pity about that too...no one should ever tamper with food. It's just downright dishonest!\" Beff growled, tromping over to Thiel and clapping his hand on the Sentinel's shoulder. \"Trust me, we've got the best Mystic Beasts in the business. If any poison gets in the food, we'll know about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in satisfaction, Thiel shook the Baciel's hand and made to leave. As he left, he bumped quite literally into Mariana, who blushed and chuckled. \"My my...I didn't know you were so starved for attention, Lord Thiel.\" she joked as he came up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny. Mariana, I have news for you. I'll be reassigning you and your staff. I'll be running this by Beff tomorrow, but perhaps it's time we tricked the population of the castle. Two cooking forces might foil anyone trying to poison Lady Rozalin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea...besides...I've heard of these Pirates. Their cooking is none too refined. Nothing befitting our mistress...\" she agreed, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for now, I think it's time we rested up for dinner. It may be an interesting event, if my guess is correct.\"</span></div></div>",

Her bosom, naturally large, was now straining her top beyond belief, the poor shirt just unable to cover both them and her new potbelly. As she stood there, her tummy hung just below her waist, a pale and smooth outcropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, her hips flared out with squishy padding, and combined with her chubby buns, they had blown the button off of her pants, while her widened thighs were straining the legs. She took a few steps over, her body quivering, and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...I could say I feel better than ever. It's much warmer in here now that I have my own built-in padding, you know.\" she joked, poking her squishy midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThiel stared in amazement for a few moments before Mariana knocked him on the head, bringing him to his senses. Clearing his throat, he offered his hand to his mistress. \"M...milady, what we came here for was to escort you to dinner.\" he stammered, using a slight coughing motion to mask wiping a trickle of blood away from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great! Oh...but why are you here, Mariana?\" Rozalin asked, addressing the plump succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thiel relieved me of my duties as head chef. At least for the main population of the castle. A small handful of people will be assisting in making your dinner, while we recruited a well known band of pirates to work on the food for the main population alongside the already present force. We're using a few wolves to sniff out any potential hazards, so there shouldn't be any poisons in tonight's meal.\" Mariana said, going through the speech that Thiel had prepared to soothe Rozalin's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...very well then!\" she said, shrugging and taking Thiel's hand and leading him from the room, the poor Sentinel being dragged along while Mariana simply followed, giggling lightly at his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a large table alongside Thiel and Mariana, Rozalin massaged her grumbling tummy, eager to begin eating. Thiel and Mariana smiled as the doors to the private room opened, a busty red-headed Overlord clad in s leotard entered, smiling gently at the assembled people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rozalin! I've heard so much about you from Mariana and Thiel.\" Overlord Prier gushed, striding over and smiling. \"Though not about your waistline!\" she giggled, poking the larger girl's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you aren't very up to date!\" Rozalin replied, a titter escaping her lips as her belly bounced. \"Thiel, Mariana...you never told me you knew Lady Prier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm one of the first people she decked in the Dark World...made me work with her and those other demon exterminators...\" Thiel mumbled, looking away as the three girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I used to be one of her servants until I was enlisted by that Fake Zenon. To be honest, the reason I and the others have such nice figures is because of the recipes she brought to the Underworld with her! They're just so scrumptious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozalin and Prier smiled, only to hear Rozalin's tummy snarl in hunger. \"Heh heh...guess I'm really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's get eating!\" Prier said, sitting down across from Thiel just as a stream of Sinners and plump Succubi started to place tray after tray on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...these are some good looking dishes!\" Thiel said, lifting one of the lids to reveal an entire deboned and glazed Abraxas. \"Though a bit unnerving...I guess only Pirates would have the guts to cook something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing lids clatter on the floor, Thiel looked up to see his three female companions eagerly digging in. Chuckling, he pushed his tray away and secretly pulled out a round purple case. Popping a pill out of it, he swallowed it and sat back to enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes prior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's looking perfect, Beff. Just let me know if you need any additional assistance. I can always call for one or two more people from Mariana's staff to help you.\" Thiel said, smiling and clapping a hand on Beff's large shoulder as he grilled a massive steak for the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Beff replied, tossing the steak behind him onto a mammoth pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThiel simply walked away, though a door into the portion of the kitchen reserved for Lady Rozalin's private chefs. Looking over the dishes, he smiled slightly as he pulled out a tiny packet. Sprinkling tiny amounts of a fine powder onto each dish, he looked over a pudgy Felynn's shoulder, smiling his winning smile and slipping his arm around, managing to sprinkle the last of it on the dish. Striding from the kitchen, he adjusted his vest and headed off, eager to deliver Mariana's lunch to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the three demonesses stuff their faces, Thiel glanced at his nails for a moment before getting up, striding over to Rozalin and scooting a large plate of Gehenna Goulash in front of her. His next stop was Prier, and a heaping platter of Deep Fried Dragon Wings was placed in front of her gently. Over to Mariana, and he grinned as he set a large platter of Barbecued Basilicrow. Giving each girl's rounded tummy a quick pat and rub, he walked over to the door, ready to shout the alarm when they finished eating.</span></div></div>",

But that would wreak havoc on my figure.\" She added with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding into the hall, Thiel smiled at her and crossed his arms as he drew near. \"I take it everything was to your liking?\" he asked with a grin, resulting in a playful glare from Rozalin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Everything was downright horrible!\" She replied, giggling gently as she stood up. A tiny potbelly poked through the fabric of her gown, leaving the normally slim Overlord with what looked like an undersized bowling ball for her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Lady Rozalin, I'm offended!\" a playfully seductive voice chimed in, the owner drifting up and chuckling. \"I had my chefs pour their heart and soul into those dishes you gobbled up with such abandon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariana's right, Rozalin.

I think I need a bit of time to digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" He said, taking her hand and wrapping an arm around her shoulder, guiding her along as the heavy, rich meal started to lull her into an overfed stupor. \"It's likely for the best, from what I can see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very...very funny Thiel...\" She mumbled, flopping forward in his grip and starting to sleep. All Thiel did was chuckle and pick her up, striding along to her room gently and soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...it's good to see her recuperate from a heartbreak so quickly...and I know what can only help the situation.\" He reasoned as he entered her room, setting his stuffed Overlord into bed and covering her gently. \"I believe that things have calmed enough that I can invite a few close friends to give her company.\"</span></div></div>",

Serving Rozalin and all've really mellowed him out, I'd imagine! He's got a lovely little blonde-haired red-eyed demon girl all of his own!\" Priere grinned and hopped off of the gate, landing next to the newcomer and placing and arm around her shoulder. \"Thiel, meet Noel Cressoon!

Within moments, Prier and Noel gazed into the room with wide eyes, gazing at a single feasting overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozalin sat at the head of the massive banquet table, quickly yet politely decimating a large plate of steak. A round, pale tummy sat gently on her lap, the material of her corset unable to cope with the rampant pudge. Her shape easily dwarfed Prier's, her thighs and rear end a good deal larger than the redheaded baton-twirler's. Each cheek of her rump squished through the back of the chair, bulging buttcheeks almost swallowing what could only be called a miniskirt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of fattened breasts managed to rest within her bustier, though a valley of cleavage managed to express itself by pressing against a soft, barely noticeable double chin. Striding up to his fattened ladylord, Thiel chuckled. \"What do you think girls? Look more like an overlord, yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her feast, Rozalin chuckled. \"Oh hush, Thiel. It's not my fault if the other overlords are still afraid to attack out of fear that I might go Zenon on them!\" she laughed, her face cherubic as she did so. \"But anyway...Prier! Noel! It's so good to see the both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel stared dumbfounded at the weighty woman, though Prier was hardly as speechless. \"You're a total LARD-ASS!

Very well, I shall try another, simpler syntax then; I plan to show my extravagance and my class among other, lesser Demons by becoming among the fattest Demons in the Netherworld.

Her last line, aimed towards Prier had a tone of friendly teasing to it, which made Prier stand back up straight with a scoff as she smirked. Instead of wearing the mask of a bloodthirsty Overlord, she felt happy letting her real, spirited self who she had been since back when she was human shine through around such a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright...so you wanna show everyone how great a Demon you are by getting fat right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoel managed to recover as she got up and rubbed her bleeding forehead, tears hanging in the corners of her eyes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It really has been a routine existence in the Evil Academy lately, ever since Mao defeated the Super Hero Auram and basically became the new Dean of the school (and in the process the Overlord as well), things have been strangely quiet as of late...well as quiet as a school full of evil demons can be anyways. At least in their sense, there was the usual ditching of class, learning how to backstab and basically be the evil beings they were meant to be by nature.Surely a place such as this, which is sometimes regarded as 'the root of all evil in the netherworld' hasn't any business being so quiet and uneventful, well things may take a change for the better as we begin this tale...let's watch shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Somewhere within the School (there's really no telling where, being it constantly expands)...-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, it sure has been boring around here\" Sighed a martial artist, as he lazily strolled through the halls his hands behind his head and a bored look in his sharp eyes. It would appear so being he has been wandering these halls for more than a couple hours, of course he himself hasn't been keeping track of exactly how many hours he's been roaming about...Math isn't really his best subject anyways. \"When is something gonna happen already, I'm just itchin' to test my new 'Blazing Tiger Flame Punch' on someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Ojisama, I sort of like it this way~\" Came the soft of Ojisama's sole pupil, Niku. However she was a female warrior who had appearantly wanted to study how to use fists rather than her swords. And even though she was enthusiastic about her training, she was rather terrible one in terms of skills, often screwing up on her techniques or forgetting how to perform them, although her terrible skill is backed by amazing luck in which case whenever she screws up something good may come out of her own mistake. It has happened more than once during her time spent in the Academy, and has given her the title of 'Uber Jynx'. Despite this, she still considers Ojisama her greates rival even though he has no title to speak of for himself. \"But, if it's action you want then I've heard that there's a new club that an Honor Student had started not too long ago, I'm thinking about asking Kyoko-senpai if she's joining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Since when did an Honor Student start a club...and more importantly why, haven't I heard anything about it?...\" Ojisama answered in a tone of surprise as he stopped for a few moments and stared at Niku who shook her head and tried not to laugh at her friend's obvious stupidity on the matter...Ojisama falls true into the archetype of being physically powerful but mentally incompetent, often not paying much attention to his surroundings or using his impulse alone to go through problems which usually only make things alot worse than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you hardly pay attention to anything, Knucklehead\" Niku teased as she knocked on his forehead with the back of her knuckle, hollow 'conk' sound emitting from Ojisama's head as she did so. It would appear that there's almost nothing inside Ojisama's head except vacant space...and perhaps a brain as well if you want to be in denial of the situation. \"Honestly, Ojisama it's been all over the Academy, I don't see how you could miss something like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Martial artist simply shrugged as he gave his follower a blunt answer \"Well, I'm not too big on rumors, they're only a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's more of a fact than it is a rumor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!? Since when!?\" Ojisama jumped back as if this was something he had just heard...which it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...Let's just go find them already...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much to find the demons both Ojisama and Niku were looking for, it was fairly easy to predict where they were, most demons (when not in their classes) usually congregate in the main area of the school. In the main area there were always a variety of monsters to marvel (or grimace) at, most from different grades and rankings, occasionally some legendary students like Honor Students or Class Reps stop by usually to rall their cronies to come with them to Homeroom or something of the like. But, mostly they usually only showed up to show off just how much of a big shot they were compared to the lower ranking students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kyoko*-senpai~\" Niku mused as she trotted over to the pink clad ninja demoness. Niku had admired Kyoko ever since she first met her during the Mao's fight with Rasberyl but, when asked as to why she admired her so, Niku refused to speak of the matter claiming it was a secret. Being Niku refused to speak on the matter most simply believed it was a passive form of breast envy(?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Warriors are, in fact, flat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Niku, good to see you again\" Kyoko said with a smile (although you couldn't really due to that face mask and all), she then took notice of Ojisama lazily following behind the, obviously more energetic, Female Warrior. \"Hm? Sir Ojisama, you came too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got kinda bored wandering around doin' nothin'.\" Ojisama yawned as he dug his pinky deep into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiku looked around and noticed the area was short one Rasberyl and one Asuka, something that was rare within itself. \"Huh? Where are Rasberyl-sama and Asuka-senpai, aren't they going to check out that club too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're on their way from buying supplies for the trip to the club\" Kyoko answered \"Sir Zerik here agreed to lead us to the clubroom, being we don't really know where it is\" Kyoko pointed to a Battle Master who sat on the stairs, his large Demon Smasher at his side. Zerik had various scars on his naked chest and shoulders, proof of the many battles in the past he had to endure, even his crimson bandanna showed wear and tear as the end of it was singed and blackened as if someone had set it on fire recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZerik used to fight along side Mao (just like Ojisama and Niku) as well, before everything was resolved in the end, that is. After which Zerik simply wandered around the school doing things to his liking and leisure, many of his close acquantices never heard from him since then. Some even thought that he had actually died somewhere within the Academy. \"How's it goin'?\" He greeted \"It's been a long while hasn't it, I can't even remember the last time I saw you two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? You're joining too Zerik?\" Ojisama inquired to the seasoned Battle Master who shook his head solemnly in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I'm not that big of a club guy so I'd rather remain a freelancer.\" Zerik stated before he smirked and glanced at Ojisama \"But I'll keep an eye on things though, Honor Students can be pretty brutal on new recruits, and we don't even know why this guy even founded this new club either\" If one couldn't see it, then it was obvious that Zerik was hiding his interest of this mysterious club by pretending to be their body gaurds, in all honesty this was possiby the sole reason he agreed to lead them there...because he was interested in the club to begin with. If you wanted to join Zerik, there's no reason to hide it behind false senses of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but the mystery of it all is what makes the club so appealing.\" The pink kunoichi stated matter of factly. \"But, for right now we could wait for Lady Berly and Asuka to return or we could go by ourselves, I told them I would send Sir Zerik back to get them if I did decide to go by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*In the US version of the game, Lilian goes by 'Kyoko Needleworker'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I say we go on ahead\" Zerix proposed as he got up catching the attention of the other 3 who stood nearby \"If I know this Academy then I know alot of demons are going to applying to join that club in hopes of out performing that honor student, if we leave now we have a better chance of checking it out and hopefully be the first to join.\" As plausible as that sounded, it would still mean leaving behind Beryl and Asuka, which Kyoko wasn't really set on doing just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but are you sure you can find your way back to tell them where we are?\" Kyoko questioned, to which the battle master nodded with a confident grin on his war scared face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've traveled this Academy more times than any of you, I know my way around\" Zerik boasted as he hoisted his Demon Smasher over his shoulder and motioned the 3 to follow. \"Come, we can still beat the rush if we move on now\" Zerik then moved on as he began to journey, although he didn't go to the Dimension Guide like most students did when they wanted to go somewhere...instead he looked as though he'd be traveling on foot to their location. \"Hey...aren't you gonna see the Dimension Guide?\" Niku asked more than a bit puzzled by Zerik's choice of travel. Students can and will get lost in the Academy...it's practically customary now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I travel on foot, been doin' that for as long as I can remember actually\" Zerik replied in a rather dry tone, which could probably mean he had grown bored of wandering during the years within the Academy. \"Anyways we should move along...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarping the distance is one thing, but walking there is an entirely different ball game. Not only was it time consuming but it was physically exhausting, at least it counted as excercise for those trying to trim down on their waistline, but if you were to gaze upon Kyoko's healthy and volumptous figure, as well as Niku's slender physique, then walking would be the least of their concearns. Ojisama didn't seem to have too much trouble with walking, most of the time he had distracted himself from the long journey by simply thinking on random things that occasionally popped into his (usually empty) cranium, or the ocasional glance at Kyoko's large and generous bosom, the supple mounds bouncing and jiggling slightly with each step the pink clad kunoich took. It is only the sound of Niku's voice that snaps him back to reality...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, how much longer do we have?\" The green haired maiden asked trying to mask the fact that she was whining about the long distance they tredded. \"I've been walking for so long I don't think my legs would stop moving even IF I sat down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle master only chuckled at Niku's complaint and glanced back to her \"I wouldn't worry we're nearly there, we just have to cross over into the next building and we'll be home free\" This made Niku groan a little more, how could there be more walking...this was unfair, just down right unfair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on the march to the club, Kyoko took the time to notice that the corridors of the Academy were somewhat crowded with demons of many shapes, sizes, and classes. She could probably guess that most were possibly skipping out on class. However what struck her as odd was the fact that none of them were following in their direction to the club. As popular as Honor Students are, there should be a line of demons traveling to that club to sign up. 'Hm...any of you notice how we're the only ones headed in this direction?\" Kyoko asked to the 3 others \"If this club was founded by an Honor Student then there should alot more demons following after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Kyoko-senpai has a good point there...I was expectin' all these demons to be following us\" Niku said as she looked back to a group of Heavy Knights who seemed to be conversing on things of their own matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably didn't know...like I did\" Ojisama answered with a shrug taking his eyes off Kyoko's large bosom for once during the entire trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not going to bet my Hel on that one...\" Niku replied in a teasing like tone, which Ojisama took offense in...those words did mean that Niku was calling him stupid, if not, retarded. Needless to say it was these words that threw the two into a verbal confrontation. Kyoko herself ducked from between the two of them and was now side by side with Zerik. To be honest, Kyoko didn't really know how to strike up a conversation with Zerik being she wasn't too sure on wht he liked besudes wandering around, and she was sure that he had enough of that. So she simply walked beside the battle master all the while listening to Ojisama and Niku's argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Zerik came to a halt as he stood in front of a pair of doors his head tilting from left to right as he began inspecting it to make sure this was the club they wanted. \"Hm, this looks to be it...\" Zerik remarked with Niku and Ojisama looking up from their verbal spat to pay what Zerik said some mind. \"Alright this is the place\" He announced to the 3 of them before backing up some and taking his seat by the club's entrance. \"What you do from then on is up to you, but I still wish ya luck on getting in\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't seem like there was anyone here, there didn't seem like any thing was going on behind the closed door, in fact it was completely silent behind it. Niku stepped toward the door and placed her pointed ear to it's surface hoping to hear at least some activity behind the door. But, alas, nothing could be made out from behind it. \"Did you hear anything, Miss Niku?\" Kyoko asked to the warrior who only stood up and shook her head in response. \"It's as if no one's even there...\" She paused for a moment before her face froze in disbelief \"Don't tell me we walked ALL this way...for nothing?\" This is what basically shook her up the most, the initial journey to this exact location was long and murder on her feet (which were within heavy metal boots).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's it, after all Zerik said he knew the way\" Kyoko pointed out as she crossed her arms over her full chest \"Perhaps they're not in yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh if that's the case then there's only one way to get in...\" Ojisama said as he cracked his knuckles, turning his gaze to Zerik \"You gonna give me a hand with this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, s'all yours...\" Zerik replied nonchalantly as he leaned to the wall to relax a bit before he would begin walking back for Asuka and Rasberyl. \"Just try not to cause too much of a rukus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah I gotcha.\" Ojisama then crouched down holding his fist back as he focused on the closed door in front of him \"I've been dying to try this move out...now I finally get my chance\" The martial artists continued to focus on the doorway, a hot aura beginning to undulate around his crouched form causing his loose jacket to flow as hot air circulated around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Sir Ojisama...what are you going to do?\" The kunoichi questioned not quite grasping the reason as to why he was crouching down, after all that position made him look like some kind of animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' much, just be sure to stand back though\" Ojisama replied a crazy grin snaking across his face, which only made the kunoichi worry a little more of what was to come, but still she stood back just as Ojisama said. He wouldn't say something like that unless something big was about to happen. The tempreture in the area quickly began to increase as more heated energy began to build around the martial artist, Niku began to fan herself futiley as beads of sweat began to form on her body. \"Geeze is it just me or is it getting hotter all of a sudden...\" She glanced over to Kyoko who also seemed to be feeling the mysterious heat although she had a small japanese styled fan in her hands and was using that to try and cool herself down. Zerik also seemed effected by the heat but didn't say much about it. \"You're not the only one, Miss Niku...\" Kyoko lamented the cool air from the fan she held not doing much to beat the growing heat around her. \"Although, I'm fairly certain Sir Ojisama is the cause of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko was indeed correct, Ojisama was the source of the mounting heat that was filling the air around them, although Ojisama himself didn't seem to be affected by said heat at all, his tanned and muscular body not even showing the slightest sign of sweat. It was as if the hot atmosphere didn't even apply to him when he was in this focused state. \"Tiger...\" Ojisama began reeling back his fist as he crouched down a little further still maintaing his focus on the door. \"...Flame...!\" The hot air around him suddenly ignited now granting Ojisama with an aura made of pure fire, yet his still remained entire body was unscathed by both heat and fire. \"PUNCH!\" And with everything behind him, Ojisama burst forward, al of the fire that surrounded him, coating his fist. The roaring flames just breifly took on the shape of a tigers head before it slammed into the closed door before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud explosion, that could only be described as the roar of a beast, the door immedieatly caved to Ojisama's flaming fist, flying inward off it's hinges and into the room it was keeping the trio out of. Ojisama smirked as he rose up and looked back to the group, his arm still steaming from the intense heat it had around it. \"Well, the doors open NOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you broke it down, Knucklehead!\" Niku chided her hands on her hips \"What'll the club leader think about this when he (or she) finds out you busted in when he (or she) wasn't inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Niku has a point, I don't think you could've used (that much) force to open the door...\" Kyoko added in, matter of factly. \"You could have knocked also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Don't worry about, we're demons remember,\" Ojisama shrugged as he started inside the newly opened room \"If anything they'll probably compliment us for bustin' in so dramatically\" Which would only apply to him if that were true, being he was the only one who applied force to the door to begin with. Inside it looked like any other classroom only there were posters placed about the room. The desks were all haphazardly thrown and tossed about the room (prodominately in the back of the room), and on the chalk board there was a message written in large letters. \"...Boo Dawg's Straight Crunk Club...?\" Ojisama reead aloud more than a little confused at this phrase...the only word he knew in it being 'club' the rest was like som other language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Niku questioned both her and Kyoko stepping inside the classroom to see just what it looked like on the inside...which is pretty much a let down being for an Honor Student the place looks like a bunch of low class demons had a party and left everything in a complete upheavel. \"And why's this place so...messed up, shouldn't it be alot more...I dunno...polished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this room does look a little out of order, to be in the hands of an Honor Student...\" \"Maybe that's the way the club functions, desks aren't always used in club meetings after all, though they could have organized them a bit better than this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo yo yo! Don't be hatin' on my clubroom, homie!\" Shouted a loud voice as  the lights suddenly shut off, drenching the room in complete darkness save for the only light coming from hole where the door used to stand. Things were about to get interesting...and that's not only due to the rather 'unique' use of words this stranger used either...</span></div></div>",

Ojisama assumed a combat ready stance jumping in front of the 2 demonesses as a defensive measure which to Niku was more than a bit annoying, she disliked being protected being it makes her look weak...something a warrior such as herself cannot stand for. \"What're you doin' I can fight for myself\" She protested as she stepped beside Ojisama who simply shrugged \"You just make sure you can keep up with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be careful still\" Kyoko warned the both of them as she stepped up to the challenge \"It's still dark in the room so the enemy could strike from anyside of us, if we remain sharp we might be able to counter whatever they throw at us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, senpai...\" Niku nodded as she kept her eyes ready for any movement, and her ears at attention for the same. The room was deathly silent, yet with it's silence came a thick tension that hung heavily in the air. Something was bound to happen, it was just a matter of when...and from what angle it would occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megaton Kilo Crush!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOjisama looked over his shoulder and caught sight of a large figure barreling down from above \"Heads up!\" He shouted as he and Niku and Kyoko quickly dodged before a loud 'CRASH' thundered through the darkened room. Niku looked up and saw the shadowed figure of a Fight Mistress, a God Buster to be precise, although said figure was alot rounder than the usual, her arms chunky  enough to even be noticed when inside the large sleeves of her outfit. Niku could see the prodigious curve of her right hip in the light, it's sheer wibth straining the pants that she wore to the near limits. With a giggle the sneaky martial artist leaped back into the shadows, her thick legs making little to no sound as she did so, despite her size. \"Oh no you don't, no one sucker punches me and expects it to slide!\" Niku shouted as she threw all reason out the window and charged into to the darkness after her assaliant, much to the chargin of Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Niku wait!\" Kyoko shouted to the brazen warrior who only disappeared into the darkness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you dammit!\" Niku fumed as she gave chase into the darkened room looking for the Martial Artist who tried to crush her and her friends under that huge butt of hers. Was this a foolhardy decision on her end, yes it most certainly was. But, Niku herself wasn't going to just let someone get away with something like that. Even though it's common for demons to be sneaky and under handed like this, Niku found it infuriating to be on the business end of it. The enraged lady warrior slowed her run to a walk as her clouded mind, soon realized that she couldn't see two feet in front of her. 'Uh...maybe this is bad...' she thought now knowing that she could have easily played into that martial artists trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peek-a-boo~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiku whirled around and only saw a fattened fist connect with the center of her face, the large amount of force behind it was enough to send her off her feet and flying back into the pile of desks that littered the back of the clubroom. Niku fell to the floor facefirst and groaned as the pain in her back throbbed through out her body. \"Show yourself...\" Niku demanded weakily the wind being knocked out of her from the collision she took earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, you must not be that good at CQC...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose veyr words are what did it for Niku, nobody downs her abilities like that, with a sudden burst of anger, Niku ignored the pain in her back and sat up to her knees \"...How's about...you say that to my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiku stiffened as she heard that voice, she got up to her knees and prepared to shield herself from another punch but, only found a soft and cushiony feeling press against her face. This was no punch...it was too warm and soft to be something so painful. It was almost like a pillow had been placed onto her face, it's soothing warmth making Niku relax a bit. She looked up and what she saw made her pupils shrink, for looking down at her with a faint smile was the very God Buster that had knocked her senseless. It turns out the pillow Niku rested on...was her soft tummy. </span></div></div>",

Niku pulled herself from the rotund fight mistress' middle and rolled to her blind spot. With unworldly speed, Niku pounced upward to begin a Triple Strike, unfortunetly her foot slipped and she fell over herself into a forward sumersault, sending her metal boot crashing into the God Buster's middle. Although Niku was thrown over her self in a chaotic manner, she could feel her leg jam into her victim's love handle and was certain that with that amount of force, and fom a metal boot no less, she could at least do some damage to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that was not the case. The chunky God Buster simply giggled at Niku's scrawny leg that had lodged itself into her flabby love handle and simply grasped it tightly. \"Y'known, I would have let you go had you not kicked me just now\" She said to the captured Valkryie who began to squrim to get free. However, her struggles did nothing to stop the God Buster from going through with her retaliation. She whirled Niku around and flung her into the air, sending her body flying upward before she followed suit by throwing herself upward. Her massive form slowly coming over top Niku's own slender body and it didn't take much for the Female fighter to know where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tartarus...\" She began drawing out the name of the attack that would bring about judgement on Niku. Time was swiftly slipping away from the doomed fighter who futilly began striking the area that took the least amount of damage. \"Craaaater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the God Buster's pudgy body suddenly came down on top of Niku, lodging her face into her pillow breasts and putting the rest of her body into the fat of the God Buster that was taking her down into what would be the biggest Body Slam she would ever experience. \"Nighty-Night...\" She taunted in a sadistic tone as her heavy frame finally impacted the floor of the classroom, the sheer amount of force generated creating a massive shockwave that quaked the floors and letting loose a low and thunderous 'BOOM' that rumbled throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe God Buster lay on her front for a few moments before she hoisted herself up to examine the aftermath of her attack; She had managed to put a large gash into the class floor, and Niku lay jammed into the floor spread eagle and motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what...in the world...are you...\" Niku managed to choke out, despite having god knows how many pounds pressed against her body at such an astounding force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what, who\" The God Buster remarked. \"They call me, Flora Windsnapper, Master of 'Heavy Fist' the Kilo no ken.\" Flora plopped down onto the floor beside the crater she had made, her ponderous bottom making a low thud as it hit the floor. She gazed at the body of the defeated Valkyrie and tilted her head, having faced a number of them she hasn't really seen or heard of one who chose to use their bare hands against her. This one was an odd one out, something she took an interest in no less. \"But enough about me, I want to knwo who you are, little girl~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's...Niku Habachan...\" Niku replied as she painfully pulled herself from the crater and glowered at the copulent fight mistress before her. \"And I'm not little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee, to me you are~\" Flora taunted as she poked her tounge out to her, knowing full well the Valkryie wouldn't attempt to fight back lest she wish to get beat down again. \"Anyways, what are you doing here, Little Niku?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to join your club, I mean, you're apart of it right?\" Niku said to Flora who paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that I am.\" She finally answered \"But to join you're going to need to ask Master Boo Dawg\" Niku's heard that name somewhere before...Oh right! It was on the board back at the front. So it looks like this 'Boo Dawg' is the President of this club, but there was one problem; Niku didn't even know where this Boo Dawg was, well she did know he was in the room but with everything dark like this, it was hard to tell where to go in order to find him. \"Still, you didn't do very good with trying to defeat me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I? My attacks didn't even hurt you!\" Niku shouted in an agitated tone. \"Your fat helped you cheat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee, the size of your waistline shouldn't determine the out come of battle. After all, you could have hurt me if you hit me in places besides my belly y'know~\" Flora giggled as she gave her large belly a hardy slap causing it to jiggle about. Niku couldn't understand how Flora could love being so huge and obese the way she was, although to be fair, she WAS a deadly powerhouse with all that weight behind her punches, so perhaps that's the main reason for her optimistic attitude towards her overweight status. \"Maybe if Master Boo Dawg's feeling generous he might let you join...he's been looking for girl's like you lately.\" Flora added as she lazily fell to her side, her pudgy cheek resting in the palm of her fatty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wh-what's that supposed to mean?\" Niku inquired taking the statement the wrong and thinking she was a target for someone looking for a girl friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find out soon enough~\" Unfortunately for her, the God Buster wasn't exactly going to reveal details on that matter just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back at the front-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOjisama glanced over his shoulder to check on Kyoko, she seemed okay though a little taken aback by what she just heard and felt. Earlier on the both of them were thrown off their feet by a huge quake that seemed to originate from the back of the room. Automatically, the both of them feared the worst for poor Niku who had infact been defeated by the attack that caused such a commotion. \"We should hurry to Miss Niku's aide, Sir Ojisama!\" Kyoko suggested the fatalist not arguing in the least as he burst forward ready to charge into the blackness, his student disappeared into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Niku, we're on our-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before they could even make a move any where near the shadows, a sharpened Axe jammed into the floor before them, looking over Ojisama and Kyoko came to see a Magic Knight now standing in front of the door, though her widened physique was eclipsing what little light that shone inside. \"I don't think you'll be going anywhere...\" The magic knight said in a cold tone her body now moving forward as her wide hips rocked from side to side. \"Master Boo Dawg, has ordered me to 'busta cap' in anyone who 'talkin' smack' about our club\" She added as she placed a hand on her axe and easily pulled it from the floor it was lodged in. The Magic Knight didn't seem that hindered by the weight of her weapon nor her body, which is a rarity in both senses, no doubt this advisary was a powerful one to be able to weild such a weapon with no strain on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't...how do you say, 'Talkin' smack' about anything\" Kyoko raised an eyebrow to the magic knights last words. What does 'talking smack' and 'busta cap' mean anyway? \"We were simply here to investigate this strange club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A likely story...\" The massive magic knight scoffed, readying her axe for the coming battle. \"Everyone always says that...before I defeat them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho, you think you're all that just because you're big and you have an Axe huh?\" Ojisama commented as he cracked his knuckles, also readying himself to strike back against this rounded woman. Usually, he would have a bit of a problem with fighting female opponents, but found that this called for an exception as she was not only hostile to him and Kyoko but was also MUCH bigger than any female opponent he's faced up until now. \"Well then, let's go fatass! You may be a woman but I won't hold back on you!\" Ojisama charged to the Magic Knight, his quickness taking her by surprise and allowing him to get in the first hit of the battle that would soon follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ojisama Punch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Squish*</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I thought you said you wouldn't hold back.\" The magic knight giggled ominously as a confident smirk spread on her chubby face. Of course, she had every reason to be confident, for her attacker's fist was lodged deep with the folds of her belly fat thus not delivering any damage to her what so ever. Ojisama could only stare in disbelief as he saw his opponent's gut practically absorb his attack as if it were nothing worth calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hold up, what the hell's goin on here!\" Ojisama questioned in shock, as he began to panic and unleash a barrage of punches of equal strength to her bulging midsection. \"Why. won't. you. go. down!\" Too bad, none of them did any damage to her, the only thing the punches were doing were jiggling the magic knight's belly about like that of a big bowl of jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Ojisama, get away from her now!\" Kyoko forewarned \"Your attacks are useless against an opponent like her!\" Sadly, she was too late in telling him as she came to see the Magic Knight bump him forward sending the fatalist rolling into the podium she stood beside and practically going right through it. \"Sir Ojisama! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you know when these stars are outta my eyes...Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to attack?\" The magic knight questioned leaning on the butt of her axe as she watched Kyoko for any movements. \"Judging by your equipment, you don't look like your equipped to take me on either...\" Which was partly true, Kyoko was a fist user just like Ojisama and Niku, and from what she saw Fist users were at a huge disadvantage to opponents like this woman. However there was still, one more option left; Zerik. He was also an Axe user and could easily put this woman in her place. But would Kyoko make it to the door before the magic knight made a move on her? She was obviously heavier than she was so she could probably get by, but if she threw that axe...well, let's try not to think about that...</span></div></div>",

She could barely stomach the stuff; it wasn't that it was bad, quite the opposite. Actually, these were very good. The trouble was that they were completely bland and just used for nutrition. Even as a military nut, she couldn't stand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, theese stuff...eet iz 'orrible!\" Spitting out the last bite she took, her flat, almost concave stomach rumbled loudly. She patted it sadly. \"Oui...we need to get some deecent food within you, my poor belly.\" Luckily, she knew a secret path to the kitchens no one had ever heard of. And slipping into a trapdoor below her, clutching her stomach, Salvatore began her little adventure for better food.<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the other side of the passage, Salvatore climbed up into a highly restricted area of the school kitchens: the experimental room. Here, the most volatile foods and spices were kept, only to be used by master chefs like Mr. Champloo. The military girl crept in, her grumbling belly causing her intense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I need to find ze food pantry...ozzerwise, I may be considered dead!\" she moaned. Picking up the nearest item off the shelf and tearing off the wrapping, she had no sense in checking what the label said before digging into her treat: a delicious and wonderful-looking egg, cheese, and sausage croissant, practically bursting with the innards. It was the size of her head, if not larger. Thick, gooey mozzarella cheese dripped from the center, enticing her to taste its meaty core. Her tongue scraped the cheese, licking off the smallest dab of the white fromage. Her mouth immediately exploded in scrumptious flavor, the smallest nibble throwing her mind into disarray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eetz...eetz...perfect!\" Salvatore exclaimed, scarfing down the rest. As her mouth wrapped around the bread, she was almost knocked out by the fluffiness and buttery bread. Chewing it rapidly, her teeth snapped down on the crisp, fat sausage slices, savoring the juiciness of it. The egg was cooked to perfection, not too yellow and not too solid, but not runny enough to leak out of the tasty breakfast dish. Before she knew it, she had already finished the entire treat, and was sitting down, licking her fingers and rubbing her slightly distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo...too much of zis one...delicious...heavenly...croissant! I feel as if I am about to burst!\" she said contentedly. Sighing, she tried to get up, but found it very painful to do so. \"What iz zis? Am I too full?\" Falling forward and landing painfully on her engorged gut, her eyes suddenly shrank, realizing with utter horror that....</span></div></div>",

Finding the wrapper, she looked at its nutritional value lablel, gasping as it said something like 100,000 calories. Besides her metabolism being such a snail, making her liable to easy weight gain, the 100,000 caloric intake she was about to experience. It actually quadrupled the amount of weight she would gain, thanks to her non-physical activities. Her thin fingers were holding her belly, which was quickly becoming softer by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, her legs began to plump, slowly filling out with flesh. Her stockings grew tight around her thickening legs, their soft, brown forms stretching the fabric. Her hips became wider, beginning to be constricted by shrinking shorts. Supple buttcheeks suddenly had new forms, swelling against the black pair of shorts. They quickly fattened, her entire lower half leaving her with an impressive two and a half foot hip span, each delicious-looking buttcheek the size of a volleyball. Her thighs were thicker around than a small girl's bicycle tire. Lithe hands grasped at her newfound curves. \"Wh-what iz zis?\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her belly bloated. It billowed out slowly, straining the top of her uniform. Starting off small, it just kept swelling until her jacket began to strain, the buttons struggling to hold in the big tummy that wanted to spill out. Her tanned flesh was still growing, the fat trying to squish itself out of the openings in her jacket. She let out an unexpected giggle; the fattening was starting to feel very...good. Her hands found her bloating gut, sinking into it a little as it continued to stretch and grow. A sharp ping! was heard as the buttons gave out, letting her fattening belly spill out onto her lap. Salvatore patted it gently. It jiggled a little, and was extremely soft to the touch. It was enticing(and addicting) to play with her new blubber. Before long, however, something interrupted her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" she sighed, looking down at her chest. It too was growing, her large breasts starting to become gargantuan. They spilled out of the top of the dress, still held together by golden buttons. However, they gave out soon; her large bosom had become so big by the few minutes they had been growing that they soon burst out of the top, tanned flesh piling into fluffy mounds. They were round and pert. \"Well..zis isn't so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she was now ravenous. Her newly developed and emptied belly roared at her to feed it. Moaning in agony again as her empty tummy growled, she began to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking for just one certain foodstuff was out of the question for now, especially since one's stomach is as ravenous as Salvatore's. <i>Everything</i> in here was at her mercy of being devoured and no one would every know...well until they came in here at least, that still didn't really stop her from beginning her food related holocaust on anything she could get her pudgy hands on, anything even remotely considered food being greedily stuffed into her hungry maw to satiate the hunger that still gripped her large, and prodigious midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~\" Salvatore moaned from the pleasurable tastes each food had, despite being experimental each one had a high quality taste to it like nothing she had ever experienced before. Better than those boring rations by a long shot, that's for sure. \"Zis...zis is heavenly!\" Salvatore exclaimed having downed a rather large Bagel like sandwhich that was filled with a mysterious, yet decadant, condiment she had little knowledge of. However it's taste was something that put her mind off the mystery of what it really was. Nothing was safe from Salvatore's hunger; Unusually spicy sausage and egg biscuit? Down the hatch it went. Experimental Turkey Sub? Say hello to Salvatore's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the various sweets and desserts that lay here were consumed by Salvatore, even though she wasn't usually one to eat sweets, but at this moment she didn't seem to care, her gluttony clouding her mind of all reason and only focusing on filling her stomach that only wanted more food still. Cakes, Cookies, Ice Cream, Candy, everything mentioned, and thensome, Salvatore had consumed. At one point, while she searched for more food, Salvatore had run into a cake hidden in a seperate room, the sheer size of the dessert dwarfing anything she's ever seen before. Did it's prodigious and somewhat imposing size stop her from eating it? Of course not, she was Salvatore the Great and, at this point, no food would go uneaten by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and devoured Salvatore had come to lay on the emptied selves of the secret kitchen, the only thing being filled in this room was the blonde's massively swollen and overstuffed middle as it struggled to digest the feast that Salvatore had indulged herself in. Had she the power, she would rewind time itself so she could experience the pleasures of her gluttony once again, even though she was quite stuffed, full to bursting even, it was actually rather nice to have her stomach filled like this. Especially since she herself came here wanting to satisfy her need for better food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, now zat *urp*...iz fine dining.\" Salvatore sighed in satisfaction as she stifled a burp and rubbed her bulging middle, the size of it having nearly tripled since her binge a few moments ago, her equally large bosom resting comfortably on her taut (yet still somewhat soft) belly. \"Although, I thought there was more in 'ere zan zis...\" Salvatore observed as she looked around the decimated selves of the kitchen. However, her gluttony would soon be payed off in full (pun not intended) later on, after all, most of these foods were experimental and thus there was no telling as to what they had in store for Salvatore's already bloated physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, for now, it didn't seem like anything would happen, nor would Salvatore be going anywhere. Being this bloated, it would be best to just wait here and let everything digest before moving on, to...huh, now that she thought about it, where else could she go from here? With the entirety of kitchen's food supply practically demolished in as little as a half hour, could there really be another place in the school that held even better food? \"Ah, I'll cross zat bridge when I geet to eet.\" the blonde says as she relaxed and let her bloated stomach do it's job... </span></div></div>",

Zis is not good!\" she worried, managing to roll off and start to drag herself along the floor right as the door opened. \"I vill be punished most severely for sure! Possibly with glass beneath my fingernails or being forced to...CLEAN...\" she added, shivering at the thought as the mystery figure stood and surveyed the carnage that Salvatore's hunger had wrought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well! It seems someone in this school has an appetite after all! And here I thought all those dishes I made back when the flames of my passion were on low were going to just sit here and rot like an badly seasoned tray of meatballs! Boom!\" an exuberant voice called out. The owner soon enough stepped in, revealing himself to be none other than the legendary Home Ec. teacher Mr. Champloo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...not him...\" Salvatore groaned, having managed to hide herself behind an upturned table. Her common sense was rapidly returning, realizing that if this crazy cook found her she would be lucky to escape with her toes wiggle-able. \"If he sees me, I am almost sure to be his next taste tester or somezing! I vill wind up MASSIVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the wailing of the table that Salvatore was hiding behind, Mr. Champloo strode over and smiled as he gazed down at the stuffed Diez Gentleman. \"Well well! Of all the people to have devoured everything in my pantry, you certainly are the last ingredient I'd have imagined!\" he laughed, crossing his arms and nudging Salvatore's enormous tummy with a foot. \"Such a ravenous appetite for a formerly skinny little bean sprout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning bright red at the pompous Home Ec. teacher's words, Salvatore struggled to stand, her uniform looking like an improvised swimsuit to her enormous form. \"Vat do you think you are doing?

So hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamploo simply chuckled and yanked out a large cookie from a pocket, watching as Salvatore followed the path of the large treat as he moved it back and forth. \"Ahhh...but you see, giving in to pure taste and gluttony comes with consequences...you might find yourself distracted by the simplest morsel of food, the tiniest crumb of stale cracker. All to satisfy the enormous belly you gained through indulging. No matter how strong the willpower, even a grain of sugar can cause a sweet tooth to take over! Boom!\"</span></div></div>",

Having been locked up in a sealed portion of St. Paprica after it had been rid of other demons by her old comrades and her brother, there had been no activity whatsoever in the Netherworld. His last words before he sealed her were, \"I'm sorry, Prier! But this is the way it has to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she batted away a mage pestering her with decrees and laws, her expression set in a very sour mood. \"I dont want to hear about it, okay?! I'm stuck in this damn section of St. Paprica, cut off from anywhere else! I'm in no manner for listening to political crap!\" Putting her head into her hands, she sighed once more before flopping back on the throne. She was so pissed off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage sensed the aura of irritation surrounding her mistress, and immediately took leave. Upon entering the vassals' quarters, she stumbled upon another one of Overlord Priere's vassals, this one happening to be an Iron Maiden. The mage then prompted to vent her frustration. \"I'm so sick and tired of this! It's been three weeks since her sealing, and it's a pain! She doesn't listen to a word I say, nor does she care about anything going on in the Netherworld. I'm tired of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Iron Maiden sighed. It had been a problem with the Overlord, as she was neither fulfilling her duties, nor even using her power properly. All Overlord Priere had been doing for the last few weeks was moping around the castle, depressed. Well, if that was the case, so be it. They'd have to hinder her somehow so she'd have to use one of her vassals as a surrogate. \"Well, we could break her legs, drug her food, or something to that effect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage smiled wryly. \"I don't think so. I think we need something where we wouldn't be suspected as a likely cause. Have you ever heard of the Sea of Gehenna and it's Netherworld-famous flan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Iron Maiden carefully thought about it. \"Yes. Why? Isn't run by a miss Nanaka and her daughter Hiruko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage shook her head, cherry red hair flying everywhere. \"Yes it is. But that's not why. Didn't you hear the incident about it where one of the Netherworld's leading kunoichis was fattened to the point of immobility, off of THEIR flan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vaguely remember it, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we hire them as our Overlord's personal chefs? She'll never suspect a thing until she's blimped up so much she can't stop us from this Netherworld's political needs,\" she said, smiling cunningly. Picking up a phone, she watched as the Iron Maiden grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be a pleasure to watch her struggle underneath breasts the size of her own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it will be..yes it will be...\" The mage dialed the phone number for Nanaka Family Flan.</span></div></div>",

Sneering, she turned to the Iron Maiden next to her. \"There's the first part of our plan! Now we wait until the two get here...which'll be right at dinner time. We'll get to see that woman finally out of the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her fist into her hand, the Iron Maiden smile. \"We'll finally be rid of her ire for a while! Everything will run smoothly...she's been a pain in the ass as far as training troops and politics go. She won't go into the assembly, which means we all get booted aside with the Nays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage took a cookie from a nearby platter and bit into it, savoring the chocolate chip. Swallowing, she smiled. \"Yes...but that's why we're taking control of this train now, and we're gonna make it run on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of sharp knocks echoed throughout Overlord Priere's castle, prompting the Red Mage and the Iron Maiden to rush to the doors, yelling, \"We'll get it, Mistress!\" to Priere. As they neared the door, the two breathlessly shoved them open, revealing the two girls in all of their *ahem* girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the person reading this knows what Adell's Mom looks like, that's kind of what Nanaka looks like. Except she has a regular demon motif, with a heart-shaped tail, and instead of Mom's short hair, she has wilder, shoulder-length, black hair. However, that's not the ONLY thing that sets her apart. She's over 300lbs, with her simple clothing stretched over an enormous bosom and a backside to match. Her pants barely contained her burgeoning thighs, which were topped with fat, wide motherly hips. A generous belly protruded from underneath her heavy rack, complementing the immensity of her hourglass figure. Her chubby face smiled in greeting as she smoothed out what she could of her apron, which looked like it was plastered onto her enormous body. \"Hello! We're the proprietors of Ambrosian Flan, and you called us for a job as head chef? Oh, by the way, I'm Nanaka, and this is my daughter Hiruko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter was just as large as she would be, if the little shaman was full grown. Nanaka had seemingly wrapped Hiruko's chest and her pelvis area in bandages to save her daughter's decency! At 200lbs, the shaman looked obese for her 12 year old body. Her pudgy body was quite round, and her thighs just as thick. She had well-developed breasts because of how much fat she had accumulated on her small body. The red mage seethed with frustration inside...this girl was younger than her by at least 300 years, and yet she STILL had bigger breasts than her! Such a fat cow...the good thing was, Overlord Priere was about to join her. Hiruko looked at her shyly, and simple looked at her huge belly, swirling the dirt with her plump feet. \"H-hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Well, come on in! It's about the time when we start preparing our Mistress's dinner, so you can get started right away!\" the mage said, trying to be friendly. Still seething at the size of Hiruko's chest, she led them to the kitchen. \"Here's the kitchen...so when can we expect dinner to be ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanaka looked oddly at the mage. \"Why? Is there something important that you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just that I want to be able to schedule a checkup on you and your daughter's cooking,\" she said sweetly. The truth was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mage had a very nasty plan in mind, something that coupled with the addictive and highly fattening nature of the foods would cause Priere to eat far more than she ever could before. It was known as the 'Gula Sample,' taken from the saliva of one of the futakuchi-onna's gluttonous mouths on the back of her head. It was such a craving-inducing substance, that it had been banned even in the Netherworld for fear of making a literal 'World Eater.' Putting this in Priere's food would ensure that she would always be hungry, and Nanaka and Hiruko would keep giving her the most fattening foods in the known universe. Both of those factors would result in a very, very fat and useless Overlord, and then the reins would be handed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one catch. If the sample wasn't ingested in a day or so, it automatically destroyed itself. The food it was in would turn to primordial ooze. A bad side effect, and it would stink worse than a zombie, but with the two family cooks' already addictive food, that was hardly a possibility. Nanaka, not noticing this or the overly sweet tone of the mage, obliged to take her into the private part of the kitchen. Inside, the red mage's jaw dropped. What she was expecting was a small meal, not a huge feast! \"Well, here we are! Three steaming pots of udon, flavored with chunks of roasted pork, cilantro, and a little bit of soy sauce. Barbecued basilisk wings, basted in a very rich honey barbecue sauce, served with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli drizzled with a special olive oil-based seasoning. Follow it up with a basket of steaming, butter drenched yeast rolls and a plate of prime rib and a delicious treat of our own, Ambrosia flan, right after dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they toured the feast, which took up five or six other counters, the red mage poured a vial of 'Gula Sample' into each dish, the silvery liquid soaking into the food with not a trace. As they finished up with Nanaka showing her a huge, cake-sized flan for Priere, she poured the biggest vial in there, and added a bit of bulking powder as well. The massive summoner turned around, just in time for the red mage to nod and smile in mock understanding. \"I see! So, should we call down the Overlord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell sounded and Hiruko came waddling out, with a bottle of strawberry wine. Nanaka smiled at her daughter's promptness, despite her overly large physique. \"I do believe you can call her down. Dinner is served!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriere gawked at the feast laid out before her. The fat little shaman was busy filling up her glass with delectable strawberry wine, bowing to her before she quickly took her leave. Rubbing her hands together in anticipation, the red mage was counting the seconds until Priere was utterly addicted to the most fattening foods ever created. The busty Overlord took her seat at the table, in awe at all the food that the two cooks had created. \"This is dinner...? Looks like an entire day's meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about if you can't eat it all, Mistress Priere! I'm sure that once you've started eating this delicious meal, you won't be able to stop!\" she said, smiling in a disgustingly sweet way. The magenta-haired Overlord looked at her as if she were a disease and picked up a spoon, ready to try the steaming udon first. The mage was almost biting her nails in utter anticipation of the gorging that was about to commence, utterly enthralled and almost drooling at Priere's movements. China spoon in hand, Priere's lips were almost touching the spoon when a Rune Knight coughed beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Overlord looked at her vassal. \"Hm? What is it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should try it first, just in case Nanaka and Hiruko &gt;happened&lt; to drop some foul substance into your food, Mistress,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriere thought about it for about a minute. Her decision was quick, and very blunt.</span></div></div>",

The darkly-dressed father of the Church of the Holy Maiden in Pot-a-Feu smirked a little, leaning back in his chair. He had just summoned Prier from her room, who was getting ready for Christmas by personally decorating her particular room for the festivities. Dressed in a different set of clothes, this one a sweater and a pair of black pants to keep her warm, it was a bit disappointing for the older gentleman who loved to see her in her normal battle blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm asking you to do is dress up as Santa Claus this year and go around delivering presents. It's good for morale! And we haven't had a good celebration in a while. Besides, all the kids love and know you, so you're naturally the best choice for it. Besides, with your...er, appetite, blowing through the milk and cookies they all leave out won't be a problem,\" Salade grinned, looking up at the now-fuming redhead. Moving over, he took out an entire Miss Santa costume from the drawer, tailored to fit Prier's rather generous curves and more conservative than her regular outfit despite its otherwise outlandish intention. Taking the costume in her hands, along with the black boots, brown stockings to keep her warm and the customary hat and sack, Prier sighed irritably in defeat and headed up to her dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triumphant smile was plastered over Salade's face. \"And one again for old Father Salade! Wonder if the sheer amount of milk and cookies will break Prier's massive appetite...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilith looked at her new castle, fashioned in the Devil's Stomach. It had been recently vacated by none other than La Pucelle itself, and so she was quite satisfied with how good of a job they had done. She had taken the time to lay the rest of the souls in peace, not wanting to disturb the rest of what La Pucelle had done. She may have been a demoness, but she was a particularly refined form of demoness. Shaking her head of long silky hair, her wings fluffing slightly, she looked at the wide hall before her, humming to herself. \"hmhmhmhm...Well, this will be an interesting turn of events. Milady wants me to turn this particular girl...Prier, into an avatar of her own desires! Well, that might be fun. She's gluttonous, already curvy, and has a special job for the coming days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked amongst the marble pillars of the grand hall towards a plush seat she fashioned for herself, tracing a cheek with her finger. \"And once I nab her with the bait, I'll reel her in here...and then the real fun will begin~\" she snickered before taking a seat on the throne. A few magic circles appeared before a couple of mages and shamans appeared, bowing politely before their mistress. Crossing her legs, she rests her head on her hands, letting out a sultry giggle at her subordinates. \"Well then...it's time for us to start...~\"</span></div></div>",

Now, knowing just that about her, we also know that this town, Pot a Feu, actually has quite a number of restaurants that she frequents as well. What does Santa Claus usually do when he gets to someone's house...besides leaving presents, of course~?\" The blunette succubus asks, humming to herself as her vassals converse. Listening to them talk amongst themselves, she bounces a trim leg, wondering what they might come up with. One of the mages quickly snaps her fingers, the red mage nodding to herself as the others agree with her conclusion. \"Yes~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He eats the milk and cookies kids leave out for him at night! It's one of the big traditions!\" She replies proudly, grinning. Clapping her hands, the succubus giggles before looking at the other three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay then~ We know that this Miss Prier is a glutton. I wonder, if a free cookie every meal would get to her faster than she thought?\" she asks with a lilting, teasing tone, chuckling softly. One of the shamans catches on, the tanned girl bounding up and down and waving her arm in the air. \"Go ahead~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's supposed to be Santa, she needs to eat the cookies! And if we can sponsor a new bakery to go with the udon shop in town, she'd have no choice but to eat them! WE get her hooked first, and come christmas eve, when all the kids get cookies for Santa, ours will be the best and cheapest, she'll scarf them down in no time!\" The tanned girl giggled before pulling her skull down over her head, a little embarrassed at her outburst before the Lilith pats her head and smiles warmly. Another happy nod this time, and the two giggle in synch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good! And one last thing...how fattening should we make the cookies? WE can't go instant-huge, not this time. And perhaps we should...amplify her strength a little. So that way, when her building-sized frame comes over, she can still walk fairly well despite her bulk~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl chimed in happily, \"How about ten or twenty pounds apiece? That way she bulks up quickly, and we can layer on a strength spell to keep her fit enough to waddle! That way, even when her feet are beanbag-sized, she can still stomp angrily as she tries to fit her thighs into the kids' houses~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had a good chuckle at this, knowing that bulk was the least of Sister Prier's worries. Oh yes. By they time they were done, she might have trouble fitting a toe into the front gate of Cresson castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the succubus and her vassals began to plot and scheme, and her servants started to weave magic the likes of which La Pucelle would be unprepared for. The smell of baking wafted through the castle halls, and through the shadows, one could see their dastardly baked goods start to come to life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before long, however, she heard the door's bell tinkle, prompting her to return to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Welcome to the Rosenqueen Company,\" she said in her smooth, lilting voice. It was cheery, but it had the calm, collectiveness of an adult's tone. The proprietor quickly faltered after entering the main room, surprised to see no one there. \"That's odd...I know the bell rung.\" Her eyes then caught a small envelope sitting on the wooden surface of the counter. It was stamped with the seal of one of the companies she sponsored at her stores. It was also stamped with the bakers' guild's seal. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the crisp letter, she plucked off the wax seal and unfolded an announcement. As of that day, the bakers' guild required anyone who sold their goods to taste-test them to make sure they were satisfying. At the bottom, besides the head chef's signature, was the John Hancock of Queen Crespine and her daughter, Princess Eclair. She sighed. \"Well, if it's signed by the queen and the princess, then it must be official. I wonder when the new pastries will come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, the letter specified that <i>ALL</i> pastries from the trial shipment must be tasted and fully eaten before declaring that the entire package is worthy for customers. This she would find out later, when the very first of the dessert shipments were coming in...<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of twittering birds filled the air. Erie woke up, stretching her lithe arms. Perky breasts bounced underneath her pajama top, straining the fabric slightly. Her blue eyes were half glued together with sleep. Getting out of her soft mattress for another day at work, she rose from the bed and headed towards the shower, needing a good pick-me-up in the form of hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a session of drying off and changing into her signature uniform, she took her place at the front of the store, only to be greeted by a massive crate, about the size of a large moving box. She looked quizzically at it. \"Is this the new shipment? Oh, there's a note on the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Dear Ms. Rosenqueen,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the part of the new program we mailed you about yesterday.<br>\r\nYou are to consume all the contents in this crate, and judge them<br>\r\nto either pass or fail for retail.

I have  to eat everything in this crate, just to deem it tasty enough? What are they thinking?\" she huffed, taking into consideration the size of the crate. The side said 'danishes.' \"There's got to be at least a hundred or more danishes in there! I can't eat it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. But if she didn't eat them, her own shop, the shop <i>she</i> started was going to be snatched from her caring hands. She couldn't let that happen. Cracking it open with a stored crowbar, she began her unintentional feast.</span></div></div>",

It fell with a wet plop onto the rest of the contents in her bloated belly, filling her up to almost-bursting point. It gurgled loudly, which made her moan in pain as she sat behind the counter, trying to soothe it. Her flesh was taught, filled to the brim with desserts. \"I don't think I could eat another bite...*urp*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her mouth politely as she let out another petite burp, feeling absolutely sick to her stomach. It groaned in agony, making her cringe. Her poor tummy had swollen to about the size of a basketball, hanging in her lap and feeling like a sack of potatoes. Poking it gingerly through the black fabric of her top, she groaned. It was completely filled. There was no way she could eat anymore, at least for the next few hours. Erie massaged it, caressing the engorged globe of flesh. Sighing, she reflected on the problems of eating this many sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I'll have no tastebuds for anything else, and I'm going to gain a crazy amount of weight once this is done and over with. I'll be bigger than Mt. Champignon before too long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ting ting!</i> She gasped in horror, almost jumping save for the fact that her stuffed belly was hurting like the devil. \"Oh no, I can't let them see me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was her lucky day as it was a very familiar face...Erin, the shopgirl for the Rosenqueen company, and the owner of this particular building. \"Hello! Erie? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-over here...\" she said shakily, her belly moaning up a storm. She was trying to stop it from roaring in pain so much, but her attempts were failing. It was so stuffed, her innie had turned into an outie and was protruding from underneath her sable top. Hearing something like a beast snarling, Erin moved over to the counter, peeking over the edge. Thankfully, she found a very stuffed Etoile instead of a monster. The moaning and snarling sounds she heard earlier was Erie's tummy trying to handle all the sweetness inside of her. \"H-hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erie, what happened? You're so...big!\" she said, amazed at the round, shiny globe that was Erie's belly. She placed her hands on it and began to massage it in circles, much to Etoile's comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah...oooh...that feels so good...please, keep going...\" Erin was enjoying this. Making her employer happy was one thing that always made her smile, and doing this to her made her smile like a Cheshire cat. The older woman's belly was starting to become softer as the food digested, adding an immense number of calories to the blond's form. Her breasts started swelling against the black fabric, followed by her belly, growing larger and ever softer. Her thighs, unseen, were fattening as well, growing by centimeters by every push and pull Erin did on Erie's now shrinking tummy. The pink-haired girl was smiling mischievously now, liking the feel of Erie's new form. \"Oh...so nice...it feels so...good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she liked feeling this good, the girl thought, maybe doing it again would make her feel even better!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin continued to knead her sore belly, starting to like the feeling of Erie's now fattened tummy. Without the blond woman noticing, she slipped a couple extra pastries down with an evil grin on her face. If she like having her belly rubbed, then she would make her have far more of it to massage. But before even that, she just had to get another taste of the softness that was Erie Rosenqueen. A more...direct approach. She nuzzled the fattened woman's belly with her cheek. This shocked Erie back into reality, as she had been knocked out because of Erin's massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee....I like your new belly! It's so soft, eri!\" the pink-haired teenager cooed, feeling the soft, warm fat beneath her cheek. SHe continued to massage Erie's belly, making the blond groan in contentment. Then her tone grew a little mischievous. \"Maybe making it bigger will make it softer, eri!\" And while Erie was busy trying to recover from Erin's surprise glomp, she had a thick, creamy eclair shoved into her mouth as she tried to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf!\" she tried saying, only to find that her entire mouth was blocked by the cream-filled, chocolate-covered treat. As she chewed and swallowed it, and again opened her mouth to speak her mind, she found it filled with another of the treats inside the display case. \"Urf! Erin, what are you-Umph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired Erin was now literally stuffing dessert after dessert into her mouth, making her have to eat them in order to breath properly. And yet, every time she opened her mouth to speak, it was stuffed with another bakery sweet. She didn't stop there either. Rubbing Eerie's belly prevented her from both getting a stomachache, and stopped her from struggling too much. Between waves of pleasure and irritation, the blond's body began to fatten up at a quick pace. Erin had now basically ripped open the dessert cabinets and was stuffing each of the delicious treats in the older woman's maw. Erie had officially given up trying to reason with the crazed girl until it was all over. Now she had to wait it out.<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...my poor tummy...it's so full...\" Erie whined. Her belly, already fat from before, had now grown to be twice that. It was sore, but oddly without any stretch marks. It sat, stuffed and filled to the brim with digesting sweets, on her lap. She could hardly move because of the pain. Erin, however, was busy cuddling it to it, a big grin on her young face. Her fingers traced rapid, soothing circles on the stuffed woman's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly's gotten even bigger, eri! But...\" Erin suddenly got another mischievous idea in her head. She imagined her sleeping on a gigantic Erie, using her belly as an ultra soft bed and her enormous breasts as pillows. \"I still think you could be bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" the blond whimpered. Now Erin had surely gone crazy!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin jumped up, eager to make her new \"bed\" even bigger. She dashed to the fridge, cheeks pink with the thought of laying down on Erie's soon-to-be massive tummy. Even the thought of immense pillow-like cleavage helped her along. Opening up the metal and plastic doors, she saw what she was looking for: an enormous stockpile of milk, freshly delivered from Mt. Tarte farms. It was still slightly warm. There had to be fifteen or sixteen different 2 gallon jugs of milk, just sitting there. She began to pull them from the fridge, setting them on a wheeled cart for food in order to transport them easily. \"This is definitely gonna help Erie-san get bigger, eri! I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting the journey back to the counter where Erie basically lay immobile with a very sore but empty belly, Erin grabbed a funnel for the milk and a large stack of cookie boxes left in the storage room to complement her stuffing plan. Her cute face broke into a wide grin as she saw Erie stare at the overloaded cart with a look of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not seriously going to do this, are you Erin? Erin-? MMPH!\" Erie was in the middle of a sentence when Erin forced the funnel between her lips, taping it around the plumpened blond's lips to prevent spills and her from spitting it out. Screwing off the cap of the first jug, she forced the shopkeep to lie back and began to stuff her once more. The glug glug of the milk jug could be heard, as well as the frantic gulping of Erie as she swallowed it as fast as she could for air. Erin had an almost maniacal smile on her face, although it was not one borne out of evil desires: she thought she was making her boss happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger and bigger, Erie-san~! After I'm done, you're going to be so happy, eri!\" As the first jug began to empty, she took a fairly large bowl and placed at least half a box of cookies in it, then mixed it vigorously with another jug of milk, making a cookie soup of some sort. She then proceeded to pour it into Erie's mouth through the funnel, making sure not to spill a drop. The older woman's belly began to fill out, growing slightly with every panicked gulp and every frantic swallow. She was still panicking, even as the delicious milk soared past her lips and the utterly heavenly fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies touched her tongue. Erin was still rubbing her belly, making sure it didn't get too full or too sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was only the second jug when the strings holding Erie's coat together snapped. The black string hung at her ever-growing sides, utterly useless. Erie's blue eyes found this and she panicked, starting to struggle against her childish captor. Erin made a sad face and began to massage the other girl's belly, trying to calm her down. Needless to say, it worked incredibly well. A light moan escaped the stuffed blond's mouth as her eyes fluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must feel really good, Erie-san! I knew it would work, eri!\" Erin cooed, taking a more gentle approach now and delicately feeding small bite-size cookies to her employer. Her free hand gently played about the surface of her rounded paunch, squeezing a bit of softness hrtr and tickling a teensy roll there. Erie sighed in pleasure despite the fact that her assistant was still stuffing her with food. It actually wasn't quite that bad, apart from the eventual loss of her slim and sleek figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if she didn't do it, then that stupid decree would have...\" She thought to herself, opening her mouth to accept a rich, warm brownie. Chewing and swallowing, she opened her mouth yet again, this time for a glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eri! I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself, Erie-san. I know I really prefer to feed you more delicately.\" Erin chirped, offering a slice of cheesecake to the stuffed shopkeeper. \"It's much better than having to force you to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErie continued to accept the various goodies from Erin, eventually managing to finish off their entire stock of various baked goods. A low groan escaped her lips and she sat back in a sugar induced stupor, her titanic tummy resting heavily on her plumped up legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Erie-san! You managed to eat everything!\" Erin cooed, stroking and rubbing her massive boss' equally massive belly. She smirked happily as she rested her head against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I feel like a beached whale, though...\" Erie replied, stifling burp after burp as her stomach churned and grumbled, trying to shift the enormous bounty within into a reasonable comfortable position. \"I don't think I could move an inch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, eri! I can just close up for the day!\" Erin giggled, striding to the front door and locking it. Returning to the stuffed storeowner, Erin plopped delicately down atop her swollen belly. \"Mmm...nighty night Erie-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...oh...fine...'night, Erin...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Etoile lounged around behind the counter of the Pot Au Feu Rosenqueen store, twirling her blond hair and waiting for a customer. Any customer, really. Things had been so boring recently, and she had taken to munching on her lesser sold products. As she finished off her third slice of her fourth cheesecake of the day, she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my...things have been so bland lately! Ever since Miss Prier left with Sir Ragnair, nobody has had any need for weaponry. And I hardly ever sell any of these cakes. Or pies. Or candy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, she plucked yet another slice and was about to bite into it before a robed figure walked into the store, it's face cloaked in shadow from its hood. Striding quickly up to the counter, a fanged smile could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am...would you happen to have fifteen Black Cherry Cheesecakes I could purchase?\" the shadowy figure inquired, shifting slightly under the heavy fabric of the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...sorry! Fresh out!\" Etoile giggled, scooting the last of her stock of said cakes to the side while smiling weakly. \"Just sold the last to a little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...one like you perhaps?\" the figure asked, lowering the hood of the robe. Etoile yelped as a seemingly young girl proved to be under the robe, her bright red eyes sparkling. \"You've been a little piglet, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you're a succubus!\" Etoile shrieked right as she was enveloped in the slim succubi's wings and yanked along the dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the prize you've brought me, Eva...\" A calming, feminine voice said, chuckling at the end. \"She's almost perfect...she does seem to enjoy her sweets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, milady. When I first entered the shop she was about to devour another slice of her cake.\" Eva replied, bowing before a large, shadowed figure. A top heavy figure and a maniacal grin could be seen from the small amount of light that filtered in through the high windows, though that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...start her on her first feast. I'll have my bride soon enough if she takes well to the treatment. Perhaps she'll even prove to be MORE than adequate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, milady.\" Eva said again, bowing more deeply before turning and leaving. After exiting the throne room, she shivered intensely. \"Even though you're completely disgusting...fattening up some poor girl so she can be your bride...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SUPPOSED TO EAT ALL OF THIS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile sat at the head of a table, her eyes wide and her mouth watering despite protest. The table was immense, as wide as a cart and seemingly as long as the Rosenqueen shop had been wide. And atop it lay desserts of every shape and size. Pies of every flavor, cakes of every kind. Candies, cookies, and other confections lined the centerpiece of the table, a monumental ice cream sundae that could likely tower over her if it sat on the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Lady Miami has commanded it.\" Eva said, bowing slightly. \"And if you do not eat every bit, I have been ordered to finish the rest. So I beg you to at least finish most of it. My body does not take to sweets very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I'm just supposed to...mmm, this is good...I'm just supposed to get fat....ooh, are those bon-bons...so you can avoid it?\" Etoile asked, her hand darting out to swipe various sweets as she asked her questions. Her tummy grew slightly with each handful, a testament to why Eva's body wouldn't \"take to sweets very well\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's basically the gist.\" She replied, licking her lips as she watched Etoile turn to the table and dig in with gusto. The food really looked good, but she wouldn't be able to perform her duties as a succubus if she indulged like the little pig at the table was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile nodded absently, licking a bit of pastry cream off of her now slightly pudgy digits. The demon chefs who had prepared all of this certainly knew their stuff, she thought as she reached out for a large blueberry pie. When her hand reached it, she found it met a gloved one. Following the slender arm up, her eyes widened as she noticed Eva cramming a handful of cookies into her mouth. Grinning slightly, Etoile shrugged and continued with her meal.</span></div></div>",

It pulsated slightly in discomfort, sending twinges of pain across the beauties face. A pair of succubi had been called in to massage it by Eva's orders. Eva herself was sitting across the table from Etoile, picking her teeth gently and patting a full tummy. Her body was likely accustomed to digesting such large meals as she had already garnered a few dozen extra pounds in some carefully picked places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more sweets...\" Etoile groaned, her tummy snarling and gurgling at her in what could only be taken as anger. As she lamented the eventual loss of her figure, an exceptionally top heavy succubus drifted into the room, her slightly pudgy face surveying the two stuffed ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eva! It's a good thing you decided to partake of the feast. I've come to a decision after speaking with my advisers.\" She called right as three more succubi drifted in behind her, all munching on some sort of fattening snack food. \"I've decided...that all of my servants are to gain weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva's face fell, as did the faces of the two succubi massaging Etoile's tummy. \"But...but milady...!\" Eva began to protest, only to be silenced by a pudgy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! I have had enough of being called a fatty by my own servants. By the beginning of the month, all of my vassals are to gain at least three hundred pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile gulped audibly, which brought Miami's attention to her. \"And you! You, my delectable darling...are to gain six hundred. As are you, Eva\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIX HUNDRED!\" Etoile yelped, leaping up and immediately regretting the action as her still-sore belly rose along with her. Coming back down, it hit her lap with an audible and meaty THWAP, causing her to wince. Eva simply sat there speechless, contemplating what her figure looked like now and what it would look like later. \"But...but I'll be an immovable ball of fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all! I'll have only the best care taken to keep my adorable pet mobile!\" She cooed, smiling sweetly and pulling a slice of pizza from one of her advisers boxes. \"Now then, off to bed! No need to burn any more calories than you have to! You'll be sleeping with Eva. You two are going to get the best treatment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're prize pigs?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems to be the point she's trying to get across...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two still-stuffed girls gazed at a huge table in the middle of their room, packed full of various fattening goodies both savory and sweet. Fried chicken, pizza, cookies, cakes, and pies all lined the table, and a small refrigeration unit sat at one end of the table, undoubtedly filled to the brim with devilishly fattening cold treats like full-cream milk and some of the most fattening ice cream ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Times like this make me curse I live in a Netherworld that lies nearly smack dab in the middle of all the others...\" Eva groaned, the aroma of pizza tickling her nostrils and tempting her over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Etoile asked, already cracking open the refrigerator and pulling out a gigantic ice cream sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we weren't near the middle, we wouldn't have so many different dishes to fatten up on.\" Eva replied, tearing into a deep-fried turkey drumstick. Her tummy gurgled in happiness at the food entering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile simply shrugged and sat at the table, a spoon already ferrying cool ice cream to its doom in her now softer midsection. \"Mph...at least we won't get sick of eating the same stuff day after day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...I'd just rather not fatten up at all.\" She groaned in response, throwing the bare bone aside and snapping up another one. She had a delicate ring of grease around her mouth which she delicately dabbed away, though it quickly was replaced due to the pace of her eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pudgy blond friend nodded in response, though her actions spoke of a different passion now. He spoon started to clink against the bottom of her bowl, and she pushed it aside to greedily reach for a plump blueberry pie. Snatching it up, she took a big bite, blueberry filling spurting onto her lips and cute little double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph...you're sure not slowing down!\" Eva groaned, her stomach starting to groan in protest to her gluttony but also growling in hunger, which confused her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sho good!\" Etoile replied, finishing off her pie and starting in on a large roast duck. Her mind screamed at her to resist, but her stomach simply urged her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva huffed in fullness but couldn't protest any more, simply agreeing with Etoile and digging back into their feast.</span></div></div>",

The frosty contents joined a veritable freezer as it slid down to her sizable belly, packed taut and full with various other frozen treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile smiled cheerfully through her extra chin and gave her titanic tummy a pat, her body a perfect compliment to Eva's with her bountiful belly and substantial breasts.

Her enormous hips, although dwarfed now by her two prized piglets, sashayed left to right. jiggling slightly. Her pudgy hand found Etoile's belly and was needing it slowly. Etoile giggled as the Carmilla played with her massive belly, patting it and giving it a full workdown. Eventually, she leaned down and kissed it, causing Etoile to giggle even more. Her prized piglet was becoming quite enormous, she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiami moved on toward Eva, who was essentially swallowing large chocolate sundaes whole. Her mouth was ringed with a little chocolate, and some of the vanilla ice cream dotted her chubby cheeks. The overly obese succubus topping at 850, was lying down on a set of poofy cushions that propped up her massive form. Thick, silky smooth rolls cascaded down her front, her tummy pale cream in color. The succubus's uniform she wore was almost too small; it barely covered her breasts' sensitive areas. The bottom was no different because it had been swallowed up by her enormous tummy and increasingly large hips and thighs. Eva had obviously taken well to the treatment. Exceedingly well. Miami smiled. \"And look at this! The most reluctant of my subordinates...stuffing herself silly! And growing ever larger...mmm, you've grown absolutely gargantuan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat Overlord kissed her pale belly, then massaged the other's breasts, kneading the flesh endlessly. Eva sighed in complete and utter bliss. Miami stood up, pleased with the results of her new rule. But, there was one more thing to be done...\"All right, my fat little angels! It's time for your weigh-in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile and Eva winked at each other. The big queen was about to be in for an even greater shock.<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n\"Step up onto the platform, please!\" A very, very fat Shaman said. She wasn't all that big, compared to most others in Miami's harem, but her small size made her even more susceptible to weight gain. Her glorious love handles spilled over the sides of her uniform, the little belt and fauld she had almost being taken over by her massive belly. The belts that had crisscrossed her chest were being strained by giant breasts that threatened to break them. Tanned legs had already ripped out of the bandages that held them. Her pudgy face was sweating a little, telling the two obese women how much work it was to lug around so much weight(around 350lbs) without the enchantments that they had. They felt a little pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then,\" Etoile sang, stepping up. The dress was about to give right about now; the strings holding it were about to rip off. The black blouse she had on before was now just a bra, holding in her decency. Her pillowy arms had just about filled the sleeves of her coat, straining them to the utmost limits. Pale, creamy belly flesh spilled out from underneath her black top, draping over her nethers. Her thighs had completely filled out the skirt, and now the skirt barely covered her thick, juicy legs down to the knees. Standing on the platform, she saw a wispy number pop up from the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight: 653 pounds. You pass.\" The shaman said it factually, although she was definitely holding in joy. \"Next up is you, Eva!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense succubus gladly complied, straddling the platform easily, even at her gargantuan size. Her breasts shook pendulously, each probably the size of a large beachball. Her plumped feet squirmed inside of her stockings, waiting for the result. Immense, bulging thighs quivered, shaking her belly in the process. She smiled as the numbers in the air continued to climb, reaching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight: 872 pounds. You pass!\" The shaman said excitedly. Eva winked at her, basically saying \"See? I'm the best.\" Eva was looking at her two engorged angels proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two...are even bigger than I could imagine! Now, you'll only grow bigger with time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva and Etoile could hardly wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Take whatever you want, when you want'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the mantra a bandit always follows, life's treasures are not so easily attainable, so why not just steal what you don't have and keep if for yourself? Of course, many with morals try their best to avoid this urge to take what they desire and make it theirs, but what of those who don't? Well, in this tale we'll see just how stealing can have it's rewards and it's consequences (namely of that to a young woman's slender physique).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Early Morning, Forest Area near Astec-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been quite a while since Shauna split from Endorph's gang of 'theives'. Having already been rather upset with him when he had come along and taken charge of her group all his own, everyone knew it was bound to happen, it was only a matter of when and where. Of course this isn't saying, that she didn't take along ith her some like minded vagabons, most that followed her, were already strong supports of Shauna from the very beginning, even after Endorph showed up and started calling the shots. Was Shauna concearned of where Endorhp and his gang were; absolutely not, why would she be? The only thing Shauna was after was grade A loot from the neighboring countries and villages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResources were always tight, especially after Shauna's decision of flying solo from Endorph's group, so this is one of the main reasons why they set up shop near Astec. As everyone knows, Astec is a hotspot for trading goods, that being said loads upon loads of supplies come through every so often. So whenever a by passing caravan comes along, Shauna would simply order her gang to steal what supplies, food or loot they could get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this method in play, life had been fairly easy so far, so long as they managed to elude knights and other law enforcing groups they were free to hang out anywhere near the trade route leading into Astec. Although, the main culprit for the food's disappearance, was none other than Shauna herself, even though she had help from a few Redflanks who were also fairly big eaters in their own right, she found herself eating alot more than she normally does. She did like the Hotpods that came in the caravans from time to time, so perhaps that's the answer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor right now, everything seemed fairly calm, the few Redflanks in the group were keeping their eyes sharp for any enemies that might show up, standing gaurd not to far from the camp's entrance. A couple of Phynx lazed about the grounds, usually being the ones to carry along most of the things they stole, it was a routine to see them snoozing from time to time. The every present Pyremage that served by Shauna's side, were doing just that; the both of them seated silently on each side of their master awaiting any orders she may give to them. It's been well nearly two days since the last shipment of food was eaten up, and the gypsy was getting a bit impatient with this next caravan that was supposed to have come through here a day ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the Astec officals were wising up to them and had given the caravans a different route to use or something else was holding them up. Whatever the case maybe, they were still taking too long and Shauna was growing hungrier by the minute, the occasional snarl echoing from her toned stomach only egging on her impatience on the matter. This was getting very annoying, very quickly, Shauna snapped her gaze to the 3 Sepp Bandits who sat nearby \"Hey, while you guys are talking about nothing, maybe you could tell me how we can find a little bit more food around here\" Shauna remarked rather impatiently to the bandits, her arms crossed over her soft, ample bosom and an annoyed expression wrinkling her features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we were just talking about that\" One of the bandits replied, slightly taken aback by Shauna's outburst \"These guys have been takin' alot longer to come through here lately, and we know how much you like to...erm, eat as of late, so we think we should move on to somewhere else\" Shauna raised an eyebrow at the sound of this statement, where else could they possibly go that gave as much food as this route used to? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bandit could see his chief's confusion on the matter and quickly opted to explain one of the options he had in mind. He asked for a map from a Swoardsman who shrugged and handed him the rough edged map. \"There's a city right around here called Croutte\" He says placing his finger on the southern most part of Prodesto, right below the Astec area \"It's a decetly sized place, although no bigger than Astec, but I hear the place is still loaded with valuables...the only problem is it's located in the Ensnarelands\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna was more than a little skeptical at her follower's judgement at this point. The Ensnarelands is a region of Prodesto that is infamous for trapping those who enter it inside, never for them to return to the outside again. Matter of fact, it was for this prime reason that Yesterwind was located deep within the Ensnarelands, it was an ideal area to hideout and lay low provided you know EXACTLY where you are going. Otherwise, you're doomed to get lost with the sea of trees that is the Ensnarelands. Yet, despite the forests reputation, the bandit was saying out right that there was a city near it? \"You really think there's a city out there?\" Shauna \"Hah, from what I remember the only thing down there is nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the bandit was not so easily detered, for despite his leaders skeptism, her pressed on. \"Trust me on this one chief, I had a couple buddies who used to hangout down there, I remember the way like the back of my knife\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...the back of your knife is the same as the front, genius...\" Another bandit quipped as he gave his comrade a cynical look. Truth be told, it was a rather dumb comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you get what I'm trying to say!\" \"Anyways, I know the way there so I gaurentee we won't get lost\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but if we do end up getting lost it will be on your head\" Shauna conceaded, as much as she didn't trust on this bandit's word, she was still famished. So sitting here won't get her any closer to eating, she took risks before so why not now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile speaking of thie city and planning to get there was all well and good, it was actually doing the deed that made it all the more tedious. Even though their original location was due, southeast of Astec (the Ensnarelands is south of Astec) and therefore wouldn't take as long to get to this 'Croutte', the fact that most of the group was already rather hungry made for a long journey. Most went so far as to eat Deathblossoms that nested near the forest regions. Although the ravenous plants were fairly nutrutious, they had one major drawback as far as eating was concearned: They tasted awful. And this wasn't even the challenging part of the journey, the true test came to getting through the forest and reaching their supposed destination, provided it actually existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna leaned against a tree and sighed in exasperation, Nash and Lerouche taking to her side as she did so. Hunger no longer plauged her for her stomach had already been filled when they rested a while back, however, the gypsy's belly was bloated with the one thing she thought she would never eat; Deathblossoms. The tanned flesh of her once flat abdomen had now swollen out a small amount from her her eating her fill of plant monsters, the weight of it pushing down on her frilly purple dress that she wore, revealing a small glimpse of the curvature of where her stomach and her shapely hips connected. Although, the only real consequence of having eaten all the Deathblossoms she was offered was that Shauna still had their horrible taste lingering on her tounge, like that of a lasting curse of something most foul. Truly those who left the carnivours plants alone were right to do so, they were not only dangerous to wrangle, but also tasted like ass, but you're willing to eat anything when your hungry. \"You better be damn sure of where you're going, We've been walking for almost all day and we still haven't found anything on this 'Croutte' place you were going on about before.\" Shauna shot to the bandit who was nosing around the area searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I know exactly where I'm goin\" He replied looking behind a tree and the moving on to another. Needless to say this action caught the curiosity of most of the group, at least the curiosity of what exactly he was nosing around this particular area for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...what're you doing?\" An archer asked with a rasied eyebrow, her eyes watching the bandit zip from treeside to treeside a few of the Phynx following his actions, perhaps hepling him in his endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I marked one of these trees before a long time ago, matter fact that's how I knew where to go, because I marked the trees with arrows so I'd know where I was going\" The bandit answered briefly as he disappeared into the underbrush the Phynx following behind him. With nothing really to do as of now, except wait for their comrade to return with either directions to Croutte or an apology for having dragged them to the edge of the continent for nothing, everyone decides to just take 5 for now. Shauna not arguing in the least and taking her seat at the foot of the very tree she leaned upon. \"Do you need anything, Miss Shauna\" The 2 Pyremages said in unison, it was weird how the both of them had a tendancy to do that. \"No, I'm fine\" Shauna answered with another sigh keeping her blue eyes fixated on the fleeting body of her underling who was still searching the trees for his little markings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my doubts about this whole thing\" A redflank remarked, his bulky arms crossed as he followed the figure of the Sepp dashing about in the background \"If this city existed then why has no one else heard of it, if it's so loaded with treasure wouldn't you think that at least one person would know where to go to actually get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta point there, but what if it's location is a secret, the leader of the village was probably trying to protect the treasure they have stashed away\" Replied aother bandit who yawned and plopped onto the ground as he awaited for anything new to come up. </span></div></div>",
