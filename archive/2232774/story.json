            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm Marina Douglas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was born and raised in Roderick Bay, a fishing village on the East Coast. My dad was Jonas Douglas, a commercial fisherman who helped keep the village fed. My stepmother was Cordelia, and Adrian was my half-brother. For my young life, Dad didn't say a lot about Mom; only that she left when I was a baby, and that he loved her and missed her every day. He had a few pictures of her, and she and I looked a lot alike. Hardly a day went by without Dad saying to me, \"Princess, you look more like your mother every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad had his own boat, which he called <i>Heart of Doria</i>. He only took me out on her once a year, on my birthday. Adrian, on the other hand, got to go out anytime there wasn't school. \"How come Adrian gets to go out all the time,\" I would ask, \"and I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I retire,\" he'd reply, \"Adrian will take over the boat. But you, Princess, have another destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What destiny is that, Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, you'll see your mother, and you'll know your destiny then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad made it sound so amazing, I really wanted to believe him sometimes. But I had to wonder why he went to the trouble. I mean, sure, I was blonde and pretty, but I was still a fisherman's daughter. People like me didn't have grand destinies. We married local boys and started having kids before we graduated. And that was the <i>happy</i> future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as it turned out, I <i>was</i> more than just a fisherman's daughter. And I <i>did</i> have a grand destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I learned about it in the days between my first period and my 14th birthday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week before I turned 14, I was going to the bathroom when I saw it. The thing that so many girls look forward to, and I was no exception: A red stain on my panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Dad and Adrian had been home, I would have asked Cordelia to come in, and told her privately. But they were out fishing, so I didn't need to be discreet: \"Hey, Cordie, I'm on the rag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came running. \"Oh, Marina! I'm so happy for you! Thank you so much for asking for me, instead of calling your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not kidding, that's what she said, and how she said it. I know she really wanted to bond with me, but she seemed to think that trying too hard wasn't trying hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked for the panties, and sprayed them with something. \"This is supposed to prevent staining. Unfortunately, it almost never does. So, don't be surprised if these become your 'period panties.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out for a minute, and came back with a clean pair of my panties. She showed me how to put a pad into them. So she could be a great help, and I loved her. I just wish she dialed it back sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to lie down for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she helped me up, and supported me as I walked back to my bedroom, and helped me get into bed. I just lay there for a few minutes, with my hands over my lower belly, thinking to myself, <i>I'm a woman. I'm really a woman.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was ready, I texted my best friends, Coral and Bermuda, and told them I'd gotten my period. They came right over, bringing Hershey bars. \"Welcome to the club, girlfriend,\" Coral said, as she and Bermuda had been through it before me. \"Though it's weird that you got the curse before you started shaving your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone,\" Bermuda retorted. \"It's bad enough that men talk like there's only one way for women to be. The last thing we should do is join them at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was grateful for the support, but I knew what Coral was talking about: Of the three of us, I was the only one who hadn't yet needed to shave her legs, or her pits, either. All the hair I grew was on my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dad and Adrian came in, smelling of fish and salt water, Cordelia told them, \"You boys have two women in the house to deal with, now. Marina's on the cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Princess,\" Dad said, and he hugged me. For some reason, the way he smelled comforted me, as much as his hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian just said one word: \"Gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate that night, I got up to get a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poured a glass of water, and I took a swig. Then, I grabbed a canister of sea salt, and poured some into the glass, stirring it with my finger. Deciding that tasted better, I took the glass to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until I got to the bottom of the glass that I remembered: people aren't supposed to drink salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did I like it so much?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, my thirst for salt water was undiminished. I didn't know why I needed it, but I definitely did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have sworn we had more sea salt than this,\" Cordelia said. \"Where did it all go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing, knowing that the answer was in the water bottle I was drinking from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cordelia said, \"there's nothing to do about it but run into town. You should be okay. I'm sure the worst of your period is over. Just watch the house until your father and Adrian get home.\" With that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia was right, the worst of my period was over. All I had to deal with on that end was changing out my pad every few hours. But there was something else to be concerned about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room sat Dad's aquarium. He fed them twice a day, and he loved to look at them. He always said that, no matter what was going on in the world, a half hour looking at the fish could put him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also shared his love of fish with us, our friends, any relatives who came to visit, and any other houseguests. He knew everything about the fish in that tank. Even if you tuned him out when he started talking about fish, you'd come away knowing how important they were to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that day, however, the aquarium wasn't stirring thoughts about the things Dad loved. Instead, whenever I looked at it, my tummy would fumble and my mouth would water. <i>Why would I want to eat those fish?</i> I thought. I decided to ignore this new craving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't have enough willpower to accomplish that. Half an hour after I tried to ignore it, I walked right up to the tank. Selecting a clownfish, I pulled it out of the water, put it in my mouth, and ate it. It tasted good, like something a rich snoot would pay a few hundred bucks for at a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that was so tasty, I decided to try an angelfish next. Just like before, I pulled it out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, when Dad walked in, he had just enough time to realize what I was doing before I ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me. I looked at him. And it finally dawned on me what I'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears in my eyes, I ran to my room, and buried my face in my pillow. How could I have done such a horrible, horrible thing? And why did I want to do it again, and keep on doing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dad came in, I didn't dare look at him. \"I'm sorry, Daddy,\" I said. \"And yet, I'm not sorry at all. I think... I think I want to keep doing it. What's wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad put his hand on my shoulder. \"Nothing's wrong with you, Princess,\" he said. \"I'm not mad. I'm not even disappointed. If anything, it's a bittersweet feeling. I knew this day was coming. I just... I thought we'd have a little more time, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, and turned to face him. \"What is it, Daddy? What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his arm around me. \"You really are becoming more like your mother, Princess: You're becoming a mermaid.\"</span></div></div>",

Everybody knows that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I know better, Princess,\" Dad replied. \"I've met a few merfolk, and fell in love with one. You're living proof of that. When Cordelia gets back, we'll all talk about it. Have you started drinking salt water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're Doria's daughter, and I've never forgotten my first love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia got back a half hour later, and Dad sat us all down at the kitchen table. \"I met her the way you would expect a mermaid and a fisherman to meet: she got caught in my net. I won't deny it, when I saw her, I thought of how much money she could bring in for me. Once I looked into those seafoam green eyes, though, all I wanted to do was protect her. When she kissed me, that sealed the deal.\" Dad stopped to chuckle. \"She told me later that merfolk absorb languages through physical contact, so just touching my hand would have helped her. But, when she looked into my eyes, she felt she just had to kiss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't the only one,\" Cordelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once she could speak English,\" Dad continued, \"she told me her name was Doria. Once she was dry, she got her legs, and she needed a place to stay. So I took her in, and put her up in my guest bedroom. The more we talked, the deeper we fell in love, and it wasn't long before she and I were sharing a bed. Almost before we knew it, she was pregnant.\" Dad looked at me and smiled. \"The second time I fell in love at first sight. The three of us were happy together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just after you'd been weaned, a couple of mermen showed up. Her father, the king of Poseidia, had died, and so they came to ask her out of exile, and take her rightful place on the throne.\" Again, he looked at me. \"That's why I always call you Princess: Because it's what you are. Because you didn't have a tail or gills yet, she had to leave you behind, with me. But she told me you would one day have to join her, and it looks like that day is coming soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we need to do?\" Cordelia asked, clutching my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're ready, Marina, we'll take you out on the boat, and you'll swim to join your mother. In the meantime, I'll start bringing seawater back with me, so you can stop using all the salt. I've kept a few fish in the live box, just in case, and it looks like it's time. Those fish will tide you over better than the fish in my aquarium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, maybe you're mistaken. Maybe I'm not a mermaid. Maybe - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of us were to take a swig from your water bottle, we'd be sick as dogs, and you know it. It's happening, Princess, and it's not going to stop. Soon, it will be undeniable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was right, the fish he caught were more filling than the fish in the aquarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to bed that night with my head full of Dad's stories. I dreamed of the sea. In some of the dreams, I heard a woman's voice, calling to me.</span></div></div>",

You see, I spread my toes as I stretched, but some of my toes didn't spread. And those that did were now webbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up and brought my feet closer to get a better look. The reason some of my toes wouldn't spread was because they were fused together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I examined my feet, something else caught my eye. Moving my sheets, I saw that patches of the skin on my shins were covered with blue-green scales. I touched them, and they felt like fish scales. \"Hoo, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and went to my mirror. I also had scales on my thighs, and a patch of scales in place of pubic hair. \"Hoo, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things were abundantly clear: I was definitely turning into a mermaid, and I had to tell my friends, Coral and Bermuda, all about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding,\" Bermuda said. \"A mermaid? There's no such thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious,\" I replied. \"My mom is a mermaid, and I'm turning into one, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us were sitting in my room, like we had been two days before, when we were celebrating my period. Now, though, I was dressed only in my bathrobe, and my feet were the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a better explanation for her toes?\" Coral asked. \"Because I'd love to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's going on with her feet,\" Bermuda replied, \"because I'm not a doctor. And you need a doctor, Marina, not fish stories from your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up. \"Under no circumstances am I letting any doctor, anywhere, look at this.\" I opened my robe and showed them my scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Coral said, \"I guess that settles it. So, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad says, once I change completely, I'll go to be with my mom for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. She and I have a lot of catching up to do. And there may be rules that I couldn't even guess. But I promise, when I can come back, I'm going to come and see everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to hold you to that,\" Bermuda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Coral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us embraced.</span></div></div>",

Besides, merfolk aren't known for their tans, so I really didn't need to go out, until it was time for me to go see Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning to find that the scaly patches were bigger, and all my toes were now fused. Also, my fingers were webbed a bit. Not Creature from the Black Lagoon territory, but enough to help push me through the water when it was time for me to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that would have been headlines enough. But, when I walked into the bathroom, the mirror offered up another surprise for me. Six surprises, to be exact: three slits on either side of my neck. Slits that opened and closed with each breath I took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia tried to act normal, like the changes I was going through were just something in a chapter that somehow got edited out of <i>What's Happening to My Body?</i>. But she couldn't hide her reactions when I extended a hand in her direction, or when she saw my gills working. The only thing worse was when I ate: Live fish were delicious to me, but watching me eat did nothing for her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Coral and Bermuda showed up, Cordelia was even happier to see them than I was. After all, they were unchanged, human. I was the only one preparing for the life aquatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your butt looks smaller in those shorts,\" Bermuda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the shorts,\" I replied. \"My butt really is smaller. Who ever heard of a mermaid with a badonkadonk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound okay with it,\" Coral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting used to it. This morning, I posed for the mirror the way mermaids are drawn: combing my hair, and letting my legs dangle off the side of the bed.\" I demonstrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dad got home, I showed him the new changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Looks like you'll be going on your birthday, Princess,\" he said. \"Do your gills work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I haven't tried them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you probably wouldn't have,\" he said. \"You'll need something for that. And I've brought it in my truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went out, and returned with a five-gallon bottle. As he poured it into my bathtub, I could smell the seawater. Then, he brought in another bottle, and another, and another. When he ran out of five-gallon bottles, he brought smaller ones, until the tub was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little privacy?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was alone, I took off my clothes, climbed into the tub, and submerged.I was scared for a little while, but I soon realized that I could breathe just fine. The water felt wonderful going through my gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I dried off and got dressed again, I knew it would be quite a while before I slept on a human bed again.</span></div></div>",

But Coral and Bermuda did make a clamshell bra for me, and I'd need that at least part of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, although I mostly ate nothing but fish, I had no idea when I would have cake and ice cream again, so that was a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I still had to eat my fish in my room, where nobody would see it bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was such a relief when I got off my feet at the end of the day. Tomorrow, I knew, I wouldn't be walking anywhere.</span></div></div>",

My feet were no longer feet. And the point where my legs separated was now just below where my knees had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guessed now was as good a time as any. \"Cordy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she opened the bathroom door and turned on the light. \"Did you say something, hon - Oh, dear Lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Adrian called out, his voice getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia intercepted him. \"Go get your father,\" she said. \"Tell him Marina needs help. I'll get her ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Adrian went off, Cordelia said, \"No need for him to see you like this. Now, let's get this clamshell bra on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tied the bra in place, she asked, \"How do you feel, honey? Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't,\" I replied. \"It just isn't something I'm used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dad was in the bathroom, he and Cordelia carried me to the bed of his pickup truck. Then they threw a tarp over me, and the rest of the family got into the cab and drove me out to the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tarp was taken off of me, we saw that my calves had fused together. It wouldn't be long now. I was hauled aboard the <i>Heart of Doria</i>, and we shoved off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the voyage out to sea, what had been my feet joined together, and my lower body grew into a tail. And I do mean grew: my tail was twice as long as my lower body had been with legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dad turned the engines off, and came out with us. \"This is about where we first met,\" he said. \"Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try, Daddy,\" I replied. \"Help me to the rail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried, but climbing is easier if you have legs. Dad and Cordelia ended up having to lift me up over the rail, and throwing me over the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was in the water, I was literally in my element. I swam a few laps around the boat, getting the hang of swimming with a tail. When I felt ready, I surfaced, waved, blew kisses goodbye, and dove down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about 200 feet down when I saw them: two mermen and a merwoman. As I swam down, they swam up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got closer to each other, I could see more details. The mermen were armed, and the merwoman wore a gold crown and an ornate bra. Could it be... ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, we were face to face. She was older, but otherwise looked like... me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marina?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swam up and hugged me. I hugged her back, pretty sure my tears of joy were enough to raise the water level.</span></div></div>",

It is time for you to see your ancestral home, and your birthright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and began swimming down. I followed her, with the mermen flanking us. They seemed to be guards, as they discouraged sharks and other marine predators from getting too close to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw something strange ahead. It looked like a glowing eddy beneath the waves. \"What's that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is our way home,\" she replied. \"An underwater portal that will take us to Poseidia, in Atlantis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe swam into the portal, and the currents within carried us with dizzying swiftness. I had no way of telling where we were anymore. Part of me suspected that the portal was in another dimension, which let us move so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal let us out in a large chamber. Once we had collected ourselves, the mermen opened the door, and we swam out into a bustling city. The merfolk around us took notice of us, and crossed their arms against their chests, which I took to be a gesture of respect. Seeing Mom give a little wave, I did the same, and we swam to what looked like a palace that was partially encased in coral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the palace, I saw that the coral was only on the outside. Inside, it was a glittering spectacle. I guessed that the coral was to camouflage the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo mermaids swam up to us. \"Welcome back, O Queen,\" they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my daughter, Princess Marina,\" Mom said, indicating me. \"Take her to her quarters, and dress her in a manner more befitting her station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did exactly that. My clamshell bra was off in a heartbeat, replaced by something more like what Carrie Fisher wore when she killed Jabba the Hutt. \"If I may,\" I said, \"I'd like to keep the clamshell bra. It was a parting gift from dear friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Your Highness,\" they said.</span></div></div>",

I recently experienced something that had a profound impact on my life, changing everything about me, and exposing me to a world I never knew existed. You see, I\u2019m now a mermaid living in what surface dwellers have come to know as Atlantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally sunny, after almost a week of near constant rain, and I was going to take full advantage of that. I was sitting in traffic about half a mile from my girlfriend\u2019s apartment, I was on my way to pick her up for a hike in the woods on the edge of town. I was never a fan of hiking until I started dating Ariel; being more inclined to play video games or watch YouTube videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel and I met on the first day of classes at the University of West Florida, where we were both working on our Master's in Oceanography.  That was almost a year ago, and we\u2019d been dating pretty much the entire time since then. After sitting in traffic for a few minutes more, thanks to people not paying attention to the lights, I eventually pulled into her apartment complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drove around for a few minutes until I saw her walking out of her building. Pulling up next to her, I climbed out of the car and went to kiss her. \u201cYou look beautiful today, Ariel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling alright, Caleb?\u201d looking at her outfit, consisting of a ratty pair of shorts and shirt, Ariel said, \u201cBecause I look like absolute crap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping Ariel into the car, I said, \u201cI promise I\u2019m fine; can\u2019t a guy compliment his girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel looked at me for a moment before bursting into laughter, \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d Buckling her seat belt, Ariel said, \u201cNow are we going to do this hike or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back into the car, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of 15 minutes to get to where we were going; a small dirt-covered parking lot with a trail leading off into the woods. As I got out of the car, I started getting this weird feeling, as if something were calling me into the woods.  I must\u2019ve been staring off into space, because suddenly Ariel was standing next to me.  \u201cCaleb, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, I cleared my head and said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just taking it all in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d been walking for about 10 minutes before I got that feeling once more; this time it was stronger. I tried to resist, but eventually gave in, and started walking off in another direction. Running to catch up with me, Ariel said, \u201cBabe, you\u2019re going off the trail, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a smart idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but something is telling me to go this way.\u201d Seeing the weird look on my girlfriend\u2019s face, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but I swear something is calling me to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked for a few more minutes until we found an opening in the side of a ledge; big enough for us to fit through. Ariel tried to stop me, but I walked inside. After some hesitation, she decided to follow me in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked for about 30 feet before entering a small cavern with a pool of water in the middle. Whatever had been calling me here stopped as I approached the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to me, Ariel said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you see every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Looking at Ariel, I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get lunch ready? I-I\u2019m going to take a dip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel tried to talk me out of it, saying that I wasn\u2019t wearing a swimsuit and we hadn\u2019t brought towels, but I wasn\u2019t listening.  <br>\r\nUnsure of what exactly was compelling me to do so, I took my shirt off and jumped into the water. The first thing I noticed was its warmth; being much warmer than I expected it to be. It was even making my skin tingle in some areas. Looking at me from the shore, Ariel said, \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating on my back, I said, \u201cIt feels great, you should try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d Gesturing for me to return, Ariel said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come have some lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started swimming back towards the shore, I felt an overwhelming urge to have sex with Ariel. Try as I might, I couldn\u2019t get that urge out of my mind. Climbing out of the water, soaking wet, I approached Ariel and said, \u201cWhat do you say we have a quick love-making session before lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d in shock, Ariel looked at me and said, \u201cYou want to have sex <i>here</i>, when anyone could just walk in on us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Ariel.\u201d Moving closer to her, I said, \u201cYou said it yourself, we\u2019ve gone off the trail; I doubt anyone will walk in on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear from the look on her face that Ariel was conflicted, until she looked down and saw the tent in my shorts.  Giving in to the temptation, Ariel said, \u201cOh what the hell; there\u2019s always a first time for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both completely naked within seconds, our bodies becoming intertwined for what would become the best sex of our relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did we know, however, that it would also be the last time we were ever intimate with each other.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, we both got tired, and stopped to catch our breath, lying down on a makeshift blanket of our clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards Ariel, a smile on my face, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you; but I think that was the best sex we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with you on that; I think I\u2019m going to be sore for a while.\u201d Looking at me, Ariel said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over you, but you were so passionate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us lay there for a moment until I started feeling a weird sensation coming from my toes; almost as if they were falling asleep, but ten times stronger. Getting myself into a seated position, I looked down, and was shocked by what I was seeing \u2013 it was as if my toes were fusing together. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d reaching towards my toes, I said, \u201cAriel, something's wrong with my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel quickly sat up next to me as my toes continued to fuse together; we both watched as the skin around them started turning a dark green color. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to your feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know!\u201d Starting to freak out, I said, \u201cM-Maybe there was something in the water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel quickly jumped to her feet and started drying herself, as I\u2019d gotten some water of her during our lovemaking. It quickly became clear that nothing was happening to her, all while my toes were now completely fused together, and the discoloration was spreading up my feet. Getting on her knees, Ariel reached out and cautiously touched my feet. \u201cBabe, I-I think these are scales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScales?\u201d confused, looking at her, I said, \u201cAs in fish scales?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think so, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scales were now past my ankles, as Ariel and I watched in silent horror. As if scales forming on my legs weren\u2019t bad enough, I started feeling a weird sensation on my neck. Bringing my hands up to my neck, I felt what appeared to be flaps on my neck \u2013 three of them on each side. I couldn\u2019t get a good look at them, so I got Ariel\u2019s attention. \u201cW-What\u2019s going on with my neck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite going for a Master's in Oceanography, Ariel had received a Bachelor\u2019s in Marine Science. As she focused on my neck, I felt her lift one of the flaps before recoiling in horror. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here, but you\u2019ve got gills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was freaking out at that point; what with the scales now up past my knees and the development of gills on my neck, it was obvious that I was undergoing some bizarre transformation. Things got worse as I noticed my junk receding into a slit no more than three inches in length.  <i>God no, not that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if watching my manhood disappear wasn\u2019t bad enough, I suddenly felt a strange sensation coming from my rear. Rolling over on my stomach, I said, \u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask what\u2019s happening now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closely at my rear, Ariel said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say your toes aren\u2019t the only thing fusing together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes progressed like that for a few minutes, until everything from my belly button down was covered in scales of varying shades of green. Things only got worse as I slowly lost the ability to move my legs; watching helplessly as they began fusing together from my waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes my legs had fused together into what I could only imagine was a tail \u2013 measuring almost five feet in length.  Ariel and I watch as fins started growing from the area where my feet had once been \u2013 continuing until it was around two feet in length. Once the changes were finished, Ariel and I looked at each other in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs impossible as it seemed, I\u2019d somehow turned into a merman.</span></div></div>",

I ran my hands down what had once been my legs; feeling the scales that had, only minutes before, been skin. Once I was able to find my voice again, I turned to Ariel, \u201cWh-What just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel stepped back a few feet; probably fearing that she\u2019d be affected in some way. I guess I couldn\u2019t really blame her, I\u2019d probably do the same in her situation. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know, babe.\u201d Gesturing to my tail, she said, \u201cCa-Can you move that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting myself in a more comfortable position, I looked down at my tail and tried my hardest to move it. It took some effort, but I eventually managed to lift it a few inches off the ground. \u201cI\u2019m a freaking merman, how is that even possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get you to a doctor; maybe they can help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know Ariel was desperate to help me; but I couldn\u2019t help but wish she\u2019d given that idea a little more thought. \u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d gesturing to my tail, I said, \u201cI\u2019m a merman, Ariel; they\u2019ll probably more inclined to study me then to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel looked at me with sadness in her eyes; she was having a tough time processing this. She looked as though she was about to say something, when I suddenly grabbed my stomach, feeling an overwhelming feeling of discomfort wash over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to my side, she said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching my stomach, I looked at her and said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ve never felt like this before.\u201d Suddenly realizing my voice sounded different, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to my voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, I had to watch Ariel as she took a step back, \u201cCaleb, your voice isn\u2019t the only thing changing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful of what I might see, I looked down and saw two fleshy mounds forming on my chest \u2013 breasts. Bringing my hands up to them, I said, \u201cBreasts?  I\u2019m growing breasts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, Caleb; we have to get you to a hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d my voice now unmistakably female, I said, \u201cThey\u2019ll never believe this; hell, it\u2019s happening to <i>me</i>, and <i>I</i> can barely believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel and I watched in silence as the breasts continued to grow, while my waist took on a more feminine appearance. I could only imagine what was happening internally; it wasn\u2019t a stretch to assume I now had female reproductive organs. My vision was suddenly obscured by a fair amount of brown hair. It was only when I reached up to move it that I realized my hands were now feminine as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was perfectly content with staying silent; until I was momentarily blinded by a bright flash. Once my vision cleared, I took and saw Ariel pointing her phone at me. \u201cSeriously?\u201d looking annoyed, I said, \u201cThe last thing I want right now is photographic proof of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby.\u201d Handing me the phone, Ariel said, \u201cBesides, I think you look rather nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begrudgingly took the phone from Ariel and looked at the photo. As I looked at the photo, I saw that there was nothing left of the old me; I was undeniably female in every respect. I had a decent figure, I had shoulder-length brown hair and a rather feminine looking face. A small part of me, one not disturbed by the whole thing, realized that I was now rather attractive \u2013 even for someone that was half-fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding the phone back to Ariel, I said, \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t exactly bring you out in public; even if I was strong enough to carry you the half mile back to the car.\u201d Looking at me in uncertainty, Ariel said, \u201cI think the best bet would be for you to stay here for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was all ready to agree with her, when suddenly a bright blue light appeared in the pool a short distance from where we were sitting. That was quickly followed by a voice in my head saying \u2013<i>Come home. Come Home</i>.  I tried my best to resist, but the urge to follow the voice was too strong. Maneuvering onto my stomach, I started pulling myself towards the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Without taking my eyes off the light, I continued pulling myself towards the water. \u201cI just know something is telling me to go towards the light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb, stop; that pool already turned you into a merman and then a mermaid.\u201d Moving to stand in front of me, Ariel said, \u201cWe have no idea what will happen to you if you go into that... that thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d reached the water at that point; submerging myself and feeling water rushing through my gills with each breath I took. I found that my eyesight was now even better underwater then it had been on land; I could see even the most minute details in the rocks around me. I swam around for a few moments; marveling at how fast and maneuverable I\u2019d become. Popping back to the surface a short distance from shore, I turned to Ariel and said, \u201cTrust me, Ariel; I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored Ariel\u2019s pleas as I dove back underwater; swimming towards the bright light before me. Despite my assurances to Ariel, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect on the other side. I closed my eyes as I swam into the light, not knowing where I would end up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I came through the portal, I found myself alone in a small room with little in the way of lighting. Thanks to my new enhanced eyesight, however, the lack of lighting wasn\u2019t a problem for me. The portal closed behind me shortly after I came through. As I looked around the room, I saw what looked like light fixtures embedded in the wall, as well as a sealed door in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no visible way to open the door, I started to fear that Ariel may have been right \u2013 that coming through the portal was a mistake. Swimming up to the door, I started banging on it and screaming at the top of my lungs. \u201cHelp!  Is someone out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while until my voice and energy eventually gave out. Suddenly overcome with fear, I went to a nearby corner and curled up in the fetal position \u2013 or the best approximation I could with a nearly 5-foot-long tail and fin. As I lay there, wondering what was going to happen next, I found myself thinking about the events that led me here. I found myself focusing on my decision to jump into the pool; none of this would\u2019ve happened, had I not dove in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing inside a sealed off room with no windows, I lost all concept of the passage of time. After coming out of my state of shock, I spent some time exploring my new body. One of the first things I noticed as I reached out to examine my tail was that my fingers were now webbed to a small degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to leave a more thorough examination for later, focusing instead on once more trying to find a way out of here. Suddenly, as if answering my prayers, I heard a noise on the other side of the door. Swimming closer to the door, I realized I was hearing voices on the other side, although I couldn\u2019t quite make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to get out of the room, I started banging on the door once more, \u201cPlease, let me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the door opened, revealing half a dozen men floating inside an expansive hallway. The first thing that came to mind as I looked at them, much to my immense shock, was how rugged and handsome some of them looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed myself a moment where, to my embarrassment, I found myself growing interested in the men in front of me. That moment quickly faded once they all started entering the room and encircling me. I wasn\u2019t enjoying the looks they were giving me; my mind quickly jumping to the conclusion that they were going to take advantage of me. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen; so, when one of them approached me, I lashed out and punched him in the nose before swimming for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, my unfamiliarity with my new form proved to be my downfall, as they call up to me before I\u2019d even made it five feet down the hallway. As they started pulling me back into the room, I screamed for help as loud as I could \u2013 but no one came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in the room, one of the men threw me against a wall and said, \u201cHow do you get in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Suddenly feeling more afraid than I\u2019d ever been before, I said, \u201cI-I was in this cave with my girlfriend; I jumped into a pool and it turned me into a mermaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a surface dweller!\u201d The guy whose nose I punched looked at me, saying, \u201cWe must take her to the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Retrieving what I could only assume were handcuffs from his waist, the leader of the group turned to me. \u201cDon\u2019t try anything stupid, surface dweller; I\u2019m well within my rights to imprison you for assaulting one of my men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement, staying silent, as the man placed the cuffs around my wrist. Before long, I was escorted out of the room by him and his men.</span></div></div>",

It took me a few minutes to realize why they were looking at me; they were wearing what looked like bras, while I was pretty much topless. Becoming self-conscious, I tried my best to cover my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, we eventually came to several vertical shafts built into a wall. I wondered what it was, until I saw a merman swim up through one of them; quickly realizing it must\u2019ve been how they accessed different floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men swam down one of the shafts as they pulled me after them. After swimming out the bottom of the shaft, I said, \u201cCan you guys please tell me where I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group stopped moving and turned to face me; the leader looking displeased with me. I suppose I couldn\u2019t really blame him, since I had assaulted one of his men. After a tense moment, the leader simply said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others stayed behind, I cautiously followed the man around a nearby corner \u2013 where I found myself in front of a large window. My jaw dropped at the sight before me; an underwater city stretching as far as the eye could see \u2013 with buildings of varying heights, mermen and mermaids swimming in the streets below.  Turning back to the man, I said, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the city-state of Poseidia.\u201d Moving alongside me by the window, the man said, \u201cIt\u2019s located on the southern coast of what surface dwellers consider the lost continent of Atlantis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I should\u2019ve been more surprised to hear that Atlantis was real; but nothing really surprised me after getting turned into a mermaid. As I turned to look back out the window, I noticed a brightly lit structure on a hill in the distance. Pointing to it, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis demeanor slowly growing less confrontational, the man said, \u201cThat\u2019s the Royal Palace; where Queen Doria lives with her daughter, Princess Marina.\u201d Looking towards me, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re taking you; a surface dweller hasn\u2019t breached our defenses in decades, so the Queen will want to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed by the window for a few moments until the man gestured that it was time to go. Before he swam off, I said to him, \u201cDo you think you could remove these cuffs?\u201d seeing the apprehensive look on the man\u2019s face, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for injuring one of your men; with everything going on, I thought you guys were going to hurt me or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I would have reacted the same way.\u201d With a sigh, the man came swam over and removed the cuffs. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this, surface dweller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a fleeting moment I considered trying to make a run for it, but realized that would be futile.  Eventually, I swam after the man as we joined up with the others. The one I punched looked upset about the fact that I was no longer restrained, but he didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was settled, we swam out of the building and towards a nearby cylindrical tube, leading to larger horizontal tube floating above the road. My curiosity was getting the better of me, swimming up to the leader as we entered the larger tube \u2013 where I suddenly picked up speed despite barely moving my tail. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are mass-transit tubes; similar in function to your subway system.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cWith this, we should be at the palace in minutes.\u201d</span></div></div>",

At one point the leader, introducing himself as Arturo, came alongside me. \u201cI can only imagine what you must\u2019ve gone through; transforming into a mermaid as you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at Arturo for a moment, unsure of how to respond. \u201cIt was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced before.\u201d Looking at him, feeling hopeful, I said, \u201cWhat are the chances that all this can be undone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a simple soldier, so I can\u2019t give you the answer you seek.\u201d Glancing at me, Arturo said, \u201cBut I can promise that our healers will do what they can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the city passing by outside, I said, \u201cIf it can\u2019t be undone, I suppose there\u2019s worse places for me to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued for a few more minutes until someone came up beside me. Turning to my right, I saw the bruised face of the man that I\u2019d punched earlier. I wanted to apologize to him, but the look on his face told me he wasn\u2019t ready to hear it just yet. Ignoring me, he turned to Arturo and said, \u201cSir; this surface dweller isn\u2019t properly dressed for audience with the Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized that he was referring to my lack of a bra, something I\u2019d seen every other mermaid wearing. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Arturo.\u201d Gesturing subtly to my chest, I said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a tad exposed right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo took one look at me before removing the vest he was wearing. Handing it to me, he said, \u201cThis will do for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the vest briefly before putting it on as I tried to determine what it was made of. It was a material unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen before. After putting it on, and thanking Arturo, I turned to look at the other man. \u201cHey.\u201d Reaching out to stop him as he turned around, I said, \u201cListen, I-I\u2019m sorry about earlier; with everything going on, I got worried that you were going to harm me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was clearly still angry about what happened, but he swallowed his pride and said, \u201cApology accepted.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was much longer before I and my little entourage, if you could call us that, arrived in front of the palace. Let me tell you something; seeing it up close was much different than seeing it from building I\u2019d been in earlier. It looked to be probably 6 stories tall; and encased in something resembling coral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo and his men led me past a trio of guards stationed at a nearby gate. I\u2019d begun getting the hang of swimming by that point, so I had no problem keeping up with everyone as we swam towards the side of the palace. Turning to look at his men, Arturo said, \u201cYou\u2019re all dismissed; I will take it from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the men saluted Arturo before turning to leave; once they were gone, the two of us swam in through a side door. Once inside, I saw that the interior closely resembled what I imagined most castles would look like \u2013 with statues and paintings everywhere. I quickly realized that the coral-like substance was only an exterior thing; the interior of the palace, like the building I\u2019d appeared in, was made of a much smoother material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we swam through the halls, my curiosity got the better of me. \u201cArturo, sir.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cIt appears that we\u2019re far below the surface; so, I\u2019m curious as to where this light is coming from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Swimming towards a nearby wall, Arturo pointed to a clear cylinder attached to the wall. \u201cThese are filled with a bioluminescent organism, which gives off light when exposed to an electrical current.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we continued through the halls until we came to an ornate staircase leading up to the next level. As we swam up the stairs towards a large doorway, we were approached by what I could only assume were guards. \u201cHalt. What is your purpose here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Arturo, captain in the Praetorian Guard.\u201d Gesturing to me, Arturo continued, \u201cThis surface dweller appeared through a portal; I\u2019m taking her to see the Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked at each other before one of them swam off; but not before asking that we wait here. After a few moments, Arturo turned to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re about to meet our Queen, surface dweller; I trust you\u2019ll be respectful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d Nodding as I nervously ran a hand through my hair, I said, \u201cI promise to be respectful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard returned not long after and gestured for us to enter. As we swam inside the throne room, I saw that it was surprisingly modest in appearance. Aside from some portraits and statues, the pair of thrones on the far side of the room were the only things to show where we were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo and I swam up to the throne; I followed his lead as he bowed in reverence to the two mermaids on the thrones. The thrones themselves were quite interesting; resembling stools with section for one to wrap their tails around. I managed to steal a glance at who I assumed were the Queen and Princess; the Queen looked to be in her early to mid-40s, with slight graying of the hair, while the Princess looked like she was in her early teens. The Queen wore a gold crown, while the Princess wore a silver tiara. I found myself focusing on their chest; realizing their bras were more ornate than what I\u2019d seen up to that point. The more I thought about it, the more I realized it must\u2019ve been a status symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen glanced towards the Princess; giving her a look that told her to pay attention. Turning her attention back to me and Arturo, the Queen said, \u201cForgive me; I\u2019ve been caught up with matters of state.\u201d Getting up from her throne, the Queen swam over to us and said, \u201cWhat is the reason for your audience, Guard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d with a quick gesture towards me, Arturo said, \u201cThis surface dweller has managed to breach our defenses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Princess seemed interested in the fact that I was once a surface dweller, the Queen had a more serious response to that revelation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a breach in decades.\u201d Giving me a stern look, making me feel two inches tall, the Queen continued. \u201cHow did she accomplish this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was discovered in the antechamber for one of the birthing portals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no clue what Arturo and the Queen were talking about, especially in regard to the aforementioned birthing portal. As the conversation continued, I could tell that things weren\u2019t going in my favor. Therefore, no doubt going against protocol, I decided to speak up, \u201cI apologize, Your Majesty; I meant no harm.\u201d Trying my best to hide my growing sense of fear, I said, \u201cYou see; after becoming a mermaid, I was drawn to the... portal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could stop me, I went ahead and explained everything that happened, leading to my appearance before the Queen. Once I was finished, Queen Doria\u2019s demeanor changed to a more caring one. \u201cI can only imagine how traumatizing such an experience could have been for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me; it ruined the perfect moment between myself and my girlfriend.\u201d Gesturing to my transformed body, I said, \u201cOne minute we\u2019re snuggling together; the next I\u2019m turning into a mermaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving me a onceover, Queen Doria said, \u201cAm I correct in assuming, based on your facial expressions, that you\u2019ve filled out more than you were before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch more, Your Highness.\u201d Starting to blush, I said, \u201cYou see; before all this, I used to be a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen and her daughter had markedly different reactions to that revelation; the Queen, while shocked, managed to stay composed. While Princess Marina, to my utter embarrassment, had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing out loud. Even Arturo, who until now had assumed I\u2019d always been female, was shocked. Looking at me, Queen Doria said, \u201cYou were a man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much to ask; I was wondering if you could turn me back into a man before returning me to the surface?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Doria\u2019s demeanor changed once more; focusing on me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, but we can\u2019t let you return to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d flabbergasted, I said, \u201cI have a life on the surface; you can\u2019t just keep me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur laws say otherwise, child.\u201d Sighing, Queen Doria said, \u201cIf you were to return to the surface with the knowledge of our existence; you\u2019d be putting our entire civilization in grave peril.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized she was right. \u201cIf you won\u2019t let me return to the surface; surely you could at least let me say goodbye to my family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a situation hasn\u2019t occurred in nearly 25 years; I\u2019ll have to speak with my advisors about what to do. In the meantime,\u201d placing a sympathetic hand on my shoulder, Queen Doria said, \u201cI\u2019ll make arrangements to have you returned to your rightful gender; and will have accommodations arranged for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the news I\u2019d hoped for, but it was better than nothing, \u201cForgive me, but how long will I be awaiting your decision?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be days, or it could be weeks, my child.\u201d Looking at me, Queen Doria said, \u201cThere are matters at hand more serious than your unfortunate situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Arturo led me from the throne room; once outside, he looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry; I assumed, under the circumstances, that they would let you return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Arturo.\u201d With a wry smile, I said, \u201cAt least I get to be a male again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sensing my confusion, Arturo swam up beside me. \u201cThis is one of many healing centers throughout the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us swam inside the building, I stopped just outside the entrance. \u201cI hope you can forgive my curiosity. But,\u201d in a hushed tone, I said, \u201cOnce this procedure is finished; exactly how much of a man will I be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the shoe was on the other foot, so to speak, as Arturo was confused by my question. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around to ensure the coast was clear, as I was uncertain whether our current topic of conversation was considered taboo. Once satisfied the area was clear, I turned back to Arturo and said, \u201cOnce the procedure is finished; will I be able to\u2026 well, rise to the occasion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that Arturo was finally catching on; looking at me, he said, \u201cAre you unable to reassign one\u2019s gender on the surface?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can; but only to a certain extent.\u201d Pausing for a moment to consider my words carefully, I said, \u201cTrans women can't give birth, and trans men don't have the... well, you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, surface-dweller; I can assure you that we\u2019re far beyond that.\u201d With a smile, Arturo said, \u201cMany of our citizens have undergone this procedure; it\u2019ll be as though you were born a merman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied by that answer, Arturo and I continued into the building. As we swam out of one of the vertical shafts, I was surprised to see Princess Marina waiting nearby. Swimming up to her, I said, \u201cPrincess Marina, what an unexpected surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Marina asked Arturo to give us a moment, before leading me around the corner. \u201cI wanted to see you before the procedure; to express my sympathy for the situation you\u2019re in.\u201d Looking at me, she continued, \u201cI, too, was born on the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why, but that news came as a shock to me. \u201cYou were?\u201d leaning in, I said, \u201cDoes that mean the Queen is, like, your adopted mother or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, she\u2019s actually my mother; I\u2019m the result of her relationship with my human father.\u201d Her face turning sad, Marina said, \u201cI feel sorry for you, because I\u2019m actually free to return to the surface whenever I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe perks of being royalty, I guess.\u201d Hiding my annoyance, I said, \u201cSo how long have you been down here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a month next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarina and I spoke for a few minutes; sharing stories of our lives on the surface. I was in the middle of telling her about Ariel when Arturo came around the corner.  \u201cForgive the intrusion, Princess; but the healers are ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d With a smile on her face, Marina looked at me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, surface-dweller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized it was partly my fault for not telling anyone my name; but I\u2019d had enough of people referring to me as \u2018surface-dweller.\u2019  Looking at Marina, I said, \u201cPlease, call me Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy first crush was on a boy named Caleb; I\u2019ve always liked that name.\u201d With a sincere smile, Marina said, \u201cI truly hope things work out well for you here, Caleb; Poseidia is a wonderful place. And don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll try to persuade my mother to let you visit your family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, I reached out and embraced Marina, not caring that I was undoubtedly breaking some rule. Apart from Arturo, Marina was the only one who sincerely seemed to be looking out for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the hug, aware of the glare I was receiving from Arturo, I turned to Marina and apologized, \u201cSorry about that; it\u2019s just been an emotional day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize, I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Marina swam off, Arturo moved in front of me, his annoyance made clear by the look on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like on the surface, Caleb; but here, we don\u2019t just hug a member of the Royal Family.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cJust be glad a member of the Royal Guard wasn\u2019t here; they would\u2019ve thrown you in prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Arturo.\u201d With a wince, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just with everything that\u2019s happened, it was nice to meet someone else from the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d As his glare slowly softened to a frown, Arturo said, \u201cNow come on; the healers are waiting for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I started to feel nervous as Arturo led me into a small nearby room. That feeling grew exponentially once we went inside. Even though there were some notable differences, I could tell that I was inside the underwater equivalent of a procedure room. I could see a hospital bed in the middle of the room, with a device hanging from the ceiling above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mermaid, probably a nurse, came to escort me to the bed. Before turning to leave, Arturo looked at me and said, \u201cI wish you the best of luck, Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArturo, wait.\u201d Freeing myself from the nurse\u2019s grasp, I swam over to Arturo, \u201cI\u2019ll understand if you don\u2019t want to; but you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve met so far, aside from the Queen and her daughter, who\u2019s shown any interest in my wellbeing. Would you be willing to stay for moral support?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear Arturo hadn\u2019t expected me to ask that question; after all, we\u2019d only just met barely an hour earlier. \u201cOf course, Caleb.\u201d With a sincere smile, Arturo said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside until the procedure is finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Resisting the urge to hug him, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing: will this hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny pain you feel will be minimal.\u201d Looking at me, Arturo said, \u201cTrust me when I say you\u2019ll be swimming again in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed while the nurse and an older mermaid, who I assumed was the doctor, got everything ready. Swimming up to me as I lay on the bed, the doctor said, \u201cHave you been told anything about what you\u2019ll be going through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Getting nervous, I said, \u201cAll I\u2019ve really been told is that it\u2019ll make me a man again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the woman was caught off-guard by my comment, her face didn\u2019t show it. \u201cWell then, let me explain how this is going to work.\u201d Gesturing to the device hanging from the ceiling, the woman said, \u201cWe\u2019ll start the procedure at your tail, slowly transforming your body as we move along. The entire process should only take a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s really incredible.\u201d looking at the woman, I said, \u201cOn the surface, it would take multiple procedures to accomplish the same task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the other mermaids moved the device towards me, the older one said, \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about such barbaric medical practices anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll admit to being a little insulted by that remark: after all, she was implying that surface dwellers were primitive. The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized she was right. With everything that I\u2019d seen so far, I\u2019d say this society was likely centuries more advanced than anything on the surface. As they got the device set up, I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave Arturo, floating outside the room, a reassuring thumbs-up as the doctor started the machine. This resulted in him giving me a peculiar look as he left the room. Once he was outside, I watched as a beam of light came down and started moving up my body. The first few minutes passed by without issue, save for the occasional wince of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed the time thinking about what my life was going to be like down here; until my thoughts invariably turned to my loved ones on the surface. <i>Will I ever get to see them again?</i> I was pulled from my thoughts when I saw the nurse come over and float beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat next to me, I came to a disturbing realization \u2013 that I wasn\u2019t attracted to her in the least. \u201cI\u2019m sure you probably get this question all the time. But,\u201d taking a breath as I looked at her, I said, \u201cWill I still be interested in men once this is finished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo; if you\u2019re heterosexual, you become attracted to whatever gender is opposite yours.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIs that going to pose a problem for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be a problem for me.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just with everything I\u2019ve been through today, I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t biting off more than I could chew. Part of me was wondering if perhaps being a mermaid wasn't the worst thing in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the machine continued its progress up my tail, arriving at the area of my privates, the nurse turned her attention back to me. \u201cPerhaps you wouldn\u2019t mind answering a question for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose it was only fair to think that she\u2019d want to ask me a few questions. Looking at her, thinking it was probably going to be something about life on the surface, I said, \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious why you referred to a captain in the Praetorian Guard as a sex worker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor, working nearby, barely stifled a chortle as I looked at the nurse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d a little confused, I said, \u201cI just gave him a thumbs-up to let him know I was okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Blushing, the nurse said, \u201cThat gesture means something different down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, I realized that Arturo had given me a quizzical look. Realizing just how little I knew about this culture, I let out a sigh and said, \u201cGreat, more stuff for me to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d With a sincere smile, the nurse said, \u201cOnce you\u2019re recovered, you can undergo a procedure that will teach you everything you\u2019ll need to survive here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to acknowledge what the nurse said, but I was suddenly overcome by an intense discomfort as the machine moved further up my body. If it hadn\u2019t been for the restraints, I probably would have injured myself. \u201cI thought you said I wouldn\u2019t feel any major discomfort.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor came rushing over after the nurse called out for her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like my insides are on fire.\u201d Wincing, I looked at the doctor and said, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Perhaps we can at least find a clue to understanding this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I told her the whole story, from being called to the pool to being called by the portal. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My conjecture is that, when you swam in the birthing pool, you absorbed a great deal of the energy left behind by all the merwomen who had given birth in that pool. This energy not only changed you into one of us, it corrected what it sensed as a flaw: your inability to conceive and bear children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at myself. \"Is... is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have often heard of infertile merwomen swimming in birthing pools in an effort to conceive. Your experience may explain it. Unfortunately for you, it means that you are a mermaid for the rest of your life. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cursed myself. If I had stayed out of that birthing pool, I would be a man, going home right now. Instead, I was a mermaid, and this city would be my new home.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d barely had a chance to get comfortable before Arturo came in, a sad look on his face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t look at me like that, Arturo; I got enough of those looks from the nurse and doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming up to my bedside, Arturo said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Caleb. I truly believed they could make you a man again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I suppose it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d With a shrug, I said, \u201cAt least I\u2019m not dead; I\u2019m just a mermaid for the rest of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a chair up to my bed, Arturo said, \u201cYou\u2019re remarkably calm about all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to maintain composure during stressful situations.\u201d With a chuckle, I said, \u201cMy panicked screams in that cavern notwithstanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo and I chatted for a few minutes, until the topic of my living arrangements came up. Arturo was the only one I knew here, only I suspected he didn\u2019t want a young mermaid living with him. I wasn\u2019t sure how that would look down here, given our age difference. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about a place to live, Caleb; I\u2019ve spoken with my daughter, Athena, and she\u2019s agreed to let you stay with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great and all, but does she about my... situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to your former gender and species, then yes.\u201d Taking my hand in his, Arturo said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll help you adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange markings on the wall, like what I\u2019d seen outside, caught my attention. I knew they were letters; but, for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out what they were saying. \u201cHow am I going to adjust to living down here when I can\u2019t even read your language?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the doctor entered the room with a small helmet-like device. Placing it on my head, she said, \u201cThis device will teach you everything a mermaid your age should know; from our language and culture to, as the surface dwellers say, more delicate things, like personal hygiene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the doctor tightened the straps, I looked at Arturo and said, \u201cBefore you go, Arturo; I could use some help with a new name. Caleb isn\u2019t exactly appropriate for my new gender.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo was silent for a moment as he considered that question. Eventually, he looked at me and said, \u201cWhat you choose is entirely up to you; but I have a personal request.\u201d Smiling, Arturo said, \u201cMy wife died during the birth of our second child, robbing me of both my wife and my newborn daughter. That little girl would have been Cora. I would be honored if you took her name for your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to get emotional, wondering how crying would work underwater. Looking at Arturo, I said, \u201cA-Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Looking at Arturo, with a feint smile, I said, \u201cI guess my name\u2019s Cora now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the doctor activated the device, and I went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I started getting emotional after a while, so I tried to get my mind off my family, just as Arturo entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming up to me, he said, \u201cHow are you doing, Cora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question to answer, Arturo; my life\u2019s been changed in ways I never thought possible.\u201d Gesturing to my body, I said, \u201cI mean look at me; this morning I was a human guy, now I\u2019m a mermaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, with a rather cryptic tone in his voice, Arturo said, \u201cI have some idea what you\u2019re going through, Cora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re about to say you were born on the surface, you\u2019ve got no idea what I\u2019m going through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a device from his belt, I watched Arturo do something before turning it towards me. On the screen, I saw what I assumed was a heavily pregnant mermaid floating next to a rather attractive merman. From the way they were looking at each other, I quickly saw they were in love. Pointing towards the mermaid, Arturo said, \u201cThat mermaid was me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded, I looked at Arturo, \u201cThat was you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all started about 30 years ago now; I had just joined the Praetorian Guard.\u201d Pulling up a chair, Arturo sat down. \u201cI was given an undercover assignment in Olympia, a neighboring kingdom; one that required me to become female.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay in bed completely fixated by what Arturo was telling me. \u201cYou see, females aren\u2019t allowed to serve in the Guard; so whoever went on the mission had to become one.\u201d Looking at me, Arturo said, \u201cMy assignment was to infiltrate the Olympian Palace as a servant, and determine whether they were going to violate a long-standing peace treaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very interesting; but how does that pertain to you getting pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout a year into the assignment, I met this young merman; and it was, as the humans would say, love at first sight. The two of us became inseparable; spending all of our free time together.\u201d Pausing, his face turning serious, Arturo said, \u201cForming relationships with potential assets was forbidden, but I managed to keep my superiors from finding out for almost 7 months \u2013 until I got pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding myself getting drawn into the story with each passing moment, I said, \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to inform my superiors of what happened; they ordered me to leave, but I refused to do so without my child\u2019s father.\u201d Taking a deep breath as he ran a hand over his mouth, Arturo said, \u201cTo make a long story short, we returned to Poseidia. My mate became a citizen, and I gave birth to our child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, why did you become male again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoining the Guard was a childhood dream, and I didn\u2019t want to give that up. So, once I was no longer nursing, the two of us underwent the gender-change procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to your child and mate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you already know what happened to my mate: she died giving birth to your namesake.\u201d Gesturing to the door, Arturo said, \u201cAs for my child; well, she\u2019s waiting outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I watched Arturo swim over and open the door, revealing an attractive looking mermaid. I got a good look at her as she entered; everything from her chestnut brown hair to her athletic figure. Swimming into the room, she said, \u201cYou must be Cora; I\u2019m Athena, it\u2019s lovely to meet you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once he was gone, I looked at Athena and said, \u201cIs your dad the overprotective type?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can be at times, but he means well.\u201d Pulling up a chair, Athena said, \u201cSo Cora, why don\u2019t you tell me a little about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena and I spent the better part of an hour getting to know each other; I told her stories about life on the surface, while she told me stories of growing up underwater. The more we talked, the more I got the sense we\u2019d be good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re settled, perhaps you wouldn\u2019t mind speaking to my students?\u201d Looking at me, with a smile on her face, Athena said, \u201cIt\u2019s not everyday they get an opportunity to speak with someone from the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019d be happy to; just as soon as I get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsually merfolk who undergo the procedure are released within hours.\u201d Looking at me, Athena said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how that applies to someone in your situation, however; I\u2019ve never heard of the procedure not working before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor assigned to my case couldn\u2019t figure it out either; all she said was my body was counteracting everything the machine put out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, what exactly caused your transformation in the first place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was taking a hike with my girlfriend; we found this underground cavern with a pool in it. I jumped in for a swim, and within minutes I was transforming into a mermaid.\u201d Readjusting myself in bed, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s really no point in dwelling on that now, though; it\u2019s not like it can be undone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being remarkably calm for someone in your position; I certainly wouldn\u2019t be if that happened to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, I was far from calm when this first started.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cMy girlfriend and I were both freaking out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo returned with the doctor at that moment. After giving me a quick once over, she said, \u201cI see no reason to keep you here any longer; you\u2019re free to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I thanked the doctor before following Arturo and Athena outside. Once we were outside the Medical Center, Arturo turned to us, \u201cI have to report back about what happened earlier; so, I\u2019ll see you girls later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArturo left shortly after, but not before Athena and I each gave him a goodbye hug. After watching him enter the transit tunnel, I turned to Athena and said, \u201cSo what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's completely up to you, Cora; we can _____.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Doria Moana. I was twelve, going on thirteen, when it all started. I was, or at least I thought I was, an ordinary girl. A fisherman's daughter in a small fishing town on the shores of Hawaii. That all changed when I got my first period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I was home at the time, feeling rather ill. Dad seemed rather sad when I told him, and I almost went to school despite how bad I felt, but he insisted I stay in bed. I had read up on a woman's menstrual cycles, and thought I was prepared for my first. Only when I found gold-colored scales, like on a goldfish, forming upon my skin, I screamed at the top of my lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was quick to enter my room, seemingly ready for anything. Upon seeing the scales on my arm, however, his eyes teared up, and he sat down next to me. \"I was hoping this wouldn't start for a while.\" Sadly, he said. \"It looks like you're going to meet your mother sooner than planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you're scaring me.\" Tearing up, I said. \"What is happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" sighing, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\" Insistent, I said. \"I'm the one with fish scales growing on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Well, Doria,... you are becoming a mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... what?\" Taken aback, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Those old sailor stories have more truth to them than you might think.\" Calmly, he said. \"There was a terrible storm a little over fifteen years ago. It was my first commanding role, on an ocean research vessel called The Searcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you told me that story.\" Teary eyed, I said. \"You saved everyone on board, nearly drowning in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was when I first met your mother.\" To my surprise, Dad said. \"Her name was Ariana, a direct descendant of the very first mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they could, my eyes would have grown wider. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When in a storm out at sea, waves are not measured in inches or feet, they are measured in increments of fear.\" Serious, Dad said. \"I ordered the entire crew below decks, and took the controls alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dad told his story, I could picture the scene... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves were towering, and they crashed down with unforgiving force. Dad stood out in the elements, the pilot house all but destroyed by the storm. He struggled with the wheel, his body tied down to the deck with ropes, as he steered for the safety of a sheltered cove. He was using the occasional flashes of lightning to see his way. Dad screamed at the storm, shaking a single fist at the threatening clouds, as if to curse it for upsetting the calm sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terrifying wave crashed against the side of the vessel, nearly capsizing it, but Dad turned the vessel into the wave and used it to propel his ship closer to the cove. Lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating the jagged rocks, and Dad spun the wheel, just in time to avoid running aground in the powerful storm. Just as the ship kissed the opening of the cove, a massive wave struck the ship, breaking the ropes and hurling Dad into the sea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought, that was it... I was dead.\" softly, Dad said. \"Only a soft hand touched mine, and I turned to see the most beautiful woman I had even laid eyes upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariana.\" Whispering, I said. I was hanging on every word, picturing every detail of Dad's tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"She pulled me with such speed, it dislocated my shoulder.\" Quietly, he said. \"I screamed as I reached the surface, and she let me go, swimming off back into the sea as quickly as she had come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You met her again, though.\" Hopeful, I said. \"Come on, Dad, this is more than you had ever told me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"The question is, are you ready to hear it, or do you think I'm still telling tall tales of the sea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, frustrated. \"Dad, you're terrible.\" Pouting, I said. \"Don't tease me right now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't too far away, so he ran to investigate. He found the woman he had met in the ocean on the beach, cornered by four muscular blurry men. Dad could not believe his eyes, it was a beached mermaid. They men surrounding her were grinning among themselves, talking about how much money a real mermaid would bring them. Dad had a strong sense of right and wrong, and what he was seeing was all wrong. He ran up to the scene and challenged the men, who turned their attention to him. The woman looked up at Dad with hope in her eyes, which was all he needed to commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first man took a swing, but he was too slow for Dad's reflexes, and was rewarded with a high roundhouse kick to the jaw, sending him off his feet. The second and third man charged Dad, each with a hunting knife in hand. Dad caught the hand of one and kicked the other in the groin. This gave Dad all the time he needed to head butt the one he was holding, before sending him to the sand with a powerful uppercut. The fourth man produced a gun, but Dad had already taken the knife from the second man and threw it into the fourth man's hand, forcing him to drop it. At this point, it was now only two against one. Dad took down the one closest to him with a judo chop, then kicked up a rock from the sand and threw it into the head of the last man, just as he had picked up his gun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all four men out cold, I took the woman into my arms, and carried her back into the water.\" Calmly, dad said. \"Only she surprised me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was again hanging onto every word. \"What did she do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her tail separated into two tails, then became a pair of silky legs.\" Smiling, Dad said. \"She then rolled out of my arms and kissed me.\" He sighed, tears falling. \"That was when she told me her name, Ariana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad cursed under his breath, pulling a tissue from a box on my nightstand to dab at his eyes. I couldn't help tearing up as well. \"You miss her, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time I come back from the sea.\" Sadly, Dad replied. \"If it were not for you, life on land would be unbearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Dad walked out of my room, hiding the fact he was crying. I had a sad feeling he felt he was about to lose me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********  **********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to get out of the house, to think, to give both Dad and me some space. He had always told me that he and Mom were never too far away, and that I would meet her when the time was right.  Still, his story about how he met my mom seemed to really tear at his heartstrings. I had never seen him cry in my life, it made me want to cry with him. I instead began to cry as I walked out on my own down the sidewalk, trying to digest it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still more of the story to tell... \" Sadly, I muttered. \"How did he move from being an oceanographer to a fisherman? What happened to the <i>Searcher</i>, and why has he never told this story before today? I always knew him owning <i>Heart of Doria</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ping of pain in my arm caused me to pause and look. Upon seeing what caused the pain, the tears came faster. It was another small patch of scales... just like I had seen on a goldfish. It shimmered in the light and sent shivers down my spine with the slightest touch. Dad's story was real. The tears came faster, I had never felt more lost, or confused, or frightened in my life. I was in a bit of a fog when I bumped into Cordelia and Adrian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's wrong?\" Seeing my tears, Cordelia demanded. \"Why are you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian frowned, his expression showing his protective side. \"What's his name?\" Gruffly, he demanded. \"We'll break his kneecaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hiccup-like laugh escaped my lips. Adrian could certainly be a brat at times, as most brothers were, but I never met anyone more caring or protective as he. \"I'm going through more changes than most girls deal with.\" Softly, I replied. \"Dad filled me in on some of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian winced. \"He gave you 'The Talk'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I really laughed. \"No,... he told me about how he met my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia sighed, a sad look on her face. \"It's that time, isn't it?\" Softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To say I was surprised would have been an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, he's just asleep for a while.\" Calmly, Cordelia said. \"He's too young to know or even grasp what I am about to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about this.. . ?\" Taken aback, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded. \"You see, Doria,... I'm a mermaid too.\" Softly, she replied. \"It was my job to protect you, and Jonas, your father, until you were ready to go to the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can live on land and sea?\" Surprised, I asked. \"Then why... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoral gave a sad smile. \"Then why is your father so sad? It is because only adult mermaids can move from the sea to the land and back. He will not see you for a few years, once your transformation is complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my arm, uncomfortable. \"Is Adrian a merman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded. \"He still has a few years before he will be joining us.\" softly, she said. \"Still, this is why your father is so sad right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, mermaids and mermen alike can't have sex or reproduce in their oceanic forms, due to having no genitals.\" Serious, Cordelia explained. \"Only while in human form can they mate to carry on the supernatural species.\" She sighed. \"It is only during the night of a full moon that mermaids ovulate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once a month... \" sighing, I said. \"I have a feeling this is The Talk for mermaids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded. \"In mermaids, reproduction is much like that of dolphins.\" Calmly, she said. \"Mermaid babies are born live in the ocean, near the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they are all raised on land?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why you never hear sailors telling stories of child mermaids.\" Serious, Cordelia said. \"It is also why there is a high rate of missing teenagers in this part of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's a mermaid community.\" surprised, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled. \"There are, of course, lots of normal humans here, too.\" Softly, she said. \"Just don't be too surprised if you meet an acquaintance or two when you go to live in the ocean with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, hearing that. \"What can I expect down there?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will be escorted to where we live, but I won't ruin it by describing it to you.\" Bemused, Cordelia replied. \"As for what to expect, you will find many mermen interested in getting to know you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I saw Cordelia smile, and cringed. \"Ew... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia laughed. \"They are not all, as they say on the surface, wolves.\" Smiling, she said. \"Besides, it's the girls who pick the boys, not the other way around, like here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unusual.\" Curious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you take into account the fact that mermen are shorter and less muscular than the mermaids.\" Smiling, Cordelia said. \"Or have you not noticed that Adrian is shorter than most boys his age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to ask more, but Adrian moaned and pulled himself off of the floor. \"What- what happened... ?\" Groggy, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tripped.\" Simply, Cordelia replied. \"I was about to worry, as you hit your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be more careful, bro.\" Catching on, I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian shrugged. \"What were we talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia and I grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, I found more golden scales on my sides and parts of my chest, as well as on parts of my leg. After hearing Cordelia's story, I didn't know how I felt. On one hand, I did want to meet my mother. But, on the other, I didn\u2019t want to hurt Dad by leaving him behind. It brought me to tears all over again, and I began to cry out my frustrations in my room. Hearing me, Dad knocked on my door. \"Honey... are you okay... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to leave you, Daddy... \" Crying, I replied. \"Cordelia gave me The Talk for mermaids, and a little of what I can expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be leaving me forever, sweetheart.\" Hugging me, Dad said. \"Also, think of how long your mother had to wait after you were born to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not argue with that, but I was still worried. \"Can't you go with me... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"Not until Adrian has his changes.\" Softly, he said. \"What kind of father would I be if I left him an orphan, just to be with you and your mother a little early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it won't really be goodbye.\" Smiling slightly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Cooing to me, Dad said. \"Only one of us had to remain on land to care for you, and then Adrian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. \"Did you and Cordelia... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"As far as the landlubbers are concerned, yes.\" Calmly, he replied. \"Only in mermaid society, I am considered a stepfather, due to agreeing to being a father figure for a mermaid's child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... ?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cordelia's mate died, Doria.\" Sadly, Dad explained. \"I agreed to raise Adrian as my own, and she agreed to look after you, until it was time to return to the sea, and take Adrian and me with her when it becomes his turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that.\" Surprised, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a lot of things you don't know.\" smiling, Dad said. he chuckled. \"Mainly because you didn't need to know, and you wouldn't likely believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to The Searcher you said you had captained?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The funding dried up, and I had to find another way to make a living.\" Shrugging, Dad replied. \"Knowing my way around the ocean and the habits of the local fish, I became a fisherman, recommissioning my ship to The <i>Heart of Doria</i>.\" He smiled. \"That was when I met Cordelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... what happened to Mom during that time?!\" Worried, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad again smiled. \"Which do you want to hear first, what happened to your mom, or how I met Cordelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pouted. \"You're terrible, Daddy... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shrugged. \"I'd be happy to tell you both tales, but only one at a time.\" Calmly, he said. \"It's not my fault you find it a difficult decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
