Sonic decided to try it out and see how he like it before signing up for a membership.  He started running on a treadmill.  He started out fairly slow, but soon worked it up to top speed.  It was hardly Sonic's top speed, but he was about just as fast as he was when he was on his jogs.</span></div></div>",

He had cracked Eggman so many times he couldn't make an omlete out of all the yolks.

You get a free meal today.\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to pass up such an opportunity he ordered up several different things off the menu from corn dogs to pizza to ice cream and cake for dessert.  It took him nearly two hours to eat it all.  He had to occassionally walk off some of the food, but inevitably it all went into his stomach.  He patted his bloated stomach.<br>\r\n\"I've never eaten so much before.  I've never felt so bloated either.  I doubt I'll be able to eat for a while.\"<br>\r\nHe took his leave, but not before the waitress gave him a few coupons to the retaurant if he would ever come back.

But he had slowly been changing as he ate more and more every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was fatter; his belly had gone from just round to downright doughy, hanging over his legs and bulging out even when he was hungry.  His arms were wider too, jiggling as his arms moved food from his plate to his mouth.  His butt was larger too, and the size of his legs made his feet look even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to eat more and more, the size and type of his portions had changed; he had gone from small fries to medium onion rings to large grease crisps, and his burgers grew in size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic heaved himself up from the table, having finished his 30th consecutive meal at the restaurant.  \"Thanks for the food!\" he told the cashier, and he waddled out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was outside, he realized that it had been quite a while since he had last seen his friends.  He wondered what they might have been up to while he was pigging away at all these meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" thought the hedgehog, \"who should I see next?\"</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve.... changed since I last saw you.\u201d Tails was surprised to see how big Sonic had gotten.

I\u2019ve just been eating at this new restaurant and the food there is extremely delicious.\u201d Sonic said as he slapped his mighty gut. Tails was unsure what to think about this.

He then suddenly remembered he had those waffles in the microwave, and took a box of the drink mix with him as he rushed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the box, and the drink mix was chocolate mint flavor. Tails' face lit up in glee as he got a big glass to make the mix in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tails didn't look at the finer print on the box, that said \"Drink mix intended for underweight individuals struggling with appetite and/or calorie absorption. Do not consume more than a packet a day for your own safety.\" The calorie information also listed 1000 calories per packet, which was unbelievably high for a simple drink mix. Tails only glanced at the ingredient list to make sure it didn't have MSG or aspartame in it, and proceeded to rip open the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe packets were tiny, half the size of a normal packet of hot cocoa mix, and since Tails always put 2 packets of mix in a cup, he proceeded to rip open 6 packets (there were around 30 in a box) and poured them into his huge glass of milk. He stirred them around briskly with a stirring machine, and got his waffles out of the microwave. Tails slathered syrup on his pancakes and dug in, taking big glugs from his chocolate mint milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tails had finished his big stack of waffles and drank two big glasses of chocolate milk, he layed back in his seat and basked in the glow from being so stuffed. It had been some time before Tails had ever stuffed himself this much - he must've been pretty starved. His stomach was big and bulged underneath him as he rubbed it and got up from his seat to go off to the workshop to work on a project of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then all of a sudden as Tails was under a machine of his fixing it, Tails felt hungry again, like he hadn't eaten anything.

Tails, still reflecting on what Knuckles said, allowed himself to be whisked away in to a chair, lost in his own thoughts. <br>\r\nafter the usual singing of Happy Birthday, the cake was sliced, Sonic, wanting to be fit, gently passed his slice to Tails, \"here bro, eat up\" Sonic said quietly, \"why don't you give it back?\" Tails muttered,\"because A) Ella spent a LOT of time on this, and I don't want to offend her,B) because Cream and Cheese will be sad,C) if I'm the one who made them sad, Amy will kill me and finally D) I want to make up for you today about not being able to join on my run\" Sonic explained. well I guess 2 slices aren't too bad, he thought to himself quietly, he quickly swallowed it, just then, Knuckles passed his bowl of  pasta to Tails,\"sorry about what I said earlier\" Knuckles muttered shyly,\"uh Knux? Sonic just made me..\" Knuckles cut him off \"please, Tails, me and Rouge have a bet....\"<br>\r\nTails sighed, looked at his somewhat balloted gut \"sure Knuckles\" quickly finishing it up, Tails was feeling a little tired and sick, so decided to head to his and Sonic's room, well, actually it was basically Tails's as Sonic spent most of his time running. the moment Tails got down, everyone noticed, they didn't want him to leave, so, to stall him they gave him mountains of food, it was only when Tails went to the bathroom to \"throw up\", well in reality, he just wanted to use it as an excuse to leave. tiredly he walked the many flights of stairs, eventually reaching his and Sonic's room, in the middle of the room was a large bed for him and Sonic to share, a TV in front of it and a PS3, on the left side of the bed was a cabinet, it had all of Tails's Gizmo's and Gadgets, on the right one had a stopwatch, a half empty bottle of water, tired; Tails collapsed on the bed, on his back, ignorant to the fact that if Sonic, or if that someone would come in, would see a large belly sticking out....<br>\r\nA few hours later Sonic walked in hoping to god that Cream didn't see him leave,  Sonic then looked at the bed, there was a small, all most perfect circle ball under the blankets, \"heh\" said Sonic chuckling, Tails must be curled up in to a ball again he thought, he lifted up the blankets and found that it was Tails stomach! \"woah!\" he exclaimed a bit loudly, waking Tails up, then he saw Sonic looking at his gut, Tails blushed.

His once small, medium sized appearance was now a  big, chubby fox reflecting on what tails looked like.  Based on his appereance, he seemed to weigh 225 pounds almost double on what he use to weigh at.  \"Wow, I guess I look better fatter\" tails said to myself while poking at himself.

Punching in a couple of buttons that was on the table and he made a Doughnut Hamburger with cheese and 6 strips of bacon into it.  Looking at the food being made in front of him made a drool a bit, until he realized he forgotten the fries.  \"Hmm... Waffle fries or French Fries?  I guess Waffle fries would be lot better.  Better make sure they are bigger size than normal.  I'm starving over here\"  Tails said to himself.  Adding his fires to the menu, he looked up at the TV and notice that Sonic was defeating eggman's robots again.  \"You think by now he could just avoid those things.  Honestly Sonic, why would you...\" Tails said until a ding noise came from the table.  Tails looked down in front of him and saw on what he ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell and look of the food made Tail's stomach groan more than ever.  He picked up the burger and took a bite outta it.  The 5 pound burger tasted, so sweet and delicious that tails began eating faster.  Tails made it in a couple bites into the burger, until he decided eat the fries with it.  He was about to eat the fries, until he notice that it didn't have any toppings on it.  \"Oh dang it.  I forgot to add salt and pepper to this.\"  Grabbing the salt and pepper shakers, he covered the fires, until he thought he had put enough on top of it.  Grabbing a large waffle fry, bit down into one and instantly fell in love with the taste of it.  He began eating all the fries that he recently covered in salt and pepper.  As he kept eating, his belly and waist started to expand little by little.  \"Oh my god, this food is so good!  I have to remember to order this again.\" Tails said.  He had just finished eating all of the fries and looked over to the burger that he still had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, he reached out, grabbed the burger, and began eating it again.  His body fatten up by eat bite, he eats his way through the middle.  His entire head was surrounded by the burger, but tails thought he could eat his way out of it.  Lifting his head out, he began to eat the side of the doughnut burger, working his way to the end.  His belly began bulge out halfway down his thigh.  Taking another few bites, he realized he was almost done with his food.  He shoved the rest of the burger into his mouth and swallow it whole.  A bulge of the food ran down his throat and down to his fatten belly.  Licking his lips and face that still had the doughnut sugar glaze around his mouth, he gave a content sigh and letting out a thunderous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was just a perfect meal,\" Tails said.  After done eating, he thought he could use something to drink.  He quickly punch a couple of buttons and a extra-large soda popped out of the table and straight into Tails' hands.  Taking his soda, he waddled out of the chair he was sitting on and move into his living room to watch TV.</span></div></div>",

Shaking the cup, tails realized it was empty, so he tossed it right into the trash bin.  Admiring the food that he ate, he began rubbing his belly admiring the taste of his last meal.  \"Wow, my belly feels fatter than before.  Oh well, I love this feeling anyway\" Tails said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails wondered how heavy the food was so decided to lift up his belly.  Using his tails, he began to lift the bottom of belly to see how heavy it was.  He managed to get his belly a inch off his legs, until it came down onto his legs again.  The sloshing of the inside of his stomach made tails feel good on what he just ate.  He began slowly moving his belly side to side with his tails, feeling all of his food being rocked back and worth.  The sloshing of his food moving inside his stomach made him sleepy, so tails decided to lay down on his back and continue to rub his belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Tails fell asleep with his bloated belly still present.

Cream laid her head down into Tails' stomach to hear the churning of food.  With each breathe that Tails would make, it would make his stomach groan and churn more loudly.  In addition, it would make Cream rise and fall with Tails' belly.  Cream began to rub Tails belly, which made Tails open his mouth and flop is tongue out.  \"You loving this don't you?\"  Cream said.  She continued to rub Tails belly, when Tails suddenly started to wake up.  He first looked at the TV to see what time it was and to see if Sonic was still on the news.  \"Ugh... He is still on the news?  I know he is my best friend and all, but this guy is a little too....  Wait a minute.  I feel pressure on my stomach,\"  Tails said to himself.  Looking at his bloated belly he noticed something was on top of his belly.  Tails thought to himself, \"I guess the food I ate hasn't digested fully yet.  It's a good thing to I guess.  I really enjoyed that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tails!\"  Cream said popping out of Tails fat belly with a smile on her face.  \"What are you doing here?!?\" Tails said with a shocked look on his face. \"I thought you were going to the mall with Amy?\"  Cream replied, \"Amy never went to the mall, so I decided to come here since you lived close by.  My, my Tails... wait have YOU been eating?\"  Tails was shocked to see Cream enjoying the sight of himself being fatter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just had something quick to eat and then I fell asleep.  Next thing I notice is your on top of me.\"  Tails said with an embarrassed look on his face.  \"By the way why are you...?\" Tails said before Cream began rubbing his belly again.  \"This is the reason why,\" Cream said.  Tails was loving the fact that he was getting belly rubs with someone.  \"Just the way your belly feels like right now Tails.  It's really comfortable up here,\"  Cream said with a seductive look on her face.  Tails was feeling pure bliss and so comfy that he began rocking is bloated belly side to side again with his tails along with Cream's belly rubs.  Cream and Tails were both enjoying the way Tails fatten belly was sloshing side to side.  \"I love it how your belly moves Tails,\" Cream said with a soft voice.  Tails realized that being friends with Cream was actually taking his relationship with her to another level.  \"I love the way you rub my belly Cream,\" Tails said with soft voice.  Tails was starting love being fat all over again.</span></div></div>",

To him, there's nothing more exciting than the thrill of having a workout on a mountain, going into the forest hungry, picking the ripe fruit and chowing down on it after he's worked up a sweat. Naturally these habits don't leave him with a lot of weight left, so he's not really much more than skin, bones and muscle at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down with his sacks on a big rock outside of the forest, the Master Emerald in clear view. He picked out a cluster of grapes, picked a couple off and tossed them above his head, ready to catch them in his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, they never made it to his mouth. After a few seconds of confusion, Knuckles opened his eyes to see Sonic lounging on a branch above him, munching the grapes with an \"I don't care\" look on his face. \"Oh hey there, Nuckster!\" Sonic announced as if he were surprised to see Knuckles below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles grunt-sighed. \"What are you doing here? You said you were looking out for Eggman again back in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic smirked and closed his eyes as he lied on the branch with his arms behind his head. \"Hey, can I help it if Eggman's more boring than a block of wood? I thought I'd drop in to say hi. You should feel thankful for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles looked unimpressed. He then noticed a small pile of sacks in the corner of his vision. Sonic answered, \"Oh, I decided to help you harvest your fruit, you left so many fruit behind it just bugged me, so I made your job quicker for you. Oh, and they all taste bitter, but I'm sure you're used to health food more than I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles, surprised and perplexed, took a <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fighting</span> annoyed stance towards Sonic and yelled, \"You're supposed to let them get ripe first! You can't just go and pi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic interrupted. \"Hey, if nature can't keep up to speed with my eating, then I can't keep up to speed with waiting for it. Wait, I mean up to waiting with, I mean putting up with- whatever.\" Sonic jumped off the limb and grabbed Knuckles' two sacks fruit. I'll just take my share of the work here, pal. So yeah, sayonara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gestured his hand to his head in a peace sign at the last sentence, right before dashing off to who knows where. Knuckles had gotten up and was going to whack him one but he was so exhausted after working himself all day that he just didn't feel like it. Sure, there was fish, but this was a short season on fish and Knuckles had depended on having some ripe fruit to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles collapsed onto the ground in sweat and hopelessness. \"I can't let myself get this exhausted again, I've got to do something about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Knuckles decide to do?</span></div></div>",

The effort wasn't so much actually lifting the weights, but finding weights that were actually an effort to lift. See, Knuckles already was used to doing a lot of lifting and heavy work in the mountains with boulders, doing lots of odd jobs involving heavy lifting, things like that. So Knuckles was only able to feel a sense of working out by lifting a thousand pounds or more by getting other lifters to sit on the ends of the barbell, and then only if he pumped it for 10 minutes or so. Sonic characters are already freaks of nature, so this wasn't that surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Knuckles got slightly worked out (but mostly bored) after about half an hour, when he set his barbell down on the ground. All of a sudden he smelled a barrage of delicious food smells coming from a doorway behind him, along with the sound of a dinner bell being rung. He could recognize the smells of steak, cinnamon buns, mashed potatoes, cheeseburgers... His mouth started to drool, and one of the other weightlifters put his hand on Knuckles' shoulder and said, \"You gotta eat good between your workouts, or else yain't gonna be bulkin' up none, y'hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles nodded and wiped the drool from his mouth with his fist. He followed the weight lifters, who were making a line to the cafeteria serving table. He was surprised and delighted to see that the serving trays were huge, and the servers were very generous with their portions. Today's menu was steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, but you could go back up and get seconds any time you wanted, and there was a huge variety of foods to eat. Everything he smelled, and so much more, was there and it drove him crazy at the thought. But then he shook his head and said to himself, \"Nope, gotta keep it small, I didn't work out that much today, just eat the steak and potatoes and go back lifting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles finally progressed in the line to the servers, he showed his card, and they loaded his tray with steak and mashed 'taters. He picked up his silverware and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had expected that the food would be lousy, seeing as they were serving so many people and they would have to cut corners wherever possible. But Knuckles was surprised to find out that this was the best steak and potatoes he had ever tasted! After what felt like only a few bites, his tray was empty, and his stomach still felt empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would obviously have to go back for seconds, so he went back to the food tables, where the smells and sights of more steak and potatoes, fruity protein shakes, cinnamon rolls, cheeseburgers, and donuts flooded his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... just a little wouldn't hurt...\"</span></div></div>",

He now was so full that he had to lay down on the cafeteria chairs, which were all deserted by now. Knuckles had never felt so stuffed in his life, and he rubbed his bloated tummy in ecstasy as he licked his lips and quietly moaned a little in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights were turned off, and Knuckles lifted his head enough to look around to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought everyone was out of here already, sorry.\" The janitor turned back on the lights. \"The place is closing for the night, you need to go home, okay? ...glad you enjoyed the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles felt annoyed that they would interrupt him like this, then suddenly realized that he had done almost nothing but stuff himself the whole day.

He was alone, and bored out of his mind; Sonic was off running somewhere, Amy and Cream were off shopping, and Tails was helping his grandfather with some new invention. Tanaka and Ella were nowhere to be found. It was a Saturday, so he was still in his pajamas. Eyes half closed, he looked at a nearby clock. It was 11:00 AM. Shrugging, he got up and headed to his room to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRrrggh! Come on!\u201d Chris grunted as he attempted to button his pants. As of late, there had been a run of relative inactivity from the Chaos Emeralds or Eggman. As a result, Chris had taken to watching more TV, exercising less, and eating more junk food, and his body was beginning to show the effects of it. His waist and stomach were gradually beginning to grow rounder and more pudgy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Chris managed to button his jeans. Other than the fact that his stomach could be vaguely seen pressing against his shirt, his clothes still fit. Looking at himself in the mirror, he sighed, placing a hand on his stomach. He suddenly heard it growl, and blushed. \u201cOh yeah, I didn\u2019t eat breakfast yet?\u201d Chuckling, he made his way to the kitchen and looked around. \u201cLet\u2019s see, what should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
