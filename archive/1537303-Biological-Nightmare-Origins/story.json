Sure, skipping class was worth it, but was it worth taking a short-cut through a burial ground..? After all, months earlier, there were suspicious recounts of murder piling up recently, and not only that, a Fendrick she knew earlier had been accused of delibrately setting things up, but as it stands everyone still wasn't sure as to HOW it occurred. It just did. They never found the missing bodies, but wild tales had cropped up about alien adbuctions and even stranger incidents such as the Bermuda Triangle. But Kaede wasn't the sort to believe them. Chuckling, she brushed against a plated monolith. A cold wind picks up sharply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pale girl shudders, her long wisps of magneta hair sprawl across her face... There was movement, a subtle creeping movement as something spwaned from the depths of the earth crawls through the ground. It suddenly latches onto the frightened girl as the teenager found herself clawing at her airways, as something not quite human PUSHED its way into her. It happened so quickly, it took only a blink of two eyes as it burrowed deeper into the body.<br>\r\n\"He-l-elp,\" she gasps, just before a scream welled up and as all went dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am Sector Duskbrood.</i> seethed the bubbling mass, <i>Victim Infiltration complete.

Chris was not happy when a police officer held him accountable for speeding and he grimaced as he stuck his pale head out the window,<br>\r\n\"Chris Endor?\" spoke Officer Federick, his shadowy longish hair obscuring the rest of his handsome face, \"You are hereby arrested for speed-\" The response was a slap in the face:<br>\r\n\"Do ya think I care about some god-friking demerit ticket?\" Chris pointed out, \"Just doin' my job here! nothing to see here! Moving along!\" The smirk was wiped off Chris's face soon enough as Officer Federick leant down.<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see about that.\" Federick grinned nastily as he reached down and then Chris noticed that there was a yellow glint in the officer's shimmering eyes...</span></div></div>",

The first plot involves an infested Kaede and Shuka's investigation into the incidents, depending on how Kaede is treated by the others the parasite can be good, neutral or evil depending on their reaction. The second is a survival-horror where tourist-campers Hussen, Felicity and Seth are hunted down by the same parasite and they all fight for survival. It's up to you where you take this to the limits.
