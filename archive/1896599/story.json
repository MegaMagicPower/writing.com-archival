Sometimes I just want to shot myself because of the pain. I'm fighting against my friends who cared about me and helped me when I was down and depressed, I just want things to go back to normal. The Good ol' days, when we didn't bicker about which gender is superior. Each gender cant be without the other. If one goes, the other will follow. This war has blinded both of us and if we keep on with this war, just as if a blind man leads another blind man, we'll both fall off a cliff.</span></div></div>",

The collar was not for mind control, Sonic insisted to Hypon when he came to get her collar off, it was only a short range mini burst nerve shocker. Basically, if Ice happened to attack a boy guard, the collar would send pulses to her brain's motor functions to halt her attack, with no brain damage other than a slight headache and the quiet need to find something else to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sonic didn't tell Hypon was that the collar had to be removed by a tech, it could not be manually altered, and also reacted to increases in mood or emtions that are considered dangerous. Sonic did say that it was the next step with collars when the girls stop trying to kill their masters, since it was less stressful. Ice however didn't appreciate the added features, it still felt like she was on a leash which technically she was.</span></div></div>",

This was for the sixth time in a row that his robot side was being altered without his permission and was starting to confuse his fox brain. Eric tested each of his robot brain's lobes, very lucky that he could tell what he was doing and really was glad he learned how to fix himself after being freed from the late Eggman. \"Looks fine from here, but why does something feel off?\" Eric mused as he worked, sure to be quiet for Amy, who was in the bedroom while he was out on the couch. \"Possibly since that Nicole girl had some fun with our system.\" Cindy, Eric's robotic side of mind answers back with an electronic sigh of annoyance. \"She practically ripped up our system protocols with so much hacking and altering. I am surprised you aren't in a scrap heap by now.\" Eric keeps working despite his robot mind taunting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are you going to tell Amy?\" Cindy asks, intruding on Eric's work. \"Tell her what?\" Eric responds, half working and the other half listening. \"About me, I mean seriously? You finally got a real girl for your lonely butt, however, you neglected to inform her about the girl in your head? What's that about?\" Eric tries not to scoff but does it anyway. \"Maybe because I want her to think I'm normal? Maybe because if you did meet her, she would consider me more machine than fox? Just like everyone else has?\" Cindy pours and starts to run data from his side to Eric's brain. \"Maybe... still a girl needs some girlfriends at some point.\" Eric muffled his laugh with a hand. \"Girl? Your an interface, made to help me deal with this body. You have no gender, except that name you forced me to give you. Besides, you'd bore them to death with your data and I'm not sure you could keep up with current fashion.\" Cindy gives Eric a jolt. \"I could if you gave me a try, but enough, if you keep my brain open too long, I'll get dust and run slower.\" </span></div></div>",

But Sonic deals with Shadow's arrogance and blindly follows and Sally's royal pride sometimes gets the better of her. I never wanted this war to happen between my friends, Amy, why would I? Have you ever wondered why I am not as violent as the other boys who you patrol or ever think why some girls still come to me to talk and ask me for advice? Amy, do not make threats to those who are not your enemy; for this war was not my doing. Gender may tell what side I am suppose to be on, but can you see what my mind is actually thinking or what my heart is truly speaking of?\" Do not come to judge me if you do not know all the facts, little Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Hypon did not speak another word and began to mediate as he did when he trained with Espio years ago, but he hoped that Amy would not enter the cell, for he had something for her to see about their past together. </span></div></div>",

As Hypon walked to the bathroom to bandage his hands, Amy then saw something resting on his desk. Amy felt her body moving towards the desk and saw that it was a typed letter that was going to her room number as she saw the envelope. The letter rested next to a very red rose and the letter was folded nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy was looking at the letter, she heard past Hypon muttering to himself in the bathroom, \"I hope I know what I'm doing. This is the second time you going to do this and we both know how the first time played out. One heartbreak in hard enough, but two.. <b>sigh</b>. Come on, Hypon, pull yourself together, you like this girl and you are going to let her know how you feel.\" Amy then felt the surroundings change into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Past Amy's Room, Hours later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was taking care of Cream and brushing her hair while Cheese was sitting in Cream's lap. Amy looked at her past and saw how happy and content she was in the past but then it quickly divided into two scenes: what happened in her room and what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hypon was looking around the corner and wait for the right moment to place the letter on her front door. Inside, Amy kept playing with Cream and Cheese. Hypon then made his move and quickly placed the letter by her door and quickly hurried back to the corner, sitting at the corner. But to his surprise,  Amy didn't come out but the letter was gone moments later, making Hypon have a little shard of hope that he finally found someone to love who wouldn't betray him. But then Amy then saw a female Freedom Fighter take the letter from her door, now realizing Hypon had a crush on her back then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back in the present...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was holding the hammer right next to his cheek and Hypon said, \"That day was very hard to deal with when I actually heard what happened to my letter. I found the rose I placed in that love letter of mine in a trash can in the lunchroom. It was completely dead and completely wilted. Do you want to be the one who crushs this rose, Amy? </span></div></div>",

I guess I would need to start with a couple of weeks before the start of the war. Sally came to me and stated that she was going to stop Sonic and the other boys while they were still pretending that girls weren't going missing. See she knew what they were doing and she was going to put her foot down. However, she started to lose her trust in all of the boys, including you. She had Wave design a massive pulse weapon that would later be fine tuned into our feminine ray weapons and sex change machines, one hit and you switched chromosomes. She had the chance to take out every boy, but I tried to convince her that not all boys were bad.\" Frost  started to explain and ramble slightly as she looked at Hypon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days before the war, Sally came back to me again and told me that she was going to go through with her plan regardless of the countless boys who didn't even do anything. However, if I proved my loyalty to her and only her, she would spare to boys the indecency of an unfair fight.\" Frost looked down and couldn't face Hypon. \"That required I cut off all ties to boys, including you, and even the girl versions of the boys. But I did, because I cared about all of the boys and girls, but not even close to how much I love you Hypon. Because I left you, the war kicked up and the boys were able to defend themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost was then quiet for a bit and looked back at Hypon. \"I guess what I'm trying to tell you, is that if I didn't leave, close to every boy would be a girl.

At first glance, she seemed like any other recruit for the girls with her uniform of Freedom Fighter battle armor crudely altered to show off her feminine assets, yet something about her green eyes told a different story. A story of pain and hardship, yet cold determination, which is what first made Hypon realize who he was seeing. The girl in the corner was an altered Eric Prower, once ally and friend, now a pawn of Sally with a body to fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her fur color stayed the same, her body was morphed in a way pleasing to the eye. Slender hips, C cup breasts and a behind shapely enough to catch eyes as she went by without slowing her down. She was thin, yet muscle hid under her form that was fox. The alteration kept her robotic left side, but it appeared that several things were stripped away from the arms and legs, tricks and gadgets that were dangerous to anyone and everyone gone. Her robotic eye glowed green in a way that almost made it blend with the other eye. Almost. She acted as cold as her robotic side, but he could see that she didn't treat him with the stare of lust or hatred, but of pity of his situation as if she remembered him. She had a dagger on her left side and some pouches that could only have held her tools of thievery on her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles continued as if Eric had not walked in and shook her head. \"From where I am standing Hypon, you are at no way in an advantage. I'd say this is your lowest point, before you get sold out to every female here as a prostitute, which should lower the bar more.\" </span></div></div>",

Each broke us in a couple of hours and then taught us how to pleasure any sex as that is our jobs for now on after a trip to the blackroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brainwashing, how low...\" Frost said, disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been fucking since, so much fun and it will never end!\" Both foxes said together with a smile and faced Hypon again. \"Now are you sure you don't want a quickie with us?

Hypon muttered as he moved his clenched fist away from the wall, showing the small amount of cracks that came from his punch to the solid concrete wall, \"I am tired of this war, Frost. I'm tired of all the bullshit that started over a petty squabble between ideals. This has to stop before they both destroy Mobius. Too much blood has been shed, so many innocent lives snuffed out and been replaced with faces that no one can recognize anymore. The Balance has been shifted into chaos and somebody has to fix it sooner or later or we will all perish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hypon was captured, he saw a vision retaining to Dark Gaia and that the light has been snuffed out by the chaos that ensued the land riddled with constant war. Hypon planned on finding a way to stop it, he was caught by a team had Sally had placed to scout high-value targets. Even as he resisted and fought back against his capturers, it wasn't enough. Hypon came back and quickly turned to Frost, giving her a quick hug before she spoke; holding her tight like he used to and setting her down, knowing that he interrupted her with the hug, waiting on what she had to say.</span></div></div>",

You made a little storm in here, how cute Frost.\" A voice she knew spoke out but the creature that had taken his place was unknown to her as she tried to keep herself from going native on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No comment? Well, I guess we should skip the pleasantries and get to business then.\" The voice slowly came closer as the steps stopped a few feet from where she was sitting, the blue hedgehog in a winter coat staring at her. Frost held a stare that noticeably unnerved Sonic as they locked eyes, she was holding back rage and displaying disgust at the mockery of his presence. \"I want her, now. Tell me where she is, and you will be taken care of. Anything you want, any... girl you want... is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a response, Sonic saw Frost look up before she spat in his face, looking back down as she continued her meditation.

You know it is a matter of time before we get her, save countless lives and tell me now, there is no shame in defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost however let her jaw go back into position before she spat blood on his shoes, remaining in her seat as her jaw throbbed but didn't want Sonic to have the satisfaction of seeing her hurt. When Sonic saw what she had done to his prized sneakers, he scowled deeply but did not press his luck with her and stepped back. \"I guess you think you're tough doing this, we will see how tough you are in the Boiling room. Guards, take her away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost slowly stood up but she was quickly knocked down when they electrocuted her, the collar on her neck sending currents of juice through her spine and body.

By keeping the heat of the room elevated well above what was comfortable, the prisoners would be stuck in a all day sauna that would slowly sap away their energy while they sweated it out. Most prisoners tried to tough it out or assumed it was a joke until all too late when they were too weak to even move. Although normal prisoners can be placed inside, it became popular and effective to place water or ice powerful enemies into the rooms to extract info. Once inside, it is difficult to get out, and every second is one that could permanently end you if you don't hydrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost sipped her warm water as she sat in her new cell, trying yet again to bend the water in her sweat and cup to move to her will. However, being effective with cold and freezing, her efforts were little to water that was warm, yet it was something to distract her and keep her working. Since she was put into the Boiling Room, she was terribly uncomfortable and found herself restless and unable to sleep for more than a two or more hours at a time. She found herself shaking again and slowly stopped it as as she drank more water, her body suffering at the high heat that consumed her. She was forced to strip down to her underwear in order to prevent from completely overheating in her metal guard outfit, but no matter how hot it went she didn't go farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew somewhere was a camera or a false wall with boys watching and didn't want her privates on display. Yet they gave her water to keep her moving, as they knew it was necessary for the task, and Frost did her best to try and make the water she had work for her. Luckly she was almost able to move the water a little bit, but she only felt more drained as she felt herself feel weak again. \"Damn it, just a little more and I can get out.\" She muttered to herself before she gave up angrily and finished her water before laying on the warm ground to try and rest. \"Maybe next time, and then Sonic is mine...\" She almost growled as she passed out on the floor of her cell, unaware of the eyes that were watching her until they left her to her sleep.</span></div></div>",

The loss of General Frost caused a dip in the girl attacks but slowly they were able to make up their defenses, not everything she taught them was lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost herself was not in good shape. She had been in the boiling room for a month, longer than any other prisoner and she could not stop the shaking of her body. Frost endured so much, yet the temperature was winning out over her stubborn personality, as well as the lack of food and people to talk to. Solitary confinement in the small room was driving her crazy, her own mind playing tricks on her, seeing people who weren't there and memories playing out on the walls. Frost was practically eager when someone delievered her water, trying to hear them or call out to the one true thing to try and focus away from her stressed out mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she worried, for the fate of her friends, for Sally and her boyfriend. Yet she tried to stay positive, and hoped that Sonic pulled her out of the hell she was forced to live through. She thought about this as she sat in her cell and watched her oldest Samantha love dance in front of her, finding somekind of joy from it, even knowing it was not real. However her show was interrupted by something she did not expect would happen, hearing the sliding of a bolt before the door to her cell opened a crack, bringing in colder air in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, Frost thought her mind was playing another trick on her so she slowly approached the open door and poked at it, surprised to find that it was real, immediately feeling tears swell in her eyes as she had not realize how happy she was to be free. She then shoved the door open and fell out her cell, the cold air giving her body a chance to finally cool off, easing the shaking of her body before she felt cold metal touch her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost opened her eyes to see Sonic above her, holding a ray gun in his hand pointed at her head that was used to stun enemies in combat. The grin on his face made her claws come out but he simply shoved the ray gun more in her face, not willing to take a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, get up!\" Sonic shouted at her before he hit her with the side of his gun, making her head flash with white before she dropped flat to the ground. \"Move it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly got up from the ground, although her knees tried to buckle under her twice, she got almost head level with Sonic before he grabbed her by the back of her neck and shoved her down the hall, his gun pointed at her back. She did not know where she was going but with how Sonic treated her, she did not expect much in the humane department.</span></div></div>",

Seeing the boy base reminded Frost of her time exploring her first town after being exiled by force, just as seedy and offensive, slaves walked the hallways and there was always a boy who was rough with them. It made her sick, yet Sonic the Hedgehog seemed like it was normal to parade around half-naked women on their knees doing forced acts, making her think it was all for his and his boy's egos. The collars around the slaves necks changing who the women were, into whatever the base wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there laid Frost's expectations as they stopped in front of a pair of doors, marked \"Interrogation\". Sonic jab her back with the tip of his ray gun as he moved her to one door and lead her through it, revealing a table with a bar through a side. She tried to move to the chair but was whacked again by Sonic until he picked her up by her arm and dropped her into the chair himself, cuffing her arms to the bar and then her feet to chains on the floor. \"I was going to sit down, do you get off hitting defenseless women now Sonic?\" Frost commented as she felt her cheek bruise from the second hit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not taking chances with you.\" He responded as he made sure she was locked in tight, slowly moving to the other side of the table. Sonic then pulled a few things out from a cabinet across from the door, placing a knife, a tazer, a file with her name on it, and a police baton on the table that was out of her reach. \"You will talk, don't get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say the same for you Hedgehog.\" Frost answered back, frowning as Sonic left the room with a slam, testing her restraints to find she was stuck. The room was simular to the one on the old base, dark with a single light in the center and a one way mirror on the opposite side, and uncomfortable chairs. They even turned up the temperature but she barely noticed it as her eyes were focused on the mirror. They were sending someone to break her, since Sonic didn't have the balls, and she was prepared to again state nothing. However her time in the boiling cell had left her drained and she was still seeing hallucinations in the dark of enemies and friends alike, so she hoped she still had it in her as the boys choose who would come in and try.</span></div></div>",

I guess after ratting me out to the squirrel and having me stripped of rank, you'd thought I wouldn't come back. I guess I'm not done haunting you yet.\" The leopard reaching into her pocket and took a swig of a flask she had, extending it to Frost before taking it back before her ex could reach it. \"Now isn't this a familiar scene? You coming to me to make the world a little bit more bearable for the toy sword sweetheart...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley however stood up and grabbed the taser, zapping it in the air a few times near Frost's face, her own grim and hateful. \"Not today native, 'cause now you have little old me to deal with. You can't talk you way out of this one, your sweet talk has run out with me the second I was locked up in a small metal box for a long time. And now... the roles are reversed... how typical of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost tried to face Ashley, feeling old anger bubble up as she responded with an anger she reserved for Sonic. \"I was correcting you. You were a drug kingpin working as a slaver the moment I met you, using your power to bust your rivials and sell their product! That was your choice, and it came to bite you, if it wasn't me it would've been another of the guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit! You were my girlfriend, you were supposed to back me up or leave if your panties were that twisted over it. But the last thing you were supposed to do was stab me in the back by going to the princess, then having me throw in prison. If I remember right, you enjoyed my stash the same as any of my customers, so fuck off with the white knight routine. We both know you have some grey in there...\" Ashley snapped, slamming her hands on the table just as the room went icy cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice wolf in chains stared back and stood up, her powers flowing from her in small bursts as Frost managed to control what she had in her tank. \"I got addicted because you took advantage of a girl with no street-smarts. I didn't want to take that junk, but you keep pressuring me until I ended up so messed up that I nearly lost everything! How was I supposed to leave when my girlfriend was fucking up everything my best friend was working towards?! You talk about betrayal, but the biggest betrayal is you abusing my trust and loyalty to claim a position you didn't earn and poisoning what relationship we had with your drugs and greed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Frost finished, she felt her legs give out and fell back into her seat, her body still weakened from her time in the Boiling room, her eyes losing focus on the smirk of the purple leopard who was her girlfriend. \"I'd say we could argue this all day, but you look like you'll pass out in an hour. Now that our trip down memory lane has concluded...\" Ashley grabbed the knife and walked over to Frost's side of the table and picked her nails with the tip of the blade, her eyes cool but her smile dark and foreboding. \"Where is that uptight bitch Sally and her little friends...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat a dick and choke, I'm not saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple leopard laughed instead of being offended, making Frost confused as the knife was slammed into the table. \"I thought that was your thing now? Some boy from that tribal forest you call home, Hyper... Hype... oh yes, Hyperion. I heard he was in the building since you've been here, and he hasn't even tried to save you? Tsk tsk tsk.\" Ashley laughed again as Frost lowered her head in silence, raising it only when the cold baton under her chin and forcing the ice wolf to lock eyes with her ex. \"I guess he doesn't care about you after all, letting Sonic do what he wants with you. It's sad really, but it seems like only your info will give you a chance. Hmm, maybe I'll see if he really is as loyal as you believe he is, if he even remembers you when he works me over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley barely finished her sentence when she was headbutted hard by Frost, giving her a fat lip and the start of a bruise. She laughed dryly before she hit Frost with the baton hard in the head, wiping the blood from her lip. \"Looks like I hit a nerve. Good. Time to go back home girl, I'll be back once I got your man running circles around me.\" Frost barely looked up before another hit knocked her lights out, leaving her limp as she was dragged back to the Boiling Room and locked up once again.</span></div></div>",

He was in his office that he was assigned to as one of the Wardens of the Prison Sector, but he had a few restrictions placed on him because of Sonic's belief that Hypon was trading secrets to the other side which was false. Hypon wasn't that stupid when it came to a position of power, however; He was to blame for Frost's capture as he thought that he wasn't followed to their meeting place that was his old village's ruins to finally see her in person rather than dreams hence why he was not able to face her without feeling any guilt for what had happened but tried to make sure that she wasn't treated like most of the prisoners that weren't in his sector but to no avail  because of Sonic's tampering. Over the month, Sonic and Hypon were at each other's throats over the situation and almost led to several fights between them. Sonic may have more authority than Hypon, but he didn't have the respect of most of the men. Everyone could tell that Sonic was slowly losing it, but no one wanted to say anything about it due to what he could do to them. Hence why Hypon was not executed and placed under heavy watch along with a minor restricted access that didn't apply to his current position because if he was to be killed; Sonic would have to face not only the wrath of half the base and Sally but Frost's anger as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was well-liked by his prisoners and by most of the base who didn't blindly follow Sonic's orders without question. His sector mainly consisted of the previous male populous who were taken and transformed into women and captured in previous battles along with a few normal girls who none of the wardens could control. He treated each member of his sector as equals to himself, not using force unless absolutely needed. He didn't have many guards under him, but he could do without the drama of the guards who were too frisky with the inmates and other antics that occurred in the other sectors. However, Hypon was very troubled after being awakened from his meditation, expecting that Frost was being interrogated currently; which did not please him as he despised using violence on prisoners as it never helped anyone. He just sighed before getting off the ground and pulling up his cameras to keep an eye on his prisoners as he got dressed for his rounds, his mind wandering as he hoped that he would be asked to help with anyone's \"tensions\" as he wasn't in the greatest of moods to help anyone in that way after the month he had fought against Sonic and his lackeys who tried to hurt him but failed miserably. It didn't take long for him to get his jacket and armor on and readied himself for anything and everything.</span></div></div>",

His first thought was that one of his own prisoners had gotten free and was looking to shack up, as a female that wasn't under control were practically finite, yet she wore the uniform jacket of a lieutenant in Sonics army with a badge marked as \"hands off\". She didn't care for the troop standards as she wore black leather boots that went just below the knee and her long hair was below her shoulders, a t-shirt under her jacket that held a reference to a show well before the war. She was armed with a stun gun and a knife that was on her otherside of the belt, which wiggled as her walk seemed to show off her hips. She was pretty attractive with a shapely body that grabbed eyes as she walked along the cages, which made him wonder how someone like her wasn't under guard or how she managed to become enlisted in the Boy Army of all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon remembered that someone had told him something about a leopard in the past but he didn't managed to recall it as the girl approached him and stood right in his path. \"Hello Hyperion. I've been looking to meet with you for some time now. My name is Ashley, I was recruited by Sonic not too long since he captured this base and found me here.\" The purple leopard managed to smile, but her eyes were full of a hunger that Hypon couldn't tell was for him or for something he would lead her to. He could also smell some drugs in her pack now that she was closer to him that seemed to rest behind her belt and that she had lit a joint not that long ago, but her fat lip and a bruise on her chin concerned him as the seemed fresh.</span></div></div>",

You can join if you want, but be warned; you might attract some very unwanted attention that you may or may not want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Hypon made his way down the corridor, catching a few eyes that were focused on him and the leopard, rolling his eyes as he continued his walk and making sure on each inmates' needs and requests, writing it down, and going down the line.

Unfortunately, my matters are on a deadline and I think you should know why I'm really here for you before someone suspects what I came here for.\" Hypon still worked as the leopard fumbled around her pocket and pulled out her ID to him, showing her status as an \"Prisoner Negotiator\".

Some brute of a boy is interrogating her on Sonic\"s orders and he hasn't been easy on her or me. Bastard clocked me in the face when I told him to get his hands off of her, and he barely got in trouble for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stamped out her joint at the end of the line of cells and faced Hypon with a sympathetic look. \"I'm taking a big risk talking to you about her case, the hedgehog has made it clear that he wants you in the dark, but I think you can get her to call off this suicidal path through me. Just tell me something just she and you know, so that she can believe I'm talking to you and maybe she can get out of the Boiling room if she tells something small. She's been in there for a while, and I'm not sure she can handle much more before she breaks down. Please Hypon?\" Even though Hypon felt that she has a bad vibe and clearly was in deep with many of the things he fought against in the past, her story seemed to phase him as he hadn't actually heard about anyone particularly interrogating Frost or that they had her locked in the Boiling room for a while.

She is complaining of the lights and she won't stop covering her ears so we think it's a migraine.\" One of the guards commented as Hypon knelt by her side and looked her over, his eyes filled with distrust in him; but honest concern for the prisoner. \"It might be the food, we're using some older stuff since the shortage for the girls.\" Another commented as he was checked her neck for a pulse, with no change as far as he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightwolf took his time to check everything and quickly started to give the correct medicines to help lessen her symptoms, removing her bounds once she was properly locked up again and addressed his guards. \"We requested fresher food already, remind them that if they hold back on proper foods, these women have less to lose if they want to break out. They are our people, even changed, they deserve to have proper meals. Keep an eye on her if she gets worse, I need to get back to my office, but call me again if she acts out again.\" He then jogged towards his office as he had a feeling Ashley would be getting restless or she would be called to some task soon, but mostly he wondered if she had messed with his office. When he arrived at his office door, he opened it to find Ashley sitting in his desk with her feet up while she read from a folder that looked like a prisoner file. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything fine?\" She asked as she lifted her eyes from it, not apologetic for taking his spot, but the photo clipped on the folder caught his eye. It was his girlfriend Frost, from the time well before the war for her Freedom Fighter profile, dressed in her guard uniform from way back when with an Acorn insignia on the shoulders. There was also a red stamp on the outside marked \"VIP: Capture or Kill\", but Hypon guessed the file was before they took Frost captive as it was not one of his. \"Just some light reading while I waited in a comfy chair...\" Ashley told Hypon as he closed the door behind him, closing it to address him fully.</span></div></div>",

Ashley figured a memory between the two was as good as anything to trick Frost and pulled a photo album that seemed to date before the war, slipping through pages quietly while glancing up to see if Hypon was coming back. She only wanted to get inside her ex's head and get her to cough up the details, wrapping up the leopard's business with Sonic and allowing her to roam beyond the base without fear of becoming a slave. The idea of guys going at her without her having any control made her sick and scared, as she never cared for any guy the same way she cared for the women she had been with. She did wonder what made Frost make the leap, as she couldn't get her to give the goods high or sober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally snagged a decent choice page where she saw pictures of them outside of some mountain village, one where they were at a beach and another outside of the base they are in now.

Ashley did know from Frost's stories of her tribal the importance of tattoos and figured she likely got it once they decided to go steady. It was a start, and all she needed was a way to get Frost to believe that Hypon wasn't coming to save her and the job would be done. \"If only it could really be that simple...\" Ashley muttered as she popped back some pills, now needing to dull her aching heart as well as her head.</span></div></div>",

I've learned that her bond with Hypon is stronger than I first thought, but I managed to do some research and found some chinks in that armour of hers that I will rip to pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic however didn't look impressed as he put his pencil down, resting his hands down as he stared her down. \"I am fighting a war here, every second we waste is one Sally can use to bring me down, I don't have time for you to chat up your ex! I even managed to get your old gear and your extensive list of narcotics to help get you into the mood faster, but now I'm honestly wondering if I made a mistake allowing you to wander freely here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am doing what you instructed me to do, but your petulance doesn't help anyone!\" Ashley stared him down, having faced worse threats than the boy in a chair twice his size. \"You knew that I could get into Frost's mind and you gave me this chance to get the job done, so let me work in peace. I finish my jobs so don't turn a friend into an enemy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog gritted his teeth as he was picturing ways to break the leopard into nothing but a sex slave, but managed a smile that held too much sweetness to be honest. \"Of course. Just remember our agreement, Frost for your own freedom, and if you fail you will join the others.\" Sonic then pressed a button on his desk and Mina Mongoose came into the room with a collar and went behind the desk, resulting in a horrified look on Ashley when she began to pleasure him, only for him to wave her away. \"Don't come back until you have her barking on command. Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple leopard moved at a fast pace from the office, growling as she hated this set up he had her in, thinking of ways to get back at him as she popped back more pills until she felt her body finally get numb again. \"Alright Tara, this will hurt you just much as I know it will. If not, then maybe I have to go off script...\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't just going to stand aside for that...not anymore. After Hypon locked up his office, he made his way directly over towards Sonic's office. He was prepared to bring hell with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way over towards Sonic's office, Hypon made his way before being stopped by a collection of soldiers before kindly asking what the meaning of this was. One of the soldiers, a tabby cat named Gerald looked at Hypon and spoke, \"If you think we are going to let you pass through his hallway, sympathizer. You have another thing coming.\" Hypon just looked at Gerald and then the other soldiers before simply saying, \"We might be at war but not every person has to follow Sonic's thought process and honestly; I don't care what a few grunts think about my methods. Now, I will ask again to kindly move out of my way.\" Gerald laughed at Hypon's face before shoving him back. Hypon just sighed before punching Gerald in the gut, watching the cat drop to his knees before having Hypon's own knee connect with the tabby's nose before speaking to the hurt grunt, \"I asked nicely\" before looking at the others, adding, \"Now, do I need to send more people into the medical bay or can I pass through now.\" The other guards moved out of Hypon's way, leaving their \"friend\" laying in the floor as the wolf made his march without hesitation or fear. Hypon meant business and was ready to go above Sonic if he had to if the hedgehog would not budge.</span></div></div>",

I swear Sonic, if you hurt her in any way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic however just stood up and walked to his window, resting his hands on the sill while he looked outside at the courtyard exercises, not particularly intimidated with his threat. \"You were not in the need-to-know. The bias you have for her safety would put the interrogation at risk of failure, which puts everyone on this base at risk. Do you see everyone out there? We are in a war, something that doesn't look favorably to time wasted. Right now, Sally's forces are fighting our boys and she is causing many boys to become girls or become wounded beyond any battle.\" Sonic turned to face Hypon, his look sour at Hypon as he crossed his arms and leaned back on the sill. \"Frost has the power to end this, yet her stubbornness to talk has made us have to be more... practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This war is between you and Sally over your ideals, everyone else is forced to be a part of the ride.\" The Nightblood spoke clearly, but quickly followed up after Sonic started to chuckle. \"My 'bias' towards Frost is because I know what you would be willing to do to her to get what you wanted, which is everything. You and your methods on getting women to talk are inhumane, and if what boy you have going at Frost so much as tries, I will castrate him if she won't.\" Hypon felt the gun barrel nudge his head but Sonic shook his head, so the guard stepped back again. \"I want Frost in my care and outside of that Boiling room, right now, or I will go to the council to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue hedgehog however continued to laugh, pressing a button on his desk that brought more soldier to aid him. \"The council already knows about Frost, the majority signed off with getting her to talk by whatever means, apparently they can see the need to get Sally's bodyguard and top general to sing. And about the methods to get the Ice wolf to sing, she might actually prefer the person working on her than some of my others.\" Hypon could hear some chuckles from behind him as the guards aimed at him, but Sonic just sat back at his desk and watched him. \"I did agree with the council that after we had gotten every single bit of info out of that girl, she will be returned to you. Although, she will wear a collar like the others and will obey commands from you, me and a third party that you don't need to know about yet. Can't have her going back and causing trouble... although she does stir up a certain response from the recruits being half naked all the time...\"</span></div></div>",

He then answered Sonic with calm sense while Hypon's anger could be felt within the room as the shadows seem to expand across the room, \"You can keep dreaming, Sonic. There is no way that the council would agree with your methods to get information out of Frost and I will get to the bottom of this even if I have to call an emergency meeting to get them all together. Better enjoy the power while you have it because it's all about to crumble underneath you...\" Hypon then turned to look at the guards and began to move his way through them before a few guards that were hansy got a quick elbow or fist to the upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon and Sonic never got along and this war didn't help that case as he hated the methods that Sonic adopted to be used on prisoners (male and female). While Sonic had control of the army; Hypon did his best with the prisons while trying to convince the council that Sonic is no longer fit to lead the army. Most of the council contained male elders from most of surrounding areas and included the echindas, several hedgehogs, and previous veterans from past wars who were too old to fight anymore. Both sides had a form of council and were deemed untouchable but that didn't stop Sonic from trying and \"bending\" any of female council members which should had been enough to remove him from power but any item that came from Hypon could look like a way for him to seize control as he was the second in command after Sonic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had proof of Sonic's misconduct but had to persuade the council to give him control which was harder said than done as two members of Sonic's family were on the council.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Ice Wolf sat on her bed in the corner of her cell, taking deep breathes as she embraced the cold of her room and trying to get herself ready for her plan in motion. A member of what she assumed was the council was doing checks as \"requested\" by a \"warden of female POW's\" and found her nearly dying in the Boiling Room, which led to her being reassigned to her previous cell that was still half frozen by her earlier efforts. Frost did ask to see the warden, wanting to thank what little humanity she got, but the council member explained that it wasn't possible until she cooperated with Sonic's questions about Sally and her info. It still helped in a big way once she crunched down the ice and managed to rehydrate and calm her worn-out body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost did still have to deal with the remaining problem between Sonic trying to break her again, along with the threat of sex by any number of boys in the base, and the almost certainty that she was not going to get her clothes back from the Boiling Room. Yet she had much more mobility in an environment she could control, along with a body that was stronger and the return of most of her mind from unraveling into mush. To deal with the second issue, she put a heavy freeze on any camera and two-way mirror in the room that may give the boys ideas about her body, the third wasn't much of a problem as she was comfortable in the cold to the point she could easily sleep naked in the snow, as long as no one would be able to stare if they couldn't get in easy. The issue with Sonic was much harder than a simple fix, requiring outside help or submitting to Sonic and likely being collared like a pet, both extremely unlikely to happen. She could escape, as long as she planned it right, but the risk that would fall to her boyfriend would be heavy and she could bet Sonic would use him to get to her just like before she was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea on how to get word to Hypon would require more... finesse, as most boys wanted to bed her than pass word to her true partner, along with Sonic who would be keeping an eye on any communications she had and also wanted to break her in a bed. Yet her past had taught her the value of a motivated asset, one that was on their way by Sonic who thought he was getting to her. Frost turned to the door of her cell and saw Sonic along with the yellow mongoose she requested, thankfully dressed in clothes that would keep her warm in the environment, yet wore the collar of a slave. \"So you finally gave in about my offer?\" Sonic spoke through his own winter clothes as he shoved Mina into the room, holding a ray rifle in his hands just in case. \"Figures after you saw your home for pissing me off. Now... after your night of fun, you better start talking about that squirrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get everything you deserve Sonic, I will make sure of that...\" The Ice Wolf responded as she helped Mina up and moved her to the bed, careful to watch him leave and paused until she knew he had left. She made sure to thicken the ice as much as possible to prevent the collar's signal from being caught outside the room and quickly smacked away Mina's hands when she started to strip down. \"I don't want that and don't worry, he can't hear or see us right now beyond the storm.\" The yellow mongoose looked confused as the 'training' they had done on her through the collar had a toll on her, making her try again until the Ice Wolf held her hands in her own. \"Mina... I cannot even imagine what you have been through, but you can help end this hell if you do me one simple request. I need you to find Hypon and deliver a message to him only, and if anyone asks, I am asking you to tell Hypon dumping him in exchange for you to be my girlfriend, make up a reason why. Can you do this for me Mina?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the mongoose seemed to drift away in her mind and Frost was worried that tbe former star was too far gone to help, yet a tight squeeze in her hands and a firm but quiet shaking voice put her mind to ease. \"Anything to end that... bastard.. Sonic, now... I assume you want me to... make noises while you explain this to me? So those... monsters can get off...?\"</span></div></div>",

This first member to visit Hypon in the garden was Locke. Locke, a former general and leader of the Knuckles Clan in his time, knew that Hypon's moral code was something to be marveled at as it had a plan for almost any situation and could just see how Hypon's anger towards Sonic's choices as a leader hooked him to the very core. Locke was against the enslavement idea and releasing Frost under his custody but couldn't be sold on the impeaching Sonic as he saw it as a lost cause while Uncle Chuck and Jules were on Sonic's side. Unless Hypon could get enough of the council on his side, he would not have his vote for removing Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Locke left, Hypon moved to the next spot on his walk, a different part of the large garden where Moss the Sloth, an old hermit who had seen plenty in his lifetime. Moss was a very neutral council member, very known not to pick sides unless it was something he was avidly against. Sonic and Moss did have a relationship when Dark Gaia was a threat but Hypon's relationship with Moss became close before the war began. It almost became like Lupe's relationship with Hypon when he was starting out as a recruit. Moss was going to need time to think about choosing Hypon over Sonic as a leader but thought that Frost should be under his care after seeing a recent report of the prisons that were being used for POWs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Moss left the meditation spot in the garden, there was a nearby rustle that occurred as Hypon remained seated in meditation before the wolf opened his eyes and spoke to the air, knowing that someone was there. \"Glad to see the old king still has some tricks, I see.\" Hypon stood up and saw the final member he was meeting with this night; Nigel Acorn, Sally's father. Nigel and Hypon's relationship was very brief but had one goal; end the war with little causalities. They both saw Sonic as the issue and the one who was causing the war to turn the way it had become. Sally had only stooped to Sonic's level after he did something to cause her hand. Nigel knew that Sally would never do anything drastic unless pushed towards doing it, even if it went against everything she knew and cared for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon's plan was to simply show that Sonic was no longer fit to be the leader of the army but he had his work cut out for him with most of the other council members as they either didn't like the fact that he was a warden who protected his prisoners and would discipline male guards who stepped out of line and were caught abusing prisoners in one way shape or form or they didn't like him for the fact that he saw and fought for certain female POWs who were considered \"high-value targets\" be moved into his block for protection (both for the men's and the POWs). Most of the high-value targets were females every single male on base wanted to break in or humiliate for Sonic's cause against Sally which was a way of boosting \"morale\" that Hypon saw as barbaric.</span></div></div>",

He managed to slip on a pair of pants before he went to the door, glancing through the peephole to see the yellow mongoose Mina, who looked particularly on edge. \"Mina? Is everything-?\" The Nightblood asked as he opened his door, before he felt her fingers rest on his lips and watched her close the door behind them, at first wondering if she was hiding from Sonic. Mina turned to him and gestured a pen writing in the air, only stopping once she had a pad and paper to quickly write, making him think she was trying to send him a message without letting Sonic or his goons know. Once she was done, the mongoose turned to him and spoke in a low tone before leaving the room. \"Good luck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message she left behind sat on the table, where Hypon sat down to figure out what was happening, reading the note that would connect all the dots. The message started with the warning about Ashley, marking her as the interrogator and her ex girlfriend for him, and also stating the fake 'deal' she made with Sonic to get Mina to him,which may escalate tension when she will not give in for her interrogation today. The middle was a broad sense of where she was on the base from the interrogation room to her cell which helped narrow her placement while also stating she would also lower the temperature in the base where she was as another way to track her. The last bit of it was rambling worry that Frost wouldn't get to see him again and how much she cared about him, warning him that Ashley would not go down without a bloody fight and her desire to hug him tightly once the whole mess was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Frost's note, Hypon had two solid options to play and relatively decent time to put things into place. He could go searching for her as he knew Sonic would likely have her up at dawn to have Ashley work on her, following the leopard or hunting the spot down by her clues. He could also get the council to see what Sonic's methods really came down to by bringing them to witness the event, giving him leverage over those who favored Sonic by showing the beast lurking, at the cost of Frost for a few moments. Both had risks from how the Council would see him if he broke a prisoner free to what could happen to his love while he waited for people to find their hearts, yet he knew time was not a factor in his favor as he could only do one option effectively.

The boys started to actually pay attention when females were brought to other female prisoners in case they gave them a weapon, or in her case, spread a message to the one person who could help her. The Ice Wolf had an idea how to get Mina by with raising problems with Sonic, but the actual idea wasn't popular with Mina. It required Frost to sell that she and Mina had sex, something that did not happen as Frost wanted Mina to have a night without worrying someone was going to force her into something she possibly had enough for a lifetime. So before Mina was sent away, Frost transferred her heated scent to the yellow mongoose in places the boys would check, doing so in the only way she could without sex. It wasn't exactly hard, as she had remained chaste for her boyfriend and a few spreads of her arousal near spots where it would go during a night of fun would paint the picture for the boys in their minds. The problem was that Mina had to sell it, and that meant degrading herself like she had always done to a bunch of horny dogs but getting away to reach Hypon before Sonic or Ashley got to her or Frost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you hate this, but it is the only way they will believe you. I swear once this is over, I will make sure they pay for anything they did to you.\" Frost told her friend as she smeared the last bit under Mina's lip, watching the mongoose trying to keep herself under control with the role she was going to have to pull off, concerned that maybe she was pushing her too hard in order to get to Hypon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina however closed her eyes and made two fists as Frost pulled away, taking a few shaky breaths as she got into character. \"You can get them only if I don't get them first. I just... I just shake and have trouble breathing sometimes when people touch me, especially where you put your... stuff.\" The yellow mongoose spoke with firmness as she stood up to leave, making sure to leave with her message memorized or their plan was for nothing.

It wasn't like her to bow to anyone, it was as if her skin was crawling under the idea of being just like the slaves, making old rage bubble up once again of being under Sonic or any boy suicidal enough to try her. Ashley had faced raiders, criminals who stole and killed indiscriminately, a ruler with a pole up his and his daughter's ass and yet she wasn't as scared back then as she was now. She knew how to handle prisons, it was the only reason she was still sane and alive as it was simple to her, but it was another thing to be in a situation with a corrupt hedgehog playing god and a war that had sucked her in like a blackhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple leopard tried to dull her pained mind and body again, taking more downers laced strong to hit harder, feeling the weight of the world drift away again with a small sigh. <i>\"Focus...\"</i> Ashley thought to herself as she lit another smoke, puffing out it until that lingered inside her cell-like bedroom. <i>\"I need a clear head to handle Tara, nothing she can use to mess with me, if only my heart felt the same...\"</i> Even after betraying her, the Ice Wolf still made the leopard sting with sadness over what divided them, a small part of her wished she could leave her rage aside and try to see things from her ex's side. Yet Ashley held a code, and anyone who fucked with her, deserved everything they got in return no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck her and these morons.\" She muttered to herself after a long pause, exhaling another large cloud of smoke, a distant yet painful memory playing in her mind. \"I won't go back to that, even if I have to break Tara's soul, I can't be that girl again. I'd rather die... I'd rather be dead than be a bitch one more time...\" Ashley felt her eyes close, her high knocking her out and into the easy haze of dreams that only came after she had doped up enough, her stub dying out within her fingers as she rested for the day to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley was sitting in the interrogation room that Sonic allowed her to use, now in a more quiet part of the base with low traffic and even lower standards of what went on inside them. She was trying to ignore the large stain in the floor under the prsioner's seat while aware that if the roles were reversed, this could've been her fate as well. The deal was something on her mind at every second, her ex in exchange for her freedom and money if she broke her beyond any sense as a request for Sonic to get at Hypon. Not even her starting to dwindle bag of goodies was making her feel good about what had to happen next, and yet without them she knew she would be worse off. The sound of boots marching her way signaled her time to get started, checking her new cocktail in a syringe was ready as well as her taser and polished wood baton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers hauled her in on their own power and locked her wrists on a metal bar and legs in place, small smirks on their faces as they left as they knew the purpose of the room and the two women in it. The Ice Wolf looked weak, sweating in what little cloth she refused to remove, her expression soaked in exhaustion. Her will was on it's breaking point, the proud warrior tribal princess to her father's throne, now just a woman in an impossible situation between her knowledge or her dignity. \"I will not... break my loyalty... to Sally.\" Frost spoke in a low but firm voice, yet the fear in her eyes at her ex who was rubbing the baton was clear. \"Whatever you throw at me... or that blasted hedgehog... I will not betray her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple leopard just smoked more on a joint, watching the situation in front of her with her ex bent over in her seat by the restraints, until she tapped the baton on the table. \"Everyone says that, until the moment it's between their body and that little word.\" Ashley stretched her shoulders as she circled the table, dragging the baton over the table and along Frost's back, moving to speak in her ear while the baton poked her ex's back. \"I've done my research about your time after our fun, all about Sarah, Patricia, and even what I could scratch together about your boy-toy. A troubled vixen, a cheating lioness, and your worse nightmare turned lover, or so you thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that jealousy I hear... Ash? Upset I moved on from you?\" Frost coughed at the scent of the smoke, only to get whacked in the head and hateful eyes from the purple leopard. \"Cut the act, I know... you would never be with a guy, let alone with Hypon who can see through your bull. Whatever game you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley however finished her smoke before she knocked the bar that kept Frost's hands in the center of the table over, forcing the Ice Wolf to bend over the table while she also kicked the chair away, leaving her ex surprised and completely at her mercy. \"True, but you should also remember that I like a trapped target, especially one that is wanting. This time, I think I maybe have to help you along...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost couldn't force herself out of the bending position the table had forced her into, making her violently struggle to get free before she felt a needle go through her neck and a warm fuzzy feeling going through her body. \"What... the fuck... did you do to me...?\" The Ice Wolf could only gasp out as she felt a high that she hadn't felt since Ashley's time along with something else that made her body much more receptive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little taste of the past for you to remember, plus a little addition so you can enjoy this. I distinctly recall how a little fix made you more open once it hit your system, so how about a little refresher about your failures while we wait for your body to take it all?\" Ashley told the restrained wolf as she stood in front of her face, resting the tip of the baton in front of her mouth in a way she expected the boys would. \"Sarah was a maid of the palace whom you started to get friendly with, figured you for striking easy prey, and she managed to follow after you once the Resistance took place in the forrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost could already felt her mind dull to the drugs, and her body reacting against her wishes, but kept fighting the best she could. \"Don't you... dare speak her name... you junkie...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple leopard however just walked along and wacked at her ex's hips and back, brushing against her behind as she walked to continue the stimulation of what the drugs were making more sensitive and wanting. \"You both had a fun time, but you kept leaving her all alone in her home while on missions, even after she lost her brother to the war with our once general Robotnik. You failed her when you didn't see the signs that she was losing reality, falling deeper into despair until one day you came back and all that was left... was her body. She died because of your stupid loyalty to that squirrel bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah was sick, she had been told she had a year at most... I thought we had time!\" Frost cried out, her mind and body in completely different places, to the point she couldn't help but cry and could already feel her body being aroused without her will. \"I gave her what medicines the doctor told us could spread it out father, but Sarah couldn't bear to be in that kind of pain. I left her... and she made her choice without me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's ex just kept hitting the body of her former lover, pulling out her playbook from before they were separated as she moved on, now rubbing the breasts of her prisoner. \"You then moved on to the lioness Patricia, Sally's once secretary and eventual quartermaster that went to help you grieve and move on. Yet you could accept that she had a will of her own, just kept putting her in the same place you put that girl of yours from way back when. The fighting between you two got so bad that you eventual broke her down and she had to pick up the pieces of herself with an Ox who always felt for her. You drove her away with your selfish wants and desires, unable to accept that you were suffocating her with your problems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't there! All Patricia had to do was say she was done before she slept with that pig multiple times and be forced to admit it! She stabbed me in the back and had the nerve to flaunt that muscle-brained lummox around to dig it in farther!\" Frost yelled out as she tried to shake the numbing power of the drugs, unconsciously gasping at the small waves of pleasure from each whack and rubs that felt more like tidal waves to her weakened form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife was dug in deeper once the purple leopard dragged the baton up the outside of her underwear and showed it to her shaking prisoner, dripping with arousal. \"Now your with this boy Hypon, a boy you tried to kill multiple times and eventually you gave into after drinking yourself close to a stupor, riding his cock like the whore you are. Someone you cared enough to get a tattoo right on your ass that is currently wet from my efforts in a matter of minutes and some drugs you crave more than you care to admit...\" Ashley slipped down the underwear to her ex's feet, taking a moment to poke around the outside of her folds with the baton to hear the noises of her once girlfriend one more time before she got to the point. \"You will tell me where Sally is, where her bases are and any of her friends that we ask for, or I will fuck your pleasure starved body with this stick until you break like the whore you are. Will you give in now, or after I break you until you are begging for me to stop ravaging your snatch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost couldn't muster a bit of her elemental powers with the drugs and her weakened body to break the locks keep her bent over to her ex's mercy. Her body felt both numb and burning with pleasure from the purple leopard's teasing, practically near a climax from the extent of the drugs. Even with Ashley poking around her folds with the wooden baton, she couldn't see any other options than to surrender and betray her oldest friend from her new life, or be assaulted by an Ex she knew would not be easy on her after what she had done to her who would probably keep her as a slave after she was done. With a deep breath that came from deep inside her body, Frost gave her answer while bracing herself. \"Fuck you and Sonic! I will never let him or you win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed Tara. Disappointed, but not surprised. I will make you bark like the bitch you are one last time...\" Ashley paused as she absorbed Frost's choice, grabbing her ex by the neck and positioning the baton to plunge deep inside the Ice Wolf's fire started flower before she forced thrusts that made the Ice Wolf cry out in pleasure and pain.</span></div></div>",

She first resisted and was about to scream for Knuckles before a hand covered her mouth and a figure dressed in black was visible to her with eyes. Summer was then shocked to find the figure was Blaze after she removed her mask. \"We didn't forget you Summer, come on, we can make a break for it and catch up with the others on the way back!\"</span></div></div>",

But the rumor was dismissed after a stakeout mission showed that Hypon was still very affiliated with the Boy Army and was standing next to Shadow as several girls were changed and showed no remorse to the very fact that his own friends and fellow mobians were being changed, possibly forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>30 months into the war...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the battle inside the Feral Forest, Corporal Natalie the Echidna and Sergeant Major Blaze the Cat were captured by the male  forces and had to stop Blaze from using her pyrotechnic powers, so they cuffed her with a special kind of handcuffs that would stop any person's powers or abilities function normally. As both of them walked into the main base inside the Feral Forest, Blaze saw Hypon watching from the balcony; however, when Natalie glanced in the same direction, she saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3 days after the Battle in the Feral Forest</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie and Blaze were forcibly brought into a interrogation room and told to sit and not move, or else deal with punishment. They didn't move an inch and waited for the boy who would be talking to them. They waited five minutes and stared at the door, but nothing happened.

Just like you will. And now, shall we do this the easy way or the hard way?\" Blaze then swore at Hypon, \"Fuck you.\" Hypon's smirk turned into a Shadow-like grin as he said, \"You just picked the hard way.\" Hypon then revealed what was in his hand, a blue chaos emerald, and he shouted, \"Chaos Control!,\"  and suddenly a huge pile of bondage stuff appeared from behind him. \"Alright Blaze, let's start with you. You could learn to be more obedient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then ballgaged and stuffed it in her mouth. Then he used chaos control again and she was naked. She glared at him, as that was the only thing she could do. \"Where should we start... Well, you could use a punishment.\" Hypon stated. He then grabbed a paddle and began slapping her ass. Blaze's eyes watered, and she started whimpering. After about 15 slaps, Hypon then put down the paddle. \"Wow, you do have a nice ass.\" Hypon commented, rubbing the red mark. \"Now, will you listen?\" Hypon asked. Blaze shook her head, but much of her strong defiance was gone. \"Oh well. Maybe your friend will make the right decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Natalie's clothes were gone and she had a gag too. \"Wow.... Nicole DID do a good job...\" He teased. \"Sexy curves...\" He ran a finger along her figure. \"Big ass...\" He squeezed her butt cheeks. \"Busty breasts...\" He tickled her nipples. \"And sensitive pussy.\" He finished, and stuck two fingers into her. She gasped, and moaned into her gag. She had never felt anything so amazing. \"Enjoyed that? Have some more.\" Hypon said and leaned down, licking Natalie's breasts. She moaned even louder, and Hypon began to suck her nipples. He stood back up and smiled. \"Your breasts are so soft... So sensitive... So big and round.\" He said slowly. He took the gag out of her mouth, and as soon as her lips had freedom to move, they became a frown. \"I don't want you to touch me!\" Natalie growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want you to obey and not be so arrogant, but we can't always get what we want, can we?\" Hypon asked. Suddenly he mounted her in her sitting position, and invaded her with his dick. Natalie screamed in anger and pleasure. \"No... Stop.. I don't want you to...\" Natalie got out before she was lost in sexual pleasure. \"Ooooh, Hypon.. Ah! Yes... Yeees... YEEEEEES!!\" Natalie screamed as her juices exploded out of her, dripping on the floor. \"Good girl.\" Hypon said, running his fingers down Natalie's long wavy hair. Suddenly, she whipped her head around and bit down on Hypon's hand, causing him to pull it back and yell out in pain. He regained his composure and smiled angrily at her. \"That little accident just cost you Blaze's dignity. I'm going to fuck her in her ass, pussy, titties, and mouth until she's my slutty little bitch.\" Hypon grinned. \"Please! No!\" Blaze yelled. Hypon ignored her and picked her up off the chair, laying her on the floor face down. \"Let's start with your ass. It's so big and round.\" \"Please, no \"Please, no Hypon! Auuugh!\" Blaze pleaded, as Hypon's dick entered her butt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much Later, Hypon was in an area that was a very dangerous place for any male to be in; it was simply known as the Chamber. This was how Sally was punishing the rebel males and making them into new members for the cause. Sonic and the other male forces were capturing any female soldiers they could and would either break them in one way or another that angered him and Sally equally. This was how the Chamber came to be. Most of the project was headed by Nicole the Lynx as she had a huge amount of knowledge about how nanotechnology operated and was the main reason how Sally was able to recover and equal the playing field against her heated rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally would sentence male prisoners to the Chamber if they were deemed \"unredeemable\" because of their actions before and during their capture. There were three different sentencings, all labeled under feminine names as they were the names given to the newest recruits after the transformations: The Jessica, The Ashley, and The Vanessa. The Jessica was mainly used for those who had sworn their loyalty to Sally and the female side; wanting to ditch their gender to feel accepted amongst their new allies. The Ashley and Vanessa were punishments, one being worse than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them started off the same way; the male being placed inside the chamber and locked inside, given or forced to be in a set of clothes that would suit them after the nanites finished their work. After the subject is locked inside, they are either force fed through a tube or injected into their bloodstream with the nanites to begin the process of the transformation. The transformation is usually the shortest part of the whole experience, lasting roughly around half an hour, but is one of the most painful as your body is being manipulated into a new shape or form. This is where the punishments begin to differ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the recruit goes through The Jessica, they are escorted to a nice looking room and hooked up to a set of headphones before being isolated into a different chamber where they would hear through the headphones the basic information any standard female should know. Anyone who would go through the Ashley or the Vanessa, after the transformation; the newly changed female is collared and escorted into a dark chamber where they would go through their \"initiation process.\" Both of them take around 48 to 72 hours, depending on the will of the subject if they resist. An Ashley becomes a member of the army while a Vanessa becomes a drone of their former self; molded to become whatever Sally saw fit to do to them. A Vanessa will usually get it worse than the other two as they are thrown completely through the ringer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was watching from behind a glass as a few subjects were going through the starting moments of the nanites, visible seeing them at work as their bodies were being molded in ways that baffled him while also made him feel sorry for them but he knew that they deserved this instantly recognizing the three soldiers as neer-do-wells who had assaulted many female inmates and almost killed one that was confirmed to have a child. He had no remorse for someone who was going to murder a woman who was carrying their child because they didn't know what else they could do when there were rules against doing those kinds of things.</span></div></div>",

Eric sighed at his friend's lack of communication but spoke out loud as they reached the prison for the females not yet assigned to males. \"Fine, I'll do all the work. It's not like you're there for a reason. I just hoped you'd say something to her, she and I aren't on the best of conditions after that job I did on her...\" He trailed off as they both remembered how he stole from Rouge by backstabbing her at her weakest, making their job more difficult<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts were interrupted as they descended down the stairs to the cells, passing a guard that was supposed to keep watch but was writing something instead, which Eric yelled at as per code of conduct. The guard then closed the book, which Hypon noticed was titled \"<i>The Gender War, Boy's edition</i>\" as he passed the guard by. After a walk and several of the changed girls offered them free sex for freedom, they made it to Rouge's cell which had a reinforced glass panel showing a kissed off white bat sitting crossed legged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late, too busy fucking our old friends boys?\" A speaker on their side stated after Rouge spoke into a microphone on her end. \"Ah, the dynamic duo, both criminals pretending to have a just cause for the wrong people. And here I was just enjoying my day when you have to come up and ruin it.\" Rouge then looked Eric in the eye and both he and her were just silent for a bit before Eric spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have come to sell you a deal, providing you cooperate with the conditions.\" He spoke without breaking sight with Rouge, but Hypon saw a nervous twitch in one of his legs. \"Give us your knowledge, and we will reward you handsomely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I get to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I at least not be used as the local cocksleeve? I've been getting looks since I was put in this cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, unless you break the terms by lying to us or assisting the girls. Otherwise, your body is yours to use as you see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better conditions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll give you what we can, but this is your home until the war is over. No point arguing about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about what you owe me, Eric? To forgive your past transgressions? It might help sway my mind...\" Rouge stated with a venomous look, which took Eric a bit to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Providing your information is true, yes, I will pay what I owe you. In full.\" Although Eric didn't look too keen about it, as it would no doubt get him in serious trouble with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge however seemed pleased and stood up from her chair at the center of her cell room. \"Good, glad we could talk fairly. By the way,  before I was captured, I heard how Nicole had a little talk with Blaze about if you're possibly captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Eric stated as he paled at the idea of his ex's coming together to deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, better not get captured, for your sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly Noted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then faced Hypon, who she ignored during the talk with eyes he remembered from the days where she ran her own club, like she was ready to play whatever game was in store for the future. \"Care to note my info as I go through it dear?

Only one of the five had a real bullet, the rest had blanks that would sound just like the real one. Around the firing range, guards and boys alike watched as Eric was place in front of the wall at the mercy of the shooters. Eric looked up and saw that Sonic was watching as well as Shadow, Knuckles, Espio but the one who caught his attention was his brother Tails at Sonic's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had grown up so much since the war started,  now outmatching his older brother in both tech savy and combat, which made Eric a little proud despite the circumstances. Eric wished that Tails didn't see his execution, but in order for Tails to prove his loyalty to Sonic, he needed to watch his older brother die and continue to pledge allegiance for Sonic only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiled as the group of boys raised their guns, waiting for them to fire but felt something surge out in himself, realizing that this was the moment he was waiting for. Behind his back, Eric quickly restarted his system and activated a new program to defend himself from fatal damage, although it would hurt like hell. Just as he finished, he realized Sonic made a speech about traitors and their punishment but Eric tuned it out while he worked, needing to concentrate.  After Sonic's speech, Eric was given his chance to speech his last words, either to claim his innocence or to spite Sonic. However Eric did something quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder... with my death, will the balance of this war finally reached a end, or intensify into more damage than it has already done? Some day Sonic, you and Sally will look back at this war and will realized how much you both have destroyed. I just hope you feel proud of yourself to kill a fellow friend in cold blood for doing the right thing.\" Eric stated to the boys watching before he was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation or remorse, all five boys aimed and fired their guns at Sonic's word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the damage wasn't fatal as the bullet lodged in Eric's heart, although it looked and felt so with the blood spraying out of the wound. In truth though, Eric's body had already started repairing the damage with scrape parts his body had prepared along with making new blood cells in his body, but to all who watched, he was shot and it looked fatal as could be. Despite the convincing appearance, Eric also induced a near death coma that put him out and made his death believable to the touch and sight since they would check his pulse so see if he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a boy stepped over to Eric's limp body and checked his pulse, to find none and declared so to Sonic and the crowd. From that point, boys started to leave as the body was pulled into the morgue, all convinced that the two tailed Fox was dead.</span></div></div>",

Immediately realizing where he was, he turned on his robotic side and looked at his robotic arm while laying on his side on a very comfortable bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the timer had him three weeks after he was shot and as such his body felt weak and his battery was lower than he was comfortable with. He should've put in an alarm, but he didn't act until too late, so nothing could've changed. Eric checked which direction was up and spat to find it dropped to his feet, marking his position upright and sweet fresh air was above his head, six feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself frown and crouched down after his body figured out it's position to wind up his legs for a jump to would loosen the wood above him with his outstretched fist. It hurt and Eric was sure to have a few splinters but he loosened the wood enough to get a face full of soil that started to fill in the empty space. Without wasting a moment's notice, Eric clawed at the soft dirt and pulled himself up with whatever roots or solid soil he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric broke through the surface and gasped at clean air before he pulled himself out of his hole with what energy he had left. He just gasped for a while, breathing in and out to ease his air lacking lungs' torment, but slowly looked around. He then saw where he was and felt a tightness in his chest as he looked at the ruin of the Prower home, damaged with neglect and looted by both sides. He then looked and saw the graves of his family's ancestors before seeing his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Here lies Eric F. Prower, paid for his crimes with his life. RIP'\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Eric said dryly as he wiped the dirt from his body, seeing for the first time that he was wearing a suit that was deeply stained with the dirt. \"Not today it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got up and wobbled into the home he once knew as his body was too weak to do much else. He searched for some canned goods and found some soups, frowning since he had little else but cracked open each can regardless, he wasn't going to pass up food after his ordeal. Food came first then recharging, before Eric would even begin to think of his next step.</span></div></div>",

He often checked where the bullet had hit him and to the untrained eye, it was as if nothing was there, except for a small circle wound in his chest. He checked his body and felt some small stiffness from the wound but otherwise he was more than fine. He was lucky, and next time, the shot would be between his eyes if he didn't think smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat in his old room, in a chair from his past that he managed to fit in as he thought deeply about his next move, weighting all options. He could never return to the Boy bases, or risk another trial. An option that came quickly was to go to the girls side and provide support, a valid choice, if not for facing his ex's and the girls he had a hand in changing. Plus, they might force him to change his sex, which was a major issue as he had enough altering of his orginal body for one lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother less apealing option was to leave Mobius, let the two fight it out and go live out his life somewhere else. He had already worked to gain the friends he had, he wasn't going to stab them in the back and run. Yet he could start fresh, maybe meet new people and stay away from crazy shit until he was too old to go fight in it. Eric quickly shook his head, dismissing the thought as he knew he would just change the context of the situations and there was no guarantee he wouldn't be hunted once his grave was found empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he knew that he had to pick a side, just like before, but this time no machine was whispering in his head, telling him what to do. Cynthia was removed from his hardware once he was arrested for treason, taking away one of his comforts in life just to spite him. Robotnik's brainwashing was a distant memory as he broke free and could do what he wanted but even then everyone had trouble accepting the enemy as a friend. Especially a former rouge double agent, who turned his back on his friends in order to nearly get them all robotized. But he lived by chance, and his future was never cut and dry, so pulled out a coin that he carried for luck to flip for it. Heads he would head out to escape the war, while tails he would seek Sally and beg for protection in exchange for service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rested his head on his head that held the coin and spoke softly to it, and to the string of fate that connected them. \"Lady Fate, give me the direction to put my life towards. Grant that my feet by quick, my tongue sharp, and my hands steathy. And if the worst comes to pass, grant that my friends and family find the peace I will not receive.\" He then flick the coin high into the air, watching it flip as the world slowed down around him as the coin was snatched from the air and slammed onto the table nearby. Eric took a second before he lifted his hand and saw...</span></div></div>",

He felt his heart drop as he knew that this course would lead to more destruction and chaos, and possibly more lives lost other than what he was to be. Eric saw the faces of his friends flash through his mind, his time with them, and what they had built together, and clenched his fist in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fuck this.\"</i> He thought as he went against what had had lead him more than half his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric picked up his coin and tossed it aside to the floor as he moved outside his home to the forest, his determination clear on his face as he scanned the tree line. He wasn't going to leave his friends, no matter what fate had in plan. He would fight as a rebel to the war, removing both Sally and Sonic from power in order to make peace for all of Mobius, a third side that was opposed to the whole war in general. He would bring back the Freedom Fighters, with their last mission to bring back freedom for all boys and girls from this war that divided them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind made up, Eric then pulled up a map of Mobius and set points where he would find those who would fight with him. He would need an army of his own, and he knew just where to look and who to fight with him, but feared for his brother's sake. If he lead an army, Sonic would go to Tails and hold him against Eric, so he needed a new identity. Something the reminded his friends of the past, but kept Tails safe from harm. Eric then glanced back at his home, his mind buzzing with how to continue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric raised his hand and saw the other side of the coin stare him in his face, then with no emotion he took the coin from the table and stood up. \"It's a while until I hit Girl territory\" Eric spoke softly to himself as he set a waypoint to Knothole, several miles away from his home and started off, but stopped outside his home at his grave. He didn't feel right about leaving the grave open so he spent some time to put it back so it looked as normal as it could be to tend to his own grave. Eventually he left his family's home and ancestors to meet with the leader of the Girl's side he claimed to want to destroy, hoping his father's old silver hooded cloak would be enough to hide himself to unwanted attention before he arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked for at least several hours as he felt himself hum a nursery rhyme as he continued into the forest. Eric already felt sore as his muscles were not as strong as they were before his fake death and the long rest only made them stiffer. He looked around for a stream or a river to rest by when he found a lake several sizes of his home, with a deep blue that seemed divine for drinking at. However, he did not remember a lake here previously, so his guard was up and he carefully hide to watch his surroundings for signs of a trap. Slowly, he picked out three figures hiding around the lake in trees, but he could not figure out if they were women or part of the boys so he kept quiet. However, he focus went to the lake again as it seemed he was not the only one who found it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big purple cat fell out of the brush on the opposite side of the lake, clawing at the ground in order to get to the water, as from a distance he seemed in a bad way. It took Eric a second to recognize Big the cat from his huge ears and bigger waistband, and felt himself twitch to go and help him, but held himself back as he knew what would happen. Sure enough, once Big got close enough to the water, he put his hand through and began drinking heavily from the water and the three forms dropped from above and closed in on him. <i>\"Run Big, they're almost on you!\"</i> Eric screamed in his mind but he knew he would only cause more problems, as much as he wanted to help, his own safety was a concern as he was not nearly well enough for a three against one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric suddenly noticed Big wasn't moving as much and almost immediately aimed himself to try and help when he saw that Big had fallen asleep with his hand still in the water. Even more, he noted the figures who were around Big and felt his stomach knot as he recognized each one and knew he stood little chance against them. Amy Hedgehog, Bunny Rabot, and Blaze the Cat stood around the sleeping Big as they pulled his head away from the water, speaking to each other. \"Good thing Cream wasn't here, she would've made a huge fuss about seeing Big again like this.\" Amy spoke as he prevous pink dress was replaced with a black steath suit along with the others, pushing back her hair as she looked at Big. \"Sorry big guy, but we have orders. I'll try to keep you happy until we have to change you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, a little more help here sugar?\" Bunny grunted as she moved the large cat, her robot bits doing most of the work. Amy quickly realized her distraction and went back to pulling Big's arm while Bunny did his legs and Blaze did his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to be so hard on him Blaze?\" Amy asked between pulls to a moody Blaze, who just closed her eyes and looked away with an annoyed look. \"I mean, he just wanted help finding his frog. And he has no weapon on him, you went a little overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, he is a boy and an enemy to our side.\" Blaze spoke coldly as she snarled at Amy, who just shrugged it off. \"At least he drank the water and knocked himself out, but now we have to lug him around until it wears off, my method would have him up in mintues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With less brain cells and more broken bones.\" Bunny edged in before they all stopped and put down the giant cat, stretching out. \"He'd still be limping and we'd still be at this speed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Blaze repiled curtly before she crossed her arms, but immediately turned to face the lake, almost as if she knew where her ex was currently hiding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric flattened himself to the ground the second Blaze swung her gaze his way as he did not in any way want to fight the ex-girlfriend who nearly killed him when they broke up before the war. He put a hand over his mouth just in case her sharp ears could reach beyond the lake, mentally cursing at his misfortune to bump into her in such a quiet area where she could take him out and not even worry about others backing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze, we need a hand here.\" Amy grunted as the two of them were struggling to move Big with Blaze. However, Bunny noticed Blaze gaze around the lake and readied her ray gun to stun or change whoever might be hidden in the trees. \"What's up girl?\" She spoke quietly, but not enough for Eric's robotic ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw something in the trees over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another boy?\" Amy suddenly got interested and put down Big as she readied her own weapon, a hammer she cared deeply for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell for sure, it looked silver.\" Blaze answered before she turned her body to face Eric's spot, ready to go over and check for herself, her claws extended as she prepared for a dirty fight. \"Wait here, I'll just be a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his body go into overdrive as he really did not want to be Blaze's punching bag again, even though they worked for Sally who he wanted to see, he didn't think it was worth it to roll the dice with his chances. Yet Blaze was a predator, if she had something in her eyes, she would follow it to the end of the map and do whatever she wanted at the end of the hunt. He spent most of the first bits of war in the base in fear that he would be spotted by Blaze or Nicole and forced to fight them. Even after all the hell they put him through, he still cared deeply for them and really did not want to harm them, despite past circumstances that he was forced into doing. In the end, he took a breath and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric gritted his teeth as he made his choice to give in and show himself to the girls, despite his own personal feelings begging him to keep quiet. He slowly rose from his spot to the quick attention of the three women, each ready to chase or attack him. He slowly raised his hands from his sides and made his way over to them, going around their lake slowly as not to spark any attacks. Once he got within range of Bunnie's femminizer gun, he stopped as Blaze and Amy walked up, keeping his face down as his hood still covered his face and his cloak hid his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business!\" Blaze demanded as she had her claws out and was prepared to fight as hard as possible while Amy backed her up. \"Are you boy or girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy.\" Eric replied straightforwardly, but held his tongue as he noticed a sudden interest from Blaze focused on him, almost like she was trying to place him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked you a question boy!\" Amy yelled as she did not notice her friend, but had her attention on Eric. \"What are you doing here? Are you here to rescue Big, or did Sonic send you here to take us to him? Answer us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither.\" Eric answered wholeheartedly, glancing towards the sleeping giant with a pain of regret as he did hope he was alright. \"In truth, I was actually surprised to see him, and the three of you. Let's just say I want to go see Sally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie was surprised at the figure's words as she kept him in her crosshair. \"No boy is insane enough to face Sally! Ya'd have to have a hole in ya head to be so stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about a hole in my head...\" Eric answered back with a hidden chuckle just Blaze was a few steps from his face, her eyes staring at him as her hand slowly went up to move his hood back. \"But I used to have a hole in my heart, does that count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smartass.\" Blaze commented as she grabbed his hood, staring into his eyes before her eyes widen as she saw past the shadow hiding him from her and yanked the hood off with all her force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women were shocked to see Eric's face staring back at them once Blaze had flipped his hood back, seeing their old friend and once enemy who they thought was killed, come back from the grave. Blaze noticed the dirt stained state of what looked like the suit he was buried in and it only added to their shock, making Eric wonder silently if he was going to see this for every one of his old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts however were suddenly interupted by a solid slap to his face from his ex. \"I suppose I deserved that...\" Eric spoke just before he got a hard kneeling to his gut which made his gunshot wound burn, barely letting out a gasp before he talked again. \"And that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!\" Blaze screamed out at him, lashing out like he expected her to with some punches as well. \"Three weeks after we watched you get shot on some god-damn camera feed! Three weeks, and only now you dare come back you bastard!\" Amy and Bunnie slowly went over to try and get Blaze to stop hitting her ex but were stopped by Eric's hand gesturing them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Blaze. I put myself in a near-death coma on the spot, I didn't plan on being back. I can't imagine what kind of pain that put you through to see that happen.\" Eric spoke through the beating Blaze gave him, trying to cover his delicate bits when she immediately turned away and crossed her arm with a huff. Eric slowly got up and made sure to keep his distance as he knew she could easily pump out more rage if she wanted to, bumping into Amy before moving back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, seems a little far-fetched.\" Amy commented with a frown as she put her hands on her sides. \"How do we know you're the real one and not a fraud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cus' I took your wallet right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt her front pocket and glared at Eric until he showed her own wallet, grabbing it from his hands as he smirked a little bit. \"Alright, not bad, but Eric was more then a thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the fact that of the three of you girls, Bunnie and Blaze were hit on by me while I was first going into the Freedom Fighters? And during which, I helped Bunnie figure out another feature of her own system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy glanced over to Bunnie, who shrugged before she lower her gun and faced Eric, a little warmer than before. \"He's not a sucessful flirter, though the advice made the fight a little easier. How are ya doing sugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I as good as can be from climbing out of my own grave, but seriously, I need to see Sally.\" Eric rubbed the back of his head as he looked at Big who was still out cold. \"Only she can protect me from Sonic, and trust me when I say I have a lot to offer her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie however slinged the femminizer gun over her shoulder and frowned. \"Not likely, she's not exactly in the most trusting mood lately. Not since we nearly lost all of our bases to the boys, even Knothole is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Eric's attention as he had only remembered news that they were taking advantage of his gift. \"What!? Then how do you expect to take on Sonic?! I figured you lose a few to fights, but nearly all the bases including Knothole?! How many troops do you have? How many bases?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic has been hitting us harder than ever.\" Blaze stated finally, uncrossing her arms from her chest. \"Your 'death' seemed to push him to doing more aginst us. We only have two bases, and about 200 spread out girls over Mobius in boy territory and about another 100 in each base. We're all doing our best, but the deck is stacked heavily against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then stood forward and outstretched his arms to his former friends. \"Then let me be your wild card. Sonic and his boys don't know I'm alive, I know their bases and their security, plus I know their strengths. I can help Sally and the girls win this, although it will be tough with so few girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked a little unsure about bringing Eric with them, so they quietly moved into a group to talk it out, leaving him to wonder what was being said. Eventually, after much debate, they all faced Eric with varying amount of concern to seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have decided you can go see Sally, in exchange, you help us lift Big out of here and you follow our every direction to there. Do we have a deal?\" Amy told Eric as she held out a pink collar, something that put his nerves on edge as she went towards him. \"Rule one, we need to know that you are telling the truth and where you are, so you have to wear our... prisoner collar. Just as a precaution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew about the collars as they basically made whoever wore them more inclined to state the truth with a mixture of a tube of drugs and a eletric current that gave their head a 5000 volt shock. They also kept a heartbeat monitor so they knew if you were alive and lock that could only be removed by voice code, something even he had doubts of being able to get free. Yet he knew if he rejected, Sally would never agree, and he would be stuck at step one while the boys found and corrected their troublemaker. With a sigh of defeat, Eric slowly...</span></div></div>",
