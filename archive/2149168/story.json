            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jordan Weas was a 10-year-old boy who had just left school that day and he was walking home. He missed the ride on the school bus because he stayed late, helping out his art teacher clean up the classroom that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking home, Jordan noticed that the dark clouds started to roll in, blocking the sun. The wind kicked up, blowing the leaves on the street. Rain drops started to come down hard, and Jordan started to make a run towards his house. He had forgotten his umbrella and his raincoat, so he was rapidly getting soaked in the downpour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan had just about reached the lawn of his own house when he tripped over something sharp, which he had never seen before. His shoe got stuck on a bright, blue object and he fell head-first down into the lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuwww!\u201d he groaned as he came down. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and turned around, wondering what he tripped over. He squatted down by the blue, pointed object and grabbed hold of it. Then, he noticed that the pointed object was just a blue cube, firmly stuck into the dirt. Jordan pulled hard on it before it came out, mostly covered in dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this? A box?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan, who is only 5 feet tall, with short black hair and brown eyes, stared at the cube before he heard his mom shout at him from the kitchen window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJORDAN! Don\u2019t stand out there in the pouring rain! GET INSIDE\u2026 NOW!\u201d she shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing, mom!\u201d he yelled back, running towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jordan get inside, she yelled at him to remove all his wet clothes and to take a shower. He was completely soaked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan tossed everything on the floor in his bedroom before he took a nice, long, hot shower. Then, after he had dried off, he went back into his room and got dressed. It was pouring outside, so he wasn\u2019t going outside anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Jordan would have soccer practice, but that was canceled that day, for obvious reasons. So, he just put on shorts and a tank top. Then, he put his attention on the cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the cube and rinsed it off under the sink in the bathroom, wiping off all the dirt. Then, he dried it using his towel, before he hopped back on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the cube in his fingers as he looked it over. The cube was a nice, bright, aqua blue color, with sharp corners. It felt heavy, but not too heavy. It wasn\u2019t plastic or anything, but it wasn\u2019t exactly like rock, either. It was very hard and unbreakable. The cube was three inches wide and three inches tall and three inches deep as Jordan held it in is hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this thing is solid! It\u2019s strong!\u201d he grinned, as he let it roll off his bed and watched it land on the floor with a loud THUD. Then, he picked it up again and wondered what he could use it for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad this thing isn\u2019t a ball. I could throw it. I could do curls with it, since it\u2019s kinda heavy\u2026.\u201d He grinned as held it in his right hand as he raised up his skinny arm. \u201cOr, I should use it as a paperweight\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after he had gotten bored, Jordan got up and he walked over to his desk. He opened up his laptop and started it. He set the cube next to his keyboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he logged on, he opened his browser and he started to surf the web. He visited a photo site which displayed pictures of his friends and other guys he didn\u2019t know. Some of the guys were very athletic, very big, and\u2026 very muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan just sighed as he glanced at the pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate being too young to work out. Being ten-years-old SUCKS!\u201d he groaned. \u201cJust look at these guys with their big muscles! Man\u2026 Look how this guy has big biceps. I wish my biceps were bigger\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as Jordan said that, the cube on his desk suddenly emitted a bright, blue glow, for a split second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! What\u2026. Why\u2026 What the HECK was that!!??\u201d Jordan gasped as he quickly got up from his chair and took a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan just stared at the cube and he became scared for a moment. Then, he cautiously approached it and reached out for it with his hand, touching it and picking it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I saw it glow or something\u2026. What was that for?\u201d he whispered as he held it in his hands. He examined it closely before he set it down. Then, he started to become very tired. He yawned as he became drowsy. He could barely keep his eyes open. So, he stumbled over to his bed and laid down, crawling under the covers and then drifting off to a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, his bedroom door opened, and his mother spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJordan? Were you taking a nap? Wake up, buddy, otherwise you won\u2019t sleep well tonight!\u201d she said out loud, waking him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan groaned as she closed the door. He opened his eyes and sat up on his bed. He moved his arms when he noticed and felt something strange about them\u2026. His biceps had GROWN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026. What the--- WHAAH!\u201d he gasped as he saw that he now had bigger, firm biceps on his arms! His muscles had grown while he was asleep! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan leaped out of his bed and ran over to the mirror. He raised up both arms and flexed. He now had two firm, hard guns on his arms! Not too big, but they were big enough to be noticed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 How did that happen?\u201d he wondered out loud. \u201cI didn\u2019t lift any weights! I didn\u2019t do anything! How\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he stared at the blue cube on his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHmygosh! I made a wish for bigger biceps while talking to the cube on my desk!\u201d he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan had figured out how to use the cube!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what does he do, next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly tossed the cube in his backpack before he went to sleep. He couldn't wait to try it out on his friends. All his friends were nerds, so this would be loads of fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jordan arrived at school, he tapped on the shoulder of 11-year-old Cameron, the biggest nerd in his class. Cameron was big into math and science, so he got pushed around by the bigger kids quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Cam! Let's go out back by the soccer field, before class starts!\" Jordan suggested. \"I gotta show you something super cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys went to the back of the building where there wasn't anyone around. Cam thought Jordan was going to show him a new video game or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out!\" Jordan said, as he pulled the cube out of his bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's THAT?\" Cameron groaned. \"It's just a Rubik's cube!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's magic! Look! I wish Cameron would change into a pre-teen bodybuilder!\" Jordan blurted out, while holding the cube with both hands as he stood right in front of Cameron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ray of blue light shot from the glowing cube and engulfed Cameron's body, causing the boy to stiffen up, before he collapsed on the ground. Then, after a few seconds, Cam slowly opened his eyes and stood up. The cube stopped glowing and Jordan put it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cam! Are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron slowly stood up, leaning against the brick wall. His chest was bulging with muscle! His arms were thick with biceps and triceps. His legs were as thick as tree trunks! His abs were well-defined. He looked like a junior athlete! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... My head... I must have passed out...\" Cameron sighed as he woke up and stared at Jordan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE! Look at YOU! You're all buff now!\" Jordan cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked down at himself and examined his muscular arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Jordy! I've always been big and strong! I've been lifting weights since I was 9 years-old!\" Cam shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, dude... Sure...\" Jordan smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys walked back to the classroom. But, Jordan was thrilled that his best friend in school was now a young bodybuilder. He wondered what else he could do with his cool, new cube?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh sneered as he looked down at the kid, holding a hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's taking so long? I want your lunch money, so hand it over!\" He yelled. The kid jumped at this, lips quivering. Josh had been the main bully of these parts for a long time, everyone knew of him. At lunch he would roam around, either pushing kids around or getting them to do things for him. The kid in question gulped some, trying to figure out what to do. Then, an idea came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss. Spanner!\" He yelled, looking behind the bully. Josh's eyes widened as he turned around to see the teacher. Miss Spanner always gave him punishment for picking on the other kids. However, when he turned around, nobody was there, and when he looked back, the kid was booking it out into the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! GET BACK HERE!\" Josh screamed, stomping after him. He chased the kid into the courtyard. The darn shrimp was fast! On top of that, while Josh had size, he was never that fast to begin with. As a result, it didn't take long for the kid to evade him, and the bully to find himself in the courtyard all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" He grumbled to himself, huffing as he caught his breath. \"I can't believe I fell for that...\" At this point though, he had to be careful. He had been warned far too many times and had gotten in a lot of trouble with the school. If he got into trouble again... well, he could be expelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid adults... think they can boss me around because they're bigger and older... If I was like them, I wouldn't let anyone boss ME around...\" He grumbled to himself, deciding to sit down on one of the benches there. As he sat back, something caught his attention out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the.... the heck is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully bent down and picked up the glittering object. It was some strange object, a metallic looking cube with odd, alien markings all over it. It almost looked like a necklace, as it had some sort of mesh wire that stuck out of it, like it could be worn around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebodies necklace?\" He asked himself, before jumping as the thing gave a bright glow. The glow travelled through his body. Unbeknownst to him, this cube was sensing his desires. His deep, secret desires of what he truly wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

It twitched violently, before the growth continued into the rest of his arm. His bicep swell out further and further, veins surfacing to the top, pumping his muscles with blood. His forearm thickened as the left sleeve on his shirt finally tore, leaving him with a massive arm that flexed involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just looked at it stunned as the rest of his body twitched. Slowly, a grin formed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... awesome!\" He exclaimed, looking to the rest of his body excitedly as he stood up. He could feel his body rumble, followed by that amazing surge of growth that started to overtake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" He yelled, this time with more authority. \"Grow muscles, GROW!\" His pecs bloated out, giving him a barrel like chest. \"Yeah! Bigger!\" He commanded. His right arm swelled to match his right arm. \"Bigger!\" His legs became as thick as tree trunks, his body packing on ridiculous amounts of mass to his 5 foot frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yeah! YEAH! OHHHH YEEAAHHH!!!\" He roared, his arms lifting up as his lats ballooned from side to side. With a satisfied grunt, he bent his arms down and performed a most muscular, a few more growth spurts rumbling and spurting through his body as the shirt he wore exploded into confetti, leaving his upper body bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wild grin, he let out a deep growl, flexing one of his arms. A massive, 20 inch bicep swelled into place, throbbing with power as he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me! I'm like Markus Ruhl! I'm huge, I'm jacked... I'm MASSIVE! I'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE TEACHERS BOSS ME AROUND NOW!\" He boomed, laughing some as he looked to the cube that was clutched in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin became dark as he licked his lips. \"And this baby made me massive...

Make me GROW! I want big muscles! MASSIVE muscles!\" He yelled. As he said this, he grew more excited as the cube glowed once more. A wave of pleasure struck him and he growled, muscles twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles began to swell with a rubbery, creaking noise, his pecs inflating outwards, pressing into his chin as he laughed ecstatically. His frame widened as his lats ballooned out, shoulders now the size of basketballs, and still swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRARRRGGHHH!!!\" He growled, raising his hefty arms up to flex them in a double bi pose. It was like his peaks were volcanoes, erupting with mass and growth as he pushed them to the limit. He felt so fucking strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on baby, make me a monster! Make me the strongest kid EVER!\" He declared, his stomach instinctively clenching up to flex and bloat, a thick wall of iron plate abdominal muscles now swelling to outrageous sizes. \"Bigger... bigger... BIGGER!\" He chanted, his body complying as with each word of encouragement, he gained more and more mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had looked freaky before, he was now a complete muscle monster, nearly as wide as he was tall.

I make him look like a WIMP!\" He bragged to nobody in particular, his ego swelling along with his muscles. \"Gggrrrrrrrrrr.... FUCK!

More!\" His biceps were now a ridiculous 35 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIGGER! More muscle! More size!\" He ranted, traps swallowing his head as he flexed, now a crazy 500 lbs of pure muscle! He wasn't just the biggest bully, he was the biggest man alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE! FUCKING MOOORRRRREEEEE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his growth spurt, he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To his delight the cube began to glow once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Josh said excited that his new toy seemed to have lots of uses. \u201cMake sure whatever I\u2019m wearing still shows off my awesome body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later he was clad in a very tight tank top and equally tight black gym shorts. Josh couldn\u2019t see the shorts around his massive pecs, but he could feel their presence. He gave them a quick pat with his had to verify they were, in fact, real then laughed at the way they bunched up at his hips, the openings in the legs being too small for his giant thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unfurled the chain attached to the cube and hung it around his neck. \u201cMe and you, cube, we\u2019re going to run this place. Now, what should I test my muscles out on first?\u201d Josh truly didn\u2019t know how strong he really was, just that he felt power surging through his whole body. He couldn\u2019t see it but the cube was glowing ever so slightly on its perch atop the shelf of his pectoral muscles, slowly feeding him more and more strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk josh decided on his target. He turned toward the building that housed the front office. He took one quick step towards it then leapt off his right foot, his giant quad and calf muscles propelling his 500 pound body high into the air. He landed on the roof of the building with a smirk on his face. His confidence in his abilities was growing fast. He walked across the roof of the building towards the far end which butted up against the school\u2019s parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived at the edge he jumped down off the roof without even looking. He landed on top of an old sedan, his massive body collapsed the roof and broke the axles. Josh stepped from the wreckage and brushed dust and glass shards off his skin and looked around for his next target. A huge smile spread across Josh\u2019s lips when he spied the principal\u2019s big, black SUV just a few spaces away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sauntered over to the rear of the vehicle, \u201cWell, well, is that your car, Mr. Ford?  Would be a real shame if something were to happen to it. Why don\u2019t I put it someplace safe for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bent down and reached under the rear bumper feeling for the frame of the big car. Not knowing what to expect he lifted and felt his heart leap with joy as the back end of the SUV came off the ground with ease. He pulled the bumper up to his chest and reset his hands before extending his arms and lifting it fully above his head. Next he made his way to the center of the car, steadied his grip and lifted the entire 2 ton SUV off the ground and over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!!\u201d Josh celebrated pumping the huge vehicle up and down over and over. He tried taking one of his hands away but struggled to keep the weight steady and hand to go back to a two handed hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, cube, what\u2019s the problem!\u201d He chided his new toy. A moment later the cube glowed bright and Josh felt an energy surge through his whole body. He didn\u2019t get any bigger but he felt an explosion of strength within him. \u201cOOOOOHHHHH MAMA!!! That\u2019s more like it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when he tried holding the car one-handed he didn\u2019t struggle in the least. He walked out into the drive aisle with the weight over his head and found a small crowd was gathering outside the office while even more eyes looked on through widows all along the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pumped the SUV up and down several times while raising his free hand and flexing his monstrous 35 inch bicep. \u201cThat\u2019s right, everybody, come see what I can do. This is some Superman level shit right here.\u201d He turned and flicked his wrist easily sending the 2 tons above his head sailing across the length of the parking lot where it landed with a crash on another unfortunate vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped and several people ran away though still more remained, transfixed by the 5 foot tall, 500 pound monster with the face of a 13 year old. Josh rolled his shoulders in and flexed his upper body in a mind-bending most muscular pose. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said aloud with a cocky nod of his head, \u201cpretty cool, huh? What should I show off with next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh casually rounded the building looking for something to challenge his strength. He walked with the swagger of a top level bodybuilder owning the stage, loving the stares he received and reveling in the fear even more. Everyone that thought they were so tough just because they were bigger or older is gonna be so sorry, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cube continued to emit a soft glow feeding even more raw power into Josh\u2019s already unstoppable body. As he strolled through the parking lot he casually punched or kicked various cars he passed sending them flying through the air in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded the corner, the group of onlookers following at a safe distance, and found his next test. Several school buses were parked in a line, they were empty but awaited the end of the school day. With a sneer Josh whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s do this, cube. And make sure I can take on this one-handed too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the soft glow flashed bright for a moment. Josh stopped in his tracks and closed his eyes. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff, right there.\u201d He tightened his fists and felt the power flowing into him. It made him wonder just how strong he could be; was there even a limit? It sure didn\u2019t seem like there was. In mere minutes he\u2019d gone from a rather strong but otherwise normal kid to full blown superhuman and he had no plans to slow down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow charged up Josh strode quickly to the closest bus and grabbed the rear bumper and lifted with no hesitation. Just as he suspected the huge vehicle came off the ground as easily as if he were lifting a toy. Just like with Mr. Ford\u2019s SUV he made his way to the center but this time hoisted the 15 ton bus from the ground with just one hand. It was easy. Just to show off he tossed the bus into the air, it sailed 10 feet up, then he caught it on its return. Metal groaned and glass shattered but the bus held together the frame bending slightly where his hand was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh\u2019s confidence was soaring. With an evil chuckle he tossed the bus straight up again, higher this time. Then again even higher catching it with ease as it fell from a height of 30 feet right into his hands. On the next toss he spun the bus lengthwise catching it upside down after a half spin. The metal roof buckled a bit and his hands dig into the steel and for a moment he was afraid he\u2019d broken his toy but it held together enough that he was able to toss it again, this time spinning it so that the front end was facing down, catching the front bumper. He hoisted the bus high in one hand balancing the whole thing high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around and saw that the crowd watching him had grown. He saw the same look of fear and awe across all their faces and soaked it in. He was unstoppable and everyone who\u2019d ever given him a hard time would pay. In fact, towards the back of the crowd he noticed someone familiar. It was David, that little pipsqueak that had gotten away earlier without coughing up his lunch money. With super strength Josh hardly had a need for pocket change, but he still had a point to prove to that little asshole. Looking dead at the kid he announced to the crowd, \u201cYou guys are all in so much trouble!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh tossed the 15 ton bus one last time catapulting it into the school this time. It flew several hundred feet through the air before crashing through the roof of the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, realizing that Josh\u2019s threat was aimed at him, bolted but Josh was already in pursuit. With an easy leap the 500 pound teen vaulted the crowd of onlookers and hit the ground running after his target. He\u2019d always been big and slow but now his super-powered muscles propelled his body at lightning speed. He was charging faster than an Olympic runner quickly gaining ground on his prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned a corner, rounding a building and heading for the school\u2019s auditorium. Josh kept his speed and simply cut the corner smashing through the brick walls and coming out the other side picking up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going dweeb? You can\u2019t out run me this time!\u201d he taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh ran up behind David and grabbed the smaller boy by the back of the neck, lifting him into the air like a rag doll. With a casual flick of his arm Josh sent the kid sailing across the courtyard where he rolled across the concrete coming to rest 200 yards away. Josh chuckled then used his massive legs to leap the entire distance landing right next to David, the cement ground forming spiderweb cracks under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was laying on his back panting wildly, his eyes wide with terror, his face a mix of dirt, blood, and tears. Josh couldn\u2019t care less if the kid was hurt or afraid, in fact he drank the fear in relishing it almost as much as his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gonna give me your lunch money now?\u201d Josh asked as he flexed his entire body. His chest, arms, shoulders, and legs all seemed to double in size. Josh then noticed a wet spot appear in the crotch of David\u2019s pants. \u201cYou know what, keep your piss-soaked money. But you are going to do something for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh bent down and grabbed David by the back of his head and hauled him to his feet. Josh flexed his free hand as hard as he could pouring as much size into his monster bicep as he could. He then put David\u2019s face right up next to the towering mass letting him get a real sense of it incredible size. He chuckled when he saw his arm was bigger than David\u2019s whole head, it wasn\u2019t even close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a real good look,\u201d Josh said. \u201cPut your hands on it, top and bottom.\u201d He shook David violently when he didn\u2019t move. \u201cNOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s hands flew to Josh\u2019s arm, one hand atop the peak of his bicep one at the bottom of the tricep\u2019s low belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of people are going to ask you all kinds of questions about what you saw today. I want you to remember just how fucking massive my muscles are. You see how far apart your hands are? Keep them steady.\u201d Josh released his flex and put his arm down leaving David with his hands floating in air over a foot apart from each other. \u201cWhen they ask about me you tell them he\u2019s got arms this big, and you put your hands just like that. You got that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh dropped David who landed in a heap on the ground. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d better. Don\u2019t make me hunt you down and crush your skull between my fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned toward the approaching sound of sirens. The police were on their way. \u201cHmm,\u201d Josh whispered aloud, \u201cthis could be interesting. Hey cube, I\u2019m going to need you to make sure my body is bullet proof of it isn\u2019t already.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As he did, the cube glowed, and he felt every single muscles fibre throughout his body hum and thicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... FUCK... that's the shit right there...\" He muttered to himself, flexing his immense arms as he finally arrived to the scene. Several cop cars were parked in a semi-circle surrounding the young bully from all sides. Josh gave a cocky smirk as he saw several of the cops hold up hand guns at him. He could hear the shocked whispers from them as they hid behind the cop cars, taking in his massive, bloated physique. Hushed voices that wondered if he really was a kid, how he looked so damn big, if he really caused all that destruction at the school. Josh let out a laugh at it all and began to boast, flexing his supercharged guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right! I did all that carnage back there! I'm not just huge, I'm MEGA huge!\" He boomed, his loud voice hurting the ears of the police as he let out a growl, flexing his muscles, veins rippling overtop of them, pumping his physique with even more mass. \"And you know what? ... You guys are IN MY WAY...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire, fire!\" Came a panicked cry. With him walking towards the cars, it was enough for them to start firing. Joshes heart was beating like crazy as he was pestered with bullet fire. At first he flinched upon hearing the gunshots, but as he realized the bullets were ricocheting off his rock hard muscles, he gave a devilish grin, before bursting into a full laugh at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! Looks like your PUNY guns can't stop me! Nothing can!\" He yelled, now charging at one of the cop cars. He bulldozed right through it, his muscles turning the entire thing to scrap as he grabbed it with both arms and tore it in half, tossing the pieces carelessly to the side. The police were running now as the young bully proudly flexed his huge muscles for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah! Now that's power! All you wimps tried to boss me around, tell me what to do... well guess what! I'm bigger than anyone! Stronger than anyone! And you know what? I'm not just gonna be the biggest bully on the schoolyard... I'm gonna be the biggest bully of the whole world! That's right! I'll be the worlds bully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cube began to hum and glow as he thundered his declaration to the world. Something was happening. His clothes began to warp and change, his whole body save for his head being covered by a black substance, like some sort of bodysuit. Printed across his heaving pecs was a massive Omega symbol that glowed gold, the same colour as his eyes and the cube around his neck. Attached to his hulking traps was a billowing black cape with spiked edges, a symbol of his super being. He laughed as he raised his arms into the air, flexing them wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was reading deep into the recesses of his mind, searching for his hidden desires. It was there that the Cube could feel it, a deep hunger that wanted more. More muscle, more size, more godlike strength to help him do whatever he wanted. As Josh laughed, he suddenly felt a surge of energy rush through him, causing the massive bully to shudder. A rubbery creaking noise filled the air as his suit began to stretch out, his body filling up with even more man-shaming muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOH...\" Josh let out a deep moan as he tilted his head back, clenching his fists as his body throbbed with the Cubes energy. His eyes shot open, glowing a bright gold colour, and he let out a deep roar as his body began to pump up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! YES! MORE POWER! MORE MUSCLE! COME ON CUBE, SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!\" He held his arms out as they surged with mass, the peaks of his biceps swelling to ridiculous heights, now beginning to tower above his head, even when unflexed. Veins pumped more of the Cubes energy into him as he flexed, the ground cracking beneath his feet as his traps billowed above his head. Golden electricity crackled off of his body, destroying anything within a 50 metre radius of his ever growing and expanding body. He let out another laugh, his voice having deepened to an almost demonic tone, the surrounding area shaking from the power that just his voice held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOH YEAH!! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!\" He ranted as his pecs pressed into his chin, each one like a wrecking ball of shredded, striated, pulsating muscle, threatening to swallow his head whole. \"MAKE ME A FUCKING GOD CUBE! MAKE ME BIGGER... BIGGER! BIGGER!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body easily had at least a ton of pure muscle on it, making his 5'4 foot frame wider than it was tall. But even that wasn't enough for the greedy muscle bully, his supercharged muscles ached with hunger, the cube responding in like by pumping his freakazoid physique up even more, giving Josh as much as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... but even that wasn't enough for him.

She was one of the newer teachers to school having just started this year after graduating.  Still in her mid-twenties she was a fairly attractive young woman who was already beginning to draw the attention of the various older students including Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, should you be a lun....Oh my God!\" she gasped after looking up from her lesson plan to see the form of Josh standing there in the doorway.  Naked except for a pair of extremely tight black gym shorts the bunched around his hips and a chain with some kind of glowing cube he was absolutely massive, covered from head-to-toe in thick, perfectly cut muscle bigger.  \"What?  What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I became a real man,\" he smiled at her, rolling his massive shoulders that were almost too big to fit through the doorway that he had to slide sideways to make his way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get you some help,\" she slowly stood, still taking in all of the monstrous muscle man before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I was thinking you could give me a private lesson,\" casually Josh brought his bicep up for a flex as almost 40 inches of pure power erupted causing Ms. Zimmer to swoon slightly at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What kind of lesson?\" she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of sex ed,\" he smiled and continued posing, \"I did some research after class on the internet and found a few things I'd like to try out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Josh, we can't do that.  I'm your teacher after all,\" even as she said this a part of Ms. Zimmer wanted to give in.  She wanted to rush over and worship this form of physical perfection that stood before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Why don't you come over here and feel this and tell me you don't want to give me a lesson?\"  Josh placed his hands on his hips and flexed his muscles to the max causing it to nearly double in size and Ms. Zimmer to gasped again as she felt the warmth of arousal spread throughout her body at the sight of this stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, I don't think...\" she started to stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel it!\"  he commanded and flexed even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ms. Zimmer approached and timidly at first her hand reached out to touch the gigantic muscles on his chest.  The moment she felt the hardness her hesitation vanished and her hands were suddenly reaching out and groping this magnificent stud.  Her hands wandered up across his shoulders noting not only their shape and massive size but also their hardness and density.  She wandered down across his arms, feeling every single of inch of their perfection.  Her hand moved to his abs, each one cut and perfectly separated from the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just smiled as her hands wandered lower still to his shorts.  The cube around his neck began to glow and slowly his shorts began to feel tighter still.  Ms. Zimmer gasped again when she felt the member inside begin to expand more and more until it was as monstrous as the rest of his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to give me that lesson now?\" he whispered into her ear.</span></div></div>",

Wasting all my natural dancing talent dancing and striping for an awful clientele just to get by. My boss was old perv who doesn't pay well. Dad liked me enough to name me after his favorite kind of car, which he'd picked my mother up in on their first date. He however didn't like me enough to stick around. Now everyone assumes it's just a stage name rather then my real name. Mom worked herself to death trying to take care of me, at 16 she finally gave out, leaving me alone. I had to give up any hope of my dream of being a professional dancer, as a result of her death, and focusing on my studies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did good those last two years graduating above average, but like an idiot I listened to my boyfriend at the time Riley. He said he'd help me get money for community college, but instead he stole all the money I'd saved from a waitress job and then beat me when I found out. He left, I was bruised and bleeding and was barely able to call an ambulance. They looked for a week, but the police didn't care enough to find that damn bastard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked at that job till I fell for another jerk. Micheal acted kind when others were around, but once we were left alone he turned abusive. I lived with him despite that till I was 21, that's when he snapped and beat me till I was unconscious. The only reason I survived was because he was so loud the girl next door called the police. That bastards in the local prison, to this day he sends me letters through friends about what he's going to do to me once he gets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm stuck in this hell hole, due to Keith my current boyfriend if you can call him that. Really he's more of my pimp, while he's not beating me, he abuses me in other ways. He knows I'm dependent on him for a place to stay, and tells me if I leave he'll punish all the other girls. Basically every girl here is his dependent. I however get the \"pleasure\" of him forcing me into his bed every night. I can't fight back either he's a 270 lb brute, whom I'm sure would kill me if I don't keep him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Mercedes\", said the announcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it I hate men!!!\", she shouted in a private dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Keith came in. \"Mercedes, sweetheart how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to the ground and answered timidly, \"Uh.. fine Keith.\" He puts his hand on her shoulder. \"The fellows outside were telling me you didn't seem as energetic today, you know I can get you something to make you feel a little better. \"No way in hell am I letting you drug me, you bastard.\", She thought to scared to even look at him wrong much less tell her how she truly felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. No I'll be alright\", She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently grabbed her hair, \"Is it one of the other girls, you know you can tell me, you're my girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them alone.\", she thought. \"No.. I'll be fine.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think this how caring for someone is done, fucking animal.\", she thought as Keith walked out. She sat in her seat and began to cry. It wasn't often she did now a days, but everyone once in awhile she just broke. \"Damn it I just want an out, anything to get back at these jerks, any longer and I'm afraid I'll end up dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she heard a knock at the door. She wiped her tears away and forced herself to stop crying like she had done so many times. \"Ye.. yeah who is it\", she asked receiving no response. She got up and walked to the door. \"Hello\", peaking out the door. She looked down and noticed a box on the floor with a note. \"Great probably some idiot fanboy who doesn't know what Keith does to his type. She picked it up and read the note, \"You look like you need a hand, Open me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door and walked into her room. \"Probably just some prank, nobody gives a shit about me\", She thought before opening the box. Inside she saw a white glowing cube. \"Okay that's a new one, what is it some kind of rubik's cube nightlight.\" She tried turning parts of the cube but realized it was completely solid. \"How is this supposed to help?\", she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at it in her hand for a moment before her thoughts turned to her past. \"I hate them, I hate them so much.\"<br>\r\nJust then she felt an odd tingle first in her hand then spreading to her entire body. \"What's happening?\", she said panicking before dropping the cube. \"What was that?\", she thought. She looked down at her body, something she knew better then anyone the only thing that was really hers in this world. \"Am I a bit bigger?\", she asked looking at her arms and legs. Sure enough they were slightly bigger and felt stronger too. Curious she grabbed a hold of her rooms dresser something she couldn't move before. Suddenly however she could move it easily, \"What's happening, how is this possible?\", she asked before looking at the cube on the ground. \"How did you do this?\", she asked realizing it was the only thing different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was going to see how the cube managed to do this she heard a commotion at the door. She quickly stuffed it into her bag and went outside to see what was happening. Sure enough Keith was handling a dancer roughly in the hall. \"I own you bitch, and don't forget it\", he said as he left her in a room and locked the door from the outside. \"Oh Mercedes my girl, I was just about to come get you, how about getting dinner at Tony's before heading home for a good shag, I know Tony's is your favorite. \"Actually Tony's is your favorite you woman beating bastard.\", she thought before replying. She looked down at his feet, \"Y.. yeah let's go\", she said nervously.</span></div></div>",

Naturally Keith fit right in, while Mercedes hated everything about it. Tony the owner had connections to every deadbeat in town. \"Keith buddy how you doing?\", Tony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great Tony, hook me and my girl here up with the usual.\", Keith replied. Mercedes hated the food, but Tony got it for her when she first came here and she was afraid to disagree and get something else. Mercedes sat there watching all the scum. \"Less then an hour ago Keith was beating a woman, and now he's partying. Everyone here doesn't care about that either.\", she thought. The only taste worse than her food, was what these people gave her when she looked at them. Mercedes thought about the cube that had made her stronger. She thought she may be strong enough to get away from Keith now even, but she was to scared to even speak out against him, or look at him wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left to head back to Keith's place. Upon arriving they were greeted by Kathy. Kathy was at least to Keith a maid/cook with benefits, in reality she was basically a slave, he ever chained her up and put shock collars on her on occasion. Mercedes wanted to cry every time she saw her, she was like her little sister in captivity. \"Alright girls time for the main event both of you to the bedroom.\", Keith ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes put her bag and clothes off to the side by the bed. She stood there naked as the day she was born waiting to be told what she should do, even if he told her to have sex with Kathy in front of him, she would do it. Just then Keith looked oddly at Mercedes. \"Have you put on some weight?\", Keith asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up from the floor slightly, \"Wh.. what, I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have put on some weight haven't you, Kathy your in charge of feeding her when I don't take her out. What do you have to say for yourself?\", Keith yelled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Keith, please I'm sorry I'll just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Keith smacked her across the face knocking her to the ground. \"You know I want you to watch that, and still you fucked that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes looked on pure anger welling up inside her. She normally would have just sat there and let it happen unable to stop him, but she finally spoke up. \"Keith!!! leave her alone!!!\", she shouted. Keith turned to her and pushed her to the ground, \"Mercedes you stay out of this, this is between me and her.\", Keith yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mercedes lay on the floor she listened to Kathy's grunts of pain. \"That.. That bastard hurt me, that bastard fucking hurt me.\", Mercedes thought as she noticed the glowing cube in the bag next to her. She pulled it out and got up, \"All right cube, give me what you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes muscles grew as she stood up staring angrily at Keith. Her biceps bulged, abs began forming, and her legs became like tree trunks. As Keith was about to Kick Kathy again Mercedes yelled at him, \"Hey bastard, leave her alone.\" Just as Keith turned to face her she punched him square in the jaw. Keith went flying first through the wall of the room, then the one next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes was to angry to take in how strong she had just become. She looked down at the battered Kathy and picked her up. \"Kathy.. Kathy, speak to me, please don't be dead.\", She yelled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a very weak voice spoke, \"Me.. Merce.des, Thank.. you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes didn't know what possessed her but put the cube in Kathy's hands, \"Please Kathy don't leave me, you're all I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cube responded to Kathy's touch by returning her to consciousness and giving her some strength. \"What, What's happening?\", Kathy said less weak than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kathy you're.. you're alive.\", Mercedes said with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy still had injuries all over her body, but the cube had made it so she could survive and though with difficulty move. Mercedes told Kathy about the cube, she didn't know how it did it but the cube gives strength. Mercedes told Kathy, \"Common get your things, we can't stay here tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes got clothed and grabbed her bag, which she put the cube inside. She went around grabbing anything she thought would be useful. As she did she noticed Kathy had gotten clothed but she was just standing by Keith's dead body staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kathy.. Kathy we need to go, we can't do anything about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kathy fell to her knees and began punching Keith's body. \"You fucking bastard!!!! You treat me like dirt!!! You stole me off the street and treat me like a slave!!! And just when one thing goes wrong you....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes grabbed her arm stopping her from hitting Keith's bloody broken body more. \"I know how you feel, I know that better than anyone, but we need to go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy with tears in her eyes looked down one last time then stood up, \"You're.. You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy walked over to a draw and pulled out some keys. \"I know where his safe is, lets take what's in it and go in that dumb car in the garage.</span></div></div>",

He fixed up several cars, but his personal and most favorite was a red convertible he wouldn't let anyone touch. \"I'm touching it know asshole!!!\", Kathy said as she hooped into the passengers seat. Afterward the ride was quite for several minutes, until finally Mercedes realized she had no idea where she was going. She knew Kathy didn't want to talk right now, so she had to come up with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally decided on a place she knew would be safe. She pulled into an apartment complex on the bad side of town. \"What's this place Mercedes?\", Kathy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a safe house protected by the Prim's gang.\", Mercedes replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Prim's why are we here, Keith wasn't in that gang.\", Kathy asked shaken by idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he was, but he was a little snitching brat on the side. In fact Keith played several gangs in town, but with this one under protection and rarely used we'll be safe here.\", Mercedes replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know so much?\", Kathy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith for all his horseshit wanted to protect his property, which meant telling me to go here in the event things went south, so he could pick me up later.\", Mercedes replied. \"Of course I wanted shit to go south so I could leave, but looks like the shit hit us first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy became mad, \"So I wasn't that important to him at all then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes grabbed the key hidden behind the apartment and went inside Kathy following suit. The place was a shit hole, but it was  know there shit hole. They had a small TV set, an empty fridge, and one large bed for the both of them. \"I thought you said this was a safe house.\", Kathy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, but I also told you it was rarely used. Which is why it's not something nice to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes didn't know what they were going to do from know on, but they had a bit of money from Keith's safe to eat off of. That night Mercedes held onto Kathy, who was finally realizing what she'd done, and how her life before was even worse than she realized. Mercedes knew she'd have to come up with something to get by, but she was also mad at the world for screwing her yet again.</span></div></div>",

Megan went back  to the container containing the cube and stared at it for several minutes in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan continued to look at the cube she heard sounds that sounded like a language and then all of a sudden Megan was able to read the inscriptions on the cube. Finally she heard a voice say \"This cube is yours. It is not on your list. Take it Megan. Without thinking twice Megan reached and grabbed the cube. As she held it Megan felt a sense of pleasure from her toes to her head and she gasped. With that she put the cube in her backpack and left the warehouse after locking up the building and setting the alarm.</span></div></div>",

It meant she could finally restock on protein powder for awhile and not buy individual bars or drinks. At 26 years the 25 year old ebony was a female powerhouse standing 5 foot 10 and weighing 201 LBS most of it muscle. If there was one thing Rachel liked more then lifting weights and getting stronger or practicing hand to combat it was her job as a bouncer. Her strength and fighting skill made it easy for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the mall to go to her favorite supplement shop she heard what she thought was a voice calling out to her. \"What the fuck\" thought Rachel as she took a detour from her one destination to the mall and entered what appeared to be a D&amp;D shop crossed with a classical items store. She ignored the shop owners welcome and proceeded to the back where she saw a cube about 2 inches squared. Rachel picked it up and felt a wave of energy come over her. She was up before coming to the mall but now holding the cube she felt awake for the first time ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the cube to the counter and purchased it.</span></div></div>",

This is a story all about muscle and strength and the The Cube provides it. How it does it can vary between stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No underage sex, just none.<br>\r\n2. Little to no height growth, this is mostly a muscle and strength story. In turn little to no shrinking (in height) if you choose to let The Cube drain people.<br>\r\n3. No upper limit on how far a person can be changed.<br>\r\n4. The Cube can't be destroyed, broken, or otherwise removed from the story. Nor is it bound to any one person in any way.<br>\r\n5. How The Cube changes people is up to each story, there's no one way it grows people.<br>\r\n6. No pure choice chapters.<br>\r\n7. Actually ADD story. A few decent paragraphs and such per chapter that advances the plot. I'd prefer quality over quantity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, go as crazy as you want.</td>",
