He looked at her image which was nothing than a selfie of some friends of him and some girls, among them her. He remembered how sad he had been when he had learned that she was assigned to a different class when they both joined this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, they lived in the same neighborhood. And no, she was like living on another continent. She did not seem to notice him, which was possibly quite easy because he was too shy to be around her visibly. His friends had more interaction with girls around. At least if one listened to their boisterous claims what they had achieved and done. Last year he had seen her at the local public swim center a few times. Unfortunately she was always there with some other friends, male and female. He could do nothing than sit on his own towel with one of his friends next to him and stare at her. He remembered her beautiful face, red hair flowing, her sleek figure and her cute butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was getting carried away. There were so many things to arrange and make sure that they worked. He would rather remain shrinked than being exposed spying. Alone the thought gave him shivers. He read the Executive Summary of the paper he had pinched and copied from his father's once unlocked drawer again. About two hours it said the shrinking would stretch end to end, including about 10 minutes of shrinking and growing. Clothes would not shrink, which meant that he would need miniature clothes. If he did not manage to return to safety it could become very ugly. The size he would shrink to could be influenced by the mixture, but there were uncertainties because it was calculated only for adults. But had calculated with his body weight and thought that two inches would be a good size for one reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe's room was on the second floor under the roof. Probably there was only one room at this level. It had no balcony but a window that he knew was open at night at this time of the year. The plants in front of the window would allow him to climb in if he could bring his favorite plan into play. One of the key elements was how to get there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\na) fly <br>\r\nb) ride piggy-back on someone or something</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things with Jimmy were different. He could have spent some time and effort to be less shy, make himself more presentable (which was not even required but he thought different) and simply try to get in touch like any other teenager. But he was a focused person and it would have to be very different. As soon as he had learned about the secret shrinking formula from his dad and managed to get a good level of supply from samples his dad did not store away carefully, he had pondered about how to get in and out in time and covenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe octocopter he had bought was lighter, smaller and almost fully silent when compared to the bigger chinese one which he used to take pictures through windows. Pictures could be nice, but the vision was too often blocked or the distance proved to be too large for really good pics. The new copter came with a good software to arrange for certain flight paths and had a laser he could use to determine a landing zone very precisely. It was more a spot than a zone. The only amendments to the copter were a very small button which was easy to be pushed even for a very little boy and a small open box with tiny bars. He had checked all functions and had done test flights the previous nights. Now it was time for the real thing. It had been surprisingly easy to buy male dolls with clothes in various sizes. He was proud of himself that he was brave enough to say to the cute girl at the cashier that they were presents for his little sister. Now the dolls had been stripped and disposed of. Their clothes were arranged next to him. The copter stood fully charged on his window sill, ready to fly upon the push of a single button. The window was open and the room was dark. Phoebe's window was open and she had left her room for her favorite TV show she usually watched downstairs with her sister, followed by the obligatory shower, as a last ritual before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy stripped naked, shuddered briefly of the thought that someone might see him, sat down behind the curtain and drank the magic fluid. He felt dizzy and had problems to focus. Everything seemed to draw away from him and become bigger. He could not move during this process, which was correctly described in the Executive Summary. When the world stopped becoming bigger he looked at the timer. 9.23 minutes had passed after 8.47p.m. Jimmy struggled to get to his feet but managed to stand and look down at him. Everything looked normal but the clock now towered above him. He walked to the clothes and chose a plain T-shirt and trousers (he had not managed to find dolls with underwear, what a pity). Then he climbed out of the window, entered the box of the octocopter which looked to him like a full scale helicopter, leaned out and pushed the buttom. Fortunately he still had enough power to do so. The copter took off in a flurry and Jimmy quickly retired behind the bars and held on to them for his flight to the open spot next to Phoebe's plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight was short and his anxiety about crashing at touchdown or landing in front of Phoebe looking out of her window quickly went away. The octocopter landed on the laser guided spot and shut off the electronic engines. Jimmy left his box, heard the shower just being turned off and climbed up the plants which was easier said and done. It was like climbing the side wall of a ship on a moving rope. He finally managed to enter her dark room by convenient help of the plants again and took position behind a flower pot. His eyes wandered over her private chamber when he heard an electric toothbrush come to work. He cherished her place and her scent that hung in the air, and hoped for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light went on at the staircase. He peeked around the flower pot and saw wonderful Phoebe traipsing up the stairs with her body wrapped in a towel. He could not believe his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- luck held<br>\r\n- not really lucky</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There she appeared on the stairs, bubbly beautiful Phoebe taking the steps to her room under the roof. She entered it, closed the door behind her and stood in the center of the room for a second. Tiny Jimmy stood without motion behind the flower pot and watched in awe. Her red hair covered her shoulders and gave tiny reflections of the light from the lamp above. She just stood there and seemed to look at something, stepping from one bare foot to the other. It was difficult to see from Jimmy's position what she was looking at but he assumed from the pictures of the room he had taken with the camera equipped octocopter earlier that she was looking into a big mirror on her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she turned towards Jimmy and walked straight over in his direction. He cringed and fell to his knees behind the flower pot, counting down his faith. He had not thought this over properly. Of course she had seen him behind the pot. He thought he could feel the stream of air of her sudden movement and looking up he saw a big head appear over the flowers. This must be the feeling of a soldier when his opponents call in close air support. But the head went further and was followed by a surprisingly long neck, then bare shoulders and, hitting the flowers in the pot, two large hills covered by a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no peeping, boys\" Phoebe chuckled. Then she did something that raised the terror of poor tiny Jimmy to new heights. Unceremoniously she closed the window and turned the handle. Then she pulled the curtains which the boy knew would block any vision from outside. Plan A had failed. And there was no plan B. From his checking he was adamant that the window would remain open during the night, especially on a warm spring evening like this. The door was closed and the window as well. Jimmy was now an illegal prisoner in a beautiful girlish room with a prison warden that made him freak out when he thought about the consequences of being caught. He urged to stop the time. One hour and fourty minutes were left before he would have to sit in the copter and push the button in order to return to safety before his growing would result in a copter crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe had turned her back on him, having never looked down in the process, and went back to her spot in front of the mirror. Jimmy looked around for a better place to hide. He needed a dark corner. And then he saw it. It was a hole in a book cover, low enough above the ground to just jump in. And on the way there was an open plastic case with a dark colour for some kind of makeup. He dashed, took a handful of the dark makeup and jumped into the hole. He was swift and quiet. With his heart pounding he listend but heard nothing. Quickly he covered his head and neck (yuck) with the makeup. Now his face was almost black and would expose him less when peeking out of a black hole. And that was what Jimmy did. When he resumed his spying on Phoebe he was transfixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe<br>\r\n- changed into her nightie<br>\r\n- made a twerp show</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jimmy watched Phoebe from his hidden spot. He could see her front and left side. She stood in front of the mirror with the towel still wrapped around her. Her body started twisting and turning while she kept monitoring her own moves. He could see that they grew bolder, with her booty shaking this way and that way. The towel unfortunately blurred the movements of the tight body he could just imagine below the cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes lingered on the girl but on occasions he looked at the closed window and how to find a way to his octocopter on the window sill outside. When his eyes wandered back to the girl he saw her hips wiggle, palms outstretched stroking over her side to emphasize her movements. \"Yess, you like it, boy. I do this just for you.\" For a moment Jimmy frowned and gulped. Was she playing a cruel game on him? Confused he could do nothing but ponder and watch. The very tiny two blue eyes peeking out of the black hole in the book cover did not attract the girl's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grabbed the end of the towel that was stuck at her chest and had held the whole thing in place. With an open mouth Jimmy saw her pulling hard at that end and making a spin. \"Tataaaaaaa\" she sang, wearing absolutely nothing any more. Her hand held the towel high and spun it like a lasso. The tight upper body was swinging alongside while her firm breasts followed the movements. Her nipples had a pinkish tone. They were sitting in a puffy little steep hill upon milky white smaller hills. Jimmy almost fell out of the hole when he turned his head to see more. Between her legs was a little furry strip of red hair that was hiding little for someone who stood in front of her. But Jimmy didn't and only caught glimpses. That drove him crazy. Meanwhile Phoebe let go of the towel and it sailed to her bed before it slipped to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show time.\" She spun on her tiny feet and stuck out her rosy butt towards the mirror. Then she began a series of butt wiggling, sometimes bending forward or bending her thighs. Jimmy was rewarded with a good, albeit not great visitor spot of two half moons of wiggling rosy flesh. When Phoebe looked over her shoulder he quickly drew back. But in her excitement of her own show she would have overlooked a green elephant on her desk. Then she jumped, took a winner's pose, and waved. \"Goodbye\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer show had ended but Jimmy's show was still on. Time was still ample but slowly ticking away. He drew back into the darkness when he saw her approach her desk next to his hiding place. Hands were taking a bottle with a milky white substance in it. Jimmy screamed silently when she helped herself with a large lake of that substance in her hand and seconds later was rubbing it into her delicate skin. When he saw her struggling to reach the spots on her back he fell on his knees and considered begging to help her. Phoebe's breasts seemed to become firmer with a reflecting slimy cover. They served as a temporary depot, from which the skin milk then spread over her butt, her legs and between her legs. He thought that he might die on the spot having seen the most beautiful scene on earth. But he lived on to see what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- a bit of diddling<br>\r\n- she took her phone and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoebe was now pacing through her room while skin soaked up the lotion. She tried various ways to walk and checked which of them made her hips and bottom show best. Shrunk to miniature size Jimmy's eyes followed every move from behind his hiding place. Then she went to her wardrobe, stretched her body to reach high and grabbed a pink nightie. Her body wiggled into it and the first act of the evening show was over. The spying boy had already seen more than he ever dreamed of. But when the nightie covered the fantastic body his thoughts went back to his own safety. There was more than an hour left. He hoped that she would go to bed and turn off the light to allow for an easy escape. But Phoebe had no intention to sleep yet. The brighter central light in the room was replaced by a soft, yellow glow of the lamp next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy watched the girl climb into her bed. She pulled the blanket towards her and raised her knees under it. It did not take the boy long to understand what was about to happen. Due to his own shyness he was very accustomed to this position. But did girls do that as well? Even really cute and popular girls like Phoebe? He thought that only shy boys like him would  spent some evenings in the week on this. Unfortunately everything the girl did was covered by the blanked. On occasions he could see the blanket move, sometimes slowly, sometimes reflecting rapid motions below her. Jimmy resorted to watching the lovely face instead. At first only her mouth twitched and he saw lips licked by a cute little tongue, but over time he could see her breathing was becoming heavier. She was completely silent but her mouth opened and showed gritted teeth. Now additional movement of the blanket higher up let him to understand that her other hand was now massaging and fondling her own breast. The shrunk boy behind the cover was becoming more nervous. Was it really good to be in here right now? Seeing her aroused was spectacular but he feld a sudden urge to escape. When Phoebe started rolling herself on her bed, twisting from left to right Jimmy pressed his own legs together. His tiny hands were holding something with a strong grip. \"Not here, not here.\" he murmured to himself, suppressing the wish to move his hand inside his doll derived pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock he saw the blanket fly. Now Phoebe was sitting reclined in her bed, one hand diddling her snatch while the other one was holding one breast inside her own nightie. It had risen to her belly, but her hand between her legs gave only occasional glimpses of the bit of hair and of the flesh below. Her mouth was now open and he could hear stifled moans. Then she reached over, grabbed a long cushion in the form of a roll, and hopped to the other side of the bed. A cute bare butt was rising into the air when she reached to the floor to fetch her towel she had sent flying after the shower. With curiosity he watched her wrap the cushion with the towel. She was certainly occupied with this for a few more seconds. It provided an excellent opportunity to climb out and escape, or to watch further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he looked up to the window an icy grip in his chest made him gasp. The now closed window remembered him that he could not escape that way. All the watching of her curvy nude body and her diddling had made him completely forget that he was an illegal prisoner in her room and time ticket on. If he was not out of the house within the next hour he would grow back to his regular shape, have no clothes and could not move during this process. He sprinted back to his hiding position, saw the girl lift the wrapped towel and turn her head back to the room, and dove sliding like in an expert baseball move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Phoebe mounted the cushion he winced.

She was kneeling with her bare crotch resting on the tissue of her towel. Although he was well hidden the boy was glad that she was not facing him directly although he could see the look on her face. Then Phoebe started shimmying her hips in quick blurry moves until she found the right position. Then her hips started thrusting. At first her body was as straight as it was probably being told in a horse riding school. But as speed and intensity picked up it started swaying. \"Oh yes, Oh yes, give it to me. Do it. Do it\" she only whispered it, but Jimmy could see she would have shouted had there been nobody else around. He could see her bare crotch rubbing on the towel, turning slightly pink. \"Yeah, Greg, do it hard. Harder. Yes. I like your big one. Do it. Oh Greg I love you.\" Now she could not whisper any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was Greg? Did she mean Greg Meagher, a boy who had recently moved to the area? He was sometimes playing basketball with him. A big hunk from school, or the football team? While thinking hard Jimmy heard something else. Tiny bare feet were quietly traipsing up the stairs. \"Be careful, someone is coming.\" he wanted to shout to Phoebe. But her moaning and longing for Greg was repeated, louder and more desperate. \"Oh yes, right there, so good.\"  \"Someone is listing.\" Jimmy could only whisper to himself. He almost wished he had never intruded to see this. How would an inexperienced and shy boy be able to satisfy this girl's wide desire? She was so sweet and cute when he saw her on the neighborhood or at school. In her bedroom she was someone else. \"That is scary\" he muttered, glancing over to the door. He was sure that someone was listening.</span></div></div>",

She grabbed the pillow she had been humping and resorted to a slow and hard rubbing. \"So good. Greg, please more. Just a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock Knock. The knocking on the door was very careful. Phoebe yelled \"STOP\", frantically dismounted from the pillow, and disappeared under her blanket. With a shaking voice she managed to say. \"Come in\". The door opened and a little girl in a pink unicorn nightie slipped into the room, carefully closing the door without making any noise. \"Bridget. You should be in bed. Why do you dist....what do you want?\" When she looked what the little girl was carrying she moaned. \"Not again. You know what happens if mom or did find me helping you with your homework. Just remember...\" She seemed to shudder. \"I am sorry sis. I really tried hard but it is so much. And I forgot about the time.\" The little nightie flew along with the body when it turned from right to left. \"Please help me. You can do it really fast. I know. But why do you look tussled?\" Phoebe frowned. \"What did you answer mum when she asked you about your homework?\", ignoring the last question.  \"I said that all was completed, and I showed her all but mathematics. She had little time and did not ask for it.\" Phoebe pondered and said. \"You have to learn to solve your own problem. Mum told me that I face dire consequences if I do your homework. This is cheating. Now go down again, quietly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget still turned her body one way, then the other. Then she hopped on Phoebe's bed and asked. \"Who is Greg? Is he your boyfriend? Is he in the room? And what is this?\" Her hand was resting on the bump where the blanket was rising from the pillow Phoebe had been humping.</span></div></div>",

This made the mysterious lump under the blanket much more interesting and Bridget tackled it. For some seconds both girls seemed to pull hard, but the older sister was losing because she could only use her feet. \"Wait. It's a present I am preparing and you should not see it now.\" \"A present? For me?\" this startled Bridget and reluctantly she let go. Phoebe seized the item quickly and placed it out of reach of her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is Greg? Is he hiding in your room?\" Quickly Bridget dashed through the room, looking under the bed and in the wardrobe. Jimmy thought he saw movement under the blanket between Phoebe's legs. \"No, silly girl, nobody is hiding in my room. And you should go down before we really get in trouble.\" Lifting the lid of a small metal box close to Jimmy's hiding place Bridget turned to her sister. \"I am in trouble already for having lied about my homework and not having it completed. But think what mum would do if I told her about Greg.\" \"You wouldn't.\" \"I will if you don't do my homework.\" \"If you tell you will pay dearly.\" \"It will hurt your butt more than mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had the little girl just said? Jimmy saw that it had a remarkable effect on Phoebe. She had a blank expression on her face. \"Ok, let me do your homework. I tell you the results and you write them down.\" When she lifted the blanket and slowly got out of her bed she clenched her thighs together. Bridget was already sitting on a gymnastic ball at Phoebe's desk with her homework she had gathered from the floor, watching her sister walk stiffly with wobbly legs to her chair. Now two cute girls in their nighties were sitting next to each other. Jimmy looked at the clock. About forty minutes were remaining. The girls would take at least fifteen minutes. It sounded that Phoebe could not concentrate very well. Her little sister told her twice that it would have to be done in a different way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was not sure, but it looked to him as if Phoebe had one hand between her legs from time to time, just when her sister was busy writing down her results. He saw an electric cable hang close to his hiding place. If he was gliding to the floor he could quickly get under the desk. But he would likely not manage to climb up again. In that case he was giving up his Plan A escape route. Was it worth taking the risk? It might be too dark but the sight might still be overwhelming. He would have to watch out for their feet. If he found no solution within the next forty minutes he was toasted anyhow. And it was possible to run hidden from under the desk to the bed. Worst case he would have to grow hidden under the bed. Naked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shrunk boy in the room still refused to accept that his escape route was rendered unusable. His previous spying results from his photo octocopter had showed that this girl loved to sleep with the window open. With the spectacle he had just enjoyed it was obvious that she wanted nobody to see or listen, although that had not worked. Now she had two people in her room at a time when she wanted very much to be on her own. Although it would have been enticing to get closer for an upskirt he was sure that he would not be able to climb up after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was close enough to study their faces and frame. Bridget was skinny, had large brown eyes compared to the size of her head and a short nose. Her body seemed to be tanned, but he concluded this only from the healthy brown color of her bare neck, arms and legs. She was nervously swaying on the gymnastics ball and waited with limited patience for her sister to master her homework. Their faces had similarities but the age gap was pronounced. While Bridget still looked like a child her older sister was well proceeding in her transition to a youth. Her lips and cheeks were fuller, like other shapes of her body which were simply more curvy. He could not see a lot of cleavage but the outlines of the firm round breasts of Phoebe reminded him how they looked like earlier. When looking at her younger sister his earlier impression was confirmed. Two tiny hills were poking, sharp and pointed. It was no topic today but he imagined that this could be a target of Phoebe's mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget read the next task. \u201cAt 7:00 AM the regional train the station and one and a half hours later the long distance train left the same station in the same direction. If the regional train traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, adding 40 minutes for stops, and train B at 80 miles per hour without any stop, then at what time did the regional train have to arrive at his station to let the long distance train pass? Allow for 7 minutes safety distance.\u201d Confused she looked at Phoebe who unfortunately had been occupied otherwise. \"We always go by car. No wonder people don't use the trains if they are so complicated.\" \"Uhu\" was all Phoebe was able to contribute. Her desire to release was so overwhelming that even Bridget seemed to understand the tasks better. Nevertheless she tried. \"Two trains. Let's check what happens after three hours. The first train then will have traveled 180 miles...oh. Hm. I forgot the forty minutes. Then it is two hours and twenty minutes, for 80 miles. That is...\" While she pondered Bridget winced. \"An example does not help. They tell me I have to write a formula with this X and Y thing but how does that work here?\" Jimmy glanced at the clock. Another half an hour remaining. Maybe he could help the girls, but how should he communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thinking was interupted by another pair of bare feet audibly climbing up the stairs. But they were no kids feet. Sound and step were announcing someone senior. \"You don't have to tell me how...GOD NO!\" Phoebe and her sister heard the footsteps. In panic Bridget jumped to the ground and crawled under the bed. Phoebe grabbed her sister's homework and rushed to the bed, but she was too late. The door flung open without any knock and a tough looking beautiful woman in her late thirties entered the room. \"Did you work on your homework?\" The surprisingly cold voice made Jimmy's muscles tighten. Being discovered just by Phoebe would have been a nightmare. But he immediately decided not to cross her mother's path. Her daughter was visibly frightened, kneeling on her bed with the papers spread next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mother, I have helped Bridget with her homework. I know it was wrong.\" Her eyes looked down in defeat. For Jimmy it was surprising that this lively girl gave such an obedient impression. He would have lied casually or tried to change the subject. \"Where does Bridget Eleonora hide?\" Phoebe responded by indicating with her index finger. \"What were your instructions when Bridget Eleonora approaches you in the evening requesting help for school?\" The mother of the girls was slowly walking through the room towards the bed. Loud and clear her older daughter answered. \"I have to refuse and to report this to my parents immediately.\" \"What are the reasons for this instruction?\" \"Bridget has problems to master her school exams and it is against her best interests if Bridget and I cheat.\" Now the woman was bending next to the bed, still standing on her bare feet. She was wearing a nightie just like the girls did, albeit with a fashionable design. It looked like satin to him. He almost felt guilty when he looked at her butt sticking out in his direction. \"COME OUT!\" She said it in a commanding voice that needed not shouting. Immediately he saw a little foot appear, but the woman had something else in mind. She grabbed the ankle and pulled the girl out from under the bed. The nightie was riding up to her chest, giving Jimmy a bonus view of preteen buttocks and a plump pussy mound bare of any hair. Bridget was crying silently and could not say more than \"I am sorry mum.\" But that did not help. Now she was standing again with her nightie back in place, next to Phoebe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air in the room was tense. Jimmy wanted to look at the mother who was standing directly in front of the two girls. But her commanding attitute was so strong that he did not have enough courage to do so. The expressions of the faces of her daughters reflected a level of fear that he had never seen on any other kid's face when their parents had them standing for a tough talk. Those adults, and Jimmy knew this first hand, could threaten or shout or sometimes use harsh words, but the effect they had on their kids was not as strong as he was currently experiencing. Other kids would either talk back or look impassive during their parent's verbal rampage and get on afterwards. His friends, all male due to his shyness towards girls, usually made jokes afterwards how silly their parents acted and how they had heard this over and over again. Jimmy was now outright curious what would develop from here. He simply had not thought that girls could get in trouble that much with their parents. Was this not a typical boys topic? And why was their mother so angry. In his view it was kind from Phoebe to help her little sister with her problems at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridget Eleonora. You have entered your sister's room with papers from school. They included exercises and calculations you were supposed to complete and to show to me before dinner. You have not completed your task, which is evident by the number of blank lines here.\" The adult woman was tossing the papers on the desk. Bridget did not say anything. \"You are facing the following charges: A. Lying to me today before dinner about your scope of homework, when I asked you what you had to do for tomorrow. B. Not completing your calculations. C. Not filing a notice to me that you are unable to complete your calculations, which I told you was mandatory in any such situation. D. Illegally approaching your sister to cheat by either helping you solve it or outright solve it without you understanding the tasks. E. Attempting to hide and evade when you knew that I was looking for you, instead of immediately reporting to me your transgressions.\" Bridget stood there motionless. She was just swallowing hard, in an effort to keep from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was surprised about the number and scope of complaints Bridget's mother made. He would have simply earned a smack on the back of his head, together with an instruction to just get it done now. But in this female household things worked differently. \"Do you require me to prove those charges?\" \"No, mother.\" It was so quiet in the room that her muted answer was loud enough. \"Do you plead guilty regarding all those transgressions and the disobedience of my rules?\" \"Yes, mother.\" \"You will understand that the sheer number and severity will require a scope of punishment that will make you alter your habits?\" \"Yes, mother.\" Now Bridget was holding her hands behind her back, the fingers pressed into each other so hard that the knuckles became white. \"You will face...\"</span></div></div>",

Her eyes went wide and her mouth opened, but closed again quickly. She just managed to quip \"Now?\" Her mother nodded and sat down on the bed. The shrunk boy quickly glanced at the clock. Just less than half an hour was left before he would start to grow again. But now he could not do anything with the window closed and three people being active in the room. There was no way he could get into the wardrobe or under the bed without being spotted. He just had to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he saw made him raise his hand to his mouth to avoid shouting. The younger sister had walked past her mother and now stood close to her mother's right thigh. Jimmy could see the back of her small frame. Suddenly the nightie was lifted to the girl's arms and she bent to rest with her belly over the adult's thighs. She could neither stand or kneel properly and had to stretch her legs and rest on tiptoes to keep her balance. Watching from behind Jimmy could see everything imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\" Bridget counted after she winced, when the hand struck her little buttocks for the first time. Jimmy had little experience with spanking but was relieved to see that it was not overly harsh. But it was much more than playful and the girl's butt would remind her of this treatment later in the evening. After the third swat Bridget flailed her legs, providing even more details of her lower body. \"Phoebe, hold her ankles.\" Instantly the older girl took position and held her ankles down, spread apart enough to see that the fold was partly opened. Phoebe now looked directly towards the privates of her younger sister but her mother did not say anything. The counting was accompanied by \"Ouwiiiee\" or \"Uffff\" but went on until the fifteenth swat landed on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Phoebe and her mother swapped places he could see that Bridget was fighting hard to hold back the tears. In his view she was a brave little girl. Quickly he counted the number of swats he would get by probably all of them if he was found naked in the room. Trespassing. Spying. Seeing what he was not supposed to see. Five hundred? That kind of number he only thought would happen in Arabic countries. He gulped. Meanwhile Phoebe was raising her hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole woke up that Saturday morning with her power out. When she rolled over in bed towards the cell phone on her night stand, she discovered that not only had it not charged last night, but also that none of the electric lights worked, either. Stumbling half-sleepily towards the window across the room, she peeked outside to discover that, at some point early in the morning, a truck had rammed into the powerline and knocked her whole street's power out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on loose pajama pants to go with the t-shirt she wore to bed, she walked outside and asked the workers how long it would take to get her power back on. A worker wearing glasses told her it might take ten or eleven hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have all day,\" she said to the man. \"Can't it be fixed any faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Nicole, it could not be. Frustrated, she slogged back into her little house and made her way into the darkened bathroom across from her bedroom. She kept the door open, so that some sunlight might illuminate the room, and brushed her teeth and showered quickly. Without electricity, the shower was cold, so it was a very quick shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole dried back off and stood in front of the mirror. She didn't want to risk putting make-up on in the dark, so she decided to skip it for the day. It was a shame because she liked wearing make-up, and she thought that she looked particularly good in red lipstick and eyeliner. She tried to wear makeup and look her best whenever possible, but, today would not be one of those days. Instead, she tied her curly dark brown hair into a loose ponytail and went back into her room to put on some clothes for the day. She opened up her closet and decided to wear a button-down shirt with a thin blue sweater over it, khaki capris, and black slip-on shoes. It made her feel better about not getting any make up on for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her phone was dead and had not charged the night before, she decided she would have to go to the coffee shop a few blocks away to charge it. She would bring her laptop or a book and spend part of her day there or something. \"It's not really what I want to do with my Saturday, but I guess I'll have to\" she thought to herself. Maybe one of her friends living downtown would text her and want to get a drink later or something. Nicole packed her laptop bag with her computer and her phone (and a charging cable for each), as well as a novel she had been meaning to read and her wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out her front door and to the garage where her beat-up car is kept and realized she couldn't get it out of the garage without the electricity running. \"It's fine\" she said. \"I'll just walk.\" And so, she did. It was hot out, but the wind was blowing pleasantly, so she thought she walking be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made it down to the end of the street when she discovered a loose cable had been hanging from one of the powerlines. It hung there, limply. \"Must have fallen when the truck hit the powerline\" she said to herself. She went to walk around it, and, as she did so, was suddenly shocked. The wind had picked up and blown the cable into her. The shock was mildly painful, where the cable connected with her shoulder, but she thought it would be a lot worse. Her body felt tingly, that was for sure. She was just glad that didn't kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" she said, grabbing her shoulder. She rubbed her shoulder where the cable hit her and felt another tingle ripple through her body. Her vision began to blur, and then she didn't quite remember what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained consciousness a few moments later, she found herself at six inches tall, exactly. She didn't know this, as she hadn't a ruler to measure herself, but she was suddenly six inches tall nonetheless. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed, taking in her now large surroundings. It was like being on an alien world, except it was her trendy suburb at a massive scale. She looked around - there wasn't anybody approaching, or anybody within her line of sight who could have seen this happen to her. She instinctively reached for her phone to call for help, but remembered that it was out of power. \"Can't charge it at this size...\" she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she would continue walking, until she found someone to help her. No use staying in the same place, lest somebody else accidentally get shrunk down by a loose electrical cable. She just walked and walked, for what seemed like hours but probably wasn't around the corner on the sidewalk. She was afraid to cross the street in case a car ran her over. Her tiny legs wouldn't be able to carry her away from the crushing wheels in time, she feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time walking, somebody found her. It was somebody she recognized, but wasn't friends with. It was...</span></div></div>",

She was excited to be home, because she would be interning at the library this summer for Bridget. However, her internship didn't start for just over two weeks, so she had some time to kill in the meantime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, she had been on her way to meet one of her friends from high school at the local coffee shop. They were going to catch up after being away from each other for a year at different schools. The sun was out, the breeze was pleasant, and she was in a generally happy mood. She had been walking down the street when something over at the edge of the corner had caught her eye. It was moving, but it didn't look like an animal, like a mouse. She walked quickly over towards it until the shape became clearer and it looked like a tiny person, which didn't make very much sense to her, but she went over to it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said, kneeling down in front of the small person. \"I know you, don't I? Your name is Nicole, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. I don't think I remember your name, though\" the tiny woman squeaked up at her. She cowered under Liz's shadow. \"Um, this is going to seem weird, but do you think you might be able to help me? I've somehow shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that\" Liz said, a huge smile forming on her face. \"You look adorable at that size, did you know that? You look like a little living doll person or something, and it's just cute. Oh, and I'm Liz. I'm surprised you don't remember me, you used to babysit me when we were younger\" Liz said, laughing. The tiny woman was just so cute, she just wanted to pick her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. Nicole barely had time to react before Liz's pale hand circled around her torso, and lifted her off of the ground. She stood back up, holding the tiny woman up in her hand. \"You've got a little doll bag and shoes and everything, and it's so adorable,\" Liz gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please put me down,\" Nicole said. \"Won't you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there is anybody who can help you. I don't think anybody has ever shrunk before, do you?\" Liz asked, cheerfully. It wasn't meant as a taunt - she was, in her mind, just stating the facts of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, how about you just take me home then?\" Nicole asked. She reached into her pocket to get her key, but then remembered that they key was now too small to fit into the lock of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got places to be first. You'll come with me instead,\" Liz said. With that, she tucked the tiny woman into the backpack she was wearing, and zipped her up in complete darkness. Liz went...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole kept walking and walking. She was beginning to get tired, but would keep walking until she found somebody to help her. Somebody had to be out this Saturday morning who could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the corner of the block she was on and realized she could hear music. Somebody must have started listening to it just now, because she only heard birds chirping for a while. Nicole turned towards the sound of the music and realized that, a few houses behind her, somebody had just opened their door and had sat down to do some gardening. Her heart dropped when she saw who it was - Julie Cramton. Well, her first name was Taylor, but everyone called her by her middle name, either Julia or Julie. Julie was two years younger than her, and had annoyed her all throughout middle and high school. She was very loud and bubbly, and loved to talk. Julie always tried to hang out with Nicole, thinking she would become cooler because Nicole was older, and, therefore, cooler than her. Nicole never wanted to, and usually brushed her off. Unfortunately, Nicole didn't know when the next time she would see somebody would be was, and so she walked up onto Julie's lawn and approached the towering girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had had her blonde hair pulled back in a bun, and was wearing her \"gardening clothes\", which were also her running clothes - a white tank top and black biker shorts. She was a little curvy, but not in a way that was unappealing. In fact, many people would find her attractive until she talked their ears off. She was humming alongside the music, and was trimming some hydrangeas. Nicole did not like the look of the trimmers, which were larger than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" Nicole said. Julie did not hear, for the music was too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" Nicole said, louder this time. Still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Nicole went over to Julie and tapped her left thigh, which she sat upon. She tapped it two, three times, and got nothing. She tapped it harder, which prompted Julie to only scratch at thigh, as if grass had merely imitated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't usually get angry or frustrated, but she always had a short fuse when it came to Julie. She huffed and then kicked Julie as hard as she could above her ankle. It probably didn't hurt very much - if at all - but it was all Nicole could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Julie didn't turn to look to see what happened. Almost as if by instinct, Julie instead reached her hand down to where Nicole kicked her, as if to rub it again. Nicole was surprised when Julie's gargantuan hand instead swatted at her, catching her in the stomach and sending her tumbling a few inches away with a thud. She had been winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't feel like a bug,\" Julie suddenly said. \"I wonder if that was, like, a rabbit or a mouse or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and turned, walking over to see what she had just smacked. To Nicole, it was like watching a tall building walk towards her, and felt rushed and trapped when the giant woman crouched down to get a closer look. She spread her legs out around the tiny Nicole as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she said, lifting her hand up to her mouth. \"Nicole? You look like a little doll or something! How did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't kn-\" Nicole began, but was cut off as Julie snatched her up with great force and swiftness. Her fingers squeezed her - too tightly - around her midsection. Julie giggled, pleased at her find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! This. Is so. Cool! I'm so glad you came to see me. I didn't mean to swat you away like that, but I won't do it again,\" she said, fawning over the tiny woman. Julie began petting her, playing with her hair and her limbs. \"I was going to garden this morning, but now that you're here, I think it can wait\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was about to ask her for help again, when she found herself cut off once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh wait! Maybe you can help me with my gardening. You could be like a little gnome! Or a garden fairy! I'll have to get you a costume!\" she gushed. \"Okay, now hold this pose,\" Julie said as she began to bend and contort the tiny woman's body. Satisfied, she set Nicole down next to some flowers she had planted the week before. \"Perfect!\" she beamed, and reached for her phone to take a picture. She took a few. \"And when Christmas comes, you can be a part of my nativity diorama! That would be so cute!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie. I can't be a garden gnome. Or fairy, or be in a Christmas nativity. I'm not a decoration\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right. What if someone or an animal tried to take you? Or if you tried to get away? That would be awful,\" Julie said, grabbing Nicole roughly once more. \"I guess I'll just have to keep you inside, then. But don't worry, we'll have lots of fun. I can do your makeup, and give you a haircut and a makeover, too. And then on Monday you can sit on my desk at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep me inside? I'm not your plaything. I need he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not. But you are mine now. I'm going to take good care of you though, don't worry!\" she said. With that, she took the squirming Nicole inside her house and shut the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole squirmed and kicked in Julia's hand, who seemed completely unaware that the tiny woman didn't want to be in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what would be adorable?\" Julia asked, nonchalantly. \"If I made you into a little trophy! You know, like the ones they make for athletes. I could spray you up with gold and pose you on top! Wouldn't that be cool?\" she asked. \"Well, maybe it wouldn't. You'd get all sticky and then I'd have to scrub all of that paint off of you. That would be a pain for sure!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was mortified. \"You can't just cover me in paint like that! I'd probably suffocate from the fumes alone!\" she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm sure it would be fine. Besides, we're not doing that right now anyways, so don't worry about it too much\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the couch, one hand on her chin, the other wrapped around Nicole, thinking about what to do with the tiny woman. Occasionally, she would toy with Nicole, passing her between her hands, or tossing her up in the air, or toying with her tiny legs, all while Nicole thrashed and squealed with displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I definitely don't want to put you outside anywhere...\" Julia said, aloud. \"Aha!\" she said, snapping her fingers. \"I know just where to put you!\" She shot up off of the couch and ran towards the back of her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her bedroom and held the tiny Nicole up in front of a bookshelf. On top of it was an old teddy bear, a snowglobe that said \"Flughafen Frankfurt am Main\", a Statue of the Eiffel Tower that must have been nearly three times as tall as Nicole, and a figurine, about Nicole's size, of the David statue. \"They're my knick-knacks from my travels. Well, and my old Teddy Bear, because he's special. You can stay up here with them!\" Julie said enthusiastically. She set Nicole down next to the David figurine roughly, causing her to stumble and topple onto the shelf. Standing back up, Nicole turned towards Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to stay up here! I'm not some knick-knack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're not some knick-knack. You're special, because you're alive! That means you can talk and sing and dance for me whenever I want you to!\" She said, squealing with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Julia exclaimed, overcome with excitement. \"I know JUST what to do with you. Stay there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia leaned in and kissed Nicole on the head, pushing her off-balance, and then turned to leave the room. \"I'll be right back!\" She shut the door as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked desperately for a way to get off of the shelf, but there was none. Eventually, she got bored, and sat down, laying against the towering Teddy Bear. She was about to doze off when Julie burst back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii Nicole! Guess what I bought you?\" she asked, gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, startled. She didn't really want to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie rummaged around in a plastic bag and brought out a little plastic package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those look like doll clothes\" Nicole said, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are! It's a ballerina outfit. Do you know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Nicole said, preparing for the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're going to be my little ballerina!\" Julie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, for the last time, I'm not a doll. Now, if yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doll?\" Julie asked. \"No, you're definitely not a doll. I'm making you into a little ballerina for my new music box!\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's heart dropped. \"M-music box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm! I'll show you after we get you changed!\" Julie said. She grabbed Nicole in a tight grip and carried the little toy woman over to her bed, laying down on it. \"Now, don't worry, I'll be gentle with you, like always\" she said as she began to pull on the tiny woman's clothing. Off came the sweater first, and then the shoes and capris Nicole wore. Nicole attempted to protest, but Julie's hands were forceful as they undressed her, able to overpower her easily. Julie suddenly set Nicole down. \"Unbutton your shirt, I don't want to break the little buttons\" she ordered, folding Nicole's now-discarded clothing neatly. When Nicole finished, she took the shirt, folded it up, and then set all of the little clothes into her nightstand drawer. Nicole was just in her undergarments, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, for the fun part,\" Julie said, smiling. She picked up the tiny woman again and forced her into the ballerina outfit. It didn't fit Nicole properly, as it was intended for a doll roughly her height but with somehow even thinner proportions, making the outfit constrictive and restrictive. The tights and flats, thankfully, weren't too terrible to bear, but the frills of the tutu and the tight top felt more like a corset than something designed for comfort. Nicole was then flipped over and laid flat against Julie's bed, ace down, as she undid her ponytail and wound it tightly into a tight knot. \"Don't you just look perfect! We're almost done\" Julie said, turning her tiny toy around to face her. She sat up and grabbed a few things off of her nightstand before crouching down over Nicole again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's left?\" Nicole asked, laying flat on her back. She was so sore from being handled so roughly by Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your makeup, duh!\" Nicole let out a sigh and shut her eyes as Julie prepared a bright stick of lipstick and lowered it towards Nicole's waiting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Julie finished dressing up Nicole, she had to wipe her toy's face off several times. The lipstick was too wide the first time, and covered half of her lower face in red, so she kept trying and trying before lathering some on a thin brush and applying it that way. As for the rest of the makeup, it was quite heavily applied - Julie colored Nicole's cheeks in bright pink, and heavily applied white foundation to the rest of her face. To top it all off, she tried to paint eyeshadow on, but it was sloppily done and heavily applied, making her look like a caricature of a ballerina. Many pictures were taken of the Ballerina Nicole doll that Julie had made, some posed and some informal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, for the box\" she said. She went over to her bookshelf and removed a few books from the top shelf, depositing Nicole on the now-empty shelf. She left the room and came back with a big wooden box - big enough for Nicole to fit into, and to have some wiggle room, but not huge. She set it on the shelf next to Nicole and opened the top, placing Nicole in the center on a red velvet circle meant to imitate a stage. \"I had to find one at the antique store that was missing the original figurine, but you'll do nicely!\" she exclaimed. Her eager hands reached in to the box and posed Nicole in a pose, her arms raised, with one knee bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now you fit right in with the rest of the knick knacks\" Julie said. With that, she slowly shut the box on top of Nicole, leaving her standing in the cramped darkness. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole kept walking and walking and walking and walking, and walking. She was getting very, very tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't made for this kind of exertion\" she said as she walked. She wanted to stop and sit down for a while, because she still had not come across anybody, but didn't want to stop unless there was a tree or some shade she could sit under. Unfortunately, her neighborhood didn't have many trees in it. There were a few over by the library, though. The library wasn't a super far walk from her house normally, but, at only six inches tall, it was like walking to another city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing stopping, she continued on in that direction anyways. She only had to cross the road twice to keep moving - and while the first time was frightening, the second time was much easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she could see the little library. It opposite the corner of a couple of houses and near the community center. It was still so far away though, and, after crossing the crosswalk in her way, Nicole decided she needed a rest. Her tiny body just couldn't keep going. Nicole had, thankfully, packed a thermos of water before leaving her house for the day, so she wasn't at risk of getting dehydrated, but her legs ached. \"At least they'll be toned after all of this walking\" she thought to herself. She trudged over towards the tree nearest the corner and fell face-first into the grass, her arms laying at her sides. She found herself sleeping in short order, exhausted from the ordeal. She was, as she had planned, in the shade, and the grass was cool enough to be comfortable. She would try to get help in a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Bridget Kagen, the community's librarian, walked towards the library. It always opened late on Saturdays, but fewer and fewer people were using it these days. She would probably spend her morning doing clerical work and taking care of her other duties, and then be bored for the rest of the day until she went home. She usually spent her afternoons dreaming up ways to try to get more people in the community back into the library, or reading a book. She spent her free time at home, usually meticulously caring for her things or decorating her house. She collected old and rare books personally, and had a growing collection of unique spoons and stamps from different countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed something colorful in the grass - a bright patch of blue. She hoped it was not a bird, fallen from a tree. She jogged over to it and saw nothing but a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, picking it up. \"A pretty little doll. Someone must have dropped you last night on their way out of the library.\" There were sometimes kids who brought toys with them, and they tend to lose things. \"I guess you can come with me for now. Maybe someone will come back looking for you,\" she said. She couldn't tell what brand the doll was - it was too small to be a Barbie doll, and too realistically proportioned to be one of the other dolls on the market. \"Must be a collector's item or something. Who would spend so much money on a nice doll like this for a careless kid?\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stroked the doll's hair, smoothing it, and then walked on in to the library. Going to the information desk in the center, she set the doll down in one of the shelves, next to her cell phone and other belongings. Bridget decided that she'd keep the doll here for a few days to see if anybody claimed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget went about putting away some of the returned books (of which there were very few) and then returned to the desk to work on some spreadsheets she had to finish for the end of the month, deciding on which books to purchase and which to donate. She hated doing this part, and, seeing as how she could put it off for a little while, reached down for her cell phone. Her hand hovered for a moment, and then instead grabbed the doll again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised nobody has come back looking for you,\" she said, toying with the doll in her hands. Bridget liked the way that the doll's legs bent at the knee, and how there didn't seem to be any visible joints. \"You certainly are unique...\" she said. She began to covet the doll - she'd never collected them before, but this doll would be a great center piece for a collection. She could get her a stand and everything. \"And you are pretty. Although, I think I would apply a layer of makeup or paint to really doll you up,\" she said, running a finger across the doll's face. Glancing at the clock, she decided to return to her work, but kept the doll placed upon her lap, resting in her purple skirt. The more she looked at it, the more she decided she would love to start collecting dolls - especially this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went by quickly for the rest of the day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>2:30 pm. 2:35 pm. 2:40 pm. It was almost time to go home. Bridget was excited - she decided to keep the doll. If any kid was careless enough to lose a doll as intricate - and expensive - as this one, then, as far as she was concerned, the doll shouldn't be theirs. She was just glad it hadn't rained all night - the doll could have been damaged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had, for the past twenty minutes or so, tried to search online for the brand of this mysterious doll. She couldn't find any websites that made custom dolls that were as intricate or realistic as this one, especially not in this area of the United States. She tried the google image search, she tried etsy, and she even trolled some forums for a short while trying to find anything that resembled her new possession. Nothing. This meant that she would have to come up with a name for the doll, of course, but it meant that finding more clothes for her would be difficult as well. Not only were they meticulously embroidered, they fit the doll perfectly. She decided she would text her seamstress friend, later. Maybe she would make some new clothes. Bridget decided that she would pay whatever her friend asked for just for some clothes that fit her new darling doll properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:45 pm. Bridget struggled to think of a name for her new doll. She wanted to give her new doll a proper flowery name, like Marguerite. The doll didn't look like a Marguerite though, she decided, as she laid the doll flat against her desk and hovered over her protectively. Marigold wouldn't work, either. Delphine sounded kind of nice, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:55 pm. The name would have to wait until she got home. Bridget had almost settled on Delphine as she began to pack her things into her satchel. She gingerly picked up her new doll, tentatively named Delphine, and secured her in the backpack. Closing it, she set the backpack on her chair as she logged off of her computer and walked over to the front door to put the \"Closed\" sign up. Walking back over to the information desk, she turned off the lights in the library and reached over for her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back as something moved in the bag. She could hear something muffled inside of it. It almost sounded like squeaking, or chirping. A mouse, perhaps? She hoped it wasn't damaging her new doll. She hurried over to it and tore the bag open, leaning in to examine her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another massive step back as the tiny doll looked up at her and shrieked. She almost screamed too, but her initial fear was overcome by curiosity, and then by her avarice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... not a doll at all\" Bridget said as she leaned over the open bag. She reached in and, less gingerly this time, wrapped one slender hand around the tiny woman. \"But you are definitely unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for taking me inside! I must have fallen asleep on the grass from exhaustion. Please, help me!\" Nicole pleaded with the gigantic librarian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget began re-examining her new doll, feeling her react to her probing hands and to her sudden movements. A small smile formed on her face. \"What a lovely little surprise you are. I'm going to enjoy having you\" she said, stroking Nicole's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having me?\" Nicole asked, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, I'm a collector. I like to collect unique things. Like books! And you've inspired me to collect dolls, and you are the most unique doll I've ever seen\" Bridget said as she fawned over the tiny woman. She was a pretty little thing, and she would look even better once Bridget had dolled her up even more. \"Back in the bag you go. We'll play later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget put Nicole back into the bag once more, zipping it shut. She paused for a minute, straining her ears. While muffled sounds could be heard, they would be undetectable if she walked by passerby's quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her bag and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home...</span></div></div>",

For the most part, everyone\u2019s wish can only be something that affects them personally, and even then, not by very much. If you make a wish that cannot be granted, your wish will be\u2026 re-interpreted. So it\u2019s very important you get it right the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people wish for things like being more attractive, or for some sort of natural talent or ability, or even to change their species or perform minor magical spells. One young wolf boy living in the vastness of suburbia, on the other hand, wished for something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dWhy\u2026?\u201d</i> His girlfriend wept, a week\u2019s worth of emotion coming out in a single moment. <i>\u201dI just don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, his family, and his friends, have been planning this for years. When the time came, he was going to wish for a boosted natural talent in writing, as his dream was to one day become an author. When the day finally came, everyone he knew was baffled and horrified when he instead returned home\u2026 at a height of around 6 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fallout that followed was unbearable. Not only has he wasted his only wish, but he\u2019s actively handicapped himself. At this height, he was going to be in constant danger, and have to rely on other people\u2019s help just to survive. His lifespan was probably drastically reduced. Everyone thought he had gone mad - that he had decided to ruin his own life for no reason whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his girlfriend\u2019s reaction, however, hurt him the most. Instead of freaking out like everyone else, she did her best to try and understand and support him\u2026 but the arctic fox couldn\u2019t keep her emotions bottled up forever. <b>\u201dI-it\u2019s going to be okay, Val\u2026\u201d</b> He steps forward, gesturing up to her, not able to stand seeing her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dNo it\u2019s NOT!\u201d</i> She snapped at him through bitter tears. <i>\u201dYou can\u2019t LIVE like this! You can\u2019t write anymore. You can\u2019t go anywhere by yourself. Hell, how long before somebody accidentally steps on you?\u201d</i> Val shuddered at the very thought of losing him. <i>\u201dI just\u2026 I need to know why. Why would you do this? Why use your wish to\u2026 shrink yourself?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris gazes down at his paws with a sigh. The truth\u2026 well, it was something he was planning on never telling anybody, even at the cost of seeming like a complete lunatic to everyone he knows. But he couldn\u2019t stand to lie to Val. Not anymore. <b>\u201dI\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</b> He finally confesses, through gritted teeth. <b>\u201dI didn\u2019t wish for this.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, confused. <i>\u201dWhat?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201dI didn\u2019t wish to be shrunken down! Well\u2026 not exactly\u2026\u201d</b> He sighs. <b>\u201dI just wished I could\u2026 disappear.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened. <i>\u201dW-what do you mean?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. His entire body was shaking so much with anxiety, he could hardly stand. He had a seat on the table he was standing on, trying to calm himself. <b>\u201dI\u2026 I just hated myself\u2026\u201d</b> He confessed, is voice shaky. <b>\u201dI hated\u2026 existing. Being\u2026 who I am. I couldn\u2019t stand being ME anymore. But I didn\u2019t want to die, either. So\u2026 I wish to sort of\u2026 stop being me. Be something unnoticeable, like a fly on the wall. Y\u2019know, something that watched reality, but does not participate. I guess my wish sort of got\u2026 reinterpreted.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately winds down. After all the confusion she\u2019s felt over the past week\u2026 she finally understands. Sadness fills her as cognisance flashes in her eyes. <i>\u201dChris\u2026\u201d</i> Her lip quivers. She holds out her hands, her palms cupped together, and he hesitantly climbed up onto them. She gently lifted him up in the air, before lying down on her bed, cuddling him close to her. <i>\u201dOh, Chris\u2026 why didn\u2019t you tell me\u2026?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201dI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</b> He stuttered, before sighing. <b>\u201dI\u2026 should\u2019ve let you know\u2026\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, wiping the tears from her cheeks. <i>\u201dI don\u2019t know what made you\u2026 hate yourself, but\u2026\u201d</i> She tried to come up with the words. <i>\u201dI\u2019m not giving up on you! I don\u2019t care what it takes. We\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re still going to make this work\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they drifted off to sleep together, their futures uncertain...</span></div></div>",
