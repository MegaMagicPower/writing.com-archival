The foot lifted and you got to glance at your unaware tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue hair, smooth skin and a grossed out facial expression,<br>\r\n\"Eww- who would just leave gum around?\" The girl whined.

EXPLOSION!\" Losing her energy she fell to the ground exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a muffled enchant outside of your prison, then a far explosion muffled too, but then a big motion, an impact was a terrible experience what happened?, the explosion hit Megumin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry I forgot to say to you little buddy, every time I cast an explosion spell, I deploy all my energy, so we are stuck here until someone comes or until some energy come back to me.\" Megumin said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This just great.</i> You thought to yourself, you started to think about escape from this girl this just isn't going anywhere and at this rate you probably wouldn't get back to your size never.</span></div></div>",

So she left what she assumed was a pebble there for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great a pebble get into my boot, since I dint find a hard enough quest I think I will go to the market and buy some supplies, and with my little pebble buddy this walk gonna be a bliss.</i> Darkness though to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in her boot, on the other hand, you were in heaven, actually no, if you were darkness you might enjoy it but it is not the case, so you were in hell, the heat, the sweat of her foot drenching on you, the constant motion, the toes squeezing and curling on you, they even pass you between each toe space. So you got the full tour after a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Darkness decided ti sit for while after buy some supplies. She sat under a tree near the mansion she lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to check what actually fell in her boot, she took off her boot and shook its contents in her hand, she yelp in surprise when she saw a tiny human form in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you ?, and why were you in my boot.? Darkness asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I'm (your name) and I was trying to get your attention in the guild when I fell into your boot, and... Hello miss? are hearing me miss.? you noticed that she get lost in thought while you where explaining what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm? Oh yes, yes I am sorry a noble knight is always at the service of the weak. Darkness said not very convincingly. What thinking actually was. <i>He felt great under my foot, and he is so cute I want to keep him. I wonder if I can just drop him back in my boot and just continue adventuring. \u00a1No myself\u00a1 I shouldn't think like that he is weak tiny who need's help. Wha? what he said? damn I wasn't paying attention but now that I think about it he was the one who got into my boot, maybe he liked it too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well em, what did you say your name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your name)\" You said again not very impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right well what can I do for you?\" Darkness asked focused this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I shrunk mysteriously and I need help to get back to my normal size\" you said letting out the resurrection thing for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm I will see what I can do for you, for now we should get back to my home is near don't worry so I will drop you back in my boot and we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute there in your boot you said? why you wanna drop me back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well because I don't have any pockets, and I need to carry some supplies I just bought\" Darkness said a little surprised because she was sure that he would like the idea.

Sure you could use your new amazing abilities to help fight the demon king but why do that when there were cute girls to go after. Surely you wouldn't have been given such a perfect gift if this was not what it's intended use was. What was the worst that could happen right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The first place to look was naturally going to be the tavern at the guild, that's where all the action seemed to happen after all. You slinked in and took a seat towards the back as you stared at the wide array of different women that came and went from the building. There were plenty of options but one particular group was your primary target. The group of no good heroes that had come together not to long ago. Sure they had shown themselves to be competent when they saved the city but the vast array of things that they haven't done both for themselves and the city spoke to their ineffectiveness. So why this particular group then. Well cause they were hot of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You had a choice of either the load and admittedly obnoxious blue haired and self proclaimed goddess, a \"prize\" whose panties existence had been a topic of debate more times than once. The strange to be sure crusader whose love for pain and cup size have also been a topic of discussion with several of the people you've met. And finally the most normal of the group, not that that meant much, the crimson demon who waved an explosive stave around like it wasn't a tool to cause mass destruction. She was pretty and sane, what more did you really need right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now it just became a matter of how you would get yourself into position. You had spent some time practicing and you had pretty effectively narrowed down a way to, at the very least, get her to take you with her to her home. Anything after that would be much simpler. The first, and likely one of the more difficult options, would be to transform into her staff after getting it away from her but that may be easier said than done. Another would be to splash some sort of beverage on her and try to pat her dry, touching her bra in the process and transforming when she went to change. And the final was wait for her to try and air out her boots after they got settled down and make a quick switch when you had the opportunity. After that it was as easy as letting her take you right back to her room where you could have free range to look at or be anything you liked. The only question was how to take that first step.</span></div></div>",

Naturally the best way to sneak into her home with her would be to be the thing she has on her at all times, I mean aside from clothing. So the perfect plan was put into action devised with pure intellect and skill. And of course by that you meant waiting for her to pop them off her feet, wait for her comrades to get drunk on ale and sneak your way under the table and make your move. Fullproof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was just what you did, it didn't take long for the blue haired goddess to spend away a small fortune on alcohol and completely give herself away to it. The other two were not far behind and soon the two had a small crowd around them celebrating a whole lot of nothing. And then your moment arrived, either due to the heat of the moment or the literal heat of being around that many drunks the crimson demon Megumin tugged and removed the two boots before letting them drop under the table. Now came the hard part. With the grace of a swan you stood up and walked by the small crowd before \"tripping\" and sliding beneath the table. It was slightly hard dodging the many legs now occupying the space but as soon as you touched the crimson demons boots you tossed them aside and used you gift to take their place. Now all you would have to do is wait a bit and your in into the mansion of cities was a sure fire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than you expected for the girl to return to her boots but eventually she decided they must have aired out enough. You waited excitedly as you felt yourself shuffle around and then watched as a black stockinged foot came into view over one of your eyes and a pair of hands gripped the openings to one of your boot bodies. It was finally your time! And as the foot slowly slipped into the opening one thing became clear. This was a mistake. A huge mistake. The scent that wafted from the stocking was in itself awful. As soon as the foot landed on the insole you could taste the salty sweat trapped within a piece of clothing that had been stuck to her leg for a whole day of adventuring. The taste of her sweat filled your whole mouth and the scent seemed to consume you. And as if that wasn't enough you had to watch in horror as her other bandage wrapped foot slowly slipped into the other half of your body now sealing you in darkness along with the stench and taste of her feet consuming you. Finally the pressure of her standing up only succeeded in squeezing the sweat from the cloth into your body even more. This was a bad idea, a very very bad idea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Part of her wished that she could join in on the drinking and the fun that her fellow party members took part in so frequently. Then she remembered the way Aqua would make an absolute fool of herself and she was glad she never tried more than once or twice. One thing that she was not thankful for, however, was the much to long walk back to the mansion. Her feet were already sweltering from a day of running around looking for the perfect target for a fiery cleansing and the fact she wore these tight boots were not helping. Sure she had given them a breath of fresh air at the tavern but even walking for such a short time had quickly caused them to begin emitting waves of heat into their tiny confines once more. All she had to do was get back home and she could finally take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You were in hell. Somewhat ironic considering the reason for this was a demon with bright red eyes but for some reason the irony wasn't very funny at this moment in time. No right now you were much to busy trying not to vomit the contents of your nonexistent stomach from your nonexistent mouth from the stench and taste of death coming from the small girls feet. It was amazing that something that appeared so dainty and cute was able to completely destroy two of your five senses, three if you counted the total darkness they left you in, so easily with nothing more than a little pressure and a wiggle every now and again. God those wiggling toes, all they succeeded in doing was slide around or grind in the slick sweat that oozed from them almost endlessly. Every step pressed you into her foot causing a new gushing of the salty liquid to absorb into your body. If you could just undo your transformation and leave the girl without boots you would in a second but the cooldown and lack of space prevented that. You had no options but just endure her smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Eventually she finally did arrive home with a loud sigh before retiring to her gothic looking room. She popped you off of her feet which did little to remedy the horrible sweat stench she had left you with but did somewhat remedy the horrible sweltering heat. Still it wasn't much of a benefit considering your body had been so firmly saturated in the sticky salty sweat of the crimson demons feet.You could hear the sounds of her changing, pulling the tainted clothing from her body before she left the room. You could only hope it was to take a shower. Still after nearly an hour of being a boot and now finally free from her sweltering feet you could become something else and get away from those stink machines. And on top of that no one was in the home, you could become anything for any of the cuties. But what to choose. </span></div></div>",

He barely had time to say anything witty before the blanket of musk hit him. <br>\r\n\"G-god- that smell- A-Aqqqaaaa!\" He whimpered, before the horrid smelling thing landed ontop of him. He felt Aqua's finger tip narrow in on his location as his mind was scrambled from the stench of the rag- some strange liquid started to seep out, further obliterating his thoughts as she scrubbed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twitched as the rag lifted away, taking him with it as he struggled to even move. He barely managed to turn his head after being plopped down on the table, just in time to see Aqua leave. He slowly closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke to chatter, groaning slightly as he opened his eyes again. He lay still as he slowly arched his head around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Yunyun talking to someone out of his sight. The smelly wall of cloth blocking his vision. Kazuma tried to move, but the surface of the rag seemed to pin him down. He sighed, looking blankly forward before his world suddenly lifted upwards. His eyes met Darkness's as she scanned the rag.<br>\r\n\"Weird, how did it get all the way over here?\" Darkness boomed overhead, as Kazuma attempted to get her attention. The tiny micro shuddered as Darkness's mouth came uncomfortably close, making it clear how easy Darkness could eat him without noticing. Sniffing sounds came from high above before the mouth formed a frown, backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kazuma realised he should start yelling again, the masochists lips distracting him. Yet as he tried, she deafened him out again.<br>\r\n\"It'll have to do, I need to wash some more sweat rags. There's no way I can do the gym without wiping down my chest- it just- builds up a bit too much\" Darkness blushed, stopping Kazuma from yelling again for a moment as his eyes glanced down towards her chest. \"Sopping wet with sweat, unable to mop it down as it slowly makes my shirt transparent- what if someone see's and it opens the gates of a beast-\" Darkness panted, wiggling happily at the thought for a moment before smiling, \"Then finally, I need to use my sweat rag to mop up my cleavage, then those beasts doors will burst open wider- causing them to- ah-\" Darkness flushed red, wagging happily as she drooled.<br>\r\n\"D-do you really think guys do that?\" Yunyun looked nervous,<br>\r\n\"O-of course! It's only natural- but I'll be your shield from them if anything happens-\" Darkness cleared her throat. \"B-besides, nothings ever actually happened to me during my workouts\" She spoke so reassuringly, but with a far more monotone voice, laced with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kazuma's gate was half open as he watched Darkness's chest wag infront of him.<br>\r\n\"Oho... it wouldn't be my fault if I ended up there-\" He hugged himself while playing out the scene \"No Darkness, that stupid Aqua stuck me here- I didn't mean to! Ah- wait- maybe not- how about 'I had no choice! I know it's highly unlikely but I wound up directly in your cleavage!' No... perhaps... I should just enjoy myself then never mention this part to anyone\" Kazuma nodded a couple of times as the rag shifted again- her powerful grip reminding him of the dangers of his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, he finally started to feel his restraints come undone. He'd need to grab on to stay on.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't currently in any debt and Kazuma had even lent her a decent amount for her week alone, she could totally buy some top tier booze with this much, but as she dreamed about what her week would be like she noticed Megumin staring at her from out of a side door. When Aqua looked at her she waved for her to come into the room, and confused Aqua wandered in wondering what the younger girl could want from her. What she found though was the crimson demon holding a weird paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhh, What are you doing in here Megumin\" She was immediately suspicious since anything Megumin was doing probably had something to do with explosions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a magic item that's supposed to increase my mana but after I bought it the instructions said I need a partner to use it. Since nobody else has a lot of magic you're the only one that can help me! Please great Aqua!\" Aqua of course could not just say no when someone inflated her ego like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's got to be me nobody else will do, Hahaha! uh, what do I need to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin took out a brush with some paint on it. \"You just let me draw a the circle on your palm with the magic paint and then it links up with the one i drew on me and then we both touch the paper\" Megumin explained as she took aqua's hand and drew a relatively simple shape on it. Then she put the paper on the ground and had Aqua touch it with the symbol and then Megumin put her foot on the paper, which Aqua only then noticed wasn't covered in the usual bandages. There was a brief flash and then Aqua was confused as she was now standing with her hand touching a wall of flesh that faintly smelled bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EW! What is this thing\" She tried to pull her hand off but found it was stuck. \"What's going on! Help, Megumin! KAZUMA!\" She felt the wall drag her forward a little as it shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHHH! Aqua, don't freak out so bad. I don't know what went wrong but it kinda feels like it worked? I can feel a lot of mana flowing in.\" Aqua looked up to see Megumin's Giant face looking down at her, that means that the thing she was stuck to.. She looked to the side to see some wiggling digits and started to immediately freak out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I small! Undo it! HELP! KA-\" She was silanced this time by the giant foot turning over on her and pinning her to the ground filling all the available space with foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't tell Kazuma! He'll totally never buy me anything again if I messed this up bad.\" The water goddess really couldn't care less about that she was just concerned with fixing it but she couldn't scream although her muffled cries were still quite loud. Megumin didn't let her up until she stopped shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Aqua I'll fix everything, I just have to read the instructions again.\" She pulled out a little paper booklet while Aqua continued trying to yank herself off of the foot. Unfortunately for the little goddess though a knock on the door spooked Megumin who jumped to her feet as the door opened obliterating her under the crimson demon's foot. Although she didn't break she just kind of flattened out, the ball of the other girls foot pressing her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long! Get your shoes on we are gonna be late for the carriage.\" That was Kazuma, she couldn't stall for much longer...</span></div></div>",

With limited time to figure out what to do she silently apologized to the small arch priest and wrapped her signature bandages over aqua and the rest of her leg pressing her into place against the younger girls foot. Aqua tried everything within her power to get out of the situation but pinned as she was with her mouth wide open from screaming and she couldn't even bite the offending foot. things only got worse when Megumin put her boots on trapping Aqua in with the lingering smell of hundreds of uses. Even the change from sitting to standing was a ridiculous amount of pressure on her smashed form with the ball of the foot right on her head the slightest move pressed her down giving her a headache and scraping her tongue along just a little bit farther. In the short time it took Megumin to walk from her room to the carrage Aqua felt the sweat building up and being drawn strait to her! As a water goddess her plea for help was drawing in all the moisture from the humid shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndroplets formed and slipped under her flattened body to give just enough room while she wasn't being stomped for her to accidentally drink the droplet before the foot fell again and squeezed her back into a sticker just a little more spread out and a little thinner. With Megumin now sitting in the cart, about five minutes had passed but to the foot trapped goddess it felt like at least an hour of trampling, thankfully there was less stomping but the bandages were preventing her from un-flattening. The sweat however was a never ending torrent practically with the flavor of dirty foot only just barely mitigated by her natural purification. Aqua screamed against the foot causing a slight buzzing now that she wasn't flat against it, which tickled Megumin, who, without thinking stomped her foot down to suppress the tingling sensation obliterating Aqua once more with just a simple motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopside Megumin and Darkness sat in the back of the carriage while Kazuma drove, \"What kind of horrible beasts do you think we'll face this time Megumin, Perhaps a dragon with acidic breath, or maybe even a Giant that could [b]stomp[/b] me underfoot. Aren't you excited to try the items Kazuma got us?\" Darkness asked the eye patched crimson demon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin was trying to understand the instructions on her leaflet once more when darkness had started talking, but it spoke in vague euphemisms and didn't seem to explicitly have a counter spell that she could use without using skillpoints on it and all of hers were already invested in more explosion damage the closest she was finding was a 'transfer' rune to move the 'divine source' to enhance different attributes. She looked up startled when Darkness asked her a question directly. \"Oh uh, yeh I'm hoping it works too, although I might need some help eventually if you'd like to see if I can use mine to enhance other stuff if we need.\" Darkness had expected an enthusiastic reply about how she would one shot a dragon with her explosion magic, it seemed something was really bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think so.\" there was an awkward silence for a moment before they heard Kazuma's voice from the front and the carriage stopped prompting both girls to jump out and see what happened. Carelessly once more Megumin destroyed Aqua's form beneath her foot, if she didn't know she was down there already she might not have even felt her. As it turned out the reason they had stopped was because a giant gang of goblins had set up a block on the road. Megumin stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ufufu, let me show you the might of my explosion magic, I'll take them all out in one shot!\" someone mumbled something about only having one shot off to the side but she ignored the jab for now planting her feet she now felt the slight squish of the blue haired girl under her foot. [b]\"Oh powers of the cosmos, and powers of the earth gather from above and below to bestow your power onto me your chosen servant! Grant me the power to smite all who stand before me and grind them under the heel of your almighty strength! EXPLOSION!\"[/b] The force pressed her into the ground as the ball of energy launched from the tip of her staff grinding Aqua slightly more into her foot as a wonderful sensation of mana flowing into her body from the point of contact allowed her to stay standing. Aqua meanwhile felt the sensation of her essence being drained into the soul of the foot pressing down on her, like drain touch but if it was also a giant foot covering her whole body. Megumin stood for a few moments more simply grinding her foot into the ground as if she was trying to squeeze the mana out faster without even realizing what she was doing. When she finally did snap out of it she started jumping for joy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked finally it worked! I even tried to put all my mana into that but i'm still standing! I bet I could fire another one right now.\" She happily chirped unintentionally pounding the source of her new mana pool farther into paste. Aqua was more destroyed by the mana drain than the stomping though, she whimpered wondering what she had done to deserve this.</span></div></div>",

If your friend didn't have high connections you wouldn't even have this option...\" The woman spoke, coughing slightly. \"Admittedly, I've never seen this technique before- let alone to request it for your release... but that's the Dustiness family for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma winced as the woman finished writing the forms- she ushered him to come forward a bit. He edged forward a little as she copied a mark she saw in a book. <br>\r\n\"What is this punishment anyway...?\" Kazuma stated, looking not too worried. The woman coughed, <br>\r\n\"It's an odd request... the girl we spoke to was very happy to of discovered such a spell but it requires so many resources and magic that she simply couldn't get access to. She seemed... too happy to get the chance to test it on someone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma nodded,<br>\r\n\"Ah- was that Darkness?\" He asked, <br>\r\n\"Yes- she sure is a strange one- even put money towards the state doing such a thing... but it is better then execution. We did actually offer your freedom but after explaining a few punishments she started to come up with some very twisted ideas for you.\" the woman looked worried, \"Honestly, a perminant curse like this was probably the nicest one...\" She finished up, stamping Kazuma's head with a talisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma looked a little surprised before everything clicked together, <br>\r\n\"WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! Darkness came up with the punishment?! Are you sure she wasn't asking for it herself?\" He yelled out, the woman looked surprised,<br>\r\n\"I thought that at first but... who would...\" She started, watching Kazuma try to rip off the talisman- but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma came out of the reception looking like death. A mark on his forhead showing his punishment and a document to say he was free.<br>\r\n\"A-ahhh-\" Darkness looked sheepish as she recognised the mark \"I- was wondering why it took so long to get you through- I see they made a mix up...\" She stated, a jealous look on your forhead \"When she said they could do it I kind of expected...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma just glared at her, but it only made Darkness blush at the thought of him doing something drastic. <br>\r\n\"Hey hey! You owe me one\" Aqua cheered, casting her anti curse spell. Her happyness faded slightly as the curse stayed on Kazuma's forhead. \"A-ahhh- that's a strong one... so... what does it do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin cleared her throat, Kazuma suddenly realized she held the release papers. <br>\r\n\"Oy oy! Don't tell her\" Kazuma hissed, rushing over. Startled, Megumin held a hand up, touching his forhead. <br>\r\n\"Frog!\" She announced, his body suddenly vanishing. In his place, lay a bundle of clothes. An angry frog soon hopped out, glaring at Megumin who grinned high above as she continued to read in peace. \"Touching the cursed symbol and saying an object or a small animal will turn him into it. Asking him to fuse with an item will merge the cursed with said item if it's close. Ah-\" Megumin laughed, watching the frog pounce at her leg. \"That's not so bad-!\" the girl above cheered as Aqua scooped up the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, she pinned Kazuma down with a finger before smiling <br>\r\n\"I could use a drink-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little puff, a bottle of liqur appeared in her hand. She drooled, <br>\r\n\"Kaaazuumaaa- this might be the best thing you've done!\" the useless goddess stroked his form, popping open the cap. Kazuma paniced, what would happen if she drank him? Additionally, the symbol for transforming him was on the bottle cap- if they lost that then how would he turn back? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Darkness pulled him back, pressing the cap down and saying 'Kazuma', turning him back.(Much to Aqua's disappointment) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow walk back to the mansion for poor Kazuma as Megumin tried to cheer him up with all the pranks they could do. Darkness was promising she would protect him but her ditzyness seemed unassuring. Aqua however, was mostly just thinking up objects she could use around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce through the door and slipped into bed, Kazuma lay shaking on the bed as his mind raced.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I can turn this around on that idiot Masochist if I can just figure it out maybe spy on them as a washcloth or-\" And just like that Kazuma managed to say something while touching the curse mark, which then transformed him into it. A simple white washcloth with the symbol of transformation on it, well at least he had confirmed that it worked now all he had to do was change back... A few moments pass of Kazuma trying to move and or say something only to realize that he was neither animate or had a mouth with which to speak! This was a horrible flaw in his plan to take control of the curse somehow, and to make matters worse someone was coming into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness felt bad about landing Kazuma with a curse/blessing she had wanted for herself, and she was sure that if she did nothing either Aqua or Megumin would surely abuse the situation and Kazuma would suffer for it. She blushed imagining all the things that could now happen, what it must feel like! but she slapped her face to calm herself down before entering Kazuma's room, even if she might want those things Kazuma probably didn't and she could follow his wishes and protect him! Only, when she walked into the room Kazuma wasn't even in his bed, or at least she thought so at first. It only took her a little while to notice the washcloth on the pillow. \"Kazuma?\" A million thoughts raced through her head, she was sure none of the other girls had gotten there before her so the only person in the room that could have transformed him was himself but if he did it to himself did that mean he wanted to be transformed? He was a washcloth, so the place he should have transformed was the bathroom if he wanted to get used unless... Unless he wanted her to be the one that used him? She had decided to hold off on a bath so she could protect Kazuma, could he have predicted that! Darkness' face went red from thinking of how sweaty and humiliating it would be to be used to clean off someone else's sweat, and how embarrassing it would be to have Kazuma able to stare at her thought the whole bath. She lifted him off the pillow breathing heavily. Would she really do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma meanwhile was very concerned at the state of things, at first when Darkness was the one to find him he was thinking she would free him immediately but it was clear by the state of her that she had some perverted thing going through her head. She was walking into the bathroom too! She was actually going to use him as a washcloth! He was slung over a small bar while Darkness got undressed, red as a beet. As much as he didn't want to be used as an object Darkness did have the type of body he preferred so getting to see her naked was always a treat (unless she was being really weird) \"K-kazuma I-I'm only doing this as a favor b-but after you have to tell me how it felt.\" The ragged breathing over his form told Kazuma there was something he definitely wasn't going to like about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was nice and warm as she daintily dipped him into it and pulled him out but didn't soak herself in the water proper, she intended to give 'maximum experience' with this so rather than simply soaking she was going to use the small washcloth to scrub herself down first. She started with the area that got worked relentlessly and was thus the dirtiest and sweatiest, her feet. Kazuma would have been screaming profanities at her if he could, as it was he was face first with her dirty feet and the sweat soaking into him felt as though he was directly licking them which would have been bad enough if Darkness hadn't decided the way to clean was roughly scrubbing him. She flossed him over the first foot, and between the toes before dipping him back in the water and wringing him out causing a feeling that was, well exactly that, being twisted and squeezed by the physically strongest person he knew. At this point rather than profanity Kazuma had resolved to mentally pleading for the oblivious girl to stop. She could neither hear him nor did she stop, bringing him to the other dirty foot to repeat the actions giving him another dose of her sweat and collected dirt and grime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness paused marveling at how well her feet had been cleaned by even the 'soft' scrubbing she gave them before...</span></div></div>",

The harsh movement anything but gentle as the blonde got lost in her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma was in torment, hoping the rest of her body would be more forgiving. However, the next thing he knew, Darkness had wrapped a towel around herself and slipped out, collapsing on the floor with a flushed red face. The towel boy simply spun around- covering the drain as Darkness spoke, \"It's too much- haaa- I-I can't go through with it. I-I'm sorry-\" She grabbed the poor dirty rag, walking quickly towards her clothes. Blushing, she glanced at the rag before opening the door and tossing him outside \"I'll- just get changed, o-one moment-\" Darkness spoke, oddly still apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Change me back first!\" Kazuma internally yelled \"I don't wanna be labled a pervert for you perverted actions!\" He fumed, trying to ignore the fact that he planned to spy on Darkness using this curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting to be turned back dragged on a bit. He sat, bored in the corridor and smelling of feet as a door opened somewhere. With uninterested eyes, Kazuma watched as Aqua wandered towards him. He gazed, slightly disinterested up her skirt as she stood over him, testing the door.<br>\r\n\"Occupied-\" Darkness called forth. Aqua pouted, shifting her foot onto Kazuma. Once again, he was being abused by a girls foot, <br>\r\n\"Don't get your panties in a twist-! I just want to grab some stuff!\" She called out, stepping off Kazuma and  noticing his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma winced as Aqua stepped off him. Her sweaty toes wiping across his face before she moved- glancing down.<br>\r\n\"Why feet...?\" He asked, suddenly feeling waitless as he was picked up by the stupid goddess. He tried to flail as she smiled down at him, not noticing the symbol on the wasteband as she took him unwillingly inside.<br>\r\n\"Ah- you didn't happen to see.. um- anything in the doorway?\" Darkness blushed,<br>\r\n\"Yup, saw it on the way in\" Aqua beamed, <br>\r\n\"Great- just leave the washcloth where it is for now- it's Kazuma... he...\" Darkness shook her head, flushing red.<br>\r\n\"Noooo! Don't say it like that-! I didn't do anything!\" Kazuma internally cried as Aqua glared at a random washcloth. <br>\r\n\"Grooooss- did you come to see a goddess naked? Haha- hm hm?\" The ditzy Aqua smirked, flicking her skirt as the washcloth while chuckling, she moved over towards Darkness's clothes, dumping Kazuma into the mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor Kazuma could only watch as Aqua picked up the other panties with confusion. The wheels in her head turned as she wondered why there were two, before twisting round. <br>\r\n\"About the thing outside...\" She spoke carefully,<br>\r\n\"Leave it outside\" Darkness responded, harshly and firmly. Noone heard Kazuma screaming curses as Aqua as the goddess shrugged, taking the panties away after grabbing her leftout drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, leaving Darkness and Kazuma alone again as Darkness finished off her wash. Unheard and unable to control his fate, he was soon in the shadow of a naked Darkness.</span></div></div>",

Without her smelly feet in the way Kazuma was free to fully watch her nudity, he even forgot to mentally scream at her to turn him back for a while until her hand wrapped around him. The sweet smell of soap now radiated off of the busty blond, a far cry from the gross feet that he was smeared against earlier. There was a bit of a call back to reality when he was lowered to the floor and the dreaded things passed through his holes. He hadn't even realized that he could sort of move his vision until he had wanted to look up, and he didn't get much of a view before he was pulled tight over her ass and into her pussy. The overwhelming smell though wasn't soap anymore, instead a heavy musk was dominating what Kazuma could smell. Darkness was still very aroused from her imagination from before, and Kazuma couldn't get away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting to being worn was odd, and the thing Kazuma didn't expect or want was how tight he was over her, even the slight amount she bent over to put on her loose pants felt like he was bending a little too far back. He couldn't even cast his gaze up, because the pants covered him now. Darkness took some deep breaths to calm herself down and then walked out to go find Kazuma, but he wasn't there anymore. She was confused for a moment but then she remembered Aqua had come by and assumed that she had changed Kazuma back so she could stop worrying about him for the night. Expecting Darkness to figure out something had happened to him was too much for him to hope, the ditsy crusader simply wandered to her own room to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally something like this might be especially bad but since Darkness was a easy sleeper the Otaku turned panties finally got to focus on how soft and supple The crusader was on her ass and how intoxicating the smell of her arousal was. He was actually able to sleep contented as if he were hugging a body pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuma was woken roughly as Darkness began her normal dayly routine, he was jared awake by the bending feeling and immediately shoved into pitch black as Darkness equipped her normal gear. He tried to shout at Darkness one more time but he still had no way to accomplish that and Darkness still had no idea she was even wearing him.</span></div></div>",

How about turning into Darkness's bra?\" He stated, making Megumins face drop further. <br>\r\n\"Y-your intentions are kinda showing pretty strongly... fine- if you let me turn you into a plush toy then I'll later turn you into some clothes...\" Megumin crossed her fingers behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally he had been joking, but the temptation was pretty great now. <br>\r\n\"...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aqua gazed upwards, a confused squeak bubbled up inside of her as she looked around.<br>\r\n\"Isn't this-\" Aqua furrowed her brow, noticing no sound coming out of her mouth as she spoke. It was Wiz's shop, for sure. \"I KNEW WE COULDN'T TRUST THAT DAMN LI-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rant went unheard as Wiz wandered into the room with a box. The bell to the shop rang out just as Aqua's unheard insults slowly tailed away as she noticed Wiz standing overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiz slammed the heavy box down on the stool with a thud, panting slightly as she turned around. The poor stool seemed to shudder under the boxes weight as Wiz leaned against it.<br>\r\n\"Oh- morning Yunyun\" She beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua meanwhile had no idea what was going on, her body wobbled weakly under the box as she drowned out the talking above with her complaints. However, as soon as the box was removed, Aqua was ready to switch straight back into complain mode- before Wiz's dusty sole hovered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRREAAAAK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stool whined under foot as Wtiz stood tall. Her boots scuffing the poor chair as Yunyun helped pass the box up. Neither knew of Aqua's horrified expression as she felt Wiz essentially use her face like a door mat. Worst of all, it felt like the shoe gunk was getting dumped directly into her mouth. She was at a loss for words, no complaints came out as Wiz stepped down and easily picked her up. It started to slowly click together as she was placed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M A STOOL?\" She screamed out, just as Yunyun took a seat on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no knowledge of the chair being sentient, Wiz winced as Yunyun shifted on the creaky old stool.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, let me get you a cushion\" Wiz offered, but Yunyun waved her off-<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine! Really. Thanks for all the help you've given, I think I can beat Megumin for sure!\" She cheered, wiggling her hips happily as the chair groaned under her. Wiz winced a little, the stool did look uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late during the night after having completed a quest, when Darkness rose from her sleeping bag, detecting a nearby explosion from one of Megumin spells being cast. She glanced over the campfire noticing the little Arch Wizard gone, as both Kazuma and Aqua remained vast asleep. Darkness quickly rose, grasping her sword, and left her party members by the fire to bring their caster back before something terrifying might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megumin,\" Darkness called out, as she forced her way through a thorny bush, she could have taken a much more accessible path, but Darkness face was glowing red from the pleasure of prickling thorns stinging her. The sound of explosions grew heavier and brighter as Darkness grew closer to the action, \"Megumin\" cried out once more, this time with more concern, as she burst through the hedge witnessing her friend lying on the field, as a robed wizard stood on a hill laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the little wizard of the Crimson Demon Clan isn't alone,\" the person spoke, removing their hood to reveal themselves to be Wolbach hiding beneath, \"Splendid! Now I'll add both of you to my collection,\" her yellow eyes glowed as began chanting a spell. She slowly rose into the air, leaving Darkness to run to Megumin's aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt,\" Darkness asked, helping Megumin stand on her feet as they study the Goddess, producing a sinister ball before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin softly smiled, \"I'm okay. My explosive magic has injured me far worse than hers,\" she giggled, before stumbling forward, grabbing her staff to support herself, glimpsing to Darkness, Megumin saw her drooling and panting from the sheer excitement of imaging such pleasuring damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolbach snickered above, \"Now prepare you two for my darkest curse I ever conceived that will leave you both helpless,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness heart raced while her body surfaced in a heavy sweat, \"Leave me helpless?\" it was like a dream come true for her, but she then looked to Megumin, who was scared of what's to come. Darkness smiled and took a running start just as Wolbach cast the spell, hitting her body with all the blunt force that followed behind it. Darkness shrieked with vigorous enjoyment as black lighting surged within her entire body that shocked her very soul, as the ball suddenly began growing smaller and tighter around her body, it sent Darkness into an overdrive of satisfaction before the sphere exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin watched as a momentarily tiny unconscious Darkness began to fall hitting the ground. \"Aww, what a shame, and I seem to have used almost the last of my magic in that attack, but one of you is still better than nothing,\" Wolbach gloated, marching forward to collect her prize. Megumin, in a state of anger and desperation, used all her power left in one final explosive attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolbach quickly teleported away to dodge the attack, as the wind blew Darkness towards Megumin thankfully. \"Irritating brat, Don't think I won't get her,\" Wolback promised before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megumin dropped her staff, \"Darkness! Where are you,\" she called out, searching the rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megumin!\" Darkness fought too say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you Darkness,\" Megumin asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness struggling to speak, \"Below your foot,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin blushed as she lifted her foot that was crushing her tiny friend. She immediately panicked observing Darkness feet flat, but they quickly popped back to normal as she proceeds to picked her up, \"I'm so sorry Darkness,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness face exhausted with redness, not from the battle, but the thrill of being stepped on like a bug from her teammate, \"It's fine, just give me a sec,\" Darkness exclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you! You're tiny and feel boneless,\" Megumin illustrated, seeing Darkness smile and jiggle without fear of the situation, \"Let's get you back to the others,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness snapped out of her daze of humiliation catching Megumin's plan, \"What let's not worry the others just yet? I mean, maybe it'll wear off in a day?\" Darkness blushed slowly, hoping to have the side effect last a bit longer if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darkness!\" Megumin signed, \"I'm at least telling Aqua in the morning. Now, where am I even going to hide you from Kazuma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness blushed, glancing towards her teammate's legs, \"I know one place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumin gasped, \"No! I'm not keeping you in there!\" but Darkness begging wore Megumin down. \"Just don't move so much around, alright.\" Megumin blushed snapping Darkness inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness couldn't believe what was happing being shrunken was utterly humiliating, and it made her heart race. She couldn't wait to have some more coming the next morning. When suddenly she felt weird, and the tingling running through her body returned as she passed out, Meguminn had made her way into her sleeping bag were..</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Gods blessing on this wonderful world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to the Konosuba Shrunk and Transformed Interactive, I haven't seen one dedicated to it out there but the characters really are too great to be hidden away in a generic Anime Interactive (and also it's not there I checked).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a list of the characters, also feel free to use the succubus cause they exist but these are the main characters <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_KonoSuba_characters\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_KonoSuba_characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAIN CHARACTER CANT DIE, at least not in the first couple of chapters, when crushed they just flatten out or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Few Small Rules! <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">That I ripped right from Teniko's RWBY interactive thanks Teniko I basically agree with your rules anyhow and it's faster to do this than try and think of every little thing</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just for writers, I don't want to put anyone off buuuuut there are a few things I want to keep out of the story-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The main character can't die unless specified in the starting text. The default as a whole- flatten out and stretch- kind of thing. Vore deaths are an exception-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. OC's- I don't want a tiny OC running in to save the day- try and stick with the main cast as much as possible, perhaps throwing in a random student here and there without going into it too much. This includes naming the nameless main character in the stories where you play yourself (Sorry if you wished to be female in these chapters, it's not possible to make a 100% blank canvas character)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I won't allow diapers- it's just not my cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Transformations are object based only! Sorry if you came here for Age regression or something like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Toilet stuff, fart and such, are allowed but only if you add a bold T to the title of the chapter. Not everyone likes that stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Try and keep it fairly close to cannon at the start of stories/ try and keep shippings subtle. I've allowed a few arks to go up with this before I made the rule as the contents pretty good but I don't want a shipping war spread across the interactive ^_^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No unbirthing- insertions fine, going into the womb is fine, but turning into a baby is classed as age regression to me :P<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Finally- small chapters or chapters that I feel aren't good enough shall be deleted if I think it doesn't fit. I'll also block off chapters if I think it's going to go into a constant stream of 'How about this character?' with a bunch of empty chapters in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope the rules don't put you off! Any questions and such, please don't hesitate to message me :P</td>",
