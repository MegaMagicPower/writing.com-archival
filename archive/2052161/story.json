            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jin Kazama once again began beating the bag that hung from the dojo\u2019s ceiling, trying to see if he could improve his punches once again. Even though the bag couldn\u2019t fight back, it was a very sturdy and intimidating thing, perfect for building one\u2019s strength. And besides, if Jin ever needed anyone to fight, Heichachi Mishima, his grandfather was always there to fulfill that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Japanese fighter punched fast and hard, sweat glistening on his skin, he once again reaffirmed the reason as to why he was undergoing such brutal training. His mother, Jun Kazama, was killed at the hands of Ogre. Jin, being the type of man he was, wouldn\u2019t let that monster get away with such a heinous act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ogre was extraordinarily powerful. Only the best fighters around could hope to take him on and survive. Thus, Heichachi agreed to train Jin and make him a superb fighter, one who could attain similar skill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the thoughts going through Jin\u2019s mind as he got down and began doing crunches, beating down any small thoughts of uncertainty that popped into his mind. He wasn\u2019t going to let anything get in his way. As his hard back collided with the even harder polished wooden floor, the brunette focused all his attention on working out and victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a certain scent made its way into the dojo, catching Jin\u2019s attention. It was amazing, containing a mixture of various delectable spices and sauces. Taking a break from the crunches, the fighter made his way over to the window, where the sight of a hot dog stand on the sidewalk met his eyes. Peculiar, since mobile stands like that tended to avoid the area he was currently in; the only explanation was that the vender was feeling adventurous and decided to travel to a new area of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jin heard and felt his stomach rumble. Sighing, Jin realized he hadn\u2019t eaten since that morning, and it was already well past noon. He could eat one of the delicious-smelling hot dogs, or continue training.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
