Some say the Goddesses made it, to better understand their creation; others blame a mad wizard. Wherever it came from, though, its powers are clear- its wielder has the ability to exchange the attributes- whether physical, mental, or otherwise- of any two beings, merely by willing it. Moreover, neither its victims nor anybody else will be aware of the change, only the wielder. All others will fail to notice any difference, or act like things have always been that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, this powerful artifact finds its way into the hands of one of Hyrule's residents. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

There were so many choices; the dancing couple; the kids calling themselves 'Bombers'; that Tingle guy; and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally arrived at the town, another thought came to him. If this wand was so powerful, could it perhaps be used to swap something between himself from another time? As the Hero of Time, he had travelled seven years forward in time when he saved Hyrule from Ganondorf and although he could no longer travel to that timeline, maybe the wand could swap something between his current young self and his adult self from that time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded a little strange, but Link hoped that that could be the case. Even though he'd had the body of an adult at that point, his mind had still been that of a child. Like any child his age, Link would have loved to find out more about what an adult was really like, but hadn't had the time to do it because of the crisis. But now that it was over, he might have another chance at experiencing adulthood from the point of view of a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a secluded spot where no one would be able to see him, Link prepared to use the wand. But, as he thought about whether the should swap something with an inhabitant of Termina or with his adult self, his eyes fell upon the Fierce Deity Mask hanging from his belt, which gave him an idea for a third possibility; maybe he could use the Swap Wand to swap certain things between his different forms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his adventure in Termina, he had collected a number of different masks that allowed him to transform into other forms. Each of these forms had their own strengths and weaknesses, but if he could use the Swap Wand to give himself the best attributes of all of his forms, it would be easy for him to defeat any other dark force that might arise in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over carefully, Link decided to swap something between himself and...</span></div></div>",

The only question then was what. Link knew he had to save Hyrule, but right now the Swap Wand was simply too tempting. Perhaps he should just swap something small and get on with things.

He could go for something simple like her hair or her face, or maybe something a little more crazy like her breasts or vagina. However, another thought occurred to Link. Perhaps the things he swapped didn't need to be body parts. Perhaps he could change part of his personality or life, perhaps even his clothes. Even swapping something small, there were still so many choices. He knew he needed to decide quickly and get on with his quest. Hyrule wasn't going to save itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Link finished waving the wand, he suddenly felt very different. But what caught his eye first was not his body, but rather where he was. Instead of the Temple of Time, he appeared to be in a stable of some sort, although it seemed mostly empty save for himself and a pair of cows. Speaking of himself, Link looked down at his body, strands of red hair falling into his vision. He was unmistakably female, going by the lumps on his chest and his rather small waist. He seemed to be wearing a white and purple dress, a pair of brown boots with a slight heel to them, and a yellow shawl with a pin based on some sort of monster pinned to it. He ran a hand through his now-red hair, finding it to long and silky. The wand had definitely worked; he had swapped bodies with Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the wand, Link found it was still held in his hand (although it was really Malon's hand). He let out a sigh of relief, knowing he wasn't stuck and could switch back if he wanted to. It certainly have been inconvenient if it had stayed with his old body. However, thinking about his old body reminded him of what he really should be doing right now. He had a quest to fulfill, and he certainly couldn't do that if he was here in Malon's body. That said, maybe it would okay to just stay a little while, he was rather curious about what it would be like to actually be Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could actually decide on whether to swap back or not, the door to the stable opened, and Ingo stepped in, looking much more sharply dressed than Link last remembered of him. He immediately looking over at Link, and glared at him. Link wasn't entirely sure what to say or do in this situation, so he just stood there awkwardly. Ingo didn't seem to take kindly to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Why are you just standing around? Get back to work, girl!\" he shout at Link, who he thought was actually Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Link mumbled, finding it odd to hear Malon's voice coming out of his mouth instead of his own. Wasn't Malon's father the one in charge of the ranch? Why was Ingo bossing Malon around? Had something happened here in the seven years that passed in his absence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even doing? Playing with sticks?\" Ingo shouted, noticing the wand, or stick as he called it, in Link's hand. \"Give me that.\" He stomped over towards Link, hand outstretched to snatch the wand from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink knew he couldn't let Ingo get his hands on the wand. Regardless of what was going on here at Lon Lon Ranch, Link didn't want to lose the Swap Wand and end up stuck in Malon's body, and he certainly didn't want someone like Ingo acquiring his powers. The safest option was probably to just swap back into his own body and get out of this situation. Or perhaps there was a way of swapping back into his old life while keeping Malon's body, as he still wasn't sure he wanted to give it up yet. On the other hand, perhaps he should use the wand on Ingo. If Ingo was treating Malon like this, something had to be done. Maybe he could swap Ingo with one of the animals or something. It'd give him some enjoyment seeing Ingo like that, and probably help out Malon when he got out of her body.</span></div></div>",

While he had indeed obtained her body and clothes, that meant losing not only the body he'd previously had, but also the clothes it had been wearing. This meant he was no longer wearing the Octo Ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink groaned at his failure, sounding rather odd coming out of Nayru's sing-songy voice. He'd hoped to swap while wearing the transformation rings so that his transformed body would be replaced with the one he swapped with. Then, he'd simply have to take the ring off, and he'd be himself again, only with a ring he could use to turn into a beautiful lady instead of a monster. Unfortunately, it hadn't played out that way. He'd gotten Nayru's body, and Nayru had gotten his, ring and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be a way around this. Link would not let himself be defeated so easily. This plan would work. He would claim the bodies of the Oracles and Zelda for himself. Sure, he could simply swap with them one at a time, like how he had currently swapped with Nayru, but why have one body when he could have five? He deserved it after all he'd done. He grabbed the wand again in his feminine hand, ready to try again. There was just one question, though; should he swap back before trying again? Nayru had his body right now, a body that he wanted to keep, along with the Octo Ring, so it made sense to swap back, but at the same time, he still had the other three transformation rings. He could use one of those and try perfecting his idea, before eventually getting his own body back. Why should he have to give up Nayru's body already when he'd only just gotten it?</span></div></div>",

Maybe the Swap Wand could do something about that, provided he could make sure the ring stayed where it was.</span></div></div>",

After taking off his tiara and earrings, all he had left on was a soft, pink bra and matching underwear. With his face now flushed red in embarrassment, Link quickly took them off and hopped into the bathtub before he could see anything, after which he sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.

He was wearing a skirt made of multiple shades of blue with light blue leggings underneath, and dark blue boots as well. He felt the lack of anything between his legs, a feeling Zelda's body had shared. It was certain: Link now had control over Lana's body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I can control as many bodies as I want?\" Link thought aloud to himself in Lana's voice. Link decided to think of that later, as he looked around the small room and found Lana's spell book. He could practice some spells on it now, or maybe he could use it to teleport to Zelda's room. He still had control over his own body and Zelda's body, and could control all three simultaneously, so it would probably be best to keep all three bodies in one place for now, as it would be easier to keep an eye on all three, and then do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will he do?</span></div></div>",

He had gotten used to wearing his hero's tunic, but it wouldn't hurt to try something a little different. For some reason, the first person to come to mind was Zelda, and picturing himself in Zelda's dress made Link laugh. \"Hm, why not,\" he thought, and waved the wand in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wand was waved, his tunic disappeared, replacing itself with Zelda's dress. The flowing garment felt odd on his body, unlike any clothes he was used to wearing. It left areas on his chest and thighs uncovered, while being tight and constricting around his waist with somewhat heavy armor on his shoulders, chest, hips, etc. The breastplate looked a little odd pressed flat against Link's male chest, but he assumed the entire ensemble looked odd on him. He could even feel makeup on his face and little trinkets in his hair, trying to grasp onto his much shorter hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink couldn't help but feel silly dressed up in Zelda's clothes.He was supposed to be the hero, and yet here he was dressed up like the princess. He still had the Swap Wand in his hand, so he decided he might as well keep Zelda's clothes for now. Then again, maybe people could actually see the swaps and would ridicule him for dressing like a girl? He needed to find out. Slowly making his way back to the castle, adjusting to the odd feeling of the dress, Link made his way through the courtyard, keeping an eye out for anyone who might notice his change in attire.</span></div></div>",

Something like switching his clothes for someone else's seemed like the perfect test of the wand's capabilities.The only question then was who's clothes Link wanted to swap his for. Unfortunately, the only ideas he could seem to come up with were girls. He didn't particularly want to wear Zelda's dress, Impa's clothes could possibly work, Lana he definitely didn't want to swap with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Link, he happened to move his hand in a waving motion as he thought about Lana and her clothes, and the wand took that as a sign to start swapping. Almost instantly, Link found himself dressed in Lana's clothes. He felt incredibly exposed, and his male body looked rather ridiculous in Lana's skimpy outfit. This wasn't what he wanted at all! At the very least he had gotten a taste of the wand's power, and he could swap back as soon as he wanted. And when he wanted was right now. He was about to wave the wand and swap back, when another thought started to creep into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought the outfit looked weird on his male body, so maybe it'd be better if he had a female body underneath the clothes. This caused him to stall the swapping, not really because he was actually considering taking someone else's body, and a female body no less, but because he was worried that the wand would take this subconscious thought of getting a female body and use that instead of swapping his clothes back with Lana. But as he tried to clear his mind of the idea, it seemed to become more appealing. He could swap back at any time, so why not try out a female body for a little while?</span></div></div>",

Sure, he had been hailed as a hero after the defeat of Ganon, but now his duties were rarely any different from any other knight, just with the respect that came from being the hero of legend. Perhaps it would be nice to be someone else for a while, and take a break from being himself. Now it was just a question of who to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda was the first to come to mind. Although it would probably be weird being a girl, being a princess would probably be a nice break from being a knight. A different kinda of respect was imparted upon those of royalty than upon heroes. He wasn't sure what sort of administrative work or the like was required of a ruler, but he was sure he could handle it. There was only one problem; his conscience. Between the war against Cia and Ganon, and the peace that had followed, Link had really gotten to know Zelda, and thought of her as a friend, or perhaps even more. He would feel pretty bad about \"borrowing\" her body like that, even if the wand would make it so she wouldn't find out about it. Still, the life of a princess did seem pretty appealing. Perhaps there was another princess somewhere he could swap with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Link remembered his allies from across the ages, who assisted him in the war against Cia and Ganon. In particular, he remembered Ruto, the princess of the Zoras, a race of fish-like people. Although Link did still consider her a trustworthy ally, he didn't know her as well as he did Zelda, and wasn't as close with her. As such, he didn't feel as much guilt about borrowing her body to take a vacation from being himself. This option was not without its own complication, however. Ruto from an entirely different time period, the Era of the Hero of Time. Although Cia's magic had called forth locations and people from across the ages, Link wasn't so sure the wand would work on Ruto now that she had returned to her own time. Still, there was no harm in trying. Link held the wand up, and waved it, thinking about swapping bodies with Princess Ruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wand weaved its magic, it would seem not even the fabric of time could stop it, but how exactly did it work?</span></div></div>",

He looked at the hand that was holding the wand, and noticed it seemed much daintier, with longer fingernails, and most importantly, it was covered in blue scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself, Link no longer saw his own body. Rather, he saw the scaly feminine body of Ruto, princess of the Zoras. His body was clearly female, as evidence by the wide hips, thin waist, void between his legs, and decent sized breasts on his chest, only being covered by a pair of fins growing out of his body. Said fins also grew out of his back, elbows, and hips. He now had webbed feet, and his head was rather oddly shaped. His ears had become fins, and the pair of purple earrings hanging from them was the only item of clothing that seemed to be anywhere on his body. And of course, his entire body was covered in light blue scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Link mumbled, hearing Ruto's voice coming out his mouth instead of his own. \"This is amazing.\" He rand his hand down his body, find the experience of feeling both his new feminine curves and his new scales at the same time to be rather odd. It was a rather drastic departure from his usual body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed Link's body was indeed the only thing that changed. Looking around, he found he was still standing in Hyrule Field, in the present era. \"Well, that's disappointing.\" Link had hoped to borrow Ruto's body so he could take a vacation from being himself by living the life of a princess. If he was still in the present, then he wouldn't be able to rule over Ruto's kingdom. He couldn't help but wonder whether people would recognise him as Link or Ruto at the moment. Looking down, he saw Ruto, but Ruto didn't live in this time period, so maybe the wand just changed his body into Ruto while still having him be Link. This seemed to be something worth investigating. If people saw him as Ruto, despite still being in the present, then he might still get to experience some special privileges as a princess. He might not have his own kingdom to rule over, but he had a feeling Zelda would treat another visiting princess pretty well, especially one she'd fought alongside before. Of course, it could always be that he was still Link, and just looked like Ruto. That wouldn't really allow him to take a vacation from his own life, but at least he got an interesting experience by changing his body. Perhaps he should try the wand again. Sure, the body swap didn't exactly work as he'd hoped, but maybe he could try wording his swap differently to try and let him live out life as the princess of the Zoras.</span></div></div>",

He knew plenty of people amongst the ranks of Hyrule's knights, but none really provided any sort of interesting things to swap. His friends who had helped him in the fight against Cia and Ganondorf could all provide interesting opportunities for swaps, but majority of them were now scattered across time, and those that weren't, he was too close friends with to risk testing something like this on them. What if the swap went wrong and he hurt them somehow? What if they were able to see the swaps, and got mad at him for using it on them? No, he couldn't bring himself to do that to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, who was left to swap with? Link paced around Hyrule Field, trying to think of someone to test out this magical artifact on. There had to be someone, he wasn't just going to give up and let this wand go to waste. He stopped his pacing for a moment as he noticed the small temple housing the Fairy Fountain near Hyrule Castle. Of course; the Great Fairy! Not only would swapping with her almost certainly provide an interesting experience, but he weren't close enough with her to feel bad about swapping with her, and there were multiple Great Fairies around the world, so if he messed something up with this one, there'd still be other Great Fairies to pick up the slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was merely a question of what to swap. The most obvious thing would be her body. It took out the complication of trying to think of smaller individual things by just taking the big one, and it would certainly provide Link with an interesting experience. Although, he couldn't help but wonder exactly how it would work if he asked for her body and nothing else. Would his body transform right here, leaving him in his own clothes? Would his mind be placed in her body? And if he had her body, would people recognise him as Link, or would he be living the Great Fairy's life?</span></div></div>",

Looking down, it wasn't hard to see why; Link was no longer himself. He now possessed the body of the Great Fairy. He had her soft pale skin, her long pink hair and fingernails, her slim, feminine arms. He had her two large breasts on his chest, her slim waist and wide hips, her void between his legs. He had her tight, leafy top clinging to his chest, and her somewhat transparent pants, showing off her long shapely legs underneath. The Great Fairy's fountain seemed much smaller than it had last time he was hear, indicating he had her large size as well. Link had it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he muttered, hearing the Great Fairy's voice speak instead of his own. It was surreal enough that he had a body different from his own, but it was clear that wasn't all that had changed. After all, he was floating off the ground right now, so he likely had all her powers. Looking around the fountain, several smaller fairies seemed to be flying around, aimlessly wandering or making idle conversation with each other. None of them seemed to show any sort of reaction to what had just happened. Link had wondered if he'd still be recognised as himself after a body swap, and it seemed he had his answer; the world saw him as one of the Great Fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wasn't entirely sure what he wanted to do now. He no longer had the duties of a soldier or a hero, and the Great Fairy's powers were not often required by the citizens, generally being used in times of war or crisis, which meant Link now had plenty of time to do whatever he wanted. He had just undergone a huge change, perhaps he should stay like this for a while. He could test out the Great Fairy's power, or perhaps just explore his new body a bit. However, he did still have the wand, now looking rather grasped between his large, feminine fingers. As big as a change as this was for him, he couldn't imagine the Great Fairy's life was very interesting, seeing as it was rare for people to visit the fountain. Maybe he could swap again, into someone else's body, or perhaps something different to occupy his time and make things even more interesting.</span></div></div>",

He let out a gasp at all the sudden changes, and almost gasped again when he noticed how feminine it sounded.

What he didn't expect, however, was the breeze he was feeling all over his body. He looked down, only for his face to turn deep red with embarrassment. He had expected to see the Great Fairy's voluptuous female body when he looked down, but he hadn't expected it to be completely naked! Link held one arm in front of his breasts, and the other in front of his crotch, trying to cover up his privates, even if there wasn't anyone around at the moment to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had this happened? It wasn't like the Great Fairy normally paraded around naked, so why, when swapping into her body, had he wound up without clothes. The answer was actually rather simple, as Link figured out when he looked at the area around his feet. There, sitting around his pink-painted toenails, were scraps of green, white, and brown fabric that used to be his usual tunic, pants, and boots. It seemed that when swapping into the Great Fairy's body, he had kept his own clothes, which for some reason hadn't adjusted their size to match his new body. As such, the clothes simply split apart due to being unable to contain a body that was over twice his size. This left him in a rather unfortunate predicament. He was now in the Great Fairy's body, but without any clothes. With how big the Great Fairy's body was, it would be rather unlikely that he'd be able to get back to his room unseen, and even then, his other clothes probably hadn't changed size either. Even if he swapped back into his own body, his clothes were already torn, so there was no real sense in swapping back already. Even though the Great Fairy's body had caused this predicament, he didn't really want to give it up just yet. It'd be boring to swap back so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was there to do then? Perhaps he could improvise an outfit somehow? The outfit the Great Fairies usually wore seemed like it was pretty much just made of leaves, maybe he could put together something like that? On the other hand, he did still have the swap wand. Maybe he could use it to swap clothes with someone else, making sure to specify that the clothing should adjust to the size of his new body.</span></div></div>",

The obvious choice was the Great Fairy herself, seeing as Link already had her body. Of course, there were other people he knew whose clothes he could borrow. For some reason, the idea of causing a little chaos and mixing things around seemed very appealing to him right now. Perhaps the wand was being a bad influence on him, enticing him into using it.

He didn't know whether requesting a simple clothes swap would adjust the clothing to fit him or not, so it would be smarter to swap with the Great Fairy, seeing as her clothes should fit his body, which was actually her's, perfectly. If the clothes didn't adjust, and he tried to swap with someone else, he'd just end up shredding their outfit too as the wand attempted to place it on his large body. It wasn't like the clothes would be doing the Great Fairy much good right now anyway; if he'd shredded his clothes by being too large for them, then the Great Fairy's clothes must be way too big for her now that she had his body. So, holding the wand in his large feminine hand, he waved it, thinking about taking the Great Fairy's outfit, from her top that seemed to be composed of only leaves, to her pants that were mostly transparent. It wasn't optimal, but at least it'd cover him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the outfit adjust because of the difference in sizes between Link and the Great Fairy's bodies?</span></div></div>",

He didn't have the Great Fairy's tight-fitting top pressed against his chest, nor her somewhat loose pants flowing around his legs. The clothes were here, alright, but not in the way Link had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!?\" Link nearly shouted, grabbing a hold of the pants's waistline to prevent it from falling around his ankles. It seemed that a simple clothing swap did, in fact, adjust the size of the clothes involved to match the new wearer, which had some annoyingly unintended results on this occasion. Even though Link had the body these clothes were made for, after the first swap, they were far too big for their owner. In trying to swap clothes, the Great Fairy's outfit had grown, so that it would be just as ill-fitting on Link's current giant body as they had been on the Great Fairy a few moments ago. His legs were swimming in the fabric of the pants, and he was sure any attempt at walking would cause him to trip. The top was no longer as tight as it should be, threatening to fall of his shoulders if he moved even a little, and the cleavage window was now large enough to expose his entire chest, leaving the Great Fairy's breasts just as uncovered as they'd been before the clothes swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink let out a loud, feminine-sounding sigh. At the very least, he now knew that trying to swap clothes would result in the outfit adjusting to match the size of the wearer, meaning that despite having the Great Fairy's giant body, he could swap with anyone he wanted, and their clothes would fit him just fine. That seemed like a very good option right now, seeing how poorly the Great Fairy's clothes were fitting him at the moment. However, he wondered if he should swap back with the Great Fairy first. If he did that, whoever he swapped with would have him clothing, but far too small for their body, essentially forcing them to go naked, and the Great Fairy would be back in her incredibly oversized clothing.

He ran his hands down his body, feeling the new feminine curves he'd obtained, and the emptiness between his legs. It was all strangely exiting, how different it was. He also found it a little odd that despite gaining the Great Fairy's body, he was still a regular-sized for a Hylian, rather than being as giant as the Great Fairy normally was. Additionally, he was still wearing his own clothes, and he couldn't detect any traces of make up on his face. He could only assume that the same was true for the Great Fairy, and that she'd have his body, but still be giant, and still be wearing her own clothes and make up. Link shuddered to think what his body would look like wearing the Great Fairy's clothes, even if it wasn't his body at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could explore his body further, he heard a voice calling out to him. \"Hey, Link!\" He turned around, quickly hiding the remote behind his back. One of the Great Fairy's long pink ponytails swung around and practically hit him in the face as he did so. As it turned out, the person calling to him was Impa, a general in Hyrule's army, and an adviser to princess Zelda. \"What are you doing out here?\" she asked as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink assumed she was referring to the fact that he had left his patrol. He wasn't about to tell her exactly what he fact, he didn't want to share this knowledge with others quite yet, so instead, he told a bit of a white lie. \"I thought I saw something out here, but it turned out to be nothing,\" Link replied, doing his best not to show any sort of reaction to the fact that he was speaking with the Great Fairy's voice instead of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shouldn't you be heading back to your patrol, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I was just heading back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa still seemed a little suspicious, but she seemed to let it go, heading back towards the castle, with Link following behind. As boring as his patrol usually was, he had a feeling this wand was going to make it a lot more interesting. Speaking of the wand, as Link walked, he couldn't help but notice how much his chest bounced with each step. It was somewhat distracting. It was probably due to the size of the Great Fairy's assets combined with the fact that he was still wearing clothes meant for a man. Perhaps he could use the wand to do something about that.</span></div></div>",

And it felt like a lead weight had been strapped to his head, and it threatened to send him to the ground. Reaching his arms up to stead himself, he expected to find his own head atop his shoulders but instead, hit a wall of sorts...something huge was on his neck that extended <i>past </i>his shoulders! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was pretty sure he knew what what had happened, but he didn't want to confirm his suspicions. He couldn't put it off forever, though. Tentatively, he reached a hand around to his 'face', and where he would've expected to feel his hand on his head, all he felt was something small touching his chin, the skin of which felt much softer than his own. Sliding his hand up the smooth surface, his fingers caught on huge, plush lips, and Link finally let out a gasp, eyes widening at how <i>feminine </i>the gasp sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had headswapped with the great fairy alright, except the outcome wasn't as he expected. Her head stood on his shoulders, just as beautiful as ever but <i>outrageously </i>oversized! Not to mention unfitting, considering that from the neck down the rest of his body was the same as ever. Looking down at himself, he was unable to get a good angle on his own body, only really seeing his undersized arms as they brushed across his now womanly head. He couldn't even reach the top of his head, arms stopping short just shy of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Link took a step forward, and nearly fell to the ground as the weight of his head shifted around uneasily. Not only did his head weigh a ton, but the great fairy had <i>long </i>locks of hair that were intended to hang down the full length of her body...so naturally it fell to the ground, dragging several feet behind link while also needlessly weighing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he held it up with his arms, he could move around easily, but he'd have to get used to normal movement or people will probably get suspicious. After all, what kind of sword fighter fights with their hands on their head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt ridiculous, and he probably looked ridiculous too, though he at least felt safe in the knowledge that nobody else would see anything wrong with the way he looked. What about the great fairy? She must look ridiculous with her <i>undersized </i>head, not to mention having the face of a guy! She couldn't see anything wrong with the way she looked either, but Link still felt a little bad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered, though...the Swap Wand was powerful, and rather vague in its capabilities. Could Link swap the size of the great fairys head with the size of his old head? That'd make things bearable at least. Then again, it might cause more problems then its worth, and maybe holding on to his new giant, ladylike head would be fun? Maybe?!</span></div></div>",

As far as he knew, there was no <i>real </i>consequences to swapping, since it could all be undone. And it was... fun, albeit really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Link really wanted to do was fix the giant head problem, and he realized there were a few ways to do that. On one hand, he could go all out and take the Fairy's body aswell. As if having the head of a woman wasn't bad enough, Link would be going full <i>woman</i>, and the idea was strangely inviting in a scary sort of way. Plus, he'd be giant! Sort of. If people still treated Link like Link, then he'd certainly be advantaged if he ever needed to fight. Although fitting inside the castle would be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option, the more reasonable option, was to tackle the 'giant head' problem directly. Just swap his head size with the great fairys head size, right? Then her head would fit squarely on his shoulders, and the great fairy would have that matched her huge body. Though, Link was tentative to choose this option. Mostly because it was boring, but he had a bad feeling that he'd word the swap correctly in his mind, and cause some effect he didn't anticipate. That's silly though, right? It's just an extremely powerful magic artifact that inexplicably swapped things around whilst changing reality so that it was normal...

Although, covering his mouth was quite hard to do considering how large it was in comparison to his hand at the moment. Looking around, Link saw he was definitely much closer to the ground, his chin just barely poking above the grass. Despite the shrinking, his head still remained far too big for his body, and thus this hadn't solved any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Link a moment to realise what had happened, and why. Although he had meant to swap the size of his head with his old one, he had only specified the swapping sizes part, not that he wanted to limit it to the Great Fairy's head which he had. And so, his entire body, head included, was now only as tall as his old head had been. The meant the Great Fairy now probably had a head as tall as he usually was, plus the added height of his giant head, making her new male head even larger than her old one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his head was technically now a more manageable size, his body was also much smaller, completely negating that. He needed to swap again, at the very least to regain his usual height. Unfortunately, during the shock that came from shrinking, Link had accidentally dropped the wand, and now went looking for it amongst the much taller grass.

Instead of getting back to his regular size, albeit with the Great Fairy's large head upon his body, his body had remained tiny, as was evidenced by the large wand in his hands. His line of sight did rise up further off the ground, however, coupled with the large weight on his shoulders multiplying even further. He reached up to try and touch his face, as he'd done when he first swapped with the Great Fairy, but found that he was barely able to even get his arm around to reach the front of the large mass that sat atop his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised what had happened. Another poorly thought out swap. Instead of reversing the previous swap, giving Link his regular size back, he'd reversed the first swap, giving him his regular head back, albeit with some rather large alterations. He now had his own body back fully, but his head was about the size the Great Fairy's head usually was, and his body was tiny! He was struggling to even stay standing with his massive head being pushed down by gravity. Speaking of the Great Fairy, although Link couldn't see her, he knew she was now mostly normal, save for having a head too small for her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was starting to believe this wand was capable of more harm than good. It had started out with a simple test, a bit of curiosity, but now a handful of poorly worded swaps had resulted in him becoming a freak, barely able to stand with how large his head was, and how tiny his body was. Unfortunately, although the wand was the cause of this, it was also his only way out of this. He'd probably have the reverse all the swaps one by one, first the head, then the size, and then maybe the head again if he wasn't ready to mess around again yet. However, after seeing how badly a small mistake could screw things up, Link was admittedly a little afraid to try again. Perhaps it would be safer for him to work on this from an outside perspective, where he wouldn't have to feel the repercussions of his mistakes first hand? He could try swapping into someone else's body, and then while he was them, he could work on fixing his own body without experiencing every change himself.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know why, but he knew that, for the time being at least, he wanted to keep this. A smile started to spread across his heavily made up face, not understanding why the strangeness was giving him a sense of joy, but also not really caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what to do next, Link took another step forward, only to almost fall flat on his gigantic face. Moving around with a head this big was going to take some practice. Holding his head up, Link took a couple of steps forward, finding it to be fairly easy so long as he held it with his hands. That wasn't really an option, though. The Swap Wand would have made it normal for him to have a head this big, so people would question why he was always holding it up with his hands, probably. Not to mention, if a battle broke out, Link would have a tough time fighting if both his hands were busy holding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly let go of his head, and took a very small step. He felt his balance wobble, but for the most part, he was able to stay upright. He took another step, this time managing to hold his head steady. Then another, bigger this time. And another, and another, until... Link stepped a little bit further than he was ready for, and toppled over onto the ground. He sighed, noting how feminine it sounded. There had to be a quicker way to do this. He still had the wand, after all. Couldn't that do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious solution would be to change the size of his head, but that was out of the question, since Link wanted to keep the Great Fairy's head, while also keeping it at its normal size. He thought perhaps he could swap skills with someone to make this easier for him, but since he had created this rather unique situation himself, he couldn't think of anyone he could steal a \"walking with a giant head\" skill from. The only other option, save for just practicing, was to find some sort of counterbalance. Something that would keep him standing even if his head toppled one way or another. He considered his options, wondering if he knew of anyone who's legs he could borrow to help him stay standing.</span></div></div>",

He figured he might as well go for the feet first, seeing as how he could always just add the legs on top of that if it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the problem was who to swap with. Most people he knew were pretty normal sized, and borrowing their legs or feet wouldn't really help him. First to come to mind was the most obvious choice; the Great Fairy herself. He had taken her large head, so her feet and legs would be just as large proportionately. The only other things he could think of that were large enough, or had strong enough legs, were some of the monsters he'd faced, like King Dodongo or The Imprisoned.

It was slow, as he did his best to lift his heavy foot into the air, but he managed to stay standing. Then he took another, and another. After a couple of these, he felt his head start to wobble again, and tried leaning forward. Normally the weight of his head going forwards would have caused him to topple over, but with his new feet, he managed to stay upright. This was exactly what Link had been hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a perfect solution, however. Even though he was now able to walk without his head making him fall over, his large feet now slowed his movements, his regular legs not strong enough to pick them up any faster. Now Link faced another dilemma, one rather similar to his initial head problem; should he just practice and try to get good with these feet, or should he find a quicker solution by swapping again? He could always try taking the Great Fairy's legs as well. Then he would have legs proportionate to his feet and should have no problem picking them up to walk, although he wondered whether this would still keep the balance he'd received or not.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link ultimately decided against swapping his legs as well. Although it might give him the strength to lift up his giant feet quicker than he'd been doing right now, he felt it wasn't entirely necessary, at least for now. Sure, he was walking a bit slower than he used to be able to, but for the time being, Hyrule was in a time of peace, so there probably wouldn't be many occasions where he really need to rush somewhere fast. Right now, the Great Fairy's feet were doing what they needed to do, and that was keep him standing despite his large head. He didn't mind that it resulted in him walking a bit slower for the time being, and if it bothered him that much in the long run, he could probably swap them back with the Great Fairy once he was used to her giant head, and was able to keep his balance without the aid of her feet. For now, he decided to just keep the Great Fairy's head and feet, and work with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being decided, Link returned to practicing walking around with his oddly proportioned body. It still took a bit of effort to lift up his large, feminine feet, but he was slowly getting used to it, figuring out how fast he could move, and how much pressure he had to apply to do so. Whenever his head threatened to throw him off balance, his large feet managed to keep him from falling, although he did still wobble quite a bit. His legs eventually started to get tired, but by now, he was starting to get faster, slowly approaching his old walking pace, albeit with a lot more effort being put in in order to reach that speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is working pretty well,\" Link said to himself, hearing the Great Fairy's voice come out of his mouth instead of his own. He was rather pleased with the progress he was making, still finding the oddness of the situation strangely appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he happened to step on a rather sharp branch that had been laying on the ground. He rested his back against a tree and propped his foot up on his toes, pulling the branch off and rubbing the spot where it had poked him. That was one disadvantage of this swap; the lack of shoes, combined with the Great Fairy's soft, sensitive skin made hurting his feet a much greater possibility. As he placed his foot back down and stood in place, Link began to realise just how tired his legs were right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should take a break.\" Link decided to head home for now, and rest for a bit. He headed back towards the castle, taking a slower pace than he'd done while practicing, and making sure to look out for any sharp branches or stones. He still didn't really understand why he found the strangeness caused by the wand so satisfying, but seeing as how he could swap back at any time, there didn't seem to be any real consequence to messing around as much as he pleased. Speaking of the wand, Link pondered whether to use it again or not. He had been content with sticking with just the head and feet before practicing, but that was just in terms of swapping to help himself move easier. Right now, he had the large head and feet of the Great Fairy, but everything else in between was normal. Perhaps he could try swapping something else with the Great Fairy again. Then again, why limit himself to just swapping with her? There were plenty of other people who he could try swapping with. So long as he had the wand, the world was his oyster.</span></div></div>",

Link bent down and rubbed his hands along the smooth, shapely legs of the Great Fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried walking again, finding it easier to lift his new feet since he also had the legs to accompany them. His movements were still a little slow, due to how his body's parts were now quite disproportionate, but now he was able to move more normally. He could now run again, much to Link's surprise. Although when he ran, the rushing wind blew against his bare, hairless legs; this caused him to shudder a bit. The Great Fairy's head also wobbled as he moved, but Link could easily keep his balance by holding his large head in place combined with his new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation certainly was becoming quite interesting to Link. He maintained a firm hold on the wand as he held his head in place. This brought his attention back to the wand, so he stopped walking for now. Link stared at the wand and then down to the Great Fairy's legs and feet he now had. As intriguing as this was, he didn't quite appreciate being so disproportionate, with most of his body being smaller than his head and legs. This also brought up the slight issue of his appearance. Not only did he look funny, his apparel also was mismatched, with his legs and feet being bare while the remainder of his body whole his usual outfit.As fun as the wand was, Link pondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

In particular, King Dodongo and The Imprisoned came to mind. With King Dodongo's large, clawed feet, he could probably grip the ground better if he felt himself starting to wobble, and The Imprisoned was much larger than either the Great Fairy or King Dodongo, and its feet seemed to have no trouble holding it up, despite how much of its body seemed to lean to the front. Of course, after the war with Cia and Ganon, Link wasn't sure how many, if any, King Dodongos still remained in the world, and The Imprisoned came from another era in history altogether. Would the wand even work on either of them. Still, both options seemed like an interesting, albeit weird, idea, and Link was willing to try it.

Although, perhaps \"his feet\" wasn't exactly the correct term. They may have currently been attached to him, but those feminine feet originally belonged to the Great Fairy. In fact, his entire body, save for his head, felt completely different. From the void between his legs, to the breasts hanging from his chest, Link knew he had inherited her body. And judging by how tall he was, and how small the Swap Wand felt in his hand, it seemed her body had retained its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking down, Link found that the Great Fairy's body body looked a lot bigger than expected. In fact, even just looking to the side, his shoulder looked much farther away than it should have been. He held up his right hand to his face, since his left was currently holding the wand. It looked large enough to be able to hold his entire head in his fist. And that's when it hit him; his head was still the same size. Despite taking the Great Fairy's gigantic body, he still had his own normal-sized head. Well, normal-sized was relative to his old body, because now it probably looked tiny on the body he had now. If he looked like this, then he could only imagine what the Great Fairy looked like now, her giant head perched atop his body. He couldn't help but laugh at the thought, even if he probably looked just as silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to take a step forward, testing out his new giant body, only to stub his toe on a tree, causing him to hiss in pain. He seemed to be able to control his movements fine, but with a head so small compared to his body, he was having trouble judging distances properly. This definitely posed a problem. As much as being a giant would provide an advantage on the battlefield, even without his armor and sword, as he found he was now wearing the Great Fairy's clothes, that advantage would be wasted if he couldn't even control his movements properly. He had to do something about it. The obvious choice was to just keep practicing. He was already getting a sort of strange enjoyment out of having the Great Fairy's body, and although it probably looked silly, he thought it was kind of fun having his head so much smaller than his body. On the other hand, he still had the wand grasped between his giant, feminine fingers. With just a wave of his wand, he could have his old body back, or he could take the Great Fairy's head to match the size of his body. Or perhaps there was a way to switch the size of things. He could make his head bigger, or his body smaller. Or, if he felt really devious, he could take someone else's body, giving the Great Fairy's body to them.</span></div></div>",

As much as using it again was tempting, he figured it'd be more fun to stay like this a while. So for now, he needed a place to put the wand. The best place for now was against the waistband of the Great Fairy's leafy lower garments. Link smiled now that his hands were free. He put his feminine hands out to his sides for balance and practiced walking with his oversized body. It would have been an easy thing to learn, but with the jiggling and swaying of certain female body parts disrupted his balance quite a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      5 minutes went by and Link was progressing very quickly. The first few times, he kept falling down. But after a while, he learned how to judge distances from his obscure vantage point. His jiggly breasts and butt still made his walking a bit wobbly, but it was good enough for the moment.  \"A body such as this would certainly give me an advantage in battle.\" Link thought. He positioned his hands as if they were holding an invisible sword and swung them around him. Immediately, he realized a problem, the Great Fairy's large breasts again. They moved too much when he swung his arms. \"An easy fix.\" he figured. \"I guess the Great Fairy didn't believe in bras. One should help keep these steady.\" he said, grabbing the large orbs on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Actually, maybe a whole new outfit would be necessary.\" he decided, looking down at the thin leaf themed clothing his female body had on. Link walked forward a bit and stepped on a branch, one that hurt his bare foot. \"Ouch! Definitely some shoes at least!\" he yelped. Link looked down and picked up said branch, finding it incredibly light for his stronger, giant body. \"This branch is a lot larger than my sword, yet it weighs nothing to me.\" he said. The sword practice resumed, now with an item Link could more easily use, since it was a lot like a sword. Link grimaced when he swung in different ways, some of which didn't cause his breasts to move as much. \"This body,\" he paused a held up his hands. \"is so useful! I should keep it; it'd certainly make my travels a lot easier.\" Link decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The whole situation kept on seeming more positive to Link, although there was one thing that almost slipped his mind. He only realized it when he looked down at his painted toenails and barefeet, \"The Great Fairy could always fly, no wonder she didn't need shoes. And she could heal major injuries. Can this body still do that?\" he wondered. Link stood and tried jumping. It was a higher jump than his previous body, but not the flight he desired. He closed his eyes and kept trying, unsure if there were certain muscles he had to use or something else entirely. After what seemed like an almost wasted effort......</span></div></div>",

Guess I can't be too mad but.....\"  his frowned turned into more of a scowl. \"Whatever, I should head home for the time being.\" Link walked as fast as he could to his humble abode. His house wasn't the biggest or fanciest around, but for a hero living alone it was more than enough. Entering the building, Link sighed when he saw it was a mess. \"I always forget to clean this place up.\" He placed the wand down on the table near his bed and started picking items off the floor. His new body made the whole process exceedingly quick and easy; which Link realized when he finished and wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      He was proud to see his home more fit for a hero like himself. Link found that most of the items he had cleaned up were scraps of fabric and linen from needing to stitch up his usual green tunic and outfit from his many ventures and fights. He was now lacking said outfit, now possessing the thin, leaf like clothing of the Great Fairy pressed tightly against his voluptuous body. \"That's right, new clothing!\" he remembered. Link went for a nearby drawer and pulled out a stewarding kit, complete with needle and string of various kinds. \"Time to get to work.\" Link spent the better part of the rest of the day crafting a suitable outfit for his larger form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       It had already become dark outside when Link was done. He breathed heavily, feeling completely exhausted, but smiled at his work. He didn't have enough materials to create an outfit as ornate as his old one, but it was still good enough to him. The outfit consisted of a makeshift bra, which held up and supported his large breasts, but also pushed them up making them look larger, a light green shirt; although it was short, the sleeves and hem showing off his belly and forearms as well as showing plenty of cleavage. Tight white pants that were pretty transparent and accentuated his shapely lower body, he kept the Great Fairy's leaf panties on, and finally a pair of flat open toe sandals that had straps that went around Link's ankles, his pink colored toenails contrasted greatly with them. His signature green cap was also present on his head. \"Not too shabby, if I say so myself. I might have to find a better bra in Hyrule town though.\" he decided. A yawn escaped Link's mouth indicating his exhaustion. Link stripped down to his underwear and headed to his bed. He gave one last check in on the swapping wand he left on the table, only to find....</span></div></div>",

A breeze blew across his semi nude body and that's when he noticed the nearby window was open. He ran to it and looked outside into the darkness. Obviously, he couldn't see anything. \"I gotta go out and find that wand.\" Link thought. He threw back on his tight outfit and sandals and ran out into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Luckily, Link was smart enough to bring his lantern with him, providing a reasonable sized lighted area around him. The speed of which he walked was somewhat fast, he desperately wanted to find the swapping wand, before someone else uses it. \"I can't let that thing fall into the wrong hands.\" Link kept telling himself as he briskly walked down the dark forested path. Each step made his large, buxom body jiggle which up until this point, Link had been able to mostly ignore. But now, he was starting to shiver from each step, making him realize he was starting to feel the female sensations and 'urges' of the Great Fairy's body. \"Oh my,\" he gasped, starting to blush a little. He slapped his cheek a little to regain his focus on his mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The wind was howling quite a bit through  the forest, making the leaves on the trees above rustle furiously. Or maybe it was something following from above? This possibility entered Link's train of thought and he stopped. He turned his gaze up and looked at all the rustling tree. Aside from the rustling, it was rather quiet, putting Link at ease. \"But maybe there is something there.\" he said. Looking up, Link now noticed many lights in the trees above. Almost looking like stars, the lights flickered and danced, which wasn't a good sign to Link. One of the lights shot down, and Link could see he was being followed by....</span></div></div>",

'I knew this would happen.' Link thought. \"It's about time we met again.\" the Great Fairy with her melodious voice said. \"Although, you are usually the one visiting us.\" The Great Fairy, even with Link's old body, was managing to actually hover in the air. 'I knew it, she did keep her powers.' Link worriedly thought. One thing that Link noticed, besides the obvious, is that the Great Fairy's head wasn't as out of proportion with her new body as Link expected. Her head must've shrank some between then and the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Honestly, you don't know how happy we are to see you.\" she taunted as she flew circles around Link. The other lights from the trees above also came flying down, revealing themselves to be more fairies. \"Great Fairy, this isn't the time. I have to find-\" Link started to say but the Great Fairy held up her finger to shush him. \"I know what you are looking for.\" she pulled out the swap wand that had gone missing from Link's possession. \"You took it? Give that back!\" Link yelled and reached out a hand, only to have the Great Fairy fly up out of reach. \"Funny thing, you demanding I give you this back, when you yourself are a thief!\" she exclaimed. Link was speechless for a second. He crossed his arms in front of his breasts, squishing them a bit. He felt this and blushed a little. \"I-I don't know what you're talking about.\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"You're seriously trying to play dumb, when the very evidence is right below your freaking head?!\" she yelled. \"You stole my body, with this thing, er wand, or whatever.\" Link still had his arms crossed and started whistling. \"I...had good reasons?\" he meekly argued. The Great Fairy was taken aback by this. \"Good reasons?! You stole my body and say you have good reasons for it?\" she angrily inquired. \"Weeeelll, your body is taller and is much more useful in battle.\" Link stated. \"Yeah, cuz that's what I wanted to do with my body, go into countless battles and get hurt!\" the Great Fairy rolled her eyes as she spoke. \"Anyway,\" she continued, \"I'm taking back what's mine!\" Link quickly acted. \"And I'm keeping what's mine!\" he yelled back. Link quickly bent down and picked up a rock, only to throw it at the Great Fairy's hand. She didn't expect this and thusly was not prepared when it actually hit, causing her to drop the wand out of reflex. The wand fell to the ground in between Link and the Great Fairy. What happened next, no one expected......</span></div></div>",

He slammed the cheap lantern down onto the wand, setting a fire almost immediately. \"No!\" the Great Fairy screamed at the sight. During this whole tussle, no one had noticed the clouds rolling in overhead. A loud boom could be head after a spark of light. A storm had started and rain was pouring onto the fire. It turned to a downpour rather quickly and even then it took a minute just for the fire to be put out completely. All that was left was a small scorch mark in the grass, the wand's ashes having been completely washed away by the rain. \"You realize we're stuck this way, right?!\" the Great Fairy asked Link. He smirked and replied. \"Well, yeah. Why else would I have done that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The Great Fairy, feeling defeated, flew upward. \"C'mon guys,\" she addressed the other fairies. \"Let's cut our losses and head home.\" she sighed. \"At least this is isn't the worst thing that has happened to us.\" she and the other fairies continued conversing as they flew away. Link breathed a sigh of relief. \"I admit, at first I figured this body would only be advantageous on my adventures.\" he told himself. \"But now I'm starting to see....additional uses as well.\" he blushed. He sighed, having officially made his form permanent, as he intended. \"It's a shame that wand is gone though, who knows what else it could've done. Maybe there's more out in the world, I should check the Hyrule Town library tomorrow.\" he decided. After a yawn, Link traveled back home to get a good nights sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The next day, Link was in Hyrule Town, dressed in his tight outfit he made for what was once the Great Fairy's body. He carried his pack over his shoulder and walked into the central plaza. Surprisingly, no one paid too much attention to him, probably seeing him as some tall female (which wasn't uncommon to pass thru Hyrule.) \"Ok.\" Link thought looking down past his glorious cleavage, past his curvaceous body, and down to his wiggling dainty feet. 'So far, no one is acting differently. That must be a good sign.' he thought, not yet comfortable being out in public with his new female body. He shook his head and cleared away his doubts for the time being. 'Nevermind that. Ok, here for bras and the library, but which first?' he wondered. </span></div></div>",

Past most of the aisles he went, finally finding the one for brassiere and underwear. 'Might as well get some new panties here as well.' Link thought with a shrug. He searched as quickly as he could, picking out the ones that looked like they would fit him. Most of the bras and panties didn't match, since Link didn't care about that kind of stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        A little while later, Link was now in a fitting room, complete with a large mirror on the inner side of the door. He stripped down to his voluptuous naked form and looked in the mirror. His reflection gave him a huge surprise. Aside from the fact he had the Great Fairy's sexy body, he happened to notice his head looked different. No longer was it a comically tiny size, but was now more proportionate to his new body. His head still wasn't as large as the Great Fairy's, but it was only a tiny bit smaller. It wasn't just the size though, Link's head actually looked more feminine. He masculine jawline had become more soft and feminine. His lips were thicker and more pouty. His eyes and nose were more effeminate as well. Not to mention his Adams Apple appeared to have shrunk, which should cause Link's voice to change- \"Oh my gosh.\" Link proclaimed, quickly covering his mouth at hearing a more female voice escape his lips. \"Looks like keeping the Great Fairy's body changed my head too. Interesting.\" Link thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Link's overall new image gave him a bit of confidence. He paid for the undergarments that fit him and went on his way. \"To think that the magic from the wand could still be lingering after it's destruction. I really want to learn more about it now.\" Link smiled, not realizing how cute he now looked to passerbys.  \"Next stop, the library.\" he decided. </span></div></div>",

After all, the Great Fairy was probably about three times his size; if the wand didn't accommodate for the size difference, things could get pretty strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was the question of what to swap. Link may have been the Hero of Hyrule, but he was still a guy, and as such, he first thought was of the large orbs of flesh hanging from the Great Fairy's chest. Link blushed at the thought.

That was another thing entirely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link found he was no longer able to see his legs when he looked down, due to the huge mounds of flesh concealed beneath his tunic. It was clear that the Great Fairy's breasts had stayed their original size, despite now being on Link's smaller body, because while her breasts were big, they certainly weren't this big on her. Each individual breast was almost double the size of his head, heavily weighing him down. His tunic seemed to have adjusted to be able to fit his new assets inside of it, and yet the fabric still seemed to be straining itself whenever he inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... interesting,\" Link muttered to himself, not sure what to make of this. He hadn't really thought about the consequences of this. He had planned to take her breasts, and he was wondering whether the parts would stay the same size or not, but he hadn't really put two and two together and foreseen this outcome. He lifted them up with his hands, hoping to relieve the weight pulling on his chest a bit. They were heavier, and much more sensitive, than he had expected. \"This is ridiculous.\" How anyone would be expected to function with breasts this large, Link didn't know. But it certainly made it a bit strange that he was a man dealing these problems. Of course, it didn't need to be a problem. If he didn't want breasts bigger than his head, he could always give them back to the Great Fairy. Or even better, why not give them to someone else? Sure, he had been worried about swapping with his friends before, but now this all seemed safe enough. He could easily still try out having breasts while swapping for a smaller size, and giving one of his friends these mammoths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's thoughts were interrupted, however, as a random soldier suddenly came up to him, and after saluting, said, \"Link, the Princess wishes to speak with you as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was caught off guard by the sudden appearance of the solder, and quickly moved to hide the Swap Wand behind his back, letting go of his breasts in the process and feeling them bounce a little as they dropped. \"Alright,\" Link said, trying to hide his nerves, \"I'll go see her right away.\" Link was mentally freaking out. He had a magically artifact hidden behind his back, and a pair of enormous breasts hanging from his chest. He half expected the soldier to mention something about it, but he merely nodded, before saluting again and walking off back to his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once the soldier had left did Link finally calm down. He reassured himself that no one could see the changes; this was all normal to them. \"Heh, a world where THIS is normal, crazy,\" Link said, looking down at the large lumps pushing out the front of his tunic. However, he returned his focus to what the guard had told him; Zelda needed to talk to him. But before going to see her, Link had a decision to make; to keep the breasts, or not? Swapping these back now would certainly make it less awkward for him when talking to Zelda, but he wasn't sure he was ready to give them up yet. And even if he did think they were a bit big to manage, he was sure he could, at the very least, hold onto them until he found someone else to give them to, letting him take their smaller breasts.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps he could swap their lives around, so people would think he was the Great Fairy, but he'd still have his own body.

A magical artifact of this kind could prove to be unpredictable and dangerous, so he didn't want to use it on anyone he was too close to until he knew it was safe. That unfortunately threw out a lot of the more interesting choices, such as swapping with his female friends. Link thought long and hard about who to swap with, when suddenly he had an idea. The wand should work on people, but would it work on animals too? With this in mind, Link took the Swap Wand with him, and headed off to Hyrule Castle's stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, Link immediately sought out his faithful steed, Epona. Epona had carried him all over Hyrule, and he'd even rode her into battle sometimes. However, he wasn't above testing this wand on her. He ran his hand down her neck as he thought about what to swap with her. Link wasn't really sure what he should do. He was thinking about using a magical artifact to rearrange reality so he and his female horse had swapped something; this wasn't exactly an everyday occurrence. Perhaps he should just got for the most obvious thing; swapping bodies with her. It was a simple enough idea, although once he was a horse, the lack of hands might make it a bit difficult to swap back. He was kind of curious how the swap would work, though. If he had a horse's body, would he still be treated like he normally was? Would he still be Link, just with a horse's body, or would he be the steed while Epona was the hero? Besides, if he wanted to swap back, he could probably pick up the wand with Epona's mouth though, right?</span></div></div>",

Truthfully; he thought that battling the various monsters in Hyrule had become a little bit monotonous to him. He wanted something more exciting to happen; like him swapping bodies with his faithful horse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he used the Wand, Link decided to first open the door to Epona's stall and then to untie her rope. This wasn't just a random fancy, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink figured that swapping bodies with Epona could go one of two ways. Either he and Epona would have each others physical bodies and keep their own lives, (in which case Epona could re-tie herself with the rope while having Link's body), or they would end up in each others bodies without changing anything else, (in which case Link didn't want to be stuck inside the stall until someone would come to let him out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling Epona to stand still for a moment, Link prepared to wave the Swap Wand. Before he could, one final thought popped into his head. If he and Epona were to swap bodies without any other changes being made, then Epona would of course end up in his body which would perhaps complicate things, for even though she would have his Hylian body, Epona would still mentally be a horse; a horse with no idea whatsoever of how to be a Hylian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually made Link pause. If Epona were to keep her own mind while in his body, there was a high risk of the Swap Wand being discovered by someone else. After all, even the most dense Hylian would be able to figure out that something was wrong, if they saw who they thought to be Link acting just like a horse would! A female horse, at that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddering at the mental image of his own body being 'humped' by a stallion, Link decided to take one final precaution. Entering Epona's stall again, he picked up the rope that Epona was tied up with and tied it around his own waist. Link figured that this would work out in both scenarios.<br>\r\nIf he and Epona swapped physical bodies, but kept their own lives, then Epona could use her new hands to untie him and then tie herself up instead. If it was just their minds that would be swapped between their bodies, then Epona would already be tied up and not be able to run away with his body. Perhaps he could even teach her how to be able to walk on two legs, though it might be hard if he had her horse body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picked up the Wand once more, Link felt confident that he had ensured that Epona wouldn't be able to do something awkward with his body, while he tried out hers. With a smile on his face, Link thought about swapping bodies with Epona and waved the Wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of body-swap happens between them?</span></div></div>",

He was bent over forwards, standing on all fours, but it felt more comfortable that way, and he wasn't sure he'd be able to stand on two legs even if he wanted to. His body was much larger and more muscular, his head looking rather small attached to it, and everything except his head seemed to be covered in a fine coat of brown hair, save for his hands and feet, where the hair was white. Speaking of hands and feet, he didn't seem to have and fingers or toes anymore, as his hands and feet were now hooves instead. He had a thick, white mane running down his long neck, and he could feel a hairy tail sticking out of his tailbone. And to top it all off, there was a certain something missing from between his strong, equine legs. To say he felt different didn't even begin to describe it. When he had decided to swap with Epona, he hadn't really considered how different he and Epona were, and how it would feel to swap like this. Since Link didn't have hands anymore, the wand was instead held in his mouth. It wasn't exactly the most optimal situation, but he supposed it was better than just losing the wand altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt a hand running through his mane, reminding him that he wasn't the only one that had been changed, even if he was the only one who would know anything was different. Looking over to the side, finding it a bit odd to look around with his long, equine neck, Link saw his old body with Epona's large horse head sitting atop its neck. Her head looked huge on his body, making him realise how silly and small his head looked on her body. It was oddly comforting, feeling Epona running her fingers through his mane, her hand running down his neck, even if those fingers used to be Link's and that mane used to be Epona's. Epona seemed to be pretty content with this situation as well. While she was distracted with petting him, Link looked around for any evidence of how reality had changed due to the swap. Was Epona considered a hero now while he was her steed? Was he still the hero, despite having the body of a horse, and just carried Epona around with him for some reason? It didn't take him long to notice that one of the two of them was tied to a pole in the stable to prevent them from breaking out, and the one tied up was likely the one considered to be the steed. The one tied up was...</span></div></div>",

It was an amusing thought, that despite being a horse, save for his head, he still lived the life of a Hylian, while Epona, who was now mostly Hylian, was still considered a horse. Despite how freaked out he had been at the initial changes, Link was more intrigued by this new reality now. The lack of hands was a bit inconvenient, but he was pretty sure he could handle it for now. It's not like he was going to keep this permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, he wanted to go for a bit of a run to try out Epona's body. \"Well, I'm gonna go now, Epona,\" he said, finding it a little difficult to speak with the wand still held in his mouth. Epona tilted her head in confusing, noticing the wand. \"Uh, don't worry about it,\" Link reassured, hoping Epona wouldn't get too curious. Thankfully, Epona simply nodded, before opening up the gate of her stall so that Link could leave, seeing as he no longer had hands to open it himself. Link cautiously took a step forward, not sure how walking on all fours would work. He eventually got out of the stall, however, and Epona closed it behind him. As he walked out of the stables, he found that walking seemed to be a lot easier if he didn't think too hard about it, and just let Epona's body go on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading out of the castle to test out Epona's body, he decided to make a stop at his room first. Without hands, the only way he had of carrying the wand was in his mouth, which wasn't exactly the easiest thing to do. He didn't want to run the risk of it falling out while he was running around, so he decided it would be better to hide it in his room, and then come back for it later when he wanted to swap again. As he trotted through the halls of the castle, he found it somewhat amusing that no one seemed to find it odd that he had Epona's body, save for his head. People were still treating him as normal, save for stepping further to the side when he walked past, due to his larger horse body.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unbeknownst to Link, the Swap Wand actually had a mind of it's own. A mischievous one at that. And since Link was wondering what to swap with Epona, well, that was just too good an oppertunity to pass up. Activating itself, it hit both Hyrulian and horse with it's magic. All that was left to now, was to just enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head to make the stars in front of his eyes, disappear. Somehow, the Swap Wand had activated itself, without him doing anything! Link shooked his head faster. He really wanted to know, what the Wand had swapped between him and Epona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Epona, he could hear her making quite a racket, but he was still too disoriented to be aware of anything else. However, he could make out that she sounded distressed, judging by her whinnying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink slowly but surely got up. However, he still felt dizzy, so he placed a hand on his head to steady himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a second... A hand?! Epona whinnying?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly became fully awake; all traces of confusion and dizzyness instantly gone. Slowly, Link lowered his limb and lifted the other one, so they were both in his line of sight. He fell on his backside at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't just imagine it. Hands! He had hands! Somehow, he now had arms and hands, instead of fore-legs and hooves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growing sense of dread, Link moved his gaze downwards. He was deeply shocked at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't just have arms and hands; he also only had two legs, with feet at the end of them! Using his new hands, Link clumsily felt his head. His muzzle was gone, replaced with a nose and a mouth; he had pointy ears and there was no sign of his mane, exept for a large clump on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no other trace of his fur; instead, his new body was clad in some uncomfortable garments; a green tunic over a shirt of chainmail, sand-colored trousers, (along with the obligatory bulge... you know what I mean), a pair of brown boots on his new feet, and some kind of fingerless gloves on his new hands. Link saw that there were also a big sword and a shield, a blue scarf around his neck, and he could feel that there were some kind of headwear on his new head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Link was close to freaking out, completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on?!?' thought Link. 'Why am I like this? What has happened to my body?' Link just stared at his new form for a moment. 'What did that Swap Wand do? I... Hey... wait a minute. Isn't this...\" Link looked over his new body, one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This body... these clothes... I recognise them.' He looked himself over a third time, just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By the Triforce! I was right! I have Epona's body!!!' The realisation hit Link like a ton of bricks; he was currently in the body of his loyal steed, wearing all of her clothes, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...' thought Link, as he widened his, or rather Epona's, eyes in another realisation. 'If I have Epona's body, then...' Link lifted his -Epona's- head upwards, to look inside Epona's stall. Even though he had prepared for it, it was still a shock for him to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own body was inside Epona's stall; his big, muscular, brown-furred body, with the white-furred mane and tail, the hooves with the white fur around them, the muzzle and the friendly eyes and wearing the bridle, saddle and saddle-rug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched in slight disbelief, as his own body whinnyed, stomped, stumbled and twisted, like there was no tomorrow. Clearly, Epona was inside his body and freaking out a lot more than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill thrashing about, Epona send Link a look that clearly said: 'What's going on? Why am I in your body?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sent back an expression that said: 'I have no idea.' However, Link secretly thought: 'So, the Swap Wand swapped our bodies, like I originally planned. That's good; I thought it would do something wierd.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, the Swap Wand HAD done something wierd; it had not swapped their bodies, it had swapped their perceptions on whose body belonged to whom. The truth was, that both Link and Epona were in their normal bodies all along, but thanks to the Wand, they both thought that Link's body really belonged to Epona and vice versa. (Not that either of them were aware of this.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink started to worry; if Epona kept on thrashing around like that, then both she, and his body, might end up getting hurt. He had to calm Epona down, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried to whinney to calm her down, it had worked before. But he couldn't. Epona's body's vocal cords weren't designed to be able to whinney, resulting in Link giving off an odd whistle/buzzing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that didn't work,' thought Link. 'I guess I'll have to do it by hoof... or by hand, as the case may be.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Link moved Epona's body, to stand up. Being used to his own four-legged body, Link tried to stand like he usually did in his own body. But because he was now in Epona's body, he ended up in a weird position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, this is not going to work,' thought Link. With both his new hands and feet planted flat on the ground, his -Epona's- body ended up having the front-end closer to the ground than his back-end, causing his -Epona's- butt to stick up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd in the fact that both Epona's sword and shield were quite cumbersome when he stood like that, as well as the fact that her chainmail shirt weighted his new torso down conciderably, and even Link had to admit that he would not be able to walk like he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I have no choice,' thought Link. 'I'll have to walk like Epona if I want to reach her.' Link smirked a little. 'I've seen her walk on two legs lots of time. That shouldn't be too hard to do, since I'm now in her body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Link was wrong. It was a LOT harder, than he had ever thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Link tried to simply push his new front-end up, so he could stand on two legs. But since he was used to four legs and not two, he ended up falling over backwards, right on his -Epona's- behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in pain, Link then attempted to stand on two legs again, but got the same result; this time falling flat on his -Epona's- stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' thought Link, 'So maybe it isn't as easy as I thought, to walk on two legs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for something he could use for support, Link's choice fell on one of the wooden columns supporting the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Link got Epona's body up on all fours again. He didn't want to, it felt so strange in Epona's body, but it was the only way he could get over to the column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, clumsily and very awkwardly, Link walked on all fours in Epona's body, eventually reaching the column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, here goes nothing,' thought Link. Placing Epona's hands on the column to support himself, Link tried once more to stand on only two legs. This time he actually managed to stand up on two legs, but since he wasn't used to standing like that, his -Epona's- legs were very shaky and wobbley. In fact, it was only because he held on to the column, that he prevented himself from fallimg over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, Link,' he thought to himself. 'If you can defeat powerful monsters using nothing but your speed, your wit and your hooves, you can certainly learn how to stand up in Epona's body.' He looked down at his -Epona's- legs, as they wobbled like gelatine in an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Although this IS a lot harder that I thought it would be. How does Epona make it look so easy?' While Link still had no idea how to properly use Epona's mouth, he did manage to let out a sigh-like noise. 'Well, I'm not getting anywhere by just thinking about things.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating hard, Link tried to make his new legs stop shaking, eventually succeding. Then he attempted  to stand up, without support from the column. That didn't go so well, since his sense of balance was used to four legs and not two. The first time he tried, he almost fell down on his -Epona's- back again and he had to quickly grab hold of the column to prevent it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his ninth try, he finally managed to stand up, without any support, although he did have to sway with Epona\"s torso and had to swing her arms out to either side of him, before he found his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I did it! I'm standing up on only two legs!' Link thought in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, man, does this feel weird,' thought Link, as he looked down at Epona's body. He still wasn't quite steady on Epona's feet yet, they were still a little wobbley. 'I'm amazed that she can even move around like this. This whole body feels so strange.' Link wasn't just thinking about the two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole ordeal, Link had gotten new and odd impressions from Epona's body. The most prominent of these feelings, was that he was now wearing clothes. He had no use for those things in his normal body; all he needed was his bridle, saddle and saddle-rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut because he was now in the body of his horse, that meant he also had to wear her clothes. That he now had hands and feet instead of hooves was bad enough, but when they were trapped inside constricting gloves and boots, that was at least twice as unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't even see the point of clothes in the first place. He just didn't get why anyone, horse or otherwise, would want to cover up their whole body with such constricting things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other odd thing, was a bit below the belt. Litterally. Since he had Epona's body, he also had the 'package' between her legs. Every time he had moved, he had felt the 'package' gently rub against her pants. He had already decided that he wouldn't touch it; he didn't think it was ethical, him being in the body of his horse and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there on Epona's shaky legs, Link thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

This is, until he noticed what appeared to be his own body. His body was squatting low to the grow, pecking at the grass with it's hands tucked under its armpits. It wore a very blank expression on its face. It was a very surreal experience for Link, seeing his body from an outside perspective, not being controlled by him. He had a feeling he knew what happened, but he was afraid to look down and confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising he couldn't put it off forever, Link looked down at himself, and he was met with a small, round body, covered in white feathers. He had scrawny yellow legs, with four toes on each feet, three pointing forwards and one pointing backwards. He had long, feathery wings in the place of his arms, tucked up flat against his body. Instead of a mouth and nose, he had a hard yellow beak. But what probably freaking him out the most was not all the parts of his Hylian anatomy that he was missing, but rather the part of his male anatomy. He felt a distinct void between his legs. Sure, a Cucco's privates weren't usually dangling out on display, but even without looking, Link knew the parts he possessed were definitely female now. Link wanted to scream, but all that seemed to come out of his mouth was a clucking noise, new new avian vocal chords unable to make the sounds necessary for speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was a bit ashamed of his mistake. In his haste to get the wand away from the Cucco, he had ended up accidentally swapping bodies with it! Even though the wand should make it so everyone thinks all this is normal, he couldn't help but feel incredible embarrassed by the fact that he had the body of a female Cucco, while his body was busy acting like a farm animal. Remembering the wand, Link frantically looked around for it so he could reverse this swap, or at least make it better somehow. Thankfully, the wand still rested at his feet, but now Link was faced with the problem of how to actually use it. With his new birdy body, Link no longer had hands, and he doubted his wings would be much use in this situation. Perhaps he could pick it up with his feet, or in his beak? There had to be some way, he wasn't going to live out the rest of his life as a hen. Trying to imitate the way the Cucco had been pecking at the grass before, Link bent down and grabbed the wand with his beak. It would probably be a bit difficult to wave the wand like this without it falling out of his mouth, but it was better than nothing. The sooner he was out of this body, the better.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't entirely sure why she'd be looking for him, but this was a rather inconvenient turn of events. He quickly tried to wave the wand to swap bodies with the Cucco, but unfortunately, his thoughts began to get a bit muddled, and the outcome wasn't exactly what Link had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly found himself standing tall as a Hylian again, but he didn't even need to look at himself to know something was wrong. He could feel a weight hanging from his chest, and the same void between his legs as he'd felt in the Cucco's body. This was not his body. Looking down and confirming his suspicions, Link found that he was instead in Zelda's body. Even though he'd failed to get his own body back, this was at least an improvement from being a Cucco. He was actually somewhat interested in how these two bodies kind of stacked up. Both of these bodies were female, but in the Cucco's body, the difference in species was the overwhelming part, while in Zelda's body, the difference in gender was the most prominent difference. From her soft skin and long her, to the aforementioned private parts, being Zelda felt rather different to being Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that Link was human again, swapping everything back to normal should be much easier, due to the fact that he actually had hands. The wand seemed to have magically stayed with him, and now rested in his feminine hand rather than his mouth. Of course, it would be easier, if the Cucco sitting outside the castle hadn't noticed him and started waddling over to him. This was, of course, no ordinary Cucco, but rather, Zelda in the Cucco's body. Now Link started to stress out again. What if his thoughts got jumbled in his rush to swap back, and he messed up again? What if he was too slow and Zelda found out about the wand or something? Perhaps it would be safer to just play along with this reality for now and try to swap back once you had cleared your mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link shook his head, feeling Zelda's long, blonde hair swishing around as he did so. To try and swap back while he was still stressed out and his thoughts were muddled up would likely result in him messing up once again. Being in Zelda's body was nowhere near as bad as being stuck as a Cucco, so there wasn't as much of a rush to swap back. He didn't want Zelda to find out about the wand, though, so he wanted to put it away somewhere before she got too close to him. Zelda's dress unfortunately lacked any pockets, however. There was still somewhere for Link to hide it, but he was already blushing just thinking about it. Trying to put his embarrassment aside, Link shifted part of his armour to the side, and pushed the wand down into his cleavage, before repositioning the armour back on top. It was a bit uncomfortable with it stuck down there, and Link was still a bit embarrassed about it, but at least it was secure enough that it wouldn't fall out, and no one would find out about his little secret just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sorted out, Link crouched down lower to the ground as the Zelda-Cucco approached. She seemed to be clucking happily to see him. Link could only guess why Zelda had been looking for him, but now that Zelda was the Cucco, he guessed their roles were reversed, and he was probably looking for her. Or at least, he hoped so, because otherwise he'd have no idea what Zelda wanted from him, what with Zelda being unable to speak now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a wild guess, Link said, \"Come one, let's get you back to the castle.\" He knew he should have expected to hear Zelda's voice when he spoke, but it was still a bit off-putting. Suddenly, Zelda jumped up towards him. It caught him a little off guard, but he managed to catch her in time. For a second, Link thought Zelda might have have seen him hide the wand, and was trying to get at it by jumping at his chest, but that didn't seem to be the case. Zelda was content to just be carried, resting against his chest. With that sorted out, Link stood back up and headed back towards Zelda's room in the castle, the Zelda-Cucco in his arms, wobbling a little in Zelda's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through the castle, Link found it interesting that no one found it odd that he was walking around carrying a Cucco, and that they still referred to him as Link despite the fact that he looked like Zelda. He eventually made it to Zelda's room, only to find Impa pacing around in front of the door. She seemed to perk up when she saw him approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found her!\" she exclaimed as Link got close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had no idea what she was talking about, and simply replied with, \"Yeah, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Zelda over to Impa, who began petting Zelda's feathery body. \"Princess, you know you shouldn't wander off like that.\" Zelda made a clucking noise, but Link was unable to tell what she was trying to say. \"Thank you for looking for her, Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Impa took Zelda back into her room, and Link was free to do whatever he wanted. Now that that was done, he should be fine to go off and use the wand without stressing over things... hopefully. With the wand still nestled between his breasts, Link headed back to his room so he could concentrate. He assumed that with how powerful the wand was, he didn't need to actually need to see his targets in order to make the swap. He closed the door to his room and sat down on the bed, before fishing the wand out of his cleavage. Having Zelda's body had certainly been an interesting experience, even if it was an unintended one. In the walk to Zelda's castle, he had actually sort of gotten used to Zelda's body, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to give it up yet. At the very least, he wasn't sure he wanted his own body back just yet. He could do whatever he wanted with this wand, why should he be boring and just go back to normal so soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink laughed a little at his own thoughts. After going through the trouble of finding somewhere quiet where he could focus so he could get back to normal, and now he didn't want to go back to normal yet. At the very least, he didn't think it was fair to leave Zelda stuck as a Cucco, so he waved the wand, thinking about swapping the bodies of Zelda and the Cucco. That way, even if Zelda didn't have her body back, at least she was back to being a Hylian, and was able to speak normally. He didn't know if it worked, since he couldn't see either of them, but he just assumed it did. Now there was the question of what to do next. Link didn't want to go back to normal yet, but he didn't know if he wanted to just stay in Zelda's body either. The wand was right here if he wanted a new body, or he could swap something completely different, but perhaps it would be a good idea to just stay like this for a while before he messed around with reality even more.</span></div></div>",

Link squirmed a bit in her arms,not used to being so much smaller, and so easily lifted like that. \"Shhh, calm down, Link,\" Zelda said, running her hand down Link's feathery neck. \"I know you long for adventure, but until another war breaks out, it's safe for you to be here at the castle. Come on.\" And with that, Zelda started walking back towards the castle, taking Link with her. Link watched as the Cucco with his body disappeared into the distance. As far as he knew, the wand didn't need you to actually be able to see the person you were swapping with, so the Cucco wandering off with his body shouldn't be too much of a problem. He just hoped it didn't go out and hurt itself somehow, as he feared those injuries would then be given back to him when he got his body back. He didn't even want to think about what might happen if the Cucco died while still in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda continued to make her way towards the castle, still holding Link's fat, feathery body in her arms, Link pondered about what Zelda had said. Sure, reality had changed so that he had always been a Cucco, and if one of his friends was a Cucco, he probably wouldn't want them wandering into danger, but \"until another war breaks out\"? What did Zelda mean by that? Had Link still been the hero that defeated Ganon despite being a Cucco? It was an amusing thought, that the King of Darkness had been defeated by a mere farm animal. Or at least, it would have been amusing if Link wasn't stuck in the body of that farm animal. So despite being the hero that defeated Ganon, it was still too dangerous for a Cucco like him to be wandering around outside the castle? Link found that rather strange, but he supposed that was just the way reality restructured itself to accommodate the swap. He figured it probably wouldn't have been as drastic a rewrite if he had swapped with another person like he had meant to, instead of an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the castle, Zelda headed straight to Link's room. After Ganon had been defeated, Link was hailed as a hero, and given his own room in the castle to stay in, so he would be close at hand should tragedy strike again. However, when Zelda opened the door, it was clear a couple things had changed. A lot of it was the same; most of his furniture was still there, and most of his weapons were still hung up on his weapon rack, save for the sword and shield he had with him when he swapped with the Cucco. However, in place of his bed, there was now a large nest made of straw, and instead of his wardrobe, there was a large bag of chicken feed and a canister of water. The floor looked a bit messier, with bits of straw strewn around here and there. He assumed the bed had changed because a nest was a more appropriate bed for a bird, and his wardrobe had changed because, being a Cucco, he no longer wore clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda laid Link down on the nest and told him, \"I'll come get you if I need you, but for now, try not to wander off too far, okay?\" Link tried to protest, but once again, he could only make clucking noises instead of words. Zelda seemed to take this as a sign that Link understood what she was trying to tell him, and with a smile, she got up and left the room, shutting the door behind him. Now that he was finally alone, Link lifted up his wing, the Swap Wand falling out from underneath it. Now it was back to the problem of trying to pick up and wave the wand using his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, it would have been back to that problem, if it hadn't been for a much more pressing matter building up inside of him. Link wasn't entirely sure how to describe it. It was almost like he had to go to the toilet, but not quite. Instinctively, Link sat down, settling into the nest, and readied himself for what was coming. Whatever was building up inside of him was ready to come up. A large lump was forcing itself through his butthole, and into the nest. With a bit of force, and a satisfying plop, it finally ejected itself from his body. Link was quick to get up and see what it was. It was just as he had suspected; Link had just laid an egg. Link was a bit disgusted by this. It was bad enough being an animal, and one of the opposite sex at that, but now he was laying eggs? That was just gross. Link would have grabbed the wand and swapped immediately, if not for the fact that he felt the same feeling building within him again; he wasn't done laying yet. He begrudgingly sat down on the straw, and went back to work pushing the eggs out of his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was done, Link had laid five eggs, and he was completely exhausted. He had never experienced anything like that in his life. For some reason, he felt somewhat proud, looking at the products of his labor. But at the same time, it was weird to think that he had pushed those eggs out of his own body. Although, \"his own body\" was a somewhat relative term right now. His actual body was probably wandering about in a field somewhere, pecking at grass and bugs. Link let out the closest thing to a sigh that he could manage with this body. The hero of legend, the one who saved Hyrule by defeating Ganon, reduced to nothing more than a pampered farm animal in the castle. He slowly waddled over the where the Swap Wand had fallen in the nest, but found he barely even had the strength to pick it up right now. Laying those eggs had really taken it out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grumbled to himself as he sat back down on the nest. As much as he didn't want to admit it, the straw actually provided pretty comfortable seating for his new feathery behind. He looked around the room again. If not for the nest and the chicken feed, it almost seemed like the room of a normal person, like his old room. He wondered how he was even supposed to use the weapons he had sitting on the rack. Probably in the same way he wielded the Master Sword to defeat Ganon with it, which was another thing he had no idea how he'd done. The wand had made it so he'd done it, but apparently it didn't bother itself with little details like how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink glanced at the wand again. He'd prefer to be back to normal sooner rather than later. He didn't want to get too comfortable with the idea of being a Cucco. However, he was still too exhausted to hold the wand steady. Maybe it would work with just a little wave? The first swap had happened thanks to a big motion, a sweeping arc from his hips all the way up to above his head. All he'd probably be able to manage right now was a little wiggle. Maybe if he swapped something smaller, then a smaller wave would work? Of course, the end goal was to get his body back, but perhaps he could do something a bit smaller to make the wait easier on him. Then again, perhaps it was better to just wait until he had regained his energy and could hold the swap wand in his beak properly. That chicken feed in the corner was starting to look very tempting</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link decided that he'd probably have a better chance with only a small wave if he only tried for a small swap. As much as he wanted his body back, and he didn't really want to get too used to having this body, the wand wouldn't be going anywhere, so he could swap back into his own body once he had regained his energy. Plus, it wasn't like the his actual body was going to need its voice at the moment, since it currently had the mind of a Cucco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down again, and grabbed the wand in his beak. He could feel it slipping, not being able to grip it tight enough out of exhaustion, and quickly moved his head around a bit to wave the wand, thinking only of swapping voices with his old body. Before too long, the wand slipped out of his beak, falling back down onto the straw. Link was almost afraid to try speaking, not knowing whether the swap had actually worked or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" he asked allowed, before cheering in excitement that it had actually worked. He could talk again. Sure, his voice was coming out of the body of a female Cucco, but he was happy to have at least a little bit of himself. He was so happy, in fact, that he didn't even think to try swapping bodies with the small wave of the wand he was currently capable of doing. For now, he was content with just having his voice back, and waiting until he had regained his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of regaining his strength, Link felt his stomach rumble. He looked over at the bag of chicken feed, some of which have been put into a bowl laying on the floor in front of hit. \"Well... better than nothing, I guess.\" Link slowly waddled over to where the feed was, really feeling the exhaustion that the egg laying had brought on. He wondered if that was normal for Cuccos, or if he was just exhausted because it was his first time doing it. The feed didn't look to appetizing to his Hylian mind, just as he slowly started to peck at it, his Cucco body really seemed to enjoy it. He ended up eating more of it than he expected he would, feeling a bit bloated afterwords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waddled back to his nest, thinking a nap might help him regain his energy, he wondered about the changes to reality again. If he was still the hero who defeated Ganon, then did he still have the Triforce of Courage? He held out his left wing in front of him and focused. Sure enough, a trio of yellow triangles, one filled in while the other two just outlines, glowed amongst his feathers. He was grateful that that at least had transferred over to his new avian body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he settled down in the straw, Link looked at the Swap Wand again. What if someone came in to collect his eggs or something while he was napping? What if they saw the wand? What if they took it? Link couldn't take that risk. He had to hide it. But where? He knew he'd have trouble picking it up, otherwise he'd already be back in his own body, but he couldn't just leave it out there in the open. Instead, Link opted to bury it in the nest, pushing aside some straw with his feel to make a little hole, and pushing the wand into it, before covering up the hole again with more straw. That should stop anyone who came in from finding the wand, unless they specifically went digging through his nest for some reason. Link just hoped the hole wouldn't bee too difficult for him to find once he had had his nap. He didn't want to go building his strength back up, only to waste it all on digging through his nest trying to find the wand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, for now, the wand was safe, Link had his voice back, and he was done laying eggs for now, and that was good enough for him. He settled down in the straw, ready to take his first, and hopefully only, nap in the body of a Cucco.</span></div></div>",

As much as he wanted to just rest up and then swap back, he figured he couldn't just ignore whoever it was. He would have called out, telling whoever it was to come in, but the door had already opened, revealing Zelda's face behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, are you there?\" she asked, looking around the room. Apparently she hadn't spotted his white, fluffy body amongst the straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that the wand had worked its magic properly, and that it would be considered normal for him to be able to talk, Link called out to her. \"Over here, Zelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't see you there. Is everything alright?\" Link frowned, or at least he would have if he had a mouth instead of a beak. Was it normal for Zelda to check on him so frequently in this reality? He wasn't really sure how much time had passed between the egg laying and the eating, but he didn't think it had been that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, just a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's eyes went wide as she noticed the eggs sitting next to Link in the nest. \"Well no wonder! Five eggs in one sitting? You must be exhausted! I'll have someone come by to get those soon.\" Link let out a sigh of relief, now knowing that he apparently didn't normally lay that many eggs at once. Not that he planned on staying a Cucco long enough to have to start laying again, but if something went wrong and he was stuck like this for a while longer, it was good to know he wouldn't be doing five at a time every single time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you need something?\" Link asked. He didn't want to be rude, but the sooner he had his nap, the sooner he'd be able to regain his energy, and the sooner he'd be able to swap back into his own body. So, if he made sure Zelda got right to the point, that would hopefully speed things along.</span></div></div>",

I'll let you rest now. Someone will be by soon to get your eggs.\" With that, Zelda waved goodbye, and left, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Link was alone. Link was already sick of what the Swap Wand had done to reality. He was a fat, feathered, female bird, and had just laid a bunch of eggs against his will. He was still the hero of legend, meaning he probably knew how to defend himself, but people still felt the need to protect him and keep him out of harm's way. He hadn't been planning on going anywhere with this body anyway, but being confined to the castle meant people like Zelda constantly checking up on him. And now, he just wanted to get some rest, but he knew someone would be coming to get the eggs he had laid. He wasn't sure he'd be able to get to sleep with the thought that someone would be coming in here while he was asleep. What if they found the wand? Then again, he'd hidden it fairly well, hadn't he? Just to be safe. Link waddled over to where the wand was buried, and sat down on the straw it was buried underneath. That sound prevent anyone finding it while he was asleep, and help him find it again when he woke up.</span></div></div>",

Considering it was was around midday when he went to sleep, Link must have been more tired than he thought. However, now he was feeling refreshed and full of energy. He was also feeling strangely comfortable with his current body. Maybe a bit of rest had gotten him used to it or something, but regardless, this was kind of what Link had been afraid of. He didn't want to get too comfortable with this body, else he might not want to swap back, and right now, he didn't see any benefit to staying in the body of a female Cucco. Still, he didn't hate it as much as he did before his nap. In fact, Link was even considering turning back into a Cucco every now and then just for the fun of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for another time, because right now, Link wanted his real body back.

Hey, is that one of my batons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock, Link realised she was referring to the Swap Wand, which he had just unearthed. During the war against Cia and Ganon, Zelda had come across a strange baton-like weapon, capable of summoning gusts of wind. Although the Swap Wand did much more than that, Link had to admit that the wand did look very similar to Zelda's batons. \"No, it's not,\" Link tried to explain. \"It's um, it's just something I found outside the castle.\" He didn't want to give too much away. He had found the swap wand himself, and although he would consider Zelda a friend, he wanted this power to be his and his alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, however, didn't buy his vague explanation for a second. \"Link, you shouldn't take things that don't belong to you. Give that here.\" She walked towards him, hand outstretched to take the Swap Wand. Link was desperate now. He had to do something to stop Zelda from getting the wand. If she got it, he'd probably be stuck as a Cucco for the rest of his life while Zelda got to have fun with the wand herself, Link left oblivious to all the changes. Funnily enough, the wand was what he wanted to protect, but it was also his only way out of this, or at least, the only way Link could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured that now he had his energy back, he was wave the wand pretty well in his beak, but that left the question of what to swap. Maybe if he swapped himself with something, he could get out of here, stopping Zelda from taking the wand from him. His old body was definitely an option. Of course, this would assume that swapping bodies with someone would actually put him over where that body was, rather than just transforming his body right here in the room. Alternatively, he could swap Zelda with something. Maybe he could make her not want to take the wand from him somehow, or make her unable to take the wand. Perhaps he could even swap with her himself. As Zelda approached, Link realised the time for thinking was over; now was the time for action. Link quickly bent down, grabbed the wand in his beak, and with a twist of his neck, swung the wand around in front of him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After waving the wand, Link suddenly felt much taller, closer to his original height. Although, despite being about as tall as his old body, pretty much everything else felt different. He had long blonde hair flowing down his back, and his skin felt much softer. His limbs were much slimmer, his waist thinner, and his hips wider. He was wearing a dress, along with several pieces of gold armor. And most importantly, he still had a void between his legs, but now he also had a pair of breasts hanging from his chest. Link had no doubt in his mind about what had happened; he had swapped bodies with Zelda. That had, after all, been his last idea before waving the wand and thinking about stopping Zelda. He had already been a female while in the Cucco's body, but being a female Hylian, one of his friends no less, felt a lot different, and made him rather uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Zelda, Link could only assume that the Cucco sitting on the ground in front of him was the same Cucco who's body he had been in, now inhabited by Zelda. Despite her avian body, she would probably still have his old voice, and she should think this was all normal. He briefly wondered how exactly the swap had played out. It was obvious he had Zelda's body, and Zelda had that of a Cucco, but until Zelda spoke, there was no real way of telling whose life he was living. When he swapped with the Cucco, he gained the Cucco's body, but kept his own life, a fact that had been made obvious by the way the Cucco had been acting in his body before Zelda whisked him away back to the castle. But considering he wanted the wand to make it so Zelda couldn't, or wouldn't want to, take the wand from him, it would be just as advantageous, if not more so, for him to have been put into the life of Zelda. After all, Zelda wanted to take it off him because she thought it was one of her batons, so if he actually was Zelda now, she wouldn't have a reason to take it from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard his own voice, coming out of Zelda's Cucco body, interrupting his thoughts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Link, I said give me that!\" Link heard his own voice shout, although it wasn't him doing the shouting. His voice was still coming out of the body of the Cucco, which now belonged to Zelda. It would seem that, just like with the Cucco, the wand had merely swapped Link and Zelda's bodies, leaving them in their own lives. At the very least, Link found that with his added height from having a Hylian body again, he could easily keep the wand out of Zelda's reach. Now it was just a matter of convincing her that it wasn't one of her batons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, this isn't one of your batons, I promise,\" Link said, trying to not be too off-put by the fact that Zelda's voice was coming out of his mouth instead of his own. He supposed it was a normal side effect of the body swap, considering he had the Cucco's voice when the swapped with it before, but it was still a bit unsettling to hear his words come out in a female voice. \"I found it myself, just like how you found your batons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda narrowed her eyes at Link, staring up at him from her now shorter stature. \"Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink put a hand on his chest, flinching a little as it touched one of his breasts. \"Cross my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed. \"Alright, I guess I believe you. I should probably be heading back to my room anyway. Just, stay out of trouble, Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" he replied, as she waddled her little Cucco body out the door. Since she didn't have any arms, the door was left open, but Link shut it behind her to make sure he had some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to where the nest had been before, only to find it had now been replaced with a bed, looking something like a cross between his old, simpler bed, and Zelda's more elaborate, royal one. The floor was now also devoid of straw, and his wardrobe was back in the place of the feed bag, although opening it up, Link found it now contained Zelda's dresses rather than his own clothes. Reality had once again been restructured, this time so it was normal for the hero of legend to have a woman's body, and for the princess of Hyrule to be a talking Cucco. He wondered whether he was still considered a man, despite his body. No one had mentioned anything about his gender from what he could recall while he was in the Cucco's body, so he really had nothing to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sat down on his bed, thinking about how much reality was messed up right now. His old body as probably out in a field somewhere, eating bugs and grass, while having the voice of a Cucco. Then there was Zelda, who, despite being the princess of Hyrule, had the body of a Cucco, and Link's old voice. And Link himself still had his own life as the hero of legend, but he now had Zelda's body. This wand was clearly powerful and not the be taken lightly, something Link knew all too well after finding himself in two female bodies of different species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, while it would now be very easy for him to go ahead and take his own body back, he wasn't sure he wanted to yet. He had just landed in Zelda's body, and while it had initially made him uncomfortable to have a female body of his own race, he was now more curious than anything. What was it really like to be a woman? Even if he was still still considered a man thanks to still being in his own life (something Link made a mental note to check later), just having Zelda's body was an interesting experience in itself, one that he wasn't willing to give up so easily. After all, he had spent a few hours in the Cucco's body, and had experienced eating chicken feed and laying eggs, why should he give up Zelda's body after only a few minutes. Not to mention, if a fight broke out, Zelda's body should still be strong enough to use most, if not all of his weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'll be holding onto you for a little longer,\" Link said, looking down at the female body he now possessed. He frowned slightly. Despite his eagerness to keep Zelda's body for a while, it was still a little unsettling to hear her voice instead of his. As a Cucco, it hadn't bothered him as much, since he wasn't able to talk at all with the Cucco's voice. But with Zelda's voice, it just felt strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the matter of what to do with Zelda. Although Link was putting off getting his own body back, he didn't know if he should leave Zelda as a Cucco. Sure, she, and everyone else besides him, thought it was normal, but he still thought it was a bit weird for the princess, and one of his best friends, to be a talking Cucco with his voice. Perhaps he could at least give her his old body, and give the Cucco its body back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, so long as he held the wand, anything he did with it would be reversible, so why should he waste time fixing things now? He could be playing around with reality and messing things up even more. Or better yet, playing around with his new body. Just to get used to it, of course.</span></div></div>",

His life had changed quite when he became a Cucco. He wasn't really aloud to leave the castle, he slept in a nest, laid eggs, ate chicken feed, and was had Zelda checking on him rather frequently. He also realised that as a Cucco, he wasn't expected to go on regular patrols like he usually was, rather being kept safe inside the castle until some sort of emergency. Aside from Zelda's checkups, it wasn't actually too bad, something he hadn't realised because of how much he was in a hurry to get back to normal. Although he didn't particularly want to become an animal again, and lose his hands, perhaps there was a way to swap things around so that he'd be treated like one. For instance, he might be able to change people's perception of him and Zelda, so that despite their bodies, people would believe Zelda was a Hylian, and he was a Cucco.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link decided to test out whether this would actually work. The simplest way to be treated like a Cucco would have just been to swap lives with a Cucco, such as the one who's body Zelda now had, but right now, he wanted to keep his own life, but be treated as if he were a Cucco. This would also make Zelda be treated like a Hylian again, despite still having the body of a Cucco. It took him a while to figure out exactly how to word the swap, but eventually settled on swapping \"how people perceived what species he was\" with Zelda, hoping it would make people think he was a Cucco, without actually turning him into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the wand waved, Link looked around his room to see if it had worked. His room now resembled what it had been while he had the Cucco's body, except the nest was bigger, to fit Zelda's body, and the feedbag was next to the wardrobe rather than replacing it, since he was still wearing Zelda's clothes. Most importantly, though, despite the Cuccofied changes to the room, Link still had Zelda's body. The swap had worked, hopefully like Link had envisioned. He was still a Hylian, but considering he now had a nest instead of a bed in his room, he assumed the rest of the world saw him as a Cucco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easier than I expected,\" Link said to himself. After his nap, he was feeling a little peckish again, and looked over that the chicken feed sitting next to his wardrobe. As a Cucco, his mind had been reluctant to eat it, but his body had enjoyed it. Now, though, he still had the body of a Hylian, despite what everyone else would now think. Would he still be able to eat the chicken feed like this? \"Only one way to find out.\" Link knelt down in front of the bag, took out some of the feed, and put it in his mouth.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure if this was just normally what chicken feed tasted like, or if his tastebuds had been changed to facilitate him being treated like a Cucco. He ate enough to not feel hungry, which only amounted to a small snack this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what now?\" Link wondered aloud. \"I have Zelda's body, and people think I'm a Cucco, so I don't have to do anything unless there's an emergency.\" He looked down at the Swap Wand again, thinking he might be able to do another interesting swap, when suddenly he felt a familiar feeling building inside of him. \"What? But... But I'm not a Cucco!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his anatomy not matching what was about to happen, Link knew what was going on, and squatted down in his nest. He pushed, just as he had when he was a Cucco, and squeezed and egg out of his behind. However, unlike last time, Link was wearing clothes, something he hadn't payed attention to until the egg was already out, and sitting inside his panties, pressing up against his bottom. Before he had a chance to get it out, another egg started to make its way out, leaving Link with no choice but to continue with it. Thankfully, once the second egg was out, that seemed to be the end of it. He pulled down the shorts and panties that Zelda wore under her dress, spying the eggs resting inside his underwear, remarkably unharmed. Link supposed that if people thought he was a Cucco, that meant he needed to be able to do Cucco things, like eating chicken feed and laying eggs. He took the eggs out of his panties, laying them in the nest, feeling strangely disappointed that he'd only laid two this time, before pulling his shorts back up. He'd have to remember to pull his shorts down next time he had to lay, provided he kept reality like this long enough for this to happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down in the nest, alongside his eggs. He wasn't as tired as when his Cucco body had laid five eggs, but he still needed to take seat for a while. He looked down at the Swap Wand again. Although he hadn't expected to still be laying eggs while still in Zelda's body, he was still amazed at what the wand was capable of. He wondered whether he should try out another swap, or if he should just stick with what he had for now. There were plenty of other interesting things he could do, but it might also be good to not go too overboard with the swaps.</span></div></div>",

There were too many unknowns, and he wasn't prepared to risk it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Link thought about perhaps swapping some body parts, since he had only considered options to do with lives before. He knew he didn't want the Cucco body back, for now at least, since it would hamper his ability to use the wand, but what if he kept his hands, or more accurately Zelda's hands.

The Cucco parts must have grown to accommodate being attached to Zelda's Hylian body. He could only assume that Zelda's original legs, which were now back with the original Zelda, had shrunken down to a size appropriate for her Cucco body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked over his new body. From the waist up, he still had Zelda's beautiful body, but halfway down his waist, fluffy white feathers began to form. From there, his body buldged out from where his hips should be, his pelvic area extending down to where the middle of his thighs used to be, to compensate for his shorter Cucco legs. His thighs were still covered in feathers, but from the knees down, his thin legs were covered in nothing but leathery yellow skin, leading down to his four-toed avian feet. The proportions definitely felt a bit different from Zelda's legs. A Cucco's legs were much shorter on its body than a Hylian's, so by taking the Cucco's entire lower half, rather than just the legs, Link's pelvic area was now much larger than it usually was, and his legs were shorter. His feathery parts bulged out at the sides, and even at the front a little, but they extended out at the back more than anything. In fact, his tail feathers had lifted his dress up so far that would have been rather indecent if he'd still had the parts of a Hylian. speaking of the dress, Link noticed that while he still had all the clothes worn on his upper body, the dress included, the shorts, panties, and boots he'd been wearing were now gone, presumably being worn by Zelda. He figured it was better this way, not complicating things by modifying all the clothing to fit his new parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand along his feathery behind, Link smiled. It was such an odd feeling, having the top half of Zelda's body, and the bottom half of a Cucco, and he kind of like it. He decided to keep his new parts for now, at least until the novelty of it wore off. Looking around his room, he noticed it hadn't changed too much. He still had a bed, which still looked like a cross between his old bed and Zelda's, and he still had a wardrobe, although the pants and boots were gone from it, along with the panties that had been in his drawers. Reality had once again readjusted, making it normal for him to have to lower body of a Cucco. It was all so exciting, and Link would have explored further, if not for a familiar feeling building up in his pelvic area.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, it wasn't hard to realise why; he was completely naked. Even stranger, however, was that the Cucco standing in front of him seemed to be wearing a miniature replica of his tunic, adjusted to fit its avian body. It didn't take Link long to realise what had happened; he must have accidentally waved the wand and triggered a swap between himself and the Cucco. Well, that wasn't what he had intended to use it for, but the wand was still in his hand, so it should be pretty easy to swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do so, however, the Cucco spoke. \"Wow, this is different,\" it said, in a scratchy voice that sounded vaguely female. Link was shocked to hear the Cucco actually speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to reply with, \"You can talk?\" but all that came out was an awkward clucking sound. That shocked Link even more. Why couldn't he speak anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm a Hylian then. This should be fun.\" The Cucco turned around and started heading towards the castle. Link was more than a little alarmed by this turn of events. It seemed that despite him clearly being a Hylian, and the Cucco still being a bird, the Cucco was wearing his clothes and talking, while he was naked and stuck making clucking noises. Despite their bodies, they seemed to be stuck with the abilities of each other, and he had a bad feeling that the rest of the world would see him as a Cucco, despite clearly being a Hylian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink squawked angrily at the Cucco before it left, and it turned back around to face him. \"Oh come on,\" it said, \"Can't you just let me be you for a while? Being a Cucco's not that bad.\" Link squawked again to voice his disapproval of that idea. \"Look, with that wand, you can be whoever you want. I'm not even gonna take the wand off you, you can keep it. Just let me be a Hylian for a while, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was a little confused as to how the Cucco knew about the wand and what was going on, but then he remembered how he learned about what the remote could do the moment he picked it up. The Cucco had probably learnt about when it was pecking around at the wand, and it was aware of the swap due to holding onto it with its beak when he accidentally waved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did still have the wand, and he could swap back as soon as he wanted, but perhaps he should just let this Cucco live his life for a little while. What's the worst that could happen? Not to mention, he'd seen what happens when you mess with Cuccos before, and it wasn't pretty. If he swapped back now, there was always the chance this Cucco could call their friends and overwhelm him, stealing the wand for themselves.</span></div></div>",

Even though the consequence of not messing with them was temporarily losing the right to be himself, he wasn't ready to be on the receiving end of a Cucco attack right now. For all he knew, they'd take the wand from him, and he'd lose his life again, and possibly more. For now, he'd just have to accept that he'd be living someone else's life for a while, while a Cucco filled in for him. He reluctantly nodded, agreeing to the Cucco's terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cucco seemed pleased by this. \"Goodie! Thanks a bunch. Well, if you plan on staying a Cucco for a while, I live in a village not too far from here. There's a girl there that takes care of me and the other hens, feeding us and collecting our eggs, but she lets us roam free if we want.\" Link gulped at the mention of \"me and the other hens\". It was bad enough that he was considered a Cucco right now, but apparently he was also a female one. \"Well, you know where to find me if you need me. See ya!\" And with that, the Cucco waddled off, heading into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt more than a little vulnerable. He was currently squatting naked in a field, but as far as the rest of the world was concerned, he was just a normal, female Cucco. He wasn't really sure not to do now. He could try living as a Cucco for a while, or he could swap lives with someone else he knew. As he thought it over, he wandered absentmindedly towards the only village he knew of nearby Hyrule Castle; the village where Linkle lived. On one hand, it would be very strange to be treated as an animal for any length of time, especially one of the opposite gender. He couldn't help but wonder if any modifications had been made to his body to allow him to function as a female Cucco, such as gaining the ability to lay eggs or something. It would still be a little awkward to live someone else's life, but it would probably be less awkward than being treated like an animal. But on the other hand, swapping into someone else's life would force them to live the life of Cucco for as long as you were them. They wouldn't realise anything was wrong, of course, but it still felt a little bad to force someone into that role. As you approach Linkle's village, you decide that for now, you're going to...</span></div></div>",

No, he'd borrow someone else's life for the time being, until the Cucco decided it had gotten sick of being him. He hoped it wouldn't be long, and that she'd want to go back to being a Cucco before long, but until then, he'd just have to made do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the question of who to swap with. Whoever he swapped with you be stuck as a Cucco for the time being, but they wouldn't notice that they'd swapped, since they weren't holding the wand, so it would probably be fine. In fact, that gave him an idea. While the Cucco had been aware of the swap, thanks to her having the wand in her beak, she wouldn't be aware if he made another swap. He could try swapping back with her, but considering she'd already touched the wand, giving her knowledge of how it worked, she might be able to work out what he'd done, and then he'd have to suffer the consequences of going against her. Instead, he thought that perhaps he'd swap with someone he was close to, someone who's life he'd be able to use to spy on his old life, and make sure the Cucco wasn't screwing anything up. That way he'd be able to stop her if she did anything terribly out of character for him, but she wouldn't even know he was there thanks to the wand's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Link could only think of two real candidates for such an espionage mission. The first was Impa, captain of the guard. Link had been on rather good terms with her ever since he'd been discovered as the legendary hero who would save Hyrule. While she was a woman, her armour wasn't particularly feminine, nor was the way she acted. However, between overseeing new recruits and taking care of Zelda, she didn't have much free time. On the other hand, there was Zelda herself. The two of them had grown quite close as the overcame the ordeal that was Ganon's onslaught. She did have some royal duties to attend to, but in Link's experience, she seemed to have more free time than Impa. However, unlike Impa, Zelda tended to dress and act in a rather feminine manner, rarely being seen wearing anything other than dresses and high heels. Link knew that if he swapped with her, that was what would be expected of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough choice, and each had their own pros and cons. Of course, this was just an idea. He didn't have to keep an eye on the Cucco if he didn't want to. He could always just swap with someone else and hope she didn't mess up his life while she was in it.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't entirely sure why she came to mind, but he didn't think she'd really be a good choice to swap with for one big reason; she was dead. However, as Cia and Lana had proved, it was certainly possible for magic to cross the bounds of time. Perhaps the wand could do the same, allowing him to swap with his companions from different time periods, or allowing him to swap with Cia from a time when she was still alive. Despite initially deciding that Cia was a bad choice to try out the wand, Link was now intrigued, and felt the need to test whether the wand's magic could cross the ages. Sure, he could have tested it on one of his companions from across time, but he was so focused on swapping with Cia now that he hadn't even considered it. Now it was just a question of what to swap. The most obvious thing was her body. He wasn't sure he wanted to be a woman, but it would certainly be an easy (and obvious) test to try. Of course, there was no rush, he had plenty of time to think of other swaps to try.</span></div></div>",

It seemed as though he was peering through the holes of a mask, but he wasn't looking at Hyrule Field anymore, but rather at the Valley of Seers. He was no longer alone, instead looking over a group of other warriors. But most importantly, he could feel a big difference in his body. From the large weights hanging from his chest, to the thin waist and wide hips, and even to the wind hitting his body thanks to his more revealing outfit, Link could tell he wasn't himself anymore. He had switched bodies with Cia! Thankfully he wasn't stranded here, however, as he could still feel the wand in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Link, run!\" he heard a voice shout. It didn't take him long to realise the voice wasn't calling to him. The group in from of him, who he now recognised as Lana, Impa, Zelda (disguised as Sheik), and his old body, turned and ran in the opposite direction from him. Link wasn't entirely sure what was happening, until he was the completed Triforce floating in front of him. He must have swapped with Cia at the point where she disrupted time, calling forth locations from other eras. It was one of his most vivid memories of Cia, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cia...\" he heard another voice say, this time speaking to him. \"The time to call the fragments of my spirit is NOW.\" Link recognised that voice; it was Ganondorf. He wanted Link to use the Triforce to call forth the fragments of his spirit from across the ages. He couldn't allow that to happen! If he was Cia now, he could put a stop to this! However, before he did anything, Link stopped to think about what doing this would mean. He was currently in the past, in Cia's body, thanks to the wand. If he changed what Cia had done in the past, would that not affect the future? If he stopped Cia from resurrecting Ganondorf, would things be different when he swapped back with his body in the present? Perhaps it would be safer to simply play along and do as Cia did. Even safer, though, would probably be to not interfere at all, and simply use the Swap Wand to get out of here, either going back to the present, or at least to a less influential role here in the past.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention, he didn't know what was happening to his body right now. Was past Cia in his body in the present? Was his body acting as if it was still him? Was it merely unconscious? On the other hand, using the wand again could put things right, allowing him to return to the present, and stop messing around with the timeline. From there, he could continue mess around with the wand in a safer way, one that didn't have the possibility of altering the course of the timeline. However, he was still a bit worried. When he swapped with Cia, Cia was already dead and gone in his time, so the wand sent him back in time to when Cia was alive. Now the he was Cia, if he wanted to swap back into his own body, there were two options to choose from; his own body in the present, and the version of him here in the past. If he messed up and swapped with past Link, then past Link might screw things up with the timeline by not obeying Ganon. Was that a risk he was willing to take right now, at such a pivotal moment in history?</span></div></div>",

On his quest to stop Cia and Ganon, he'd met many allies from various points in Hyrule's history. Would the wand work on them, even though they weren't in this time period anymore? With that in mind, he decided to narrow down his options to his allies from other time periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that still left him with quite a few options to choose from. However, as he deliberated over which one to test the wand on, one in particular came to mind. It was another princess of Hyrule, also named Zelda, however she had fallen victim to a curse which forced her spirit out of her body, essentially turning her into a ghost. As such, she possessed a cursed suit of armor known as a Phantom in order to aim the group when fighting. Would the wand work on someone like her? Perhaps compounding the two tests wasn't the smartest idea, but now Link was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that he had a target in mind, he still needed to decide what he should swap. The most obvious thing would be to swap bodies, but how would something like that work on someone who was a ghost and didn't have a body? Would it put her in his body while he turned into a ghost? Would she gain his male body, while he gained her female spectral form? Would it give him a Phantom's body instead of Zelda's? Would he swap with her at a point in time when she still had a body, since her ghostly self wasn't in this time period anymore? Link's curiosity continued to grow, but perhaps compounding three tests atop one another wasn't the smartest idea.</span></div></div>",

She seems to be warming up to him, though, so it's been starting to happen less often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, remembering how Zelda had wanted to go investigate some inactive Sheikah shrines not too far from the castle, ran towards the castle stables to get his horse and go out to find her. However, Link suddenly tripped on something while on his way there. Checking to see what it was, he found a wand of some kind. Curious as to why such a thing was lying around, he picked it up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, a slew of information popped into his head, as if the wand itself had given this to him. This was known as the Swap Wand: a wand whose wielder can exchange physical, mental, or or other kinds of attributes with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was immediately intrigued by what he could do with such a thing. Perhaps he could switch something with Zelda to find out where she is?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link suddenly found himself in what appeared to be Princess Zelda's Study, sitting in a chair and having dropped a pen while writing into a journal. What was being written in the journal didn't matter as much as this sudden change in location, though. Before even beginning to look around, Link could already tell he simply felt different. He felt slimmer, heavier near his chest, and a foreign sense of emptiness in between his legs. Link was breathing from his mouth, and he could even tell that the faint whisper of his voice while breathing was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then began to look around. He noticed his hair was now longer than what it had been before, (as Link did have shoulder-length hair, but kept it in a short ponytail at all times) and felt it reaching down towards his tailbone. He then looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing what appeared to be Zelda's formal dress, and that he had two mounds on his chest that he never had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't even need to look at the rest of himself or the room he was in to know what had happened. The wand had worked, and he had switched bodies with Princess Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is real...\" Link muttered to himself, surprisingly but at the same time unsurprisingly in Zelda's voice. He lacked Zelda's more refined and noble way of speaking, however, so hearing Zelda's voice in a more common accent felt very unnatural to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood up from his chair, and walked towards Zelda's room across from the study to see himself in a mirror, looking at the rest of his new body along the way. Seeing the rest of the dress, his new, slender arms and feet, and even feeling larger hips and a larger rear than previously had. Link also noticed that he was carrying the Swap Wand in his hand, something that he didn't catch before. Was he holding it the whole time? Does the Swap Wand follow him when he switches to someone else's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he entered Zelda's room, he went towards the mirror, finally seeing Zelda's reflection mimic every movement he made. This out-of-body experience he was having now was something very few, if no one before him, could ever relate to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink started to think while he watched as Zelda's reflection copy everything he was doing. He was just switching with her to find out where she was, so it was probably best to switch back into his own body now. However, was the princess now. He has such a beautiful body, and he can practically get anything he wanted. Maybe it would be nice to stay in Zelda's body a while longer? He feels he deserves a break anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, the Calamity Ganon could appear any moment, and Zelda still hasn't awakened her powers. This would only be a waste of time and possibly detriment the whole plan to defeat it. Was it worth taking the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thought deeply on this as he gently stroked his new long, soft hair...</span></div></div>",

He was ready to go to the castle and finally help Princess Zelda and defeat calamity Gannon once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or am I?\"  Link reluctantly said to himself alone atop a mountain as he gazed down on the vast world he had explored.  He had visited so many trials, defeated so many monsters, and helps everyone that he could.  But why did he do it?  He told himself that he did it all to help as many people as he could, he told himself he needed to visit every shrine to become as strong as possible.  \"But am I strong enough?\"  Link again asked himself.  He knew the fate of all of Hyrule rested on his schoulders but that was also the case 100 years ago and he had failed.  Had he really become strong enough to finally defeat evil once and for all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink knew he couldn't stand on the mountain forever, so with doubt in his mind and heart he took his first step towards Hyrule castle and the end of his adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate however seemed to have something else in mind, another trail of sorts?  A tool that could help defeat Gannon?  Or something that could spell Link's end.  That was for Link to determine as he saw what he first thought to be a shooting star shoot down and land mere feet away.  Briefly forgetting his destiny, Link ran to the small crater where a small baton like object was waiting.  Summoning up his significant amount of courage, Link reached down and picked up the wand and all of the sudden a rush of information filled his mind telling him what this object was and how it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this, I can do it.  I can without a doubt have the power to defeat the Gannon.  But who could I possibly swap with in order to become strong enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong.  There were many people he had met in his journey he would call strong.  Most of them in spirit, but Link felt he would need more than emotional support to win the day.  And then Link got an idea.  He knew strong people, in fact he felt he had strong people along within him on this journey as he defeated each Divine Beast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha, the Zora with a huge heart and healing powers that saved him more times than he could count.<br>\r\nDaruk, the Goron who's powerful shield protected him from lethal blows regularly.<br>\r\nRevali, the Rito who's wings gave him flight to survey the land and attack foes from above.<br>\r\nUrbosa, the Gerudo who could summon lightning at the snap of a finger to go along with impressive physical abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had access to all of these power's, but he was just borrowing them and could only use them so many times.  Perhaps if he swapped something with one of his friends and master even just one of these powers he believed he could be strong enough to potentially win the day.  So Link closed his eyes and concentrated on one of his long lost friends and waved the wand.</span></div></div>",

He had gone in thinking he could just charge in and save the world with just courage, will, and a blade alone.  Link felt he knew better now, he wanted to take a more defensive approach.  Link quickly said to his friends he felt were listening, \"I'm sorry Revali, Urbosa.  You're power and friendship helped me so much but I don't think you can help me now.\"  Thinking about his friends caused a tear to slide down Link's face.  But now was not the time for tears, he had more preparations to make.  So Link began to weight the pros and cons of using the Swap Wand on Mipha or Daruk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha was strong of spirit and heart but not as much in braun.  But with her healing arts at Link's side he had already charged into otherwise losing battles many times and been victorious.  And Link felt if he used the Swap Wand on her spirit the resided with him he would be able to heal himself so quickly and frequently he could never fall in battle.  He could just stand and fight over and over again healing himself until he won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if he chose Daruk he would had the power to stand up to the biggest and baddest of Ganon's army.  With Daruk's abilities he could get his with the eye lasers of every mechanical creature in Hyrule and he could probably laugh it off much like Daruk would do.  And his physical strength wasn't something to take lightly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink knew he might only be able to swap abilities and powers with one of them and Link finally made his choice as he waved the Swap Wand in the air.</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't just her powers like Link had thought about when he first thought of the swap.  He admired so much about her, how strong she was when people needed someone to look up to, her willingness to go into battle with her Lightscale Trident in hand, her ability to be a Zora that all other Zora would admire.  Everything he cared about in Mipha is what he thought of and so that is what he swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink no longer felt like himself.  His entire body felt like it had shifted and had become something else.  His skin had become sleek yet slightly scaly upon close inspection.  Then his skin began to change colors, it became a light green that matched the tunic he was wearing with streaks of red and blue that reminded him of Mipha's skin the the outfit she would wear.  He felt the back of his head that now had a weight to it and sure enough he had the same tail like protrusion that the Zora had.  Link realized swapping such vague ideas with Mipha had turned him into a Zora.  And as he crossed his arms across his chest he realized that wasn't the only thing he'd swapped.  Link felt something odd and looked down his tunic and saw two bumps there that certainly weren't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was in a bit of shock as he looked at the drastic changes to his body but deep down he could feel something within him.  A power that he had briefly felt thanks to Mipha but now he felt he could control it at will.  Link pulled out the Master Sword from his bag and raised it, but feeling like it didn't feel quite right put it away and instead pulled out Mipha's old trident.  Link looked at his foot, or Zora fin (he wasn't sure what was the anatomically correct term), took a deep breath, and stabbed down.  The sharp trident immediately pierced the skin.  Link winced but it wasn't any worse than most of the injuries he'd suffered on this long journey.  He pulled out the trident and held out his hand to the fresh would.  Link channeled the powers he now felt within and with a soft green glow the wound was gone and he felt better than ever.  What's more he felt like he could heal 1000 injuries and still have the power for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is more powerful than I'd imagined, I should be more careful when using it.\"  Link said thinking of how he could change himself back.

I must go forth, no matter the body, no matter the weapons, no matter the powers.

Even though he had done this countless times throughout the adventure, Link never got tired to the feel of the wind flowing through his hair.  Although that wasn't the case anymore.  The wind caused the tail like extension on the back of his head to flop against his back like a constant thumping.  He felt the wind against the scales on his body, it made a weird dry sensation that wasn't very comfortable.  Link looked down and saw the Zora village.  Seeing it below and all that water tempted Link a lot.  He wanted to know what the water would feel like on his new Zora body, it would just feel natural and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, going down for a dip was not what he needed to be doing.

One person who had fought along his side against a Divine Beast for his people and showed a willingness to fight into he heart of darkness itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Sidon.  The Zora prince who's smile and optimism was infectious, Link was smiling now thinking about him.  Link wasn't planning to bring anyone with him to Hyrule castle, but Sidon was on the way and had shown himself to be more than callable in battle.  And then on top of that, Link had Mipha's healing powers and he was certain that he had more than enough power to heal himself and another front line fighter like Sidon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link flew over the Zora village he came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Link ran up to the throne where the King Dorephan was sitting with Sidon standing at his side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Sidon, I know you may not recognize me like this but I am actually...\"  Link started ready to explain why he was now a green female Zora, but the prince cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget the beautiful face of the hero who saved the Zora, freed the Divine Beast, and will soon defeat calamity Ganon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was stunned for a second as he felt his green scales turn a shade of red.  <i>I really underestimated the power of that wand.</i>  Link thought as he pushed a lot of thoughts out of his hand and got to the point.  \"Prince Sidon it is time for the final battle and I want you at my side.  Will you join me?\"  Link said offering his hand to the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince didn't even hesitate.  With incredible speed Sidon stepped forward, got down on his knees and took Link's hand.  \"I had dreamed this day would come, but did not feel it was my place to ask.  Thank you for taking me with you to the end.  I will never let you down.\"  And much to Link's surprise Sidon actually kissed his hand and stood back up with his fist in the air and his usual huge smile across his face.  \"Well what are we waiting for?  Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, right.\"  Link said a little flustered, but now was not the time to ask question, it was the time for action.  So with some fanfare from the Zora, Link and Prince Sidon left the Zora village and made their way the Hyrule castle for a final confrontation.</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the combined efforts of himself, Zelda, and the Champions, Ganon had finally been defeated. There was still much to do, of course, as the castle and much of Hyrule was still in ruins, but they could rest easy knowing the biggest threat had been done away with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it looked like a warzone, with the castle in ruins and dead Guardians scattered everywhere, Link still liked coming out here to look at the castle, as a reminder of all they'd managed to accomplish. However, he had other things to do, so he couldn't sit here staring for too long. As he turned around, to head back the way he came, though, he noticed something he hadn't previously seen on his previous trips to the castle. Something glinted from the bottom of the dried up fountain. It seemed to be some kind of... magic wand? Link had encountered many weapons on his travels through Hyrule, but none like this. He reached in to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his fingers touched the wand, his mind was suddenly filled with knowledge about what it was, and what it could do. This was the Swap Wand, a magical implement capable of exchanging anything between two people, so long as the user simply waved it and thought about what they wanted to swap. In addition, it rewrote the fabric of reality so that only the person holding the wand would be aware of any changes being made. To think that a thing so powerful existed, and that it was now his, Link was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Link wanted to try out the wand. It wasn't like there was some sort of world-ending calamity that required his attention anymore, he could afford to have a bit of fun with this. But who to swap with? There were so many people he'd met during his travels around Hyrule that would make for a rather interesting person to swap with. At the forefront of his mind was Zelda. Now that Ganon had been defeated, the two of them had been spending quite of bit of time together as they made plans to restore Hyrule. He was sure she wouldn't mind him trying out the wand her, not that she'd ever know he was doing it. In fact, if she'd been the one to find the wand, she would probably have done the same thing, as inquisitive as she was. Of course, Zelda was only one option of many, and there were plenty of other people he'd encountered that might be good to swap with.</span></div></div>",

If he was right, Zelda should be at the house right now, waiting for Link to get back so they can begin their next mission together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had decided who to use the wand on, there was still the question of what to swap with.

He would be royalty, to top it off, and even possibly have access to her special powers? Of course, that's not the only option Link can go with. He could swap absolutely anything with her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walls were all too familiar to him. Link was in his house, but seeing it from a different perspective than that he was used to. He was sitting down on a chair with an open book sitting on the table in front of him, looking as though it had just been dropped a few inches from his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of his hands, they were now feminine, with black fingerless gloves covering them. His clothes were white with the familiar shade of blue he had on his own shirt, but these were on a clearly female body. Him having two lumps on his chest was enough to verify that guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants were colored black, and were pulling slightly tight on his waist and legs, only making the foreign feeling of emptiness between the latter all the more noticeable. Clearly, he was wearing the clothing Zelda would wear when on missions. His backside also felt different, feeling more squished while sitting down than it usually felt, implying it to be bigger than before. The tightness didn't help much, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was the giant wave of golden hair sitting on his back, which he could see more clearly after grabbing it and pulling it into his line of sight, the color was not that much brighter than his own. There were also two strands of hair coming from the front, but neither of them went lower than his mouth in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it worked, then?\" Link muttered to himself, in a voice matching Zelda's, but in his own accent rather than the more refined and noble one that always paired itself with this voice, making the voice he was hearing familiar but also different at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to be 100% sure, Link stood up and walked into Zelda's room to find a mirror. (Link had previously had the Bolson Construction company expand his house a bit in order for he and Zelda to have their own separate rooms, since his house wasn't able to hold more than one person without an expansion) Staring back at him from the life size mirror was Princess Zelda, perfectly mimicking ever expression and little movement Link made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in Zelda's body,\" he whispered. \"I'm in Zelda's body!\" he said again, only louder and trying to mimic Zelda's noble accent. While it wasn't a perfect match, it was close enough that he could barely tell the difference. Link moved his hand over to his arm to pinch himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming, but noticed that the Swap Wand was in his hand. Had it been there the whole time? He didn't notice it until now. Either way, it obviously followed him when he swapped, meaning he could swap back whenever he wanted to, or could even continue swapping things with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" Link said once again with Zelda's accent. (if he's going to be in her body, he might as well try to talk like her, since it would make things feel less weird) Just think of all the things he could do now! Link and the other citizens of Hyrule had recently spoiled Zelda with a bunch of new clothes to replace her old ones from 100 years ago, so he could try \"putting on a fashion show\" for himself with them, making Zelda look as beautiful as he wished. If he were to try on her clothes, though, that would mean he would have to change. He could get himself acquainted with his new body instead, as he was now a beautiful woman with features he had never had before. The thoughts of this made Link's (or rather, Zelda's) face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also just go out and walk around Hateno Village. He would be greeted as Zelda by the people, and treated like royalty, being as spoiled by them as much as he wanted to. There was also Zelda's special powers she had for being a blood descendant of the ancient goddess Hylia. While Link had seen amazing feats from Zelda using these powers already, he didn't know everything she could do with them, and it would be much different using them himself instead of just watching them be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pondered over his choices, wondering what to do...</span></div></div>",

Lets try on some clothes as Zelda.\" Link said in a beautiful accent of Zelda. As Link stood up of the chair where she (Zelda) was sitting while reading a book, felt an odd feeling on herself (To not lose track, Link is gonna be called Zelda, so whenever hearing the name Zelda from now on, it is Link.).She was feeling lighter than before, and before Link began to walk on Zelda's boots, she fell. \"Ouch! What happen to me?\"Link moaned. The yell was heard different from what Link knew when falling off a cliff or getting hit by a bokoblin, but in Zelda's body, he went into confusion. Zelda then looked at her boots and noticed something, the heel of the foot was higher! With the knowlege of Link, he has never experienced it, and it took her time to get up. As she stood up once again, Zelda felt her perfect butt to bounce when she put a step with the 3-inch heel boot. \"This is so unpleasant! I feel like I am a model!\" Zelda protested. She managed to calm down, and had to get to Zelda's room (or rather hers) to get to the clothes. She funally made progress through the kitchen, getting support from the table. Zelda then came across the stairs, an obstacle that would create a memory for Link to remember. Zelda took a step up and felt her buttcheeks to bounce again, with the addition of her well-sized breasts. \"This.. Thiss.... This feeling feels... Feelss... Pleasant to me.\" Zelda commented on the way up the stair steps. The heel boots added a little more time to waste on the stairs, however, Zelda enjoyed it. At last, Zelda was now on the second floor of the house and headed towards Zelda's room. She opened the door carefully due to the procedure to keep herself balanced on the heel boots. And formally made her way to the closet. \"Reminder to me Link, never have too many stair steps when being Zelda. A weird but pleasant feeling massages on me within Zelda.\" Link whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, in the promised room of Zelda, now have become Zelda, will try out clothes for this sexy body to satisfy. When Zelda opened the closet, she saw a whole storage room of any type of dresses. With excitement, Zelda arrived in the category of... </span></div></div>",

What happen to me?\" Link spoke in Zelda's body (From now on, I will be calling once every time to Link as \"Zelda\" so do not get confused please). Zelda took a view at her boobs and try to regain balance by lifting them up with her hands. Unfortunately for Link's new experience as Zelda, he (or rather say she) felt an odd feeling. The soft clothes and texture of her boobs made her moan. \"Aww. What.. Aww.. What is this feeling?\" Zelda questioned. It took some time to let the experience pass, and once it ended, Zelda exclaimed, \" Zelda, I wonder how you keep yourself satisfied like this.\" Zelda then stood up from the chair and table and took a look at herself once again. Link, unlike his own body, saw the front view of her (Zelda's) breasts, as well as the cleavage of the boobs. \"This will take time for me to get used to.\" Zelda commented. Besides that, Zelda saw the point of her boots, which felt soft but tight. Later, Zelda embarrassingly looked at her pants. It had a black color, which did not worried Link, but the tightness of the black pants caused the blackness to line out and shape the perfect bubble butt of Zelda and as well as the soft and thick thighs she behold on her legs. \"This feels tight, but soft. It feels like a second skin, I hope it looks good on me I guess? Thanks Zelda!\" Link shouted in his house with the accent of Zelda. Link made sure to be confident, as he had never been a woman as gorgeous as Zelda. With careful steps on the way out of his own house, Link, as Zelda, held a smile and said, \"Here it goes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened, a thick leg popped out . It was Zelda stepping out of her house. She got shy but kept walking. However, as Link had never walked like Zelda, the steps he took felt weird, and with the absence of his manhood parts, replaced with a vagina of womanhood, felt the legs very exposed. Zelda positioned herself and managed to walk as Zelda would originally do it. Link, being Zelda, had to move her hips at every step, and at the same time had to keep her balance from the boots from not falling, as well as for the soft and thick balance of her butt ( I will say ass instead). The day was bright and sunny, with cool air blowing towards Zelda. Zelda felt her golden hair, all the way down to her waist ( tailbone) swing along the air's direction, comforting her body. To addition to that, Zelda felt her breasts move along the air at the same time, a feel that Link will not forget as Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get going, this has me oddly satisfied so far as Zelda. I need to walk through Hateno Village. No distraction.\" And with that, Zelda headed towards Hateno Village, where she would experience a pass of a lifetime Link would not do if he was not Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda first started walking in the destination of....</span></div></div>",

On her way, Zelda did not saw people out of their houses. \"Probably I got out early in the afternoon. Is this good?\" Zelda questioned. By getting distracted on her talk, Zelda (Remember, Link is Zelda) stepped near a small rock and lost balance. \"Woahh!! I feel I am going to fall!!\" Zelda screamed. Zelda did not wanted to fall, as she knew she will experience the soft treatment in the perfect sized ass of Zelda's and her bouncy boobs. To avoid this tragedy, Zelda lifted her boobs, forcing her body to straighten up. However, Zelda needed to grab on something. Without thinking, Link, attempting to use his jump skills on Zelda's body, grabbed on a big tree near the bolson company houses. Zelda managed to not fall buarmr contrast of her effort, it seemed her body did something on their own. Her arms hugged the tree as if she was hugging a loved one. Her boobs were squished on the wood and turned Zelda's face red. Later, her legs did all the sexy features. The right leg was in tip toes, showing off the large thighs Zelda exposed as well as a bouncy buttcheek in its glory. The left leg was lifted backwards, where the toes touched her other buttcheek, and showed the thighs at a level every men, even Link in his body, would not resist. The consequence of Zelda's incredible save from a trip caused her to show off one of the sexiest poses a woman can show when she is passionate for fashion and love. \"Aww.. Aww..

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link, not used to using Zelda's eyes very often due to the soft blinks of her large eyelashes, had difficulty distinguishing the female figure. The figure came closer and stopped moving for a second. \"Who is that? Please tell me.\" Zelda said, still in her sexy pose along thetree. <br>\r\nZelda did not moved as well, and before she was able to get out of her pose, the figure gave a scream. <br>\r\n\"OMG!! I cannot believe this!! Eekk!\" The woman yelled in excitement. She ran near where Zelda was, still with the sexy pose, and looked around her. Zelda then was able to know the woman. It was Sofie, owner of Ventest Clothing Boutique! In Link's mind, he had never seen the behavior Sofie showed to him as Zelda, and concluded that Zelda and Sofie were the best of friends. Zelda then reacted after being lost in her mind and spoke to the hypnotized Sofie, \"Cannot believe what?<br>\r\n\"Oh you know Zelda, we gossipped about this yesterday girl. If you posed today, that meant you will ditch your mission with Link and spend a week with me, your bestie!\" Sofie replied with a happy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not know what he has done. He would have to be in Zelda's body for a longer time, while hanging out with Sofie, ruining his plans of inspecting the rumor of secret overpowered armor in Sofie's store. He wished to turn back and hurry to the swap wand, but Sofie grabbed her hand (Zelda's) and whispered to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not escaping this time, bestie friend for life. If you reject this, I will tell the whole village about the actions Link did outside of town. Every single of them you told me Zelda.\" Sofie threatened Zelda. Link knew of what she meant by that. He had done terrible things like burning a small forest due to the bad potion he drank, causing Zelda to pay her ruppees for the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not want to have a bad reputation from his own people, so he, now being Zelda, decided to do what Sofie requested, being now controlled by her. Either way, Link was about to visit her any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me there Sofie, I am sorry.\" Zelda apologized.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is alright my Zelda. You do not need to forgive me. You will see we will have fun. Besides, I told Link to help my other friend, Ralera, a Lurelin villager, to protect her on the journey towards Lurelin village, which will take a month or less. So we have the time to us two.\" Sofie informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now in curiosity of his body. Link is currently on Zelda's body, and hearing about his body leaving far towards Lurelin Village by road worried him. He wanted to use the wand, but knew he did not have it and accidently forgot where he left it in the huge house of his. Zelda took a sigh and behaving like a maid, which Link thought never to think of up to this moment, smiled to Sofie and said \"Okay Sofie, let's go to your store. We... Will have fun. Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofie's face shined with Zelda's words. \"We will Zelda. Just imagine of the magical fashion book you gave me. We will test it out and later try on the clothes I have in store for you. With your pose, I may have you be my fashion model for the week and try out new clothes I received this morning. Oh, and I could also get us ready for a secret surprise I wish to give for being nest friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda inhaled and accepted this choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zelda and Sofie arrived at the store, Zelda saw it huge. It was now four floors high! Link had not visited for a long time, so the store was a whole new house to him.\"Come on in Zelda, we have fun waiting for us inside.\" Sofie announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sofie, thank you.\" Zelda replied. Link had to behave friendly and girly sometimes for Sofie in order to not rage or get caught of acting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda and Sofie took some woman tea, a drink Link had to take for being Zelda, and ate some apples and and healthy salads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the little lunch they had, Sofie noticed it was afternoon already.\"Zelda, let's do some stuff. You choose.\" Sofie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda thought, difficult to believe she was to do girly and fashionable stuff, reminding Link of the times in Gerudo town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda chose to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link ended up deciding to just go for the most obvious choice, and try a body swap. Bracing himself for the change, Link closed his eyes, and waved the wand in front of him, thinking about swapping bodies with Paya. Without even opening his eyes, he could immediately tell something was different. He was now kneeling, rather than standing, and he could no longer feel the wind on his face. His head felt weighed down, as if his hair had suddenly become heavier. His chest felt like something was hanging from it, and the tight pants he suddenly found himself wearing alerted him that a certain part of his anatomy seemed to be missing. There was no doubt; the wand had certainly worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring to open his eyes, Link saw he was now inside the second floor of Impa's house in Kakariko Village, and from the silver locks of hair swinging around at the edge of his vision as he looked around, he certainly no longer had his own body. Looking down at himself, Link found he was now wearing the traditional Sheikah garb that Paya typically wore, with its blue dress-like garment and red and white coat over the top, the tight white pants and brown shoes, and even her blue gloves and the pair of red sticks stuck up in her hair. Speaking of which, Link realised that the reason his head felt heavier was because Paya's silvery hair was much longer than his, resting on his back with a bit tied up on top of his head. He could tell that the belt around his waist pulled in further than it would have on his own body, and the tight pants he was sat flat against his crotch without a bulge in sight. He definitely no longer had his own body, and instead, now sat in the body of Paya, Impa's granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiverting his attention away from his new body, Link noticed exactly where he was. He was kneeling in front of a small desk which sat in the corner of the room. In one hand, he held a quill for writing, and in the other, he held the swap wand. He was thankful that it traveled around with him as he swapped, he didn't know what he'd do if it instead decided to stay with his body, and leave him stuck as Paya. However, since he was holding the quill, he assumed he must have swapped with Paya while she was in the middle of writing something. Looking at the desk, he recognised the book in front of him; it was Paya's diary. He'd seen it there before, but Paya had forbid him from reading itl it was personal, after all. However now that he was Paya, perhaps it would be okay to take a peek? It was his diary now, after all, and apparently she'd been in the middle of writing an entry when he swapped into her. Still, perhaps that was invading her privacy a little too much. That seemed like a silly thing to think, considering he'd literally taken her body, but reading her private thoughts seemed like it might be a little too much. Maybe he should leave it and just go about his business, doing Paya's chores or whatever it was she needed to do today. It was rather tempting, though.</span></div></div>",

He was sure the wand was capable of swapping a great many things, but maybe it would be wisest to start with something simple. Simply swapping bodies with the Great Fairy seemed like a simple enough test. It would get him practically everything he wanted out of the swap; a chance to test out the Great Fairy's powers, the possibility of getting his money back, and maybe the opportunity to see what the Great Fairies looked like below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little hesitant to try this swap, however. While this swap would give him everything there possibly was to gain when swapping with Tera, she and the other Great Fairies were obviously female, and, being a man, Link was a bit hesitant to try and hop into one of their somewhat voluptuous bodies. Perhaps there was something else he could try swapping first instead...</span></div></div>",

He held the wand up, closed his eyes, and waved the wand, thinking about swapping bodies with Tera, the eldest of the Great Fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a flash, everything felt different. Obviously, his body was different, but even his surroundings had changed. He slowly opened his eyes to find... he was underwater. Panicking for a moment, Link frantically looked around for where the surface was. Thankfully, it didn't seem too far away, although it did seem to be just a small opening, and Link quickly pushed himself through the water towards it, doing his best to ignore the odd sensations his body was sending him, and the white hair falling into his line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burst out of the water, gripping the edge of the ring he'd surfaced from as he coughed the water out of his lungs. He had no idea how or why the Great Fairies were able to stay underwater as long as they did. Tera's body was probably able to handle it, but he hadn't been prepared to suddenly be underwater, and hadn't had time to figure it out before he panicked. As he coughed though, he noticed he really didn't sound a lot like himself. His voice was much higher pitched and feminine. He blinked the water out of his eyes, and looked around. As he'd expected, he was out at the Gerudo Great Skeleton, where Tera's fountain had been, but everything looked a lot smaller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer able to ignore the sensations his body was giving him, Link looked down at himself. Although, he supposed \"himself\" wasn't exactly the best word to describe it. No one besides him would describe this large, feminine body, with its outfit that barely covered anything wrapped just a little too tightly around it as \"himself\". Droplets of water that clung to his body sparkled in the sunlight alongside the various trinkets that adorned his body. He raised his hands into view, noting how feminine they looked, with their long purple nails. He couldn't see all of it, but he could feel Tera's large silver curls piled atop his head, spilling over on the right side of his head. He could fake makeup thickly caked on his eyelids and long eyelashes, and on his plump lips. He moved around a little in the fountain, feeling how the various parts of his body moved and jiggled. It was odd to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose it worked,\" Link said aloud, hearing Tera's voice escape his mouth instead of his own. Thankfully, he still held the wand in his hand, although it looked much smaller now that he had one of the Great Fairies' bodies, holding it between two fingers instead of in his whole hand. To say he felt uncomfortable right now would be an understatement, but this is what he had wanted. He was now one of the four Great Fairies of Hyrule, and in accordance with that, he had her body and her powers. Now he could see if she had really needed all those rupees in order to use her powers, and if not, then he could possibly get his rupees back. Of course, as he looked down at the two orbs of flesh hanging from his chest, there was another thing immediately available for him to explore and experiment with.</span></div></div>",

It really is real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink diverted his attention from his body to look at the source of the voice; a young Gerudo woman approaching the fountain. He hadn't been expect this, that someone would actually be able to brave the desert and find the fountain out here in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps if he'd chosen one of the fairies closer to civilisation, but not this one. The Gerudo ran up to the base of the fountain, her awe at meeting one of the Great Fairies evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneeled at at the base of the fountain, lowering her head, and said, \"O Great Fairy, please, bestow upon me your blessings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had no idea what she was talking about. As far as he knew, the closest thing to a \"blessing\" the Great Fairies gave was powering up armour. Perhaps this woman simply didn't know how the Great Fairies worked, since he hadn't had a chance to explain it to her before she ran up here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Link was somewhat worried now. He had taken on the role of the Great Fairy, but hadn't been prepared for her duties. Perhaps he could just wing it? He'd just explain what service the Great Fairies actually performed, and then if the Gerudo woman actually wanted her clothes powered up, he'd figure it out from there. How hard could it be, right? But what if he messed up? Would that cause people to lose faith in the Great Fairies' abilities, and thus, have them close up their fountains again until he came by and emptied his wallets for them? Link wasn't sure he wanted to take that risk. After all, if he couldn't imitate Tera, he could just become someone else, thanks to the wand held between his fingers.</span></div></div>",

It was a silly idea, but he felt that since he could now rewrite reality as he saw fit, and anyone besides him would treat it as if it were normal, why not allow himself to be a bit silly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wand was waved, Link suddenly lost his balance, a weight on his head threatening to pull him over. Thankfully, he was able to steady himself on the fountain that he'd found the wand in. He knew Tera had more hair than he did, and thus her hair would be heavier than his, but he hadn't expected just how much heavier it would be. As he let go of the fountain and stood up proper again, however, he noticed a large silver curl hanging from his head. That was to be expected, however, said curl had only reached Tera's shoulders, whereas right now, the curl dangled all the way down to his hips. That, he had not expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have any sort of mirror or something with which to see his reflection, and Zelda had taken back the Sheikah Slate after Ganon's defeat, but thanks to the sun in the sky, Link was at least able to see his shadow. His shadow seemed to show a large bulbous mass, almost as tall as he was, sitting upon his head. That explained why it seemed to be so heavy at first; not only had he gained Tera's hairstyle, but it had retained its original size, appearing massive on his normal-sized body due to Tera being giant compared to him. That only ended up making the situation that much more silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps away from the fountain, Link found the weight wasn't as bad as he'd initially thought. Even with the large tiara Tera wore in her hair, he's still worn armour heavier than this. If anything the size was more of a problem than the weight. It was just that he hadn't been expecting it to be that heavy, so it had caught him off guard. He could see himself being able to go about his business like this without it interfering too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that brought up the question of what to do next. Link had only swapped his hairstyle on a whim, wanting to test out the remote on Tera, and picking something silly to use it for. Now the test was complete, he had her hairstyle, but what was he going to do with it? He had mused that it probably wouldn't interfere with him too much, so he could just sort of keep it for now. He wondered if anyone would treat him any differently like this, even though the swap should be treated as normal by everyone besides him. Then again, it was rather silly, so maybe he should just swap back. Of course, now that he'd used the wand once, and gotten a taste of its powers, he found himself wanting to try it out again. After all, he could bend reality to his will, why wouldn't he want to keep using it?</span></div></div>",

Only women were allowed inside, so he'd needed to dress up as a girl to get in. Even after Naboris had been calmed, and Riju, the chief of the Gerudo, had recognised him as a hero, he still needed to crossdress to be allowed in; no exceptions were made. He'd always had to be careful about what he did while in town, the make sure no one found out that under his outfit, he was actually a man. Perhaps, with this wand, he could do something about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about swapping with Riju and making an exception to allow himself into the town sans disguise, but decided against it. Even with her position as chief, people would probably question her decision to allow a man into the town, and she'd probably overturn the decision once he swapped back. However, in thinking about swapping with Riju, he realised there was a much more direct approach that would allow him to enter; he'd just use the wand to become a girl himself. Then he should have no problem getting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briefly considered swapping with Riju, but decided against it. To get the desired result, he'd either need to swap bodies or genders, and both held complications when dealing with Riju, either depriving Gerudo town of it's chief by making her into a man, or putting someone inexperienced in her place. Instead, he opted to try swapping with Buliara, Gerudo captain of the guard. While Link had no experience as a ruler, he did have experience as a knight, and was confident that he wouldn't be messing up anything by swapping with Buliara. There were probably less important Gerudo he could swap with, but since he could actually remember Buliara's name, he figured he might as well go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just a question of what to swap. If he wanted to get into Gerudo Town, swapping bodies or genders would probably be the best option. Swapping bodies would making him into Buliara, captain of the guard and a member of the Gerudo, who obviously wouldn't have any troubled getting into Gerudo Town. Of course, that option meant that he'd have to pretend to be someone else, and his usual self still wouldn't be allowed into the town. Gender swap would make him into a woman, which would mean he would be allowed into the town regardless of the fact that he was still Hylian. Of course, that would also make Buliara a man, making her not allowed in town. He knew that there was supposed to only be one male Gerudo born every 100 years, so he hoped making Buliara into a man wouldn't mess with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just because he wanted to be able to get into Gerudo Town, didn't mean he needed to limit himself to those options. So long as he didn't lose the wand, there'd be plenty of time to do whatever swaps he wanted, and no one would be the wiser.</span></div></div>",

This way, he'd not only be allowed in town, he'd also be a local, and one treated with respect. Now decided, Link waved the wand, thinking about swapping bodies with Buliara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Link found he was no longer standing in front of Hyrule Castle, but rather inside Riju's throne room in Gerudo Town. That wasn't all that had changed, of course. He'd been in here before, but now the room looked smaller than before, and the hands being held out in front of him were of a much darker hue than what he was used to. His body felt very different, as was to be expected, and so he looked down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw from his hands, his skin tone was much darker than it had been in his own body, and he was almost twice as tall as he used to be, with much more muscle mass. That would have been odd enough, but there was also all the differences that could be attributed to hopping over the gender fence. His hair was much longer, pulled into a ponytail that trailed down his back. His hips were wider, and despite the loose pants Buliara wore, he could tell his genitals were missing. A pair of breasts stuck out on his muscular chest. His lips were much larger, as was his nose, while his eyelashes were longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt, the wand had certainly worked, and he was now in the body of Buliara. Speaking of the wand, Link noticed it was still between his hands, which now rested on the pommel of Buliara's sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Buliara?\" Link heard a voice beside him. He looked over to his right, to see Riju, sitting on the throne next to him. She must have noticed that he was looking down at himself, behaving oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, no. No, everything fine,\" he said, trying to remain calm, and failing miserably. He had been caught off guard when he heard Buliara's voice come out of his mouth instead of his own, but he supposed he should have expected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, if you say so.\" Link hoped Riju would drop the issue, and go back to... whatever it was she did while he wasn't here, but instead she seemed to notice something else. \"Oh? What have you got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, in your hand.\" Riju pointed at the Swap Wand, resting in Link's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was now slightly panicked, and unsure of what to do. He wasn't sure he wanted other people finding out about the wand yet, not when he'd only just had a chance to try it out himself, and he definitely wasn't sure he wanted Riju to know that he wasn't Buliara. She seemed to trust him, even if Buliara didn't, but if she found out that the supposed hero of Hyrule was doing unscrupulous things like stealing other people's bodies, things might take a turn for the worst. He could try and lie his way out of this, but he'd never been particularly good with words. Then again, maybe Riju would be okay with this. Although she was the chief of the Gerudo, she did seem to be a bit more easygoing and trusting than some, perhaps she'd be willing to have a bit of fun with the wand and such, provided there was a way to make sure someone else was aware of the swaps as well.</span></div></div>",

Hopefully she'd be understanding, or find it amusing or something. He could only imagine how much trouble he'd be in if this were the other way around, and he'd swapped with Riju and Buliara was interrogating him, so he hoped Riju would be more merciful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, it's called the Swap Wand. It's a magic wand that allows me to exchange things between people, without anyone besides me noticing,\" Link explained, still somewhat apprehensive about letting someone else know about the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Take her to a cell!\"  If the Gerudo thought it was odd they were being order to put Link as Buliara behind bars they did not show it.  Without hesitation they manhandled Link who did not wish to cause more trouble by fighting back, and took him to an underground cell.  Link used his massive limbs and curled up into a fetal position.  He felt horrible now for what he did, taking Bulara's body and betraying Riju's trust.  But he wasn't planning on keeping her body forever, he just let himself be curious and now he was paying for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Riju stood outside of Link's cell.  \"Stand up disgraceful hero, I don't like seeing Buliara looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood up and went to the bars, \"I'm so sorry about what I did, but if you give me back the wand I will swap back and I promise you will never see me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiju pulled out the wand and looked between it and Link, \"That is what I want to do.  That is what I will do.\"  Link couldn't help it, he began to smile, but that smile faded when Riju continued, \"But, that is not what will happen today.  Not exactly.\"  Riju continued, \"It seems that even thought Buliara had your body and doesn't seemed to even remember even being a Gerudo she is loyal.  She is currently outside of the city patrolling with your body.  When I went to see her I offered some clothes to disguise her so that she could enter town but she turned them down not wanting to dishonor Gerudo traditions by letting a voe walk in the city.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will give Buliara the pleasure of walking into this city again amongs her own people as she should.\"  With that Riju waved the swap wand in the air and Link felt himself shrink down to his normal height.  He was still in a Gerudo prison but he was himself again.  \"Thank you Riju.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet.  You will still be punished for what you've done.  It is only because you saved us from the divine beast and calamity Ganon that you will not be executed for what you've done.  Instead you will walk free, but on one condition.\"  Riju again held the wand up for Link to see, \"You will walk free with a body that I choose for you, and that body will be this.\"  Riju once again waved the wand and Link felt his body begin to undergo a massive change.  It didn't take Link long to figure out what Riju was swapping him with.</span></div></div>",

However, thinking about swapping with her, and potentially becoming a girl because of it, reminded him of the time he'd had to dress up as a girl to get into Gerudo town. He'd had to walk around in fear of his manhood being discovered, and being thrown out. He was already considering swapping with a girl, so it might be nice to see what it was like to walk around Gerudo Town without having to dress up as something he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should he swap with, though? The first person to stick out in his mind was Riju, the chief of the Gerudo. She had helped him calm the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, so he remembered her clearly. Obviously the chief of the Gerudo would have no issues getting around Gerudo Town, right? Of course, while Hyrule had been devastated by Calamity Ganon, Gerudo Town had not, and was still flourishing to this day. Swapping with Riju, depending on what exactly he decided to swap, could mean taking on her responsibility as chief. Perhaps it would be better to swap with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to think of who else he could remember from the Gerudo, Link remembered Riju's personal guard, Buliara. She had been rather suspicious of Link from the get go, and remained as such even after Naboris had been calmed. Maybe he could get back at her using the wand. Of course, Buliara had her duties as well, namely guarding Riju. However, guarding one ruler probably wasn't too different from guarding another, and Link had already guarded Zelda for quite a while now. Maybe she would be a good candidate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as he might, Link struggled to recall anyone else from Gerudo town. Sure, he could be just as easily accepted there by swapping with a girl and then heading there, but by swapping with someone who already lived there, he'd not only save himself the trip over there, but he'd also get to be treated like a local. Since he couldn't think of anyone else, Link decided to just choose between these two options, and ultimately decided to swap with...</span></div></div>",

There was only really one way to find out; to try it, and he had the perfect idea in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Zelda had gotten fairly close over their time together after Ganon had fallen, but he couldn't help but wonder what Zelda <i>really</i> thought of him, the kind of stuff she wouldn't say to his face.

All he'd really have to do was try swapping with someone near Zelda, and speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an alright plan, but Link wasn't sure if he wanted this to be the first test of the wand. For one thing, he didn't even know if not specifying an individual as a target would work. Perhaps it would be wiser to first try swapping with someone specific, and leave this idea for another time.

He was admittedly a little anxious, preparing to hop into an unfamiliar body without even any idea of whose body he'd be jumping into, but regardless, Link held up the wand, and waved it, thinking about swapping bodies with \"someone near Zelda\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he was...</span></div></div>",

Of course, the road wasn't exactly what Link was focusing on right now. Rather, he was focused on what had happened to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body felt larger, and more muscular, and hunched over to stand on all fours. He had a long, white muzzle extending out from the front of his face, and pale yellow hair fell down in front of his eyes. Something protruded from his rear, and his fingers and toes felt like they'd all been merged into one solid block on the end of each arm or leg. It was clear he was no longer human anymore, and judging by the weight he could feel on his bad, he had a feeling he knew what he'd become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly felt a pair of boots digging into his sides, causing him to let out a whinnying sound. A voice came from behind him. \"Come now, we'll never get home if you stop for no reason like this.\" Link recognised the voice as Zelda's, solidifying his idea about what he'd become. Zelda had apparently been out on the road when he tried swapping, meaning that the only \"person\" near her was her horse, which Link had now become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was certainly not ideal. There was no way he could find out anything from Zelda like this. He couldn't even speak to her. And regardless of his plans, being a horse didn't exactly seem like a fun experience when he could use the wand to become anyone he wanted to be. Speaking of which, since he no longer had any hands to hold the wand it, it was now grasped in his mouth, held firmly between his teeth. It was not the most ideal situation, but he supposed it was better than simply losing the wand altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whip from the reins tied to his head reminded him that Zelda was still waiting for her horse to move. So as not to anger her while making his decision, Link began to walk forwards, a little uneasy of four legs. Zelda didn't seem to mind the slow pace, however, as he heard no further complaints from his rider. The reins did make things a bit awkward, though. The only way he could use the wand to swap back, or into someone else's body, was to swing his head about, as the wand was in his mouth. However, with Zelda holding the reins, she might try to steady him if he suddenly started moving his head around too much, thereby getting in the way of him waving the wand. Perhaps it would be wise to just ride it out for now, so to speak, and just stay as Zelda's horse until she finally dismounted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as being a horse didn't seem like a fun idea, especially one that was forced to carry Zelda around, Link decided it would be best to remain as he was for the time being. With Zelda holding his reins, and the wand in his mouth, he wasn't exactly in a good position to swing the wand and thus activate a swap. Instead, he simply kept trotting down the road, with Zelda bobbing along on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more time he spent in this horse's body, the easier it became for him to handle walking on all fours. Odd as it had been at first, walking around as a horse was beginning to feel strangely natural. Perhaps this was part of the remote's powers. After all, it'd be pretty useless if could give him any body in the world, but he couldn't figure out how to use it. He'd just be stuck floundering around until he managed to swap back or someone else took the wand from him. Instead, the wand seemed to be making is current horse body feel as natural as his own, though he had a feeling he'd never completely get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the trees began to part as Zelda guided him along the road, and a town began to make itself visible in the distance. Link recognised it, of course, seeing as it was Hateno Village, where he currently lived. Seeing as the castle was currently still in ruins, Zelda had been living with him for the time being, and must have been returning home after whatever she was doing today. Link began to grow a little nervous, as more people around meant more of a chance of someone noticing the wand, and he also irrationally worried about someone realising it was him inside this horse's body, even though they had no way of figuring it out. However, barely anyone even payed attention to him, instead directing their attention towards his rider, greeting Zelda as she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, they reached Link's house, and Zelda rubbed her hand along Link's equine neck. \"Good girl,\" she said to him, as she got off his back. It was only now that Link realised he was missing a part of his anatomy that he'd had when he was a Hylian. Being turned into a horse had been so overwhelming at first that he hadn't even noticed. That didn't matter now, however. What mattered was that Zelda was off of him, and no longer pulling on his reins. That meant he was free to swing away with the wand, and swap him out of this horse's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, before he could do so, another complication presented itself. \"Hm? What that you've got there?\" Zelda asked, looking curiously at what Link had grasped in his mouth. She'd been tying him to a post so he wouldn't run off when she happened to notice the Swap Wand. Link had to act fast. He wasn't sure how Zelda would perceive the wand suddenly disappearing from her horse's mouth, but she wasn't about to let her take it from him and leave him trapped as her horse. Right now, it mattered little what body he ended up in, he just needed to be someone other than this horse, to make sure Zelda couldn't take it. And so, as Zelda reached out towards his mouth, Link quickly swung his head around, hoping that was enough to activate the swap.</span></div></div>",

Revali, the Rito, Daruk, the Goron, Mipha, the Zora, and Urbosa, the Gerudo. They had been his loyal companions and friends, and even after their passing, they's spirits had guided him through the Divine Beasts, and granted him their power to aid in his quest. They were gone now, but perhaps the wand could still reach down into wherever their spirits lay, and swap with them as it could any amongst the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were four champions to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and each very different to Link himself.

Not being used to being a four legged animal, it made it very hard to Link to move around quickly, and Zelda was able to get the wand back before he could get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how it's going to be, huh? You really don't want to be my horse,\" Zelda said, stating the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'm letting you ride me after everything you've done to me. You'd be better off switching me with Epona and riding her instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda thought it over. She didn't want to swap Link's mind or personality. She wanted him as her steed and she wanted him to know he was her steed. Surely there was some other way to punish him for throwing her off his back.</span></div></div>",

She felt it was a shame to completely put everything back to normal so soon, but if the Great Fairy could see the swaps, it would be difficult for Zelda to deny swapping back without the Fairy causing a fuss. All she could really do was swap back, and then decide on a different target, one that wouldn't be able to see the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, things didn't exactly work out that way. As soon as the swap occurred, Zelda felt somewhat off-balance, as if there were a large weight strapped to her head, and looking up at the Great Fairy, it wasn't difficult to tell why. The Great Fairy's head was back on her body, but it seemed incredibly small in comparison. Reaching up to feel her face, Zelda could only feel something small touching her chin, speaking volumes of the difference in size between her head and her hand. It seemed that, just as in the first swap, the sizes of their heads had been retained. So thanks to Zelda's previous swap, which had made their heads properly sized for the bodies they were on at the time, they were now OK n the opposite situation of what they'd been in when the Great Fairy came in; now Zelda had a head too big for her body, while the Great Fairy had one that was too small. The only difference now was that despite their heads not being the right sizes, they did have the correct bodies now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Zelda mumbled, her hand still feeling around her overly large face, while her other hand fiddled with the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you shouldn't have swapped the sizes of our heads first,\" the Great Fairy suggested, holding up her hand to see how large her body appeared to be with her smaller head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll swapus back to normal right now, don't worry,\" Zelda said, holding up the wand again while she used her other hand to keep her head steady.</span></div></div>",

However, a loud neigh came out of her mouth instead, and Zelda clapped her hands over her mouth and blushed in embarrassment. Once she got over her initial shock, Zelda realised that, since Epona couldn\u2019t speak, neither could she, now that she was Epona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda quickly hid the wand amidst the bedding in the stable, then walked out towards the voice that had called her. Leaving the stable, she saw a young woman with red hair, wearing a blue dress and carrying a large bucket full of oats. Presumably, this was Malon, the woman who had raised Epona since she was a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon was pouring the bucket of oats into a feeding trough as Zelda walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d said Malon as she finished emptying the bucket. \u201cEat up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wasn\u2019t particularly interested in eating horse food, but she knew Malon would become suspicious if she didn\u2019t eat, so she picked up a handful of food and ate it gingerly. To her great surprise, it actually tasted quite good, and Zelda began eating with much more enthusiasm. She initially tried to eat in a fashion that was appropriate for a woman of her station, before she remembered that she technically wasn\u2019t a woman at all, and simply began shovelling more food into her mouth. Zelda was somehow able to eat all the food in the trough, which was slightly surprising. It was probably the amount of food Epona normally ate in one sitting, though, which would explain how she could eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d said Malon, patting Zelda\u2019s side as she finished the last of her food. Zelda whinnied in response, and Malon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, off you go,\u201d Malon said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to feed the other animals now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda whinnied again, and Malon walked off to grab another bucket full of food. Zelda walked back to the stable, and rummaged through the bedding in her stall until she found the swap wand.</span></div></div>",

Although it would be tempting to joke around with such a powerful item, she couldn't help but recognise the advantages she could gain from the Swap Wand as well.<br>\r\nBeing a member of the royal family meant that much of her time was spent discussing with various politicians, both native and delegations of the other Hyrulean races. Oftentimes she felt agreements with races like the Zora or the Gorons took too long to be settled due to a lack of understanding of the mores and values in each other's culture and society. But even where her own people were concerned, Zelda often had nagging doubts. She'd lived in the palace her whole life, in the lap of luxury with servants at her every beck and call. Who was she to know what the common people valued? What they most had need of?<br>\r\nIf she were to use the Swap Wand to place herself in another race's place, she could gain firsthand insight in how to better get along with them. Likewise, if she were to walk a mile through the shoes of a commoner, it could help her see what smaller matters she could improve on, rather than shoving them aside in favour of a more holistic view.<br>\r\nThis wand presented the opportunity of a lifetime. She could find out what was on the mind of other people and use that knowledge to improve her reign as a princess. Surely that took precedence over any little fun she could have with the wand? (Not that said fun couldn't come afterward...)<br>\r\nThe more she considered it, the better an idea it became. She was quickly determined to go through with it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda tucked the Swap Wand away in a sleeve of her dress and had some soldiers escort her to Hyrule Market. As they went by the stalls, her eyes scoured over the people's faces, looking for someone fitting for this experiment. She didn't know how to be a merchant, so they were out of the question for now. And she didn't feel like ripping two lovers apart by taking one of them's place, or like taking one of the playing children's youth for herself.<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw her. Tucked away close by the stalls, a demure woman sat dressed in rags with a cup in front. A pauper. One of her subject's who, despite Zelda's best efforts, did not get cared enough for to live a good life. The princess felt uneasy about what she was planning to do, but who better to teach her what funds and facilities needed to be improved than a person who required them the most? Besides, she definitely deserved to get pampered for a change.<br>\r\nZelda fired the Swap Wand at her with the intent to swap lives, and just like that her whole world changed in an instant.<br>\r\nThe first thing she became aware of what that she now sat on the hard ground of the street. Next she noticed her clothes. No more was she dressed in the finest silk the crown could buy. Her new outfit was a meager thing that just served to cover her up and provided no further comfort. The fabric had holes, did not retain any warmth and it itched and chafed all over her body. Her body which, she noticed, had also changed.<br>\r\nFor someone so accustomed to regular baths, it shocked Zelda to see how dirty she now was. Covered head to toe in dust, mud and other assorted filth. A stench emanated from her, strong enough to force her to breathe through her mouth for a few minutes. And she was unkempt. Her nail, both on hands and feet, were black with dirt and cracked in several places. Her limbs had hair growing all over it, which she'd normally shave off on a daily basis. And the hair on her head, no longer perfectly styled, now clung together in various dirty clumps. She didn't even dare consider what her face must look like, although the sudden toothache she became aware of was probably a good indication of how bad she could expect it to be.<br>\r\nBut the biggest change was probably how small she now was. Her entire body was notably thinner, and not in a good way. She could easily wrap her hand around her upper arm now, and for some reason she felt a good head shorter than she'd been before the swap. Her stomach had also become a constant growling, as if someone had ripped a great hole within her.<br>\r\nShe looked up at where the ex-pauper should be and saw her, dressed in her beautiful dress, with her skin completely clean and her hair expertly done. She also seemed prettier, taller and fuller than before. Zelda understood immediately, for her mind had not at all diminished: they had swapped lives, and currently Zelda was as she would have been in a life where every day was a struggle to survive.<br>\r\nZelda watched as her former soldiers guided the new princess back to the castle. That was it then. Sooner or later the new princess would come back for another stroll to the market, but until then Zelda would live her hard life to better learn how to improve her situation once she sat back on the throne. She clenched her hand around the Swap Wand. At least that hadn't been exchanged, it firmly remained with her. She would guard it with her life until the time came to switch back, but for now she had other priorities. She tucked it away in a fold of her old rag, ignored the desperate pleas of her stomach to be filled and began begging for change, so that she might at least buy a meal tonight. Such was the life of a pauper.</span></div></div>",

It's time to go collect eggs from the cuccos.\" Zelda nodded and Malon turned her around and headed back towards the ranch.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t seem bothered by her accommodations and the other cuccos squawking around her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy it, judging from the perky nipples sticking out from her CC cup breasts and dripping pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Malon walked over to Ruto and said, \u201cHello, Ruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto looked over to Malon, smiled and said, \u201cHello, Malon.

With a wide smile on her face, Ruto dove her head in the bucket, eating the seed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon walked out of the coop and saw Zelda finishing her carrots and now getting in position to go to the bathroom in the corral, not worrying about anyone seeing her. Malon was having trouble containing her excitement at having the two former princesses happily assuming the roles of farm animals. She was sure Link would soon see her as the only girl in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then thought, \u201cWait, aren\u2019t there more girls in Link\u2019s life? I should deal with them first before focusing on Link.\u201d She then looked at Zelda, happily walking around the corral, and Ruto, having walked out of the coop for a some fresh air with crumbs all over her mouth from her dinner.

I thought this time would never come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria walked out of the pen and followed Malon to a corner of the barn she reserved for milking the cows. Almost immediately, Saria dropped to all fours and positioned her breasts over the bucket by the milking stool. Looking up to Malon, Saria said, \"Okay, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon reached over and started pulling on Saria's small breasts, who began moaning at the contact. As milk poured into the bucket, Malon was surprised Saria was producing as much as the cow she had swapped positions with. She guessed this was the wand's magic, making Saria produce the same amount of milk whiile keeping her body the way it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, Malon squeezed out the last drop of milk from Saria. \"It looks like we're all done for today, Saria,\" Malon told the girl-cow. Saria got up and walked back to the pen, locking the gate behind her so she and the other cows couldn't escape. She then walked over to the corner of the pen covered in straw and laid down. Malon soon saw Saria drift off to sleep, a content smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out to the corral, Malon saw Ruto walk back into the cucco's coop, yawning as she prepared to sleep in her nest. She also saw Zelda still proudly walking around naked with the other horses. As soon as Malon walked into the corral, Zelda walked over and said, \"I'm feeling tired. Is it time to sleep yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small smirk, Malon said, \"Sure, let's get you and the others to bed.\" With that, Malon pulled out her ocarina and played a tune that made Zelda and the horses walked over to the stalls. In a mere five minutes, Malon watched Zelda sleeping peacefully while standing straight up, just like a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon went to sleep thinking of how much she had changed in Hyrule thanks to the Swap Wand. She had to remember to change more things tomorrow. Her last question before she succumbed to sleep herself: What should she do tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

He was sighing, \"Oh, Nabooru!\" as she reached behind to draw her closer to him. Before the scene got too intense, Malon was forced awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon had heard Link talk about a Gerudo named Nabooru he met during his trip to the Spirit Temple. She had heard of the all-female Gerudo and how their skills in battle were just as wonderful as their looks. Letting jealousy take hold, she grabbed the Wand of Swapping and waved it. Without taking the time to reflect on what she had done, she went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, Malon woke up and started to take care of the animals. This, of course, included taking Zelda out for a morning sprint across Hyrule's plains, gathering the eggs Ruto was nurturing with her bottom and milking Saria. They also got their breakfast of oats (Zelda), birdseed (Ruto) and hay (Saria). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last chore for the morning was feeding the pigs their slop. As Malon made her way to the pig sty, she suddenly stopped and took a long look inside. Sleeping with the other pigs was a Gerudo, with her red-orange hair flowing past her shoulders. The jewel on her forehead gleamed red and she had whitish pink lipstick on her lips. Aside from this, she was completely naked, having mud stuck to her tanned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon smiled and thought, \"That's right! After I had that horrible dream, I used the Wand of Swapping to force Nabooru to be treated like one of my pigs. This is going to be fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her best smiling face, she entered the sty and sweetly said, \"Are my little piggies hungry this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the pigs immediately woke to her voice and crowded the trough. Among their squeals, Malon could hear Nabooru happily exclaiming, \"Yes! Finally, there's food for us! Please, I'm so hungry! Give us our food please!\" With a final smile, Malon poured the slop into the trough. Nabooru joined the pigs around her in happily diving in headfirst to eat the messy food she'd been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling on all fours back to the bed in the corner, Nabooru was approached by two piglets. As soon as she saw them, Nabooru smiled and said, \"Okay, I guess it's time you got your breakfast, too.\" Without another word, Nabooru lowered her body and allowed the piglets to suck on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon noticed this and said, \"How are your children, Nabooru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still a little young,\" Nabooru replied, \"but they should be able to eat like the rest of us soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon left Nabooru with her new offspring and thought, \"This is just too entertaining. However, now that my chores are done, what should I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Second later after she stopped thinking, the wand began to dim again, back to wood.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" She said, feeling quite panicked \"What swapped?\" She asked herself over and over trying to remember what she had done as she pressed closed fists against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she looked around. The first thing he had noticed was the gardener. It used to be a woman, but now it was a muscular man wearing the same clothes, the white and black dress uniform worn by the female staff, there was a pin in her/his hair still, serving no purpose.<br>\r\nA fisherman on the otherside of the river had disappeared, replaced with a Zora emerging from the water, but he still looked liek the fishman, kind of. Which reminded Malon of the fish people one of her customers had once told her about.<br>\r\nIt was at this time Zelda returned, still in a handmaidens outfit, and she still looked the same. <br>\r\n\"I've finished my duties Princess Malon,\" Zelda said, bowing to her, \"And I have laid today's eggs, is there anything else I can help with?\"<br>\r\nMalon was stunned, \"You, laid an egg?\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded, \"Yes, I don't know why, but lay eggs like a cucco,\" Malon lost a shade in her face.<br>\r\nZelda looked worried, \"Are you feeling okay, Princess.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Malon told her, \"I would like to go to castle town.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Princess,\" Zelda said, bowing before leaving, \"I will assemble a small guard for you.\"<br>\r\nMalon was puzzled, she had been to castle town before, it wasn't dangerous, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I know you trained with a sword Princess, but we still need a guard, for safety,\" Zelda had turned back to address her princess, and turned away to do as she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon looked around, at this time, she couldn't see anything else that had changed, and the wand was calm now, it had it's wood colour and was a cool temperature that couldn't be felt though her glove. The power could still be felt, flowing strong though the wand and in Malon's hand.<br>\r\nThe Cucco that Malon presumed that had been accidentally swapped with Zelda waddled up to her, and Malon picked her up, and stroked it, making it cluck happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda returned, she had three guards with her, and she herself had a sword in her arms, which she presented to Malon. The Guards were of varying heights and build, all of them bigger than Link, except one. Despite all the guards wearing the same armour, one of had been swapped. One of guards had his body swapped with the gardener, and now was a smaller body, not as muscular but was wearing a full suit of armour and heavy weaponry.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go, Princess Malon?\"<br>\r\nMalon pondered a second</span></div></div>",

But she was beginning to see why being a princess wasn't so good, she wasn't going to be alone very much which made her realise that she had made her self a target. She was now important and was wanted by her nation, a symbol of hope and leadership and now would be a target if someone wanted to attack hyrule, and all that made her appreciate it more. To Malon, it was amazing to feel so beloved and known by the entire nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they all started walk, Zelda reached out and took the cucco from Malon's arms, \"Princess, an animal will dirty your dress and could damage it. It won't reflect well on you, if the people of hyrule say you in disarray.\"<br>\r\nThe cucco started to panic and flapped hard, knocking it's self out of handmaiden Zelda's arms, and glided to Malon.<br>\r\n\"I wish to keep it,\" Malon said trying to be assertive, as she continued to stroke the cucco.<br>\r\nZelda sighed, \"If that is what you want, but please be careful with your appearance,\" and she slightly held the cucco, and moved her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got into the the town, a lot of the crowd had turned to her, and bowed, causing Malon to blush with a large smile and she started to wave back to everyone. Everyone began to resume their day, but moving out the way to give Malon and her guards, as they started to move around. <br>\r\nMalon had seen all these shops before, each one was unique and very welcoming, but how would they be with a surprise visit from a princess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the bombchu bowling shop, she remembered going in there once after saving up for months, and it was a blast, terrifying but exhilarating. She walked towards it, as Zelda started to protest.<br>\r\nShe walked inside, and to the keepers astonishment, the Princess of Hyrule had entered their shop.<br>\r\nThe sleepy owner was wide awake.<br>\r\n\"It is an honour to have you my majesty,\" she said but it was little gravelly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Sorry, sorry.\" Zelda apologised frantically as she grabbed Malon, and pulled her back, \"A princess can't pay such a dangerous barbaric game.\"<br>\r\nZelda pushed Malon though the door.<br>\r\n\"I am terribly sorry, Ma'am,\" Zelda says as she leaves the shop.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMalon frowned, and moved on, walking ahead of her guard, but Zelda and the others caught up a few seconds later.<br>\r\nShe then moved over to the Bazaar, a good place for general good.<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" came a female voice from the guards,\"Let me in first, I know this guy, I don't want them to disrespect you, my Highness.\"<br>\r\nHe Said as Malon wathced the smaller guard walk into the building. A loud snap could be heard.<br>\r\n\"I believe we can enter, Princess,\" Zelda said prompting Malon to walk in.<br>\r\nMalon Stepped in, the large figure of the man running the stall towered over her.<br>\r\n\"OH, Princess Malon, It is such an Honour to have you here!\" He said quite cheerly, \"Is there ANY thing I can do for you?\" He asked almost pleading to help.<br>\r\n\"Princess, what is it you wanted from here?  Everything here is already provided and stocked at the castle.\"<br>\r\nMalon looked around, nothing was of importance, and left.<br>\r\nZelda stayed back a bit, bowed, \"Thank you for your time.\"<br>\r\n\"Come back whenever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon walked around not feeling to happy, then reflected on the wand she was holding.<br>\r\n\"What else happened...?\" She asked her self<br>\r\n\"It swapped two of the royal staffs bodies<br>\r\nMy Combat training<br>\r\nZelda's reproduction with a Cucco<br>\r\nSome shop keepers personalities<br>\r\nWhatelse?\" She asked her self<br>\r\n\"Whatelse what your majesty,\" Asked one of the bigger guards.<br>\r\nMalon blushed, was she speaking out loud the whole time, obviously the guards didn't hear all of it, but what about Zelda, she was closer.<br>\r\n\"What else could we do here, I don't want to return to the castle yet.\"<br>\r\n\"You Highness, we should return soon,\" Said the now-female guard.<br>\r\nMalon turned to Zelda, who seemed to be lost in thought, as she glared though the crowd towards the treasure chest shop.</span></div></div>",

But in doing this, she ran into someone, directed.<br>\r\nMalon wasn't looking forward and walked into someone. She felt her shoulder pushing into someone, but they stood their ground and slowed Malon until she noticed and turned around. Malon had her face buried in some green clothing covering a well toned chest, and she tilted her head up to see a familiar face, her heart flew as she looked upon his face, it was Link. The young Hylian that Malon met years ago, but never forgot and developed feeling for as he visited more and more.<br>\r\n\"Be careful where you are being Princess,\" He said, smiling at Malon.<br>\r\nMalon blushed and was lost for words \"Hi Link.\"<br>\r\nLink look over to Zelda, and said warmly, \"Hello Zelda,\"<br>\r\nZelda looked his way, \"Good day, Link.\" <br>\r\nAs he looks around he flinches at the Cucco by Malon's side, but after seconds of observation, calmed a little and asked, \"What brings you down here, Princess Malon?\"<br>\r\nIt as this point, where Malon was only half playing attention, \"I just felt like coming here.\" The object of her affection was right here, and the wand was in her hand.<br>\r\nThere was an awful lots she could do. Then curiosity over came, as he eyes glanced down a little to his mid region. <i>\"It's not like he'd notice, and it would make us perfect for each other.\"</i> Malon quickly flicked the wand in a circle down by her side, then in an instant, she felt something between her legs being constricted by her clothing. Malon almost giggled, she had a special piece of Link attached to her body.<br>\r\n\"Well, it must be dangerous for a Princess to be here, so open and crowded.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but, I have my royal knights here, I will be fine,\" Malon smiled, thinking of have Link around more often, having heard of his previous feats of power and intelligence.<br>\r\n\"You'd be a lot safer with me around,\" Link said warmly, adding a friendly expression, giving a light laugh setting Malon of into her own laugh.<br>\r\nMalon felt something stir in her nether region. her face dropped and started to feel panic, she couldn't look down but with a straining she knew she had to get out of there.<br>\r\n\"I need to be going back to the castle now, bye Link.\"Malon quickly turned and sped off as her troop tried to follow after her back up to the castle.<br>\r\n\"Princess, please slow down,\" Zelda called out to her as they all ran back. Malon got back to the castle first and ran to princess's room the door slammed close behind her. She walked up to a mirror, where she lifted her dress up. Nestled beneath, smothered by silk undies was a man's package, calming from it's fight for freedom. It was larger than she thought, even in a semi-hardened state. She reach to grab it, it had been an usual day, but this was easily the more surreal, and needed to test if it was happening. Upon touching it, a surge of excitement caused a recoil. A knock interrupted Malon, causng her to drop the hem, as her dress covered her once again. <br>\r\nA second knock came, \"Who is it?\" Malon asked.<br>\r\n\"It's Zelda, Princess,\" Zelda said as she walked in. <br>\r\n\"Princess Malon,\" She address the confused girl, \"Are you feeling okay?\" <br>\r\n\"I feel fine,\" Malon replied, she felt great, she was now a princess from a farm girl, with the monarchy as a handmaiden, and with all the power she could want a simple hand twist away. <br>\r\n\"You've been acting unusual all day,\" The former princess stated, \"Your mannerisms are more relaxed and formal, and you've been nerous and acting like this is all unfamiliar and new to you.\"<br>\r\nOh, really?\" Malon asked.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should rest, Princess,\" Zelda suggested as she took Malon's hand, and lead her to the bed.<br>\r\n<i>\"I can do that, sleep in the middle of the day??\"</i> Malon thought to her self, not used to being able to take a break, being a farm girl working from dawn til dusk, \"Okay I will do that.\"<br>\r\nZelda walked to a wardrobe and picked up a thinner dress, and moved back to Malon. She removed Malon's crown and other accessories and placed them into a box nearby, \"Arms up,\" and Malon put her arms up and Zelda peeled her dress of, glancing right past her crotch bulge but fixed of her chest for a while, which was more impressive without clothes on, and gave Malon a smug, satisfied grin, seeing the effects of her swap taken place. Zelda then pulled the nightie over Malon's head and down, she then turned around and closed the think curtains keeping out the late afternoon sun and left saying \"I will get you in time for dinner.\"<br>\r\nThe door closed behind the \"handmaiden\".<br>\r\nMalon closed her eyes, \"I could get used to this,\" she grinned to herself as she drifted off into a mid day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note, this storyline is being written with the idea of being in the childhood timeline, just years later when they have all grown up from the point of Link going back in the ending. None of Link's adult feats are known but his feats as a child, saving the goron's from King dodongo and Zora princess from Lord Jabu Jabu and Ganondorf was stopped before he came to more power).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malon slowly opened her eyes to an unfamiliar room, and a strange feeling between her legs. She momentarily panicked as she looked around the room, slipping a hand beneath the covers of the bed to investigate what was going on under there. As her hands reached the bulge in her panties, it all came back to her. Earlier today, she'd found the Swap Wand, and she was now the princess of Hyrule, while Zelda was her handmaiden. The \"unfamiliar room\" was Zelda's, now Malon's, bedroom, and the strange feeling between her legs was Link's genitals, which she'd swapped with him earlier. It was still so surreal, but she supposed the fact that she'd gone to sleep and woken up with the changes still in effect went to show it wasn't just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the room was empty, save for Malon herself, Malon got up out of bed, and walked over to the window. Behind the curtain, she could see the sun was just setting. She hadn't slept for too long, probably since she'd tried to sleep in the middle of the day and wasn't really tired, but it probably wasn't time for dinner, as Zelda hadn't come to woke her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she peered out the window, still clothed in the nightgown Zelda had dressed her in, Malon reflected on the events of the day. She'd gone from being a simple farmhand to being the princess of Hyrule, with the former princess serving as her handmaiden. She'd made Zelda attracted to women so that she wouldn't be able to steal Link away from her, a fact that still brought amusement to Malon. The strangest change of the day, from her perspective at least, had almost certainly been the swap she did with Link, however. She still wasn't entirely sure it was a good idea, giving herself a male package while giving her own privates to Link, but at the very least, she didn't want to swap back, still reveling in the oddness of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't all go smoothly, however. She had accidentally activated the wand earlier without even thinking, causing a multitude of swaps that were out of her control, ranging from personality swapping to giving Zelda the ability to lay eggs. She knew she'd have to be more careful in the future. The was also the fact that although she now inhabited the princess's life, she hadn't been acting very princess-like, which had spurred Zelda to put her to bed in the first place. Although no one would suspect the truth, that Malon hadn't always been the princess, that didn't change the fact that they would find something odd with her behaviour if she didn't act like Zelda normally would. Although she didn't want to act exactly like Zelda, Malon figured it would probably become a problem if people started thinking she'd gone crazy because of a sudden change in her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, under normal circumstances, Malon would never be able to mimic what Zelda had learned throughout her whole upbringing. These were not normal circumstances, however. Even though Zelda believed she was her former handmaiden, perhaps her old personality still slept somewhere in her subconscious, and Malon could pluck parts out of it that she needed. Of course, she'd want to only take enough to keep up appearances, without giving away too much of her old self. Stepping away from the window, Malon turned to the dresser she'd left the wand on, and found...</span></div></div>",

She looked up at the cows she was feeding, when she hit upon an idea; did the wand also work on animals? And she knew just which animal to test it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out to the corral where the horses were being held, and found the young foal named Epona. She was probably Malon's favourite horse, and if Malon was going to try using the wand on an animal, she felt it should be Epona. Although she knew she didn't have to involve herself in the swap, Malon felt it would be appropriate to use herself, considering how much trouble she had deciding on who to swap with in the first place. Now it was just a question of what to swap with her. Maybe she could see what it was like to be a horse by swapping bodies with her.</span></div></div>",

There was a flash of light, and all of a sudden, she was no longer standing on the beach. Instead, she was sitting inside the cabin of a boat. Looking down at herself, she found that she wasn't really herself anymore. She was wearing the familiar green tunic that she recognised as being Link's. She also notice she now lacked a beak or wings. She must be in Link's body! Was Link in her body now? Did he know about the saw or did he think he'd always been Medli? It was a little difficult to find out since Medli's body was back on Dragon Roost Island, while Medli in Link's body was on a ship somewhere out in the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli would have explored further if not for a tanned hand being waved in front of her face. \"Hello? Link? Kinda spacing out there.\" Turning to see the source of the hand, Medli saw Link's friend, Tetra, looking back at her. Link was probably in the middle of a conversation with her with Medli suddenly took over Link's body. That was going to take a bit of explaining. Or... Medli could feel the Swap Wand still gripped in her hand (or now more accurately, Link's hand). Maybe she could swap Tetra somehow and get out of this.</span></div></div>",

She didn't really care who got swapped right now, just so long it was someone she knew, one of her friends.

Upon hearing the voice that came out, she looked at herself and let out another scream. \"Again!? What's going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Link?\" Medli asked cautiously. Considering whoever was in Tetra's body was talking about this happening \"again\", Medli assumed it was Link, but she figured she should ask just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, who was currently the one inside Tetra's body, nodded. \"T-Tetra?\" he asked in return. It was an okay assumption, that if he was in Tetra's body then Tetra would be in his, but in this case, he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli shook her head, or more accurately, Link's head. \"No, I'm actually Medli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medli? I think I was in your body a couple seconds ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... that's kind of my fault.\" Medli did feel a little bad about doing this to link, but she felt the need to be honest in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli took the time to explain things to Link; finding the wand, swapping with him, and then swapping him with Tetra. The entire time, Link leaned against Tetra's desk, squirming uncomfortably in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's sorta like the Command Melody?\" Link asked when Medli was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. But I can do a lot more with it. It's just that this is all I've done so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Can I have my body back now? It's really weird, like I'm talking to myself or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli considered Link's request. On one hand, she had stolen his body without asking, and then used him to avoid an awkward situation with Tetra. But on the other hand, Link had borrowed her body several times during their trek through the Earth Temple, maybe now it was her turn to change things around. And if she did give Link his body back, that would mean either putting herself in Tetra's body, and in turn becoming the leader of Tetra's pirate crew, or putting everything back to normal, and leaving Link to explain everything to Tetra.</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her head to get rid of the dizziness she was experiencing before taking a look at herself. Gone was her Gerudo outfit that stood out from the rest. In its place was a purple and white gown with gloves reaching up to her shoulders. Although her figure was still showing with her ensemble, she could tell there was a lot more hidden. She then felt her head and was relieved to find the jewel all Gerudo possessed on their heads, but was shocked to find a tiara and felt her hair flowing down past her shoulders instead of being tied up in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! Princess Nabooru!!\" Nabooru heard the guards yell. She turned to the direction of the sound and saw two guards running up to her. \"My princess, the King told you not to wander off on your own!

This really proves that it should be I who leads your tribe. Do you agree yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru glared at her in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda twirled the baton around a bit, \"Oh come now. Surely I am far more qualified to lead the Gerudo than you. Do I not look the part more than you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru looked down and bit her lip. Princess Zelda may have been born to a human, but she had the body of a Gerudo with her prominent nose, tan skin, and long red hair. She was even wearing the figure-revealing outfit of a Gerudo, complete with gem. Nabooru on the other hand had the body of a Hylian, and a blond, blue-eyed, fair-skinned one at that, wearing an outfit better suited to the princess of Hyrule than to the leader of the Gerudo. <i>I was foolish to come in these clothes. All I've done was to make clear my intentions of gaining power over Princess Zelda. She was ready from the moment I walked in.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru tried to gather her confidence, \"I did not gain the leadership of my tribe from my appearance but from my training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda smirked as she waved the Swap Wand around, \"Training? You strike me as one who has trained their manners more than their blade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru couldn't hide the gasp. How could Zelda have known that she not only had the look of a Hylian Princess but the training of one as well? Hers had been an upbringing centered around kindness and compassion. She had barely eked out enough time to be a passable with blades and thievery, and she alone knew how much better-trained those under her had been. Nabooru was well-loved as a leader, but surely Princess Zelda's skills- She shook her head. <i>I did not come this far in the Gerudo by doubting myself. I won't start now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Zelda nodded, \"As I was saying, I order that you pledge your loyalty to me. And I won't take no for an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru thought. She could accept fealty for now; that would buy her some time to figure out a way out of this mess. On the other hand, the Swap Wand was right in front of her. If she could grab it, she could not only escape the dilemma but take all of Zelda's Gerudo qualities for herself.</span></div></div>",

But by hiding this fact from the others, Nabooru had been able to rise to leader of the Gerudo through her cunning and determination. And today, when she found the Swap Wand and planned to make an ally of Princess Zelda, she had worn robes befitting a Hyrulian princess, as if to announce her intentions in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did... did Zelda change my life with the Swap Wand somehow?</i> Nabooru shook her head, <i>No, that is how it's always been,</i> she told herself. <i>I'm sure I'd know otherwise... wouldn't I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's thoughts were interrupted as footsteps approached.

The reward for capturing this particular  base came in the form of a red treasure chest, usually marking an important item or weapon.  Lana walked carefully over to the chest, and opened it.  Inside was a peculiar item. There lay a blue wand, only a tad larger than Zelda's baton. \"Lucky me!\" Lana exclaimed in a cheery tone. \"I wonder what this does!\" Lana, being an avid magic user, was very excited to use what she thought was her new weapon. Upon grasping the wand and taking it from inside the trunk, Lana's mind was instantly filled with the knowledge of the Swap Wand, what it does, and how to use it. \"So, all I have to do is hold the wand and think of what traits or attributes I want to swap and with who I want to swap them with. This is an amazing item,\" Lana whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lana!\" Shouted Zelda from a distance. \"We need you at the front lines with us! Summonses have just called in a horde of new monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... Be right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana turned away from the chest, and started for the exit of the base. As she was running, a thought appeared in her head. \"I could definitely try my new wand right now!\" At first, she dissregarded it. Her friends needed her help!

After Lana tested the clothes out running and jumping a bit, she found the clothes a bit heavy, and annoying to walk around in. Her breasts were unsupported, and they jiggled and chafed too much every time she tried to run. She sat down on a nearby rock and contemplated what had just happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm still amazed this actually worked!\" She said to herself. \"Even though Link's clothes are uncomfortable and bulky, I still feel exhilarated and even little turned o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\" Screamed a low pitched voice in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Lana stood straight up.

No longer could she feel the cool breeze blow on her exposed stomach and shoulders, or the small weight of her necklace. Instead, she felt something on her that was rather odd. Her clothes now felt heavy, and she was positive very little skin was showing. It was a completely new experience for her, considering she had never worn this amount of clothing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained her vision, Lana's predictions were right. \"Wow, it actually worked!\" She was now wearing Link's signature green tunic, white pants, knee-high boots, and hat. The swap had also caused her light blue hair to go from a ponytail to just straight down so she could wear Link's hat. After Lana tested the clothes out running and jumping a bit, she found the clothes a bit heavy, and annoying to walk around in. Her breasts were unsupported, and they jiggled and chafed too much every time she tried to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm still amazed this actually worked!\" She said to herself. \"Even though Link's clothes are uncomfortable and bulky, I still feel exhilarated and even little turned o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LANA!

The voice belonged to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana ran, still in Link's clothing and armor, to the origin of the voice, bearing its weight and the pain of her chafing nipples.

Lana, who was walking alongside Cia, turned to her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re home,\u201d said Lana, though her smile faded slightly when she saw Cia was struggling slightly. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Cia. \u201cJust a little winded, is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d said Cia. \u201cI guess I\u2019m still recovering from our battle with Phantom Ganon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you need anything, I\u2019m here for you,\u201d Lana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Cia said, with a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia walked over to a nearby boulder and sat down to catch her breath. \u201cYou go on ahead. I\u2019ll catch up in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Lana. \u201cI\u2019ll see you inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia smiled at Lana as the blue-haired sorceress headed up the steps towards the ruins, but her smile soon faded from her face. She still couldn\u2019t believe that she was alive again, or that Link and Zelda had been so willing to forgive her. Lana\u2019s forgiveness hadn\u2019t been surprising, as she was the goodness that Cia had cast out of herself when she had been corrupted by Ganondorf\u2019s darkness. Seeing Link come to her aid in the Temple of Souls, despite everything she\u2019d done, simply because she\u2019d needed protection...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia sighed, and held up her right hand. A glowing golden triangle formed, hovering above the palm of her hand. Lana had given her the Triforce of Power after Phantom Ganon had been defeated, and Link, Zelda and Lana had all agreed to let Cia keep it after healing the land of Hyrule. She had expected that Zelda, at least, would\u2019ve protested letting Cia keep the Triforce of Power, but she hadn\u2019t said a word. Link and Zelda\u2019s faith in Lana\u2019s opinion of Cia was truly staggering, and Cia felt like she could never repay such kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Triforce of Power faded back into her hand, Cia spotted something in the dirt at her feet. It was a blue wand of some sort, with a red gem at one end. Both Cia and Lana had a vast collection of magic items and weaponry, but this wand wasn\u2019t one Cia recognised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cia asked as she reached down to pick up the wand. As soon as her fingers brushed against the surface of the wand, her mind was flooded with knowledge about the powers of the Swap Wand, and how to access those powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Goddesses,\u201d Cia whispered as she realised how much power she had at her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Cia do first?</span></div></div>",

Her decision made, Cia carefully pocketed the swap wand, then headed inside to find her counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia found Lana quickly enough. Lana was standing in front of the crystal ball Cia had used to observe the many periods of history and divergent timelines of Hyrule. As Cia approached, Lana looked up at her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Lana. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found this outside,\u201d Cia said as she took out the swap wand. \u201cDo you have any idea what it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana frowned as she looked at the swap wand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like it.

The Cucco was now dressed in Linkle\u2019s clothes, including the green hood over her head, the compass hanging from a chain around her neck, and a pair of tiny crossbows strapped to her legs. Linkle laughed at the sight, or at least, she tried to. However, instead of laughter, all that came out of her mouth was a clucking sound!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d said the Cucco Linkle was still carrying, causing Linkle to stare at the Cucco in shock. The Cucco was speaking with her voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, did the wand do this?\u201d Linkle tried to ask, but she simply started clucking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said the Cucco. She jumped out of Linkle\u2019s arm, and started walking towards Linkle\u2019s Cucco farm. Linkle followed the Cucco, and as she did, she looked at the wand she was still carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I guess I swapped lives with that Cucco, Linkle thought. Now everyone thinks I\u2019m a Cucco, and that the Cucco is me. And since I\u2019m a Cucco, that means I can\u2019t talk, but the Cucco can, since she\u2019s living a Hylian life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle followed the Cucco back to her farm, and watched as the Cucco walked up to the door of Linkle\u2019s house. Linkle clucked with laughter as she watched the Cucco jump up and grab the door handle with her beak. The Cucco entered Linkle\u2019s house and shut the door behind her, so Linkle decided to go enter the Cucco coop and see if things had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer to the coop, she didn\u2019t notice anything different from the outside. Once she entered, however, she saw that, alongside all the regular sized Cucco nests, there was a large nest that was just the right size for a Hylian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be my nest, thought Linkle. She sat down in the nest, and to her surprise, it was actually quite comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle clucked happily a few times as she settled into her nest. Apart from being naked and unable to talk, being a Cucco didn\u2019t seem to be too bad. Of course, with the swap wand, she could easily get her clothes or her voice back, simply by waving the wand.</span></div></div>",

It almost felt like she needed to go to the toilet, but Linkle knew that it was something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she shifted her feet so that she was squatting over her nest, and she felt muscles inside her contracting, and felt something smooth being pushed out of her vagina. She squawked loudly, and there was a strangely satisfying plop as she felt the smooth object being expelled from her body. Once she had finished, Linkle looked down between her legs. As she suspected, she had just laid an egg, much like a Cucco would. However, the egg was much larger than a regular Cucco egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the egg, she felt a bizarre mixture of distaste and maternal pride. Linkle was very disturbed by the fact that her body seemed to have been altered so that she could lay eggs, but she also felt quite proud of herself for successfully laying the egg. She honestly couldn\u2019t decide whether or not it she liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle felt the pressure building up again, and shifted slightly so that she was more comfortable. She felt another egg being pushed out of her vagina, though this time, it was much easier for her to handle. After that, she laid another egg, and another. Finally, she stopped laying, and Linkle looked down between her legs. She counted seven eggs in total, and another strange surge of maternal pride filled her. While she still found it weird that she could lay eggs, she was very pleased with herself. After all, seven eggs was no easy feat, even for a normal Cucco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle let out a tired cluck, and she felt a pang of hunger. Laying so many eggs had been surprisingly exhausting. She knew that there was a feeder full of Cucco food outside, and if her body had been altered to lay eggs, it had probably been altered that the Cucco food would taste good. Or she could simply take a nap, to try and recover her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle picked up the wand, which she\u2019d dropped when she had started laying eggs. Maybe she could use the wand to swap back into her own life, or even swap something else...</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t normally sleep on her stomach, but her instincts were telling her this was the best way to protect her eggs, so she decided to listen to them. Linkle gently rested her belly on her eggs, and felt the smooth shells pressing into her stomach. Once she had covered her eggs, she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Linkle awoke with a clucking yawn. She sat up and stretched her arms, and felt straw sticking to her. She briefly wondered why she had fallen asleep naked in the Cucco coop, then remembered about the swap she had performed with the wand. Linkle looked down, and saw that the seven eggs she had laid earlier were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cucco living my life must have taken my eggs, Linkle thought.

Thankfully, the pressure subsided immediately after, so Linkle pulled her panties and shorts back up.

She had her old life back now, which meant that she shouldn\u2019t be laying eggs anymore. But for some reason, she had just laid an egg, which was baffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was a Cucco, I needed to lay eggs,\u201d Linkle mused to herself. \u201cLaying eggs is an important part of a Cucco\u2019s life, after all. The wand must\u2019ve altered my body so that I could lay eggs while I was a Cucco. But why would I still be laying eggs as a Hylian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle was tempted to try swapping with the Cucco again, but she held back. She wasn\u2019t sure how she knew, but she was certain that she had successfully undone the life swap with the Cucco. In fact, Linkle was starting to remember a life where she\u2019d always laid eggs. She knew those memories were being created by the wand, and she could still remember her original life, where she didn\u2019t lay eggs. It seemed that if the wand had to change someone\u2019s body to make them fit a new life, those changes remained in place when the swap was undone. Maybe it was a side effect of swapping with an animal, instead of with another Hylian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if the wand has changed me so that I\u2019ve always laid eggs... I guess that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Linkle with a shrug. It was weird, but something about that very weirdness excited her. The idea of being an egg-laying Hylian was oddly appealing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can live with this,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I have much choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle gently set her egg down back on her bed, and turned her attention back to the wand. Maybe she could try a few experiments. There were other farms nearby. What other weird side effects might occur if she swapped a Hylian with a different animal?

Malon was back in her clothes, but Linkle noticed a large bulge under her skirt that was large enough to be her udder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad! Linkle\u2019s back!\u201d Malon called out, causing Talon to look over his shoulder at the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be,\u201d Talon said. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Talon,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were gone for quite a while,\u201d said Talon as he turned back to the cow he was milking. \u201cYou must have some stories to tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Linkle, as Malon walked over to where some stools had been stacked up. \u201cI went all the way to Hyrule Castle and back, and met all sorts of people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like quite the adventure,\u201d said Malon as she walked back over, carrying two stools. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither can I,\u201d said Talon. \u201cI\u2019ll join you two in a minute. Just let me finish the milking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d said Linkle as Malon set the stools down. Linkle sat down on one of the stools, while Malon walked back over to where the furniture was stacked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d said Malon as she picked up a bucket. \u201cI still haven\u2019t milked myself today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to do that now?\u201d Linkle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d said Malon as she set the bucket down and hitched her skirt up, exposing her udder. \u201cI always milk myself at this time of day. Besides, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen me do it before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malon said that, Linkle felt new memories forming inside her mind. She could indeed remember watching Malon milking herself, even though that had never actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle watched in fascination as Malon sat down and began massaging the teats of her udder. Milk began to dribble out of the teats slowly, then more and more began squirting out as Malon continued milking herself. Malon groaned happily as milk poured out of her udder and into the bucket at her feet. After a few minutes, the bucket was almost full, and Malon slumped back with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoo,\u201d Malon said. \u201cThat\u2019s much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the milking stall, Talon stood up and picked up the bucket of milk at his feet. He then walked over to Malon, and picked up the bucket she\u2019d filled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d Malon said as Talon carried the two buckets away. He then emptied the two buckets of milk into a large metal tank, and sealed the tank shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d said Talon as he put the empty buckets down and walked back over to Linkle and Malon. \u201cNow, then... let\u2019s hear about this journey of yours, Linkle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it all started a few months ago, when I heard Hyrule Castle was under attack...\u201d said Linkle as she began telling Malon and Talon everything about her adventures, and all the friends she\u2019d made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour into her story, when she was talking about her adventure with Ruto and Darunia at the time-displaced Lake Hylia, Linkle realised that Malon and Talon were distracted enough that she could use the wand on them if she so desired...</span></div></div>",

But would Malon believe her, though? Malon currently believed that she\u2019d had an udder for her entire life, even though Linkle knew that she\u2019d only gained it earlier that day. Would it be fair for Linkle to shatter that illusion for Malon? And if Malon really did want to know about her life without an udder, how would Linkle make her aware? Could she use the wand to somehow make Malon aware of the changes? However, Linkle had only learned what the wand was capable of when she first picked it up. Would Malon need to touch the wand herself to become aware of what it could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinkle?\u201d said Malon, waving a hand in front of Linkle\u2019s face. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Linkle. \u201cOh, nothing\u2019s wrong.

Her eyes were full of wonder, completely believing Linkle's story. \"Where did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just stumbled across it on the way home,\" Linkle replied. It sounded very underwhelming when she said it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon seemed to agree. \"Oh, that's it?\" Clearly she expected Linkle to have freed this magical artifact from the depths of some ancient dungeon or something after the story she'd told of the grand adventure she'd been on. \"And you're sure it works? How did you find out what it does?\" Doubt was starting to creep into her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it definitely works. I tested it a couple times just to try it out. And I know what it does because... well, it just sorta knew the moment I touched it.\" She was aware of how sketchy her story sounded, but she could think of no other way to describe it. When she reached out to touch it for the first time, her mind had just been filled with the knowledge of how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Malon hummed, thinking over Linkle's story. It wasn't that she didn't trust her friend, of course, but it just sounded a mite unbelievable, especially to a farmhand like her with no real knowledge of magic. She was sure Linkle wouldn't lie to her, though. \"Then, do you think I'd be able to touch it too?\" Even if Linkle wasn't lying, she still thought it might be good to learn about the wand the same way Linkle did, just in case she'd missed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle hesitated slightly. While the wand had granted her knowledge of how it worked, there were some things about this situation that were still a mystery. She had told Malon about the wand in the first place so the two of them could have fun with it together, and having Malon learn firsthand how the wand worked, instead of hearing Linkle's recount, would be the easiest way to let her in on everything. However, when Linkle had found the remote, nothing had yet been swapped, as far as she knew at least. That was not the case now. Though everyone was back in their own lives, Linkle's prior swaps had left her able to lay eggs, and had given Malon an udder. As far as Malon knew, these were completely normal, because she wasn't the one using the wand. What would happen if she touched the wand now? Would she become aware of everything the wand had done, suddenly forcing her to realise that her udder wasn't as normal as she believed, or would she still think it normal and simply receive the same knowledge Linkle had? How would Malon react if she found out her udder wasn't normal? It wasn't as if Linkle knew how to remove it after the life swap had put it onto her. It was a bit of a risk, though if she truly wanted to enjoy the wand alongside Malon, then perhaps it was a risk she'd need to take.</span></div></div>",

But that\u2019s impossible, right? I mean, I know it\u2019s unusual for a Hylian to have an udder, but I was born with this udder. Why is the wand giving me memories of a life that\u2019s not mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... well...\u201d said Linkle, sweating nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Malon, looking up at Linkle as her frown deepened. \u201cDid you have something to do with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle sighed heavily. \u201cYou know how I said tried a few swaps out earlier, to see if the wand works?\u201d she said, and Malon nodded. \u201cWell, the first swap I did was with one of my Cuccos. Specifically, I swapped lives with the Cucco. The Cucco was wearing my clothes and acting like I normally did, and I had to act like a normal Cucco... and since a normal Cucco has to lay eggs, the wand altered my body so that I could lay eggs too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d said Malon. \u201cBut... you\u2019ve always laid eggs... haven\u2019t you? Why would the wand need to alter you...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, before I used the wand, I\u2019d never laid an egg in my life,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cAfter living as a Cucco for a while, I swapped back into my own life. I thought I was back to normal, but then I laid an egg as a regular Hylian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle paused for a second, examining the wand in her hand. \u201cThe wand had to physically alter my body so I could live the life of a Cucco. However, those changes were permanent, and carried over when I swapped back into my own life. The power of the wand means that everyone accepts the change to my life as normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the wand made you lay eggs...\u201d said Malon, looking confused. \u201cDoes... does that mean you used the wand on me? Is that why I\u2019m getting memories of a life without an udder? Is that why I even have an udder in the first place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yes,\u201d said Linkle, unable to meet Malon\u2019s confused look. \u201cI swapped your life with that of the cow that Talon was milking earlier. But I swapped you back almost immediately after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Malon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause... I felt guilty...\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIt was wrong of me to make you act like an animal, and have an animal take your place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, since you swapped me with an animal, the wand had to change my body,\u201d said Malon softly, rubbing her udder gently. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can now remember a life without an udder. I remember having it for my entire life, but in reality, I\u2019ve only had it for a short time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIf I\u2019d known swapping your life with the cow\u2019s would give you an udder, I never would\u2019ve done it.

It seemed to help her stay calm, but there was something that felt wholly unnatural about it now that she'd obtained her memories from before being changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon, I'm really sorry,\" Linkle pleaded, desperately trying to think of what she could do to not lose her friend over a stupid mistake. \"Like I said, if I'd known it'd give you an udder, I wouldn't have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you knew this might happen, didn't you?\" Malon retorted, still refusing to meet Linkle's gaze. \"You already got changed yourself from swapping lives with an animal, you knew there was a chance of it happening. But you still did it, you still swapped me with a cow. And now I'm stuck with... this.\" The way Malon referred to her udder was miles away from the kind way she normally spoke. Now that she knew it wasn't normal for her to have an udder, her feelings truly seemed to have changed regarding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. I guess I just... couldn't help myself.\" Linkle didn't really have a good explanation for why she'd done what she did. The temptation to use the wand was just too tantalising. Perhaps it was a good thing she's let someone else in on the secret. This way they'd be able to keep each other in check, at least once Malon had calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help yourself? That's all you have to say for yourself?\" Mason asked, finally looking up at Linkle. Now it was Linkle's turn to look away, ashamed that she'd let the allure of the wand sway her into changing her friend in this way. Malon sighed, still disappointed and upset but unable to stay mad. \"You know, the only reason I'm not more mad at you is because we're the only ones who know something's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Malon,\" Linkle started, forcing herself to meet Malon's upset gaze. \"I don't want you to be upset with me. I showed you the wand because I wanted us to enjoy it together, as friends, and I still do. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you, please, just tell me. I'll do whatever I can so we can go back to being friends again.\" She hoped desperately that that would get Malon back on her side again. They had been friends for so long, it would be sad to end things here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon crossed her arms and looked away, thinking over Linkle's offer for a moment. It wasn't long before her gaze met Linkle's once more, looking a little less sad and a little more determined. \"Well, to start with, what about my udder? There's no way to undo the swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" Linkle replied, a little crestfallen that she'd failed on the first request. \"I could probably swap it onto someone else with the wand, if you want, but if swapping back into your own life didn't get rid of it, I don't really have any ideas on how to remove it for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Malon seemed to contemplate Linkle's suggestion. Linkle wasn't sure if Malon would be okay with the idea of forcing the udder onto someone else just to be rid of it, but considering the thought she was giving it, she really must not like having an udder now that she had her memories without it. It was only after offering the suggestion, and after Malon began to actively consider it, that Linkle began to realise she may have placed herself in a precarious position. Malon was upset with her for giving her an udder, and here she stood, a pristine udderless body for Malon to swap with. Mason could very easily suggest that Linkle become the one with an udder, and Linkle would have to do it if she wanted her friendship back. She could scarcely imagine what having that attached to her must feel like, and with her already having the ability to lay eggs, she'd be well on her way to becoming a veritable barnyard in the form of a single Hylian. She'd do it, though. If it meant she and Malon would be friends again, she'd accept the udder. That said, she wouldn't mind if Malon picked someone else instead.</span></div></div>",

Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it sort of does,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cAfter I swapped back into my own life and started to lay eggs, I could start to remember laying eggs before, even though that hasn\u2019t happened before today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d said Malon. \u201cBut in reverse, I guess.

That\u2019s how I can tell the memories of me laying eggs are fake. But, why do you feel like your memories of your old life are fake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s for the same reason you think your memories of laying eggs are fake,\u201d said Malon. \u201cRemember, my udder was a natural part of my life when I touched the wand. When the wand gave me my memories of my old life, it must\u2019ve done it in the same way it gave you memories of laying eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cSo... you\u2019re not mad at me for accidentally giving you an udder?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019ve always had this udder. I know that isn\u2019t true, but it doesn\u2019t feel true. This,\u201d Malon said as she placed a hand on her udder, \u201cIs part of who I am. So no, I\u2019m not mad with you. In fact, I\u2019m glad you helped me see the truth. It makes me appreciate my udder all the more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Linkle as she reached out and hugged Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Malon as she wrapped her arms around Linkle. \u201cBut there is something I need to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Linkle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are going to swap me with a cow again... don\u2019t swap me with a cow that my Dad is currently milking,\u201d said Malon. \u201cDo you have any idea how weird it is to remember being milked by my own father? I\u2019m a grown woman, I can milk myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Linkle said, then broke down giggling. Malon did her best to look stern, but she soon cracked up and started to laugh as well. Eventually, the two girls managed to compose themselves, and Linkle took the wand back out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so... now what do we do?\u201d Linkle asked.</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t just swap people without a care in the world, especially since there were still all sorts of potential side effects that she didn\u2019t know about. After all, Linkle had accidentally made herself an egg-laying Hylian when she\u2019d swapped lives with one of her Cuccos. Who knows what might happen if she did another swap? And besides, what if Malon or Talon saw her making the swap? How would they react to seeing her wave a strange wand around? As tempting as it was to make a swap, Linkle knew it was safer to resist the urge for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Dad!\u201d Malon said as she and Linkle approached him. \u201cLinkle just got back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Talon,\u201d Linkle said, waving at him as the two women approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello again, Linkle,\u201d said Talon, smiling warmly at the two. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Linkle, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d said Talon. \u201cYou were gone for quite some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cI saw so many different things on my journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like it\u2019ll be quite the story,\u201d said Talon. \u201cJust give me a few minutes to finish the milking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Linkle. Malon walked over to one side of the barn, and grabbed a few extra stools. She then brought the stools over and set them down next to Linkle. Linkle sat on one stool while Malon sat on the other. As the two sat down, Talon finished squeezing the last few drops into the bucket underneath the cow, then picked up the bucket and carried over to the other side of the barn. He poured the milk into a large metal tank, then sealed the tank shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d said Talon as he walked back over to the two. \u201cNow, Linkle, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re dying to tell us everything that happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle giggled. \u201cYeah, I guess I am. Anyway, when I first set off for Hyrule Castle, I ended up encountering this Skull Kid with a weird mask...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle spent well over an hour telling her story to Malon and Talon. Eventually, though, she reached the end of her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Malon. \u201cThat all sounds incredible!\u201d Malon then sighed. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve gone with you, but I\u2019m no good in a fight, and Dad needs my help around the Ranch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if this new farmhand I\u2019m hiring works out, you might be able to take some time to travel Hyrule yourself,\u201d said Talon. \u201cYou could even join Linkle and head off together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019d love to travel with you,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cBut not anytime soon. I think I\u2019ll stay here and rest for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Malon as she hugged her father. \u201cAre you going to need a hand bottling the milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll manage by myself,\u201d said Talon. \u201cYou and Linkle can go and enjoy yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Malon said, as she and Linkle began to walk out of the barn. As they walked, Linkle\u2019s mind again drifted to the wand in her pocket. She hadn\u2019t used it since she\u2019d swapped with the Cucco earlier, and accidentally given herself the ability to lay eggs. While Linkle had come to terms with the change to her body, the fact that the swap wand could cause such radical changes to someone made her a little hesitant to use it, despite how tempting it could be. She desperately wanted to see more of what the wand could do, though. Maybe she should tell Malon about the wand. Malon would be more than willing to tell Linkle if she was going too far. Who knows? Maybe Malon would be interested in using the swap wand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinkle?\u201d Malon asked, looking at her with concern. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d said Linkle, blinking in surprise at the sound of Malon\u2019s voice. \u201cOh, sorry. Yeah, I\u2019m okay. I was just... thinking about something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Malon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle hesitated slightly.

I...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she looked at Linkle. \u201cWait... you said you lay eggs now?! I-I can\u2019t believe I thought that was normal! Linkle, you lay eggs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt \u2013 wait, what?\u201d said Malon, looking confused. \u201cDo you... do you enjoy laying eggs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... maybe?\u201d said Linkle, feeling a blush heating up her cheeks. \u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s weird, but... something about that weirdness... for some reason, it\u2019s really exciting. Besides, I don\u2019t have much of a choice, do I? It\u2019s just something I have to live with now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Malon, looking at the wand in her hands. \u201cOkay... so you weren\u2019t lying...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cSo, do you still want to try out the wand for yourself?\u201d</span></div></div>",

We could swap clothes. That should be pretty safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cA bit boring for my tastes, but it should work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing a magic wand to change reality so that we wear each others clothing is \u2018boring\u2019, is it?\u201d Malon said, doing her best to look serious. However, her efforts were undermined by the barely suppressed smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah, a little,\u201d Linkle said with a giggle. \u201cHow about we swap jobs? I could be working here, and you\u2019d be the one managing my Cucco farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could have all sorts of changes to our lives,\u201d said Malon. \u201cI mean, would you still live on the Cucco ranch, even though you don\u2019t work there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cBut you could find out by making the swap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about something a little less life-changing?\u201d said Malon. \u201cLike maybe... ooh! I could swap our names! Do you think that might be possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA name swap?\u201d Linkle asked. \u201cActually, that could be pretty interesting, assuming it actually works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you swapped lives with a Cucco, right?\u201d Malon asked, and Linkle nodded. \u201cLives aren\u2019t exactly a physical thing, are they? It\u2019s just how you act and what you do. And since you were able to swap that with someone, I should be able to swap something like a name, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t see why not,\u201d said Linkle with a shrug. \u201cSo, what do you want to swap with me?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malon thought about it for a moment. It was a tough decision for her, as there were so many possible choices for her to swap with. A rustle in the nearby bushes snapped her out of her thoughts. She looked at where the noise had come from and saw a wild stallion appearing from behind the trees. That was when Malon made her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to swap something with that stallion over there,\" she told Linkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle looked at her strangely. \"Are you sure?\" she asked. \"I could understand it if you wanted to swap with a Cucco, or a cow; They're at least the same gender as you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" argued Malon. \"And where is the fun in that? If this wand is as powerful as you say, then it would be a much better test to see just HOW powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle still looked like she didn't approve of the idea, but eventually she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said. \"I still think you are more than a little mad for wanting to swap something with a stallion, but it's your call. Though, to be honest, she admitted, \"I am curious to see what to decide to swap with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sent Malon back into deep thoughts. She did want to use the Swap Wand on the stallion, but she hadn't yet decided on what to swap between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came to mind was to try and swap lives with the horse, just as Linkle had done with the Cucoo before. But there was one big thing that caused her to falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Linkle had swapped lives with the Cucoo, her body had altered itself so that she was able to lay eggs; a change that was carried over to her normal life when she swapped back. So, if she herself were to swap lives with a (decidedly well hung) male stallion, it would stand to reason that she would end up getting a massive 'package' so she could adjust to its life; something which would likely end up being transferred to her normal life when she'd swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon shuddered at the thought of having a massive pair of 'boy bits' between her legs, but when she started to think more about it, it actually began to seem like an interesting situation after all. Since reality would be altered to make every change seem normal to others, there wouldn't be anyone who'd think that it was wrong for her to have the 'bits' of a stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, such a drastic change was perhaps better suited for a second swap; she was unsure of whether the Wand actually worked. As Malon thought of a slightly less drastic change, the wind caused her clothes to gently sway. That's when she got another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to swap her clothes with the stallion instead! Sure; she would end up naked, but the thought of seeing a horse dressed in her clothes was really amusing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Seeing an animal talk and act like her, while everyone saw her as an animal and she had to live out the life of one, lack of clothes and talking and all, it all just seemed to fascinating to her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle seemed a little less enthusiastic, however. \"Um, not to rain on your parade, Malon, you can swap but you want, but are you sure about this? I mean, swapping lives with an animal is how I got stuck laying eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Malon replied cheerfully. \"But that's what's so exciting! You said yourself the weirdness of laying eggs as a Hylian was exciting to you, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, yeah, I guess,\" Linkle said a little sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is exciting for me too. And that's why I want to swap with that horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're still going to be as excited if the swap ends up giving you big ol' horse d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,\" Malon quickly interrupted, blushing a bit at the thought of what Linkle was suggesting. She had to admit, while it seemed a little daunting, it was also quite exciting. \"Besides, we don't even know if it'll change me like that. You started laying eggs because laying eggs is important for being a Cucco, who's to say if the wand thinks having boy bits is important enough for swapping lives with a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one way to find out, huh?\" Linkle said, reassuringly patting Malon on the shoulder. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure the horse doesn't do anything dumb while it's in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Won't it just act like me, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I mean, yeah, but still.\" The pair shared a chuckle at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes,\" Malon said once they'd stopped laughing, raising the wand. She felt a little silly doing this, but she was sure it would work. After all, she'd seen all the information when she picked up the wand, and she knew Linkle's ability to lay eggs was strange. Things were about to get wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a moment of hesitation, Malon waved the wand, thinking about swapping lives with the wild stallion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Malon waved the wand, she disorientingly found herself suddenly standing somewhere else. She could immediately feel the differences, but before she got a chance to examine herself, her attention was caught by what stood right in front of her. Standing beside Linkle, whose eyes were wide and face was bright red, was the stallion, now clothed in her dress and boots. It was a somewhat amusing sight, but the fact that she could see her clothes on the horse only drew attention to the breeze she could feel running across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he belongs to anyone,\" the stallion said, speaking in perfect Hylian. Clearly it believed that it was having a conversation with Linkle regarding the horse that had just shown up, seeing as it had no memory of the swap wand, which Malon could still feel being held in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I doubt it. I don't think I've, um, seen him on any of the nearby farms,\" Linkle mumbled in reply, stumbling over her words little as she embarrassingly tried, and failed, to keep her eyes off of something. Malon knew what she was looking at. She could feel it since the moment she swapped, she was just hesitating looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hesitate no longer, though. Casting her gaze downwards, she saw that, with her dress being worn by the horse, she was now completely naked. She blushed a little, her hands reaching up to cover her bare breasts to retain at least some modicum of modesty. She didn't bother covering her nether regions, though, already knowing there was absolutely no chance of her hiding what lay there. Even within its sheath, her new genitalia was massive, there was no other word for it. Though she was much smaller than the horse, it seemed its privates had not been proportionally adjusted to match, rather keeping the same size it had previously been, rather too large for her, although she supposed that any size would still feel strange. Even the testes that sat behind her member felt like they were almost the size of her fist. It was all a little ridiculous, and quite embarrassing, a blush gracing her face, though not quite as strongly as Linkle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how strange it was though, she couldn't deny that she was still feeling the same excitement she'd been feeling before the swap. Bizarre as it felt to have a horse's giant boy bits nestled between her legs, it wasn't uncomfortable exactly, and she couldn't help but feel a little giddy that no one would see anything wrong with it, dwarfing any feelings of awkwardness. Well, almost no one. Linkle could obviously see reality for how it really was, seeing her as a naked Hylian with a stallion's genitals, but to everyone else, she was an ordinary wild stallion. Perhaps she would come to regret this decision once the excitement was worn off, but for now, she was enjoying every second of this. Although, perhaps she was enjoying this a little too much. All this excitement seemed to be stimulating the one part of her that she definitely did not want being stimulated what Linkle was still watching.It was only then that her blush grew more intense as she fidgeted with her legs, trying to stop herself from unintentionally unsheathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems a bit distressed,\" the stallion in Malon's life observed, noting Malon's behaviour. \"Maybe he's lost?\" It slowly trotted up to her, an odd dissonance between the sound of its bare front hooves and boot-clad back hooves. Malon was suddenly glad she'd swapped with a wild horse and not one of the horses on the ranch; she didn't really want to imagine what it would be like to have horseshoes bolted to her feet. \"There there, it's alright,\" the stallion said, gently rubbing its snout against her arm. It felt surprisingly nice. Malon supposed this must be what it felt like for the horses when she hand her hand through their manes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, maybe you should ask Talon if you can keep him at the ranch for now? Just until we, uh, figure out if he belongs to someone, or what to do with him,\" Linkle suggested. Truthfully, she just wanted a chance to speak to Malon without the horse in her life being around, but it seemed like a convincing enough excuse. The talk of the horse having an owner did seem to trigger something in Malon though, as she realised that she actually had the horse's memories. She supposed that made sense, seeing as she was supposed to be living the horse's life now, but it was still somewhat amazing that she could remember things from someone else's perspective. In particular, she could tell that this horse was definitely a wild animal, and the equipment she now possessed had definitely been used before, causing yet more blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! That's a good idea. I'll be right back,\" the horse said, turning back towards Linkle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll, um, I'll wait here to make sure he doesn't run off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks!\" With not a word more, the horse ran off in an awkward gallop, dress swishing about around its legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the horse was out of earshot, Linkle turned back to Malon again, her face still tinged red. \"Well, this is awkward,\" she half mumbled, eyes still occasionally drawn to Malon's new additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again,\" Malon tried to say, but all that came out what a horse-like whinny. Her eyes went wide as she reached up to her mouth with her free hand. Despite the horse speaking like a Hylian, she somehow hadn't realised that she would have the voice of a horse now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon's reaction elicited a chuckle from Linkle. \"Oh, right, you're a horse now.\" She slowly approached, finding it easier to keep her eyes on Malon's face if she was closer. \"I'd ask how you're feeling but I wouldn't be able to understand you.\" That was a definite downside of this swap; her friend, the one who had introduced her to the wand in the first place, couldn't understand a word she said. Perhaps if they were both animals it would work, but she wasn't sure if Linkle would want to go another round after her first swap had left her laying eggs. \"Are you enjoying yourself at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon hesitated for a moment, but ultimately smiled and nodded. The excitement from this bizzarre situation hadn't worn off yet, so even being saddled with a horse's genitals, she couldn't say she wasn't enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Linkle said, a little surprised. She did recall having a little fun when she tried out being a Cucco for a while, but she didn't see her egg-laying abilities on quite the same level as the way Linkle had been changed. \"It's not weird or uncomfortable or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon waggled her head in something of a sideways nod. She wouldn't call it uncomfortable, but it was certainly weird. A good kind of weird though, not the off-putting kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Linkle was feeling pretty good about her decision to tell Malon about the wand right now. She had expected Malon to be a little hesitant about messing with something so powerful, but instead she'd jumped right in the deep end with something even weirder than Linkle had tried, and she seemed to be loving it so far. Linkle was now sure they'd be able to have a lot of fun together with this thing, but there was one thing standing in the way; while there was nothing strange about Linkle and Malon spending time together, people would probably start to question things if they saw Linkle wandering around town talking to a wild horse, to say nothing of the fact that she couldn't understand Malon at the moment. Something would have to change. \"So, you wanna swap back and see if... this sticks around?\" Linkle asked. It would be easier to understand Malon if they were the same species, and Linkle wasn't exactly eager to become a horse just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon mulled it over for a moment. She did rather like the idea of being a wild animal, roaming free, the breeze blowing across her body, but she could see the downsides. Along with Linkle being unable to understand her, everyone besides Linkle simply saw her as an ordinary horse, and would treat her as such. It limited what she could do a bit. However, she wasn't sure she wanted this experiment just yet. Strange as it may be, she was actually enjoying the weirdness of her new package, and she was a little worried about it vanishing when she swapped back. Linkle may not have changed back to normal, \"not laying eggs\" apparently not being deemed an important enough part of being a Hylian, but she couldn't see if the stallion was still as well hung as it had previously been, its privates hidden behind what was once her dress, so she couldn't tell if \"not having boy bits\" was considered as important to being a female Hylian as having them was to being a stallion. However, before she could decide, another idea came to her; what if she swapped lives, but not back into her own? Who said she had to go back to being herself just yet? Even if she didn't want to be a horse, she could be someone else for a while. Or perhaps she could find another animal to swap with, and see how it and the horse would behave, believing they were a different species. The only trouble is that would leave things yet more jumbled, and possible permanently affect herself or others, so she'd have to be a little careful if she went this route.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking it over for a bit, Malon decided that swapping back into her own life was the safest option for now. Even though she was enjoying the swap, and certainly liked the idea of being a wild animal for a while, Malon had the feeling that the longer she stayed in the stallion\u2019s life, the less likely she\u2019d be to give it up. Besides, she also wanted to see if she would keep her new equipment when she undid the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon held up the wand, making sure Linkle could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna swap back?\u201d Linkle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Malon tried to say, but a neigh came out of her mouth instead. She groaned in annoyance and nodded instead. That was another reason she wanted to swap back. Malon wanted to be able to talk with Linkle again, and she couldn\u2019t do that while she was living the life of a stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon looked past Linkle, and saw the stallion living in her life trotting away towards the Ranch. Malon\u2019s dress was obscuring the horse\u2019s legs, meaning she couldn\u2019t tell whether it was still as well hung as she currently was. She wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d keep her new genitals when she undid the swap. Of course, there was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sighed, and waved the wand. As soon as she did so, she found herself disorientated again, as she was now standing where the stallion had been when she made the swap. She could also feel her clothes settling around her, changing back to fit her body again. However, with her clothes on, Malon couldn\u2019t tell if she still had the stallion\u2019s \u2018boy bits\u2019 or not. After all, Linkle\u2019s body had been altered by swapping lives with a Cucco so she could lay eggs. However, as Malon was a woman, that would mean that the ability to give birth to children was an important part of her life... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon looked down at her legs as she raised a hand to her crotch to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A blush graced Malon's face as her hand rested against her skirt, gently wrapping around the bulge that sat there. Her expression twisted into a slightly giddy smile, realising that she still possessed her impressive stallion-sized genitalia. Most people would probably be somewhat concerned about the fact that they had irreversibly altered their body in such a way, but Malon couldn't help but be excited. Something about these big horse\"boy bits\" hidden under her dress was just weirdly amazing to her, especially considering no one besides Linkle would think anything was wrong with it. If there was anything she was worried about, it was probably the fact that she had grown so accustomed to having these parts so quickly that she could scarcely tell anything was \"wrong,\" to the point that she hadn't been able to tell if she even had them without patting down her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving wasted enough time checking her new parts were all still there, Malon quickly hurried back to Linkle, no longer needing to speak to her father about the stallion as it had been doing when it was in her life. Linkle seemed to be frowning slightly, looking at the stallion, which was back to just being an ordinary horse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it still there?\" Linkle asked once she noticed Malon approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm,\" Malon hummed, sounding a little happier than she probably should for someone who was stuck living with a horse's giant \"boy bits\" between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. He's got his too,\" Linkle replied, gesturing towards the horse. As she stated, the stallion was just as well hung as it had been before any swaps took place. It hadn't been alerted in any obvious way by its time as a Hylian girl, unlike Malon. \"I wonder why you didn't change back. I mean, if having those parts is important for being a boy, then shouldn't NOT having them be important for being a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking about that,\" Malon interjected, having mulled it over while she was coming back over. \"See, when I was in the horse's life, I realised I had its memories, as if I had been it all my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" Linkle said, somewhat surprised. She supposed it made sense that you'd need someone's memories in order to live their life, but somehow she hadn't seen that coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Was it not the same for you with the cucco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I don't remember having its memories. There was a lot to take in about being a cucco, though. Maybe I just missed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, I realised that the stallion... well, it's mated before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? ...Oh!\" Linkle's face turned red again as she realised what Malon was saying, and briefly pondered how much Malon had seen in the horse's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, I was thinking, the stallion couldn't have mated the way it did without its \"boy bits\",\" Malon explained, still not using the proper name for her new parts. \"But I haven't had any children, so maybe my parts weren't as important for my life as the stallion's were for his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Linkle replied, pondering it herself. \"I suppose we'll just have to be careful when swapping with boys. Or, I guess I will, since you've already been changed.\" This elicited a bit of a giggle from Malon. \"I still can't believe you're okay with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're okay with laying eggs, aren't you? That's pretty weird too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I guess. This feels different, though.\" Linkle had to admit it was strange that her body was now designed to push eggs out of her vagina, but the fact that Malon now possessed a set of male genitalia, let alone one as large as a horse's, seemed significantly more strange and awkward to her. She wasn't about to try and convince Malon of that, though, with how much she seemed to be enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you're not done with the wand yet?\" Linkle replied, doing her best to put Malon's new parts out of her mind. Perhaps she'd eventually learn to treat it as normally as everyone else in the world now did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linkle, we have a magic wand capable of swapping anything with anyone, and the only thing we've done with it is temporarily swap lives with a couple of animals. Of course I'm not done with it, just think about everything we can still do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis elicited a chuckle from Linkle. \"Hehe, I'm glad you're getting so into this. So, you wanna head into town and see who we can swap with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could.\" Malon pondered, thinking about all the people in the nearby town that they could use the wand on. \"I'd have to ask my dad, though. We could always just stay here at the ranch. If you're okay with swapping with more animals, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Linkle hummed. She wasn't really sure how she really felt about swapping with animal right now. So far, both swaps that she and Malon had performed had been with animals, and both had permanently altered their bodies, after a trait the animal possessed was considered an important part of the animal's life. Did she really want to risk more swaps like that? Sure, she may be comfortable with her new egg-laying ability, but she wasn't as excited about it as Malon had been about her new parts. Would she really be comfortable if their messing around with the wand gave her, for example, a tail, or a cow's udder?</span></div></div>",

As she looked down, Malon could see no sign of the massive horse genitalia that she\u2019d previously had. However, as her hand brushed against her crotch, she felt something under her fingers that didn\u2019t feel quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon frowned slightly as she examined herself more closely. After a few seconds of probing, Malon felt something between her legs, and she started to suspect what it was. Her suspicions were soon confirmed as she felt something straining against her panties, and Malon could see a small tent forming in the front of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush began to colour Malon\u2019s cheeks, and a slightly giddy smile began to twist her lips. Even if they weren\u2019t the stallion\u2019s, she still had her \u2018boy bits\u2019. No, calling it her \u2018boy bits\u2019 was a little bit childish. It was a <i>penis</i>, and it belonged to her. Malon felt herself growing more and more excited about having her own penis, which was making said penis grow harder and harder. She knew that most people would probably be worried about such huge changes to their bodies, but thanks to the power of the wand, the only person who would be aware of it would be Linkle. If there was anything that did worry Malon about this whole situation, it was the fact that she hadn\u2019t immediately been able to tell that she had a penis. She\u2019d needed to pat herself down in order to find out that she had her penis, and she was a little surprised at how quickly she\u2019d adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knew what had happened to her, Malon quickly turned around and headed back towards Linkle. Since she was back in her own life, she no longer needed to tell her father about the stallion. Malon walked with a bounce in her step as she made her way back to Linkle, who was examining the stallion from a distance. As she got closer, Malon could see that the stallion still possessed his own genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the horse isn\u2019t any different,\u201d Linkle said as Malon walked up. \u201cBut I know you were changed by the swap... is it still there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... sort of?\u201d Malon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of?\u201d said Linkle, looking over at Malon. \u201cWhat do you mean, sort of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d said Malon, trying to figure out how to break the news to Linkle. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly have a <i>horse\u2019s</i> penis anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle frowned, then her eyes went wide as she realised what Malon was implying. \u201cWait... you mean...?\u201d Linkle trailed off, her eyes darting towards Malon\u2019s crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, yeah,\u201d said Malon with a smile. \u201cI think I have a Hylian penis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Goddess,\u201d Linkle whispered as she looked back up at Malon. \u201cBut... having a... one of those... is important for being a boy. I would\u2019ve thought <i>not</i> having one is important for being a woman, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking, and I might have an idea,\u201d said Malon. \u201cWhen I was living as the stallion, I realised I had his memories, like I\u2019d been the stallion all my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Linkle said. \u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t experience anything like that as a Cucco, but I guess it makes sense. After all, you\u2019d need those memories in order to live like the horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Malon with a nod. \u201cAnyway, some of those memories involved, um, you know... mating...\u201d Malon said as she began blushing in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?... Oh!\u201d said Linkle, who also began to go red as she realised what Malon had seen in the stallion\u2019s memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Malon, nodding. \u201cAnd, since the stallion had mated before, I guess the wand decided that I needed the horse\u2019s penis in order to be the father of the horse\u2019s foals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cAnd, since you\u2019ve never had children of your own, the wand must\u2019ve decided that your vagina wasn\u2019t an important part of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly what I was thinking,\u201d said Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you still have a penis, right?\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIt\u2019s just a Hylian penis now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess being Hylian is still an important part of my life,\u201d said Malon. \u201cBut, think about it. The eggs you\u2019ve laid... they\u2019re not Cucco eggs, are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re right, they\u2019re not,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cMy eggs are way too big to be Cucco eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Malon. \u201cYou\u2019re laying Hylian eggs, just like how I have a Hylian penis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes as much sense as anything else,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cAnd, uh, how do you feel about it? Are you... okay with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m definitely comfortable with this,\u201d said Malon, gently patting her crotch. \u201cIt feels completely natural, like I\u2019ve had it my whole life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Linkle asked. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re okay with laying eggs, right?\u201d said Malon. \u201cThat\u2019s about as weird as me having a penis, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but... I don\u2019t know, this feels a little bit different to me,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for something inside my body to change. Seeing my best friend\u2019s body physically change...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know what you mean,\u201d said Malon. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m fine with my penis, but I still can\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that you can lay eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah,\u201d said Linkle, smiling. \u201cStill, I guess we don\u2019t have much of a choice, huh? We both have to live with our new bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d said Malon, looking at the wand that was still in her hands. The two women were quiet for a while, then Linkle spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d Linkle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said Malon, looking back up at her friend. \u201cLinkle, we have a wand that can swap any<i>thing</i>, with any<i>one</i>! Just think of what we could do with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle giggled. \u201cGood to see you\u2019re still okay with using the wand. Want to head into town and see what we can do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019d need to ask my dad first,\u201d said Malon. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll say no, but... well if he does, I guess we\u2019ll just have to stay here and experiment with animals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cIf we do decide to stay here... maybe we should head inside...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would we go inside?\u201d Malon asked, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was...\u201d Linkle said, trailing off as she blushed. \u201cUm... I was gonna ask i-if I could see it. Y\u2019know, your, uh... your penis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy...? Oh!\u201d Malon said as she began to go red again, and only grew more embarrassed as her new penis began hardening again at the thought of showing it to Linkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you don\u2019t have to!\u201d Linkle said quickly as she looked away in embarrassment. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to, I mean. I was just curious, that\u2019s all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Malon said, also averting her eyes. \u201cI just, I haven\u2019t actually seen it, myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right, of course,\u201d said Linkle. \u201cBut, um... anyway... back on topic, what do you think we should do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

That would turn her into a male human, and the stallion would become a mare. How would that affect her life? Would she be considered a man, or would she still be seen as a woman, despite having a man\u2019s body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next idea she had was to swap bodies with the stallion. How would Malon\u2019s life change if she had the body of a male horse? How would she do things like open doors, or milk cows? How would she even still hold the wand? Would she have to use her teeth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third idea she came up with was a species swap. While this would still result in Malon becoming a horse, she would become a mare, rather than a stallion. And if she did become a mare, would she simply have a female version of the stallion\u2019s body? Or would she have a different body, that bore some resemblance to her human form?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth idea that came to mind was a more unusual swap. What if she could swap her physical strength with the stallion? Malon was no weakling, far from it, but she was still nowhere near as strong as her father. The wild stallion, on the other hand, was obviously incredibly strong. If Malon could swap her strength with the stallion, she\u2019d be able to help her father with far more around the farm than she normally could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of swap did Malon perform?</span></div></div>",

I guess I did swap our reproductive systems after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs surprising as suddenly laying an egg had been, Linkle realised it hadn\u2019t been unpleasant. In fact, much to her surprise, she realised that she enjoyed being able to lay eggs more as a Hylian than she did as a Cucco, and felt the urge to swap reproductive systems with the Cucco again...</span></div></div>",

So, instead, Linkle decided to head out into the village and see what she could do with the wand. Her mind set, Linkle put the wand in her pocket and set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Linkle arrived in the village. As she walked, she smiled and said hello to all the people who welcomed her back. To her disappointment, nobody mentioned anything about Linkle\u2019s ability to lay eggs, but she supposed that made sense. From what Linkle had seen, when the wand made a swap, only the person holding the wand was aware that anything had been swapped. But, that also meant that she could make a swap in the middle of town and nobody would bat an eyelash, which was good. Linkle wanted to make weird swaps between Hylians and animals, like the one she\u2019d made to herself. So far, though, nothing she\u2019d seen leapt out to her and inspired her to make a swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Linkle walked into the town square, she spotted a few familiar faces. The first was her childhood friend, Malon. Malon lived with her father at Lon Lon Ranch, the neighbouring farm. The two of them raised dairy cows, and Malon was standing with one of her farm\u2019s cows next to her. Malon was talking to Ilia, a young woman from the nearby Ordon Village. Ilia\u2019s family were horse breeders, and Ilia had brought one of her family\u2019s mares with her to Linkle\u2019s village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Malon or Ilia had noticed Linkle yet, which meant this was the perfect time to make a swap. The only question was, who would she swap, and with whom?</span></div></div>",

As the light faded, Linkle looked around her room. At first glance, everything seemed to be normal, but then Linkle noticed a padded cushion on the floor, to one side of the bed. There was an egg sitting on the bed, about the same size as the ones she had laid when she was a Cucco and when she had a Cucco\u2019s reproductive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid... did it work?\u201d Linkle asked herself quietly as she put the wand down. Linkle then looked out her window, and strangely, she saw that a barn had replaced her Cucco coop. She could hear cows mooing in the barn, and Linkle frowned. Since when did she own cows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle noticed a book resting on her bedside table, and she picked it up. It was an old book, one she\u2019d had for years, that had taught her how to properly take care of farm animals, including Cuccos. She quickly turned to the pages on Cuccos and started reading. However, the text about Cuccos was now completely different, and said that Cuccos were the only bird to give birth to live young, and that they were only raised for their meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! It worked!\u201d said Linkle, jumping up and down in excitement. Once her excitement faded, she turned her attention back to the book, and quickly read the section on cows. As she read it, she felt new memories forming in her mind. All of a sudden, she could remember laying eggs all her life, and taking care of cows at her ranch, even though she hadn\u2019t done either of those things before today. Despite suddenly gaining a lifetime\u2019s worth of memories, she found she could easily tell which memories were from her original life, and which memories were from the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Linkle, putting the book down. \u201cI guess the wand is giving me memories of this new reality.

She spent a few hours walking through the town, saying hello to people and telling everyone what had happened on her journey. As she travelled through town, she noticed a woman that had been pregnant when she had left for Hyrule Castle. Now, the woman was carrying a basket, and in that basket, wrapped in blankets, was a large, baby sized egg. As Linkle watched, the egg started to crack, and the woman gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! The baby\u2019s coming!\u201d said the woman, as the cracks grew larger. A section of the egg broke off, and a tiny hand poked out of the hole. The egg continued to crack, and slowly fell apart, revealing a healthy young baby. The baby began to cry once the egg was broken, and the new mother cooed as she gently took the broken shards of egg shell out of the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from a distance, Linkle had to struggle not to laugh. While this may have seen normal to everyone else, none of them realised that this was the first time anything like this had happened before, and it was all because of Linkle. Linkle joined the crowd of onlookers and well-wishers, congratulating the mother for incubating her egg. That was when Linkle gained more memories from this new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Linkle could remember learning that Hylian women laid one or two eggs every day, and that if a woman went for more than five days without laying an egg, it meant she was pregnant. Over the course of a single month, a pregnant Hylian woman would reach full term, and would lay a large egg, roughly the size of her baby. The woman would then have to incubate the egg for eight months, after which the egg would hatch. Linkle could also now remember that a Hylian woman was considered pregnant until the egg hatched, rather than when the egg was laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the baby hatching and congratulating the new mother, Linkle returned home. She spent the rest of the day at home, and, after all the excitement of using the Swap Wand, Linkle decided to get an early night\u2019s sleep.</span></div></div>",

She lazily climbed out of bed, and walked over to the padded cushion beside her bed. Linkle pulled her panties down and squatted over the cushion. Once she was over the cushion, she laid her morning eggs, pushing four eggs out of her vagina. Another new memory rose into Linkle\u2019s mind, and she could now remember that some Hylian women, including herself, would lay many more eggs than average. In fact, Linkle could now remember laying twelve eggs in a single sitting, and laying twenty eggs over the course of a single day, despite the fact that neither event had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also began to remember selling her excess eggs, and that Hylians would use the eggs that were laid by Hylian women in their cooking. That seemed weird to Linkle, but it did make sense. After all, if Cuccos no longer laid eggs, then people would have to get eggs from somewhere else. Since Hylian women now provided a steady supply of eggs, it wasn\u2019t surprising that people would use those eggs instead. Not only that, but since Hylian women carried fertilised eggs for a month before laying them, and fertilised eggs were much larger than unfertilised ones, it was easy to tell which was which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished laying her eggs, Linkle pulled her panties up, then got dressed for the day. Linkle made herself some breakfast, and even used one of her eggs for it. Once she\u2019d eaten, she went out and checked up on the cows she now had. Linkle found it surprisingly easy to milk the cows, and she figured that the Swap Wand had given her the skills she needed after altering her life so radically. Once she\u2019d finished milking the cows, she bottled the milk, ready to sell it in town later that afternoon. When she finished a few hours later, she returned to her house to sit down and rest for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting close to midday, and Linkle felt a familiar pressure building up as she walked through her house. Linkle didn\u2019t even bother to pull her panties down, and simply squatted and pushed a single egg out of her vagina. Once she\u2019d laid the egg, Linkle reached into her panties and pulled the egg out, then put it with the others she planned to sell. She had gotten used to laying eggs surprisingly quickly, and she was even starting to get a sense of how many eggs she\u2019d lay in a single sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying her midday egg, Linkle decided to have some lunch.

She could twist the very fabric of reality with just a wave of this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she thought about what she could do to Link with it. She could finally make him do what she wanted. She could make him act like a girl. She could actually make him a girl. She then paused and thought about the girls she'd seen on their journey. What most people or twili didn't know was that Midna was bisexual. There was Princess Zelda. Midna almost had an orgasm just thinking about how she could see the Hylian Princess treating her like a god.
