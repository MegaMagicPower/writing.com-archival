I just finished my first semester and Lord Fairfax Community College recently and was currently at home in the countryside, enjoying not having any school work to do. As I sat up, I noticed something black beside me, I picked it up, and couldn't believe my eyes, it was the Onyx deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wh-what the?' I thought in surprise. Suddenly the deck glowed and all of the information I needed was beamed into me. \"Whoa...\" Was all I could say, and who could blame me, I had just found out that an Advent Deck had chosen me to protect this world and all of the other ones from TV shows that were in danger as well, luckily I have many recorded episodes of each one. I thought about it, and realized that I needed to try to find the other Riders, where ever they were.</span></div></div>",

I needed some time to wake up so I could think clearly and come up with a plan to find and gather the other Riders quickly.  I did not know why, but I had a strong feeling that at least one of the Rides was very close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Onyx deck began to glow again. I knew in an instant what it meant and turned to find a number of minions entering my house through the mirrors and windows of my house. They zeroed in on the kitchen, where I was, forcing me to flee with the Onyx deck as there was not enough room to fight there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take this outside!\" I challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bolted out the back door, towards the woods to transform, when a heard a sound coming from above. I looked up and was surprised to see a giant robot vampire bat diving for my house. Just as it reached the ground, however, it suddenly transformed into a blue and silver motorcycle with a yellow silhouette of  a bat on the front.  It was Kamen Rider Wing Knight. I took advantage of his slightly dramatic entrance and transformed myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to me, keeping an eye on the now hesitant minions. \"I see you have the Onyx deck.\" he said. \"I guess that makes you the leader of this team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a problem with that?\" I asked, calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWing Knight shook his head. \"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the minions all attacked at once, coming in at all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking with Wing Knight, he and I fought them off. Neither he or I held back a single punch or kick. We eventually cleared the woods of all the minions. Still, I knew it was just the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just the first wave.\" I said. \"There will be more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your plan?\" Wing Knight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Eric's point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx decided it best to take some extra time to lay out a plan. Personally, I would have preferred to grab one of the Minions and work on getting some answers out of him. Onyx assured me that it would have been a waste of valuable time as they do not speak any Earth language. It made sense, of course, but I grumbled anyway as I reluctantly allowed the last of the few Minions that avoided us to vanish into a window. I was still angry about the other set of Minions who had trashed by house attacking me earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those minions are the least of our worries, Wing Knight.\" Onyx said. \"Monsters are sure to follow, and soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point.\" I said. \"Let's go over our options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe returned to the house, which I assumed was his, where we both returned to our normal forms after going into the mirror world version. Onyx seemed rather surprised by my age but he did not address the issue. He instead introduced himself as Anthony. I did the same and he quickly got me up to speed on the situation as he understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds about right.\" I replied. \"I got the same feeling when I touched the Wing Knight deck. I'm not sure why it chose me, I'm not exactly in my prime. However, I will do everything I can to help you and the other Riders stop this invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI removed a bottle of pills from my jacket pocket. I opened it, then popped one of them into my mouth and swallowed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask what those are for?\" Anthony asked, giving a hint of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High blood pressure.\" I replied, returning the bottle to its pocket. \"I've had it since I was a child. Without this medicine, I won't be of much use to you or the other Riders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headaches?\" asked Onyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Migraines, moderate to severe, but still enough to slow me down.\" I motioned to the table. \"We should get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx nodded in agreement and we sat down, going over ideas and suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a new office building nearby my home.\" I said. \"The entire building is one big piece of glass, perfect for the first monster to come through. It might be a good bet that the other Riders are thinking that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. I don't think it works quite that way with the monsters.\" Anthony replied. \"Maybe we can find a way to use the decks help find the other Riders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" I said. \"How about we do both? On the way, we can use the deck to detect other Riders nearby. My deck sensed you as I was flying over, and yours sensed me coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still get the feeling that there is another Kamen Rider nearby...\" Anthony replied. The more I talked to him, the more I sensed he knew what he was doing. After several minutes of going over our options, we both agreed on one course of action and began set our plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Anthony's point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric struck me as the type of person who doesn't like to lose. Fortunately, he was mature enough to listen to my reasoning and agreed that using the decks to locate the other Riders was the best course of action. Together, we focused and searched for any nearby deck, we quickly found that there was one nearby, in fact, it seemed to be inside the normal world version of my house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another Kamen Rider this close?\" Eric wondered out loud in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one person still in our world's version of this house, it has to be her.\" I said as I went to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\" Eric asked in confusion, but I was already on the other side by that point. He soon appeared behind me after I began heading to my sister's room. \"Who are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little sister.\" I replied as I opened the door to her room. She was sitting on her bed looking at the Siren Deck in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scottie, do you know what this is?\" She asked, using my family's nickname for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scottie?\" Eric asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Family nickname.\" I simply replied. I could tell that he was currious why my nickname is Scottie, but he was willing to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that, and why is he in the house?\" Christina asked in surprise, obviously wondering why a stranger was in the house. After an introduction and a long explanation (along with a demonstration she was skeptical at first), she was helping us search. As the minutes passed, I watched Eric slowly pace the living room floor, keeping a sharp eye on the windows and mirrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should relax.\" I told him, slightly irritated by his pacing. \"It's not good for you to be this wound up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no guarantee that the decks will warn us of in coming trouble while we are searching for other Riders.\" Eric replied flatly. \"We must be vigilant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point.\" I said. \"However-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I think can we do it without pacing.\" Christina finished, already knowing basically what I was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stopped, realizing that he was indeed pacing. \"Sorry. I've been in a few situations, in my time, where I was forced to defend myself in near total darkness. I had no idea where my attacker was going to come at me next. Those minions remind me of those times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a low sigh, but we nodded in understanding and decided to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all of us searching, we should find another Rider very soon.\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Eric. \"But that same Rider could be an enemy. I'm not trying to be pessimistic, just realistic.\" He turned to me, serious. \"In my experience, nothing nothing can be taken for granted, we must stay alert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. He had a valid point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, we heard the roar of a motorcycle outside as we sensed a Rider nearby. I looked out and found a beautiful young woman in a dark blue skin tight bodysuit with heels dismounting off of a white motorcycle. She was a little shorter than me, with long, dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. As she walked towards the kitchen door, I took a step closer to investigate. But Eric quickly rose his arm to block my path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him, annoyed but stopped as I saw a certain deep focus in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at our decks.\" He said quietly, watching the girl slowly approach the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my deck to eye level, as he showed his and Christina looked at hers, and we found that all of our decks were flashing in a familiar way, warning us of danger. Who ever was coming to the door, she was not an ally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly grabbed our decks got ready to transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this house like the back of my hand.\" I said. \"If we work together, we might be able to trap her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea.\" Eric warned. \"It could be very hard to fight in such a small space. We have to take this outside. If we go out the front and circle around, we might be able to catch her off guard and surround her. Still, it's your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for discussion. I had to decide fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

If one or the other were to fall in combat... I shivered at the thought and decided to do everything I could to prevent that from ever happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" Came Anthony's hushed voice, pulling me to the present. \"Focus!  My sister and I will go right. You will go left. If we're lucky, we can all surround her at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and we all rushed out the front door, single file, transforming as we went. I banked left and ran through the side yard, trying to control my pace, despite my excitement. Our timing was perfect, we all converged upon the back yard at the same time to take the unknown girl by surprise, only to find that she was not there and her white motorcycle was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was just here!\" Christina said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised myself, I conducted a quick search of the yard. There were no signs of tire tracks, no smell of exhaust in the air, no foot prints in the grass, other than our own. It did not make any sense, it was as if she was never there. Then, as I took a step back towards the house, I caught a reflection of light from the large kitchen window, shining on the ground. That was when it dawned on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was never here!\" I said outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain.\" Anthony said, turning to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed to the refection of light on the grass. \"She's using the mirror world to search for Riders.\" I said. \"She most likely detected our decks while we were searching ourselves, and stopped at the window to investigate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the reflection of light on the grass created a sort of holographic effect?\" Christina asked, doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a little far fetched but as good as any other explanation.\" Anthony replied. \"Still, it raises a lot questions. Who was she and why is she looking for other Riders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's on our side?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering that our decks reacted like they did, I doubt it.\" Anthony responded. \"But we can't be sure, and we have to find the other Riders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-normal point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one noticed that in the reflection of one of the cars' windows was the girl, looking at them, biding her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Christina's point of view.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't too sure about Eric. He seemed like a good enough person, just a little annoying. Still, whenever I caught a glimpse of his eyes, I could tell that he was holding something back, something painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing more we can do here.\" My brother said. \"I suggest we go back inside and continue our search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and I agreed and we started walking towards the house. I purposely walked slowly, allowing Eric to move ahead, as I talked with my brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you make of him?\" I asked, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a little annoying.\" He whispered. \"But I believe he means well. He has this look in his eye that tells me he's lost more than just a few friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes him want to protect any new friends that much more.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScottie nodded. \"Exactly. I think, once he sees that we can handle ourselves, he will loosen up a little and become more tolerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my brother and I heard a loud commotion in the house. We ran through the kitchen door to find a comical scene. Eric was back in his civilian form, struggling to throw off my best friend, Robert. Robert was clinging to Eric's back, repeatedly hitting him on the head and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?!\" He demanded, bringing his fist down. \"What are you doing in my friends' house!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Eric complained. \"Get off of me, kid, and I'll tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance!\" Robert yelled. \"Explain yourself or get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScottie and I could not help but laugh at the scene. Unfortunately, it distracted Robert. Eric took advantage of the distraction and caught his right arm. With a powerful heave, he pulled Robbert off of his back, landing him hard but safely onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got spunk, kid!\" Eric told him. \"I'll give you that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert rose his hands as if to defend himself and I yelled to him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Robbie!\" I said, hurrying towards him. \"He's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this guy?\" Robert asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to him and noticed another Advent Deck hanging out of the side pocket of his jeans. That was when I showed him my Siren deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a Kamen Rider, like you, me, and Anthony.\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked at Eric, surprised, then blushed, embarrassed, as Eric showed him his Wing Knight Deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man!\" Robert said. \"I... I'm sorry. I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rubbed the back of his head, as if to massage away the pain. I could tell he was highly frustrated with my friend. I was sure he was going to blow up on him, but, to my surprise, he let out a low sigh then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it.\" He replied. \"I would have done the same thing in your place.\" He gave out a short laugh. \"I have to admit, I never saw you coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, we all gathered in the living room as Robert told a familiar tale of how the deck, which my brother and Eric called the Thrust Deck, came to him and he was attacked by a number of Minions. My brother and Eric explained their own experiences, which was when a thought came to my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did any of you ever wonder how the Minions detected us so quickly?\" I asked. Eric turned to me, raising his eyebrows in surprise. I could tell that he had wondered that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, we can only guess.\" My brother said. \"But we have other things to worry about. We were given these decks, these powers for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we are going to discover that reason all too soon.\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScottie nodded, then looked at the clock. \"It's getting close to lunch.\" he turned to Robert and Eric. \"Care to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could answer, the sound of thunder from a TV show was heard from my brother's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't happen to turn my TV on and forget to turn it off, did you Robbie?\" My brother asked, turning to my friend, who shook his head in response. We ran into his room and saw that it was on the first season of Power Rangers (which my brother said shouldn't even be playing now), and that a wierd storm was quickly forming in it. We saw a fearful shadow appear from the clouds and begin to descend slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Robert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, that wasn't in the series, so you can bet it's something we need to take care of.\" My brother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Once on the other side, we were immediately aware that something was not right. They looked skyward at the descending shadow  to find something that resembled the image of a nightmare. It was a giant beetle made up of literally millions of insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of heaven is that!?!\" Eric asked, taking a small step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" I replied, staring up at the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thunderous boom was heard and we both turned to find Jason's Red Dragon Thunder Zord moving in to face the monster with the other Zords following close behind. I sensed that the monster was ready for them and, apparently, so did Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going to need some help battling that over sized bug.\" He said. \"I'm moving in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to caution him not to act too hastily but he had already summoned his Advent Beast and was flying off to take on the monster. I let out a low sigh and shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some people just have to learn things the hard way.' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my deck suddenly flashed in a familiar way. It had detected another Rider somewhere close.  I looked about and was surprised to find a young woman with shoulder length hair standing directly between the Power Rangers' Thunder Zords and the monster. Instinctively, I materialized my motorcycle and raced out to pull her to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I steadily got closer, I saw that she was wearing a black, short sleeved shirt and a black skirt. I could make out a pair of black shorts underneath. She had black elbow length gloves, black knee-length boots with heels, and a headband very much like my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as the Zords clashed with the monster, with Eric assisting, the girl reached for what was unmistakably an Advent Deck and transformed. Her armor was identical to my own, only more feminine, complete with a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" I wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I thought of the girl the others and I saw in the window but, for some reason I couldn't figure out, I seriously doubted it was her. I quickly shook the thought from my mind and increased speed. I reached her within seconds. I was about to yell to her to get on only she did so on her own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th... Thank you, Anthony.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How do you know my name?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Anna.\" She stated. \"I think we'll just get in their way if we stay right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then sped away from the battle, only to get the girl, Anna, to a safe distance as she did not seem to be all together at the time, all the while wondering how she knew my name. However, the monster had other plans. A large piece of it broke away and flew towards me in the form of a wasp the size of a city bus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks we have no choice but to fight.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Wing Knight, concerned, but found that he was surprisingly holding his own for the moment. I knew these kinds of series well enough to take on the monster, but I was not sure about Anna. The monster was closing in fast, I had to make a quick decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Anthony do?</span></div></div>",

Asking her to help me fight the monster would not have been wise. I decided it best to fight it alone. I took another glance at Wing Knight and was surprised to find him using his Gust Vent attack to push a large number of the insects aside. Then, for some strange reason, he leaped from his Advent Beast, into the heart of the swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is he up to?\" I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I caught a brief glimpse of some creature standing in the center of the swarm. It hit Wing Knight with some kind weapon, throwing him out of the swarm like a rag doll. Wing Knight seemed shaken but he was far from out, the battle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it.\" I thought. \"It must be a new creation of Lord Zedd &amp; Rita Repulsa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately turned back to the smaller swarm coming for me and inserted a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survive Mode!\" My armor changed into Survive Mode. and I slotted my Strange Vent into the Black Drag Visor-Zwei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange Vent!\" The Visor said as the Strange Vent card was replaced by the Gust Vent card, which I immediately slotted. \"Gust Vent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragblazer appeared, then opened his mouth and blew, creating a small tornado temporarily scattering the metallic insects, as well as injuring and/or destroying some, leaving a small creature in the center vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" I said, in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster gave a growl as I aimed the Black Drag Visor Zwei at it and began firing. It howled then seemingly exploded, with the many mechanical insects following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one down.\" I said to myself. \"Now for the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" Anna said, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard, \"Gust Vent!\" After that I heard \"Shoot Vent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to find Wing Knight attacking again, only this time, he was using his head.  He used his Gust Vent to scatter the insects, as before, then used his Shoot Vent to blast the creature away from the swarm, and right into range for Jason's attack. His Zord, in robot mode, was ready. He brought its sword down upon the creature as it reached him and it was over.  The creature exploded and vanished, with the mechanical insects vanishing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You friend is rather impulsive.\" She said, watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remained silent, even though I had the same thought in mind. \"He's a stubborn one.\" I thought. \"He's a good man but with that high blood pressure of his...\" I let out a low sigh. \"He's going to push himself too far and get hurt when we need him the most unless I straighten him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Wing Knight came down from the sky, his Advent Beast returning to where it came.  I was tempted to confront him on the spot, telling him how dangerous it was for him to push himself as he did. Only, that was not the time. The Power Rangers were coming down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Anthony's point of view.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and I walked back into the living room, through the television, with Anna close behind. My sister and Robbery ran up to us, concerned and immediately noticed Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your new friend?\" Robbert asked. After a short introduction and a detailed explanation of what had happened, Robbert nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it was tough.\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I was Eric quietly excuse himself and walk into the next room. He had that same 'hurt' look in his eyes. I decided I had better talk to him now. If anything, to get to the bottom of his reckless behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I entered the next room, I found him staring at an old photograph, his eyes were swelling with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, we need to have a talk.\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed. \"Have you ever lost a close friend?\" He asked, quietly, staring at the photograph. \"I lost twelve friends in one night, I was sixteen at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew this was coming sooner or later but as I saw the 'hurt' in his eyes, I decided that the time was not right to get into an argument so I instead decided to be a leader and offer council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel like talking about it?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned to me, a single tear escaping his eye. \"You were not the first person entrusted with the power and responsibility of the Onyx Deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that I was not shocked would have been a lie, although it felt like something was telling me that it wasn't true, and I mean that quite literally. Eric handed me the old photograph and I saw all of the Kamen Riders standing, side by side with their motorcycles. Only, there was clearly different people behind the armors. I turned to Eric, throwing him a questioning look, to which he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was not the bearer of the Onyx Deck.\" he said. \"I was as I am today, Wing Knight.\" He fought off a few frustrated tears. \"Earlier, I told you that I did not know why the Wing Deck chose me. I did not mention that it had chosen me a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened the first time around?\" I asked him, trying to make sense of what was going on. Eric paused, reluctant. I could see his lips trembling slightly before he turned from me. I took his shoulder and spun him back around. \"Talk to me, Eric.\" I demanded. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed in surrender. \"We were so certain we had the entire problem figured out.\" He said. \"There was a tear in the reality stream, a barrier that exists between imagination and reality. It was allowing all worlds it touched to collide, mix, and merge. We all knew that if that tear got much larger, it would be the end of everything we knew.\" I was stunned as it almost made everything that was happening now make more sense. But there were pieces in what Eric said that did not quite fit so I pressed for more of his story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turned out that someone or some group was manipulating that tear with some advanced machine, causing specific worlds to collide.\" Eric said, continuing. \"Todd, the bearer of the Onyx Deck at that time, was a great leader, he kept us together and we were able to find the machine.\" He paused, wiping away a few more frustrated tears. I could tell that he had been holding this in for all these years. It must have been very difficult for him to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I need to know what happened.\" I pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fight ensued between us and just about every minion from the television action shows at that time.\" Eric said. \"They were trying all they could to keep us from the machine. Todd rushed in but I hesitated and turned from him as I sensed that Chris, Todd's little sister and the bearer of the Siren Deck was in trouble.\" He swallowed down a hard lump. \"In that one second of hesitation, the machine exploded and everyone, everyone vanished completely. I never saw them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help tear a little to Eric's story but I did well to hide them for, as a leader, I had to remain strong. I placed a hand on Eric's shoulder in an effort to give comfort but he grabbed my hand before I could get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my burden to bear, Anthony.\" He told me. \"Never knowing what happened or if there was something you could have done. I will be DAMNED if I lose anyone time around.\" With that, he released me and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote, the next part was written by Starfighter364 to make this chapter work, otherwise it would have had to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there thinking about what I had been told, trying to make sense of it, because many things didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on? If the decks really chose riders before, then there should be no way they'd bond with us, considering the whole DNA lock thing, and even if they did, Eric shouldn't have had to receive his again, it should have remained with him.' I thought. 'Also, the knowledge I got from the Onyx deck tells me that there is no way they should have been around long enough to pick another set of riders anyway, and that there is no tear in reality, it is just the power of the mirror monsters going into other worlds, and what is with this voice I've been hearing since the start of Eric's story? Am I going mad?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, you are not.' A deep and powerful voice spoke to my mind (if you could truly call it a voice since, as I said, it was in my mind). It was the same voice that had been talking to me during the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-who are you?' I think to it in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look in a mirror and you'll see...' The voice replied. I turned to a nearby mirror and jumped back slightly in shock, staring at me was Dragblacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dragblacker?' I thought in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, my rider, it is I.' Dragblacker thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the heck is going on?' I asked through my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unlike the Advent Beasts in the shows, we can talk to our riders because of the mental link we form with them.' Dragblacker replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why didn't you do so before?' I asked through my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just because we can talk doesn't make us chatterboxes.' Dragblacker thought with some humor in his \"voice,\" so to speak. 'We mostly keep to ourselves unless someone speaks to us first, but I have something to tell you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it?' I asked Dragblacker through my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is actually a message from Blackwing, someone intercepted and messed with the Wing Knight deck, and that effected the deck's chosen one, making him think that he was the only survivor of a previous group of riders, even though the rider powers didn't exist then.' Dragblacker replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Three questions: one, how come Blackwing isn't saying this to Eric, two, where did the picture come from, and three, why did they make him think that instead of trying to brainwash him or something?' I asked through my thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In that order, something is keeping them from being able to speak, and Eric doesn't know that riders and their Advent Beasts can speak telepathically, the picture was materiallized in Eric's room by the same people who messed with the deck, my guess is they did that to help make it seem like that really happened, and finally, I think it is to give him survivor's gilt, since the Wing Knight power is one of the best, considering Survive Mode, and they didn't have time to do something that would mess with his mind to a brainwashing degree since the deck was still trying to get to its rider, and they knew they couldn't stop it for long, however, implanting fake memories is much easier, so they could do it fast enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, Eric, needs to know this, but there's no way he would believe me, and I don't want to distance him from the group by putting him on the spot.' I thought to myself, forgetting momentarilly that I now have a dragon telepathically connected to me, and that he could listen to my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That is correct, my rider.' Dragblacker replied, surprising me a little. 'I knew that I made the right decision choosing you as my rider.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This will take some getting used to.' I thought, not bothering to go deeper into that thought since I was sure he already knew. I needed to figure out whether to tell the other riders, minus Eric, or not.</span></div></div>",

Only, I could not afford Eric to hear. Fortunately, he had left the house and was speeding off somewhere on his motorcycle. To cool off, I hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What could anyone hope to accomplish by pushing him over the edge like this?' I wondered. I gathered everyone together and explained the situation. Once I was finished, Christina closed her eyes, let out a sigh, then opened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder he kept so close.\" She said. \"But why this elaborate scheme?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" I replied. \"Eric has high blood pressure. From what I understand, he had it since he was a child. If that's actually true, his heart must be under a lot of wear and stress. With those false memories driving him to always jump into every confrontation, without hesitation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... he'll eventually drive himself to a heart attack.\" Robbert finished. He sighed, worried for Eric. \"Did you tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll never believe me.\" I replied. \"As far as he knows, he's been carrying this survivor's guilt with him for over twenty years... He believes he has been given a second chance to make things right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which will make him very determined to push himself to his limits.\" Anna said, musing. \"He does not wish to lose anyone a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Eric?\" Christina asked, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He left a few minutes ago, on his bike.\" I replied. \"I'm hoping he's going somewhere to cool off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment, and then Anna looked to me suddenly after a thought came to my mind. \"What if he's going to visit where this false battle took place?\" She asked. I turned to Anna, startled, as that was the exact thought that had just crossed my mind a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\" I asked, wanting to hear her reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna paused. \"If I believed that happened, I would often visit the last place I saw my friends.\" She said. \"If nothing else, to visit their grave, so to speak.\" Now I was a little spooked, because that is what I had just been thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking that same thing.\" I said, but not mentioning that she seemed to know exactly what I've been thinking since I met her. \"But we need to figure out how to track him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can help with that, my rider.' Dragblacker thought to me. Anna I looked towards the reflective surface of the TV to see him floating there. 'He stopped about ten miles from here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Anna asked, suprising me both because she said what I was thinking again, and the fact that she could hear Dragblacker. Christina and Robbert turned in the direction we were looking as soon as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you heard that dragon?\" Robbert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why do you ask?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robbert and I didn't hear anything...\" Christina replied. We quickly explained what Dragblacker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see what's he's up to.\" Robbert said, heading towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Robbert!\" I warned him. \"If he sees us all there, he might lose all trust in the team. I will go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I rushed over to my motorcycle and raced after him.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, the warehouse was not very far from Anthony's house. Stopping at the entrance, I let out a low sigh, hearing the sounds of that last battle echoing inside my mind. Allowing myself a bitter tear, I drew a deep breath and dismounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt good to get the truth off my chest.\" I thought. \"Even if Anthony decides not to believe it.\" I frowned. \"Who can blame him? To hear that you were not the first to have such power can be disheartening to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my bike. \"Wait here, old friend.\" I said, referring to Blackwing. \"I shouldn't be too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the warehouse, the sounds of my last battle to save the world grew stronger, I could see the events as they had unfolded over twenty years ago. I shivered a little as I stopped in the center of the junk ridden building and let out a longing sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you guys vanish to?\" I asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard a dark, almost mechanical, sinister laugh, echoing from the shadows. I wipped around to see a red light slowly moving back and forth in a short line in the darkness. My eyes widened slightly as I recognized the moving light as the sensor on the black trans am, named KITT from the action series, Knight Rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KITT?\" I asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the voice laughed again. \"Guess again, Wing Knight!\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed with hate as I then said, \"KARR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black trans am rolled forward on its own as KARR's voice laughed yet again. \"Come to visit the shadows of your past, are we?\" It asked. \"You will NEVER find your friends, give it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only assume that your arrival, after all this time, means that those maniacs have reopened the tear in the reality stream.\" I told him. \"Where is the machine, KARR!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you seriously expect me to tell you?\" asked KARR, sounding amused. \"I'm here to give you a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to KARR, curious. \"A chance?\" i asked, not trusting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you everything... If you can defeat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, sensing a sucker bet. \"You're either out of your circuit powered brain, thinking you can beat me.\" I said. \"Or you have something planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you accept my challenge, or not!?!\" KARR asked impatiently. \"Or have you gone soft in your old age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment made me angry and I transformed. \"BRING IT ON!!\" I roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to my shock and horror, KARR 'transformed' before my eyes into a massive robot and laughed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of the benefits of when worlds collide!\" he told me. \"Even cartoons, such as the Transformers have a reality all their own!\" he laughed again. \"Let's, as you said, BRING IN ON!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Me and my big mouth!' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dodged KARR's first blow and inserted a card. \"Sword Vent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anthony's point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived at a clearing and found Eric's bike standing nearby. I looked about then heard the sounds of a fierce battle occurring close by. I quickly transformed and rushed towards the sound, believing that Eric was in need of help, only to find him fiercely fighting against... no one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is he doing!?!' I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I thought about what Dragblacker had told me of his false memories and figured that he must have believed that he was seeing an old enemy and was trying to force answers out of him in a battle... inside his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the battle was not real, I watched Eric, as Wing Knight, be thrown across the length of the warehouse as if he were a mere toy, only to get up and charge again, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who or whatever he's fighting, it's damaging him physically as well as mentally.\" I thought. \"I HAVE to stop him, somehow before he literally kills himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have a suggestion, my rider.'

Why it was there was beyond me but I knew that it wasn't intended to be there. 'I've got to help them.' I thought, then I looked at my hands, or more specificly, the Onyx Advent deck. Turning to face my wall mounted mirror, I thrusted the advent deck towards the mirror, causing energy to course down from the deck and summon the rider belt. \"Kamen Rider!\" I announced, sliding the deck into the belt buckle, causing the black tinted energy field to surround me, filling me with tremendous power, the suit materialising in the process. I looked at the computer and dove into the world of Power Rangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(To make it much easier for myself, the story is going to switch from first person to thrid person perspective)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rangers fought against the strange monster, Tommy noticed a multicoloured circle appear in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just when this couldn't get any worse.\" He muttered, preparing to fight what came out of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a figure in black dragon like armour appeared with a loud thud as he hit the ground, the rangers and the mirror monster all looked at what was causing the commotion. As Onyx brushed himself off from the dusty landing, he noticed the stares he was reciving. \"What? Never seen a hero before?\" He asked, rushing at the mirror monster. Unfortionately the ranger misinterperate this as him rushing at them, meaning Onyx was constantly ducking, jumping and dodging attempted blows from the rangers' weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm on your side guys!\" Onyx shouted. \"Let me get to that monster!\" After shouting the last part, Onyx lept into the air, pulling out a card from his Advent Deck, sliding it into the Black Drag Visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike Vent.\" The visor announced, a Black Dragon's Head-like weapon attatching to Onyx's right arm. Still in mid air, Onyx let out a gigantiic burst of black flame as he approached the mirror monster, bathing it in the fire as the monster started rolling on the ground from the heat. Landing behind the monster Onyx glanced back at the rangers, the monster stumbling to it's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys going to finish him off or what?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that is required.\" Billy said. \"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the heros looked at the monster, which fell over in pain from the damage delivered by the Strike Vent, exploding.

Soon enough, both of them were trading blows with their swords, creating a storm of sword blows which would be countered in turn by the opposing rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you trying to fight me? I just saved the rangers!\" Onyx said, sidestepping a sword strike<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me laugh, even Adam couldn't get away with that one in the show.\" Dragon Knight retorted, stepping back to avoide one of Onyx's strikes. \"You save good guys in order to gain their trust and then when their back is turned you backstab them.\" He explained, both of the riders' swords currently locked against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While that's good reasoning, you don't even know me!\" Onyx pointed out. \"At least the good guys had a reason to be suspicious with Adam, they knew what he had done. Your basis that I'm evil is because I'm using a deck that's supposed to be darker than the others!\" He added, drawing a card from his deck and sliding it into the Black Drag Visor, Dragon Knight quickly copying him with the Drag Visor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINAL VENT.\" The visors simountaniously announced, the twin dragon Advent Beasts appearing on the field. However as each of the rider prepared to leap into the air and finish the vent, Onyx noted something was flying towards the ground - one of Rita's wands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET DOWN!\" He yelled, then looked at Dragblacker and pointed at the rangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the wand Dragon Knight pulled a card from his deck and slid it into his visor. \"Take cover!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaurd Vent.\" Twin gaurds appeared on Dragon Knight's arms, when he realised Dragblacker was protectively coiling around the rangers. The earth started shaking as the wand caused the mirror monster to rematerialise and grow. As it did, energy coursed out of the evil wand, firing off bolts of energy in random directions. Dragon Knight noticed that any near the rangers deflected off of Dragblacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought he was ugly before.\" Tommy remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys, we need-\" Jason started, when Goldar and a large group of Putties appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time red ranger, no zords.\" Goldar announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx gulped as he watched the monster walk off while the ranger were engaged in a battle with the putties and Goldar, Dragblacker having returned to the mirror world. Even if he summoned Dragblacker or was in a survive mode, he couldn't take down a giant mirror monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Dragon Knight shouted. \"Normally I'd finish our fight, but I have more pressing matters.\" He said, pulling out a card from the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack Vent.\" The visor announced, Dragredder appearing but then growing to be much larger than before. Suddenly Dragon Knight leapt inside Dragreder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contract Beasts can become zords here, if you wanted to help!\" Dragon Knight stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx, slightly surprised by this turn of events and that Dragon Knight gave him some advice, pulled out his Attack Vent card and slid it into the visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack Vent.\" Dragblacker, who growed to be larger than before, flew in front of Onyx, allowing him to board the contract zord. Both Dragblacker and Dragredder took to the skies, shooting off several fireballs at the retreating Mirror Monster. Dragredder flew past the monster,smacking it back towards the battlefield with it's tail. Dragblacker let out a stream of flame at the monster. The Mirror Monster turned and swiped at Dragblacker, which was barely knocked away by Dragredder which took the hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you just help me?\" Onyx asked, Dragblacker ascending to a higher altitude and out of the monsters range. \"You were trying to vent me a little bit ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight chuckled. \"Firstly, I wouldn't be much of a hero if I didn't help people and secondly, I owed you for protecting the rangers, twice.\" He pointed out, Dragredder accompanying Dragblacker (Music start-Mighty Morphin power rangers short version). \"So, ready to finish this like we tried to before?\" He asked, pulling out a Final Vent card,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you aim for him and not me.\" Onyx joked, also pulling out a Final Vent card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINAL VENT.\" Both visors announced as the riders slid the cards inside. Both rider lept out of their zords, who summoned energy to hold the monster in place, Both dragons let out a combined blast of fire, propelling both riders towards the monster feet first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double Rider Kick!\" Both riders announced, managing to kick their way straight through the monster, causing it to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldar, being the only one left of Rita's strike force, glared. \"You win this round rangers, but we'll be back.\" He said, teleporting away. Both of the riders, now without their zords, landed next to the rangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now the monster's gone, what are you going to do?\" Onyx asked Dragon Knight. For a few second the tension in the area was thick enough to cut with a knife, the rangers each prepared incase another fight broke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight chuckled lightly. \"I think your trustworthy enough, you did help save the day, but don't give me a reason not to trust you.\" He said, then turned to the rangers. \"Now, what to do with these guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't erase their memories, Rita's bunch would still remember anyway.\" Onyx pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point.\" Dragon Knight coceeded \"What about a memory blocker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same problem.\" Billy pointed out. \"Rita would ineveitibley use that knowledge against us in order to try and defeat us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we just keep this a secret between us heroes, that way there are none of the cons of the other ways?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we could let you guys know if other people like that monster or you show up.\" Kimberly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx nodded. \"Sounds like a good idea.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Dragon Knight said, a grey square portal which shifted as if the surface was water appearing next to him. \"Well, later rangers, later Ryuga.\" He said, the portal sweeping across him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuga?\" Onyx questioned, but then shook his head as he decided on what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Dark events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++Earlier that morning+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon smiled as he watched the latest episode of the subtitled japanese Kamen Riders, the glow from his laptop lighting up the face of the young adult. This was a common occurence with Leon, even though it was early morning he still enjoyed watching the episodes. His room, being rather plain at first glance, was decorated with nurmerous toy transformation belts from different series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished watching the show, he yawned and curled up, ready to get some more sleep, he heard the sounds of a fire being ignited. Quickly getting out of his bed, he opened up his door and was immediatly blasted back by a burst of heat, knocking him unconsious as he hit the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Leon woke up, he noticed that, aside from his room, the entire house looked like it had been shined... but neither of his parents, nor his sister he later found out, were there. \"Where are they?\" Leon wondered, walking around the strangely clean house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Advent Void\" An echoing, female voice said, appearing to come from all directions at once. \"They were vented by one of the Kamen Riders. If you are to return them, you first find out who was the one who vented them. The Advent Deck that you need is in front of you, along with everything you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon, still slightly in shock, grabbed the deck and suddenly gained his rider knowledge. Glancing around he noticed that an episode of Power Rangers was playing in on his laptop screen, despite the fact that he hadn't been watching that, with the Power Rangers and Kamen Rider Onyx  fighting a mirror monster. Growling in anger, Leon thrusted the deck out. \"Onyx has a dragon, so he's a prime candidate!\" He said, thrusting out his Advent Deck, the belt materialising onto him. Quickly contemplating weather to use the japanese or english transformation phrases, he glanced at the battle. \"If I'm Dragon Knight, then I guess it's... Kamen Rider!\" He shouted in rage, placing the Advent Deck into the belt, materialising his suit within the energy field. As he dove into the show, Dragon Knight took out the Strike Vent card...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++Present Time+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why you vented my family Onyx, and I shall make your punishment swift!\" Leon said, now caught up in a mix of battle frenzy and revenge frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony, now pinned to the ground shifted his helmet to the side in a confused manner \"I have no idea what you're talking about!\" He shouted \"You're attacking me for no reason!\" He then kicked Leon off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't confess?\" Leon asked, a malicous glow in his eyes, although it couldn't be seen. \"Then I'll have to vent you to save them!\" He said, raising his sword up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we have anything to say about it!\" Jason shouted. \"Rangers blade blasters up!\" The girls backflipped onto Jason, Billy and Zack's shoulders, forming a sort of human pyramid. Each pointed a blade blaster towards the center of their formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire!\" They shouted, blasting Leon away from Anthony. As they did though, a white glow blazed from the Dragon Knight Advent Deck, releasing a giant monster version of Dragon Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon, recovering from the blast, noticed the monster. \"What the hell is that?\" He asked, the monsters 'eyes' being white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing the logic in these shows, a monster possessing you.\" Anthony said, rushing over to Leon. \"You ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this doesn't add up, it was influencing me at best because I really thought you had done it!\" Leon explained, getting back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your realisation and the guys blasting you must have broken the spell the monster had on you.\" Tommy explained, the other rangers calling the Dinozords to combat the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon looked at Anthony. \"Sorry about that, I'll explain about that outburst little later.\" He said. \"But right now I have some unfinished business to deal with.\" He said, pulling out his Survive Mode card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both.\" Anthony said, pulling out the same card. They slotted the cards as Tommy played the dragon dagger, summoning the Dragonzord alongside the Megazord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survive Mode!\" Both of the visors announced, transforming into their survive forms. Both pulled out and slotted their Attack Vent cards. \"Attack Vent.\" The Advent Beasts turned into Zords, which Anthony and Leon entered. They then pulled out and slotted their Final Vent cards. \"Final Vent!\" Dragblazer and Dragranzer roared and went to opposite sides of what Anthony and Leon dubbed \"Fake Knight.\" Both Survive Mode Advent Beasts turned into motorcycle forms while blasting Fake Knight with balls of fire, before crashing down on it, causing it to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust cleared from the explosion, the monster had dissapeared, the two riders now congratulated each other as they prepared to return to either one's home for Leon's explanation.</span></div></div>",

You'll excuse me if I don't de-henshin, but the suit is a good disguise if someone manages to spot us.\" Leon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De-what now?\" Anthony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon nervously chuckled. \"Whoops, sorry. Henshin is a japanese word which means transform.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you use it then?\" Anthony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of saying 'Kamen Rider,' the majority of japanese Riders say 'henshin.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that makes a little more sense then.\" Anthony said. \"Next point, why did you blame me for your family being gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. \"I should have seen this as a trap from the start, but here goes. I woke up this morning, after being knocked out by the heat of a strong fire, to find the house devoid of all human life, aside from me.\" He said. \"Then a mysterious voice told me a rider vented them, so in my rage I saw you and assumed you as a major suspect, given that you have a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony gave Leon a wierd look. \"But if you know so much about riders, then why didn't you know that human's without powers aren't vented?\" Anthony pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't?\" Leon asked. \"I don't watch as much Dragon Knight as I do the japanese shows, so I don't know much on the venting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony nodded. \"Yep, you were conned.\" He said, then somone knocked on the door. Leon quickly leapt back into the mirror world, as a girl with curly brown hair entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Scottie, are you going to get some breakfast or what?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Chrisy, just give me a second.\" Anthony said, closing the door as Christina walked off. Turning to the TV, he noticed Leon was rolling around on the floor having silenced the audo link in the helmet. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon got back on his feet, turning the helmet back on. \"Beam me up Scottie!\" he cried out dramaticly, before silencing the link again, hiding the sound of his laughter, Anthony shaking his head as he headed to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leon, not one to stay in one place without something to do, decided to take a wander around the mirror world outside of Anthony's house. Mentally, he was dissapointed that he had fallen for such an easy trick, one that made him feel a bit shameful to be wearing the armour. Suddenly he leapt back, dodging a blast of flame. Looking around for the source, he spotted a white mechanical dragon, one that resembled Dragredder and Dragblacker in appearence. Leaping into the air to avoid another blast of fire, Leon landed and took cover behind a stone bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A white dragon beast? I know that's never appeared before!' He thought, quickly drawing two cards out of his deck. Suddenly, he felt the cover start to heat up a bit, then leapt away in fright when he saw that the fire was melting the stone! \"I don't care what you are.\" Leon said. \"You're going down!\" Upon declaring this, he slid both of the cards into the visor, one by one, activating them when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack Vent. Guard Vent.\" The visor annouced as Dragredder arrived, blasting it's white counterpart as Leon quickly used his new guards to block the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony, having finished breakfast, was looking around for the fellow Dragon rider, having not spotted him in the mirrors. Suddenly, he heard the mirror world sound, the one made whenever a person went into our out of the mirror world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly thrusting his deck out, he calmly said \"Kamen Rider.\" transforming, and then leaping through a nearby window. He immediatly saw what the problem was, Leon was surrounded by three Gelenewts, who weren't giving him any chance to recover from their attacks, while Dragredder was tangling with a white version of itself. Anthony sighed, charging towards the Gelenewts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword Vent.\" His visor announced, having recieved the first card Kit ever uses in a fight as soon as Anthony had started to charge, allowing him to vent one of the monsters while they were off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't leave you alone without you getting into trouble huh?\" Anthony asked, Narrowly dodging a strike from one of the Gelenewts' giant shuriken. The Gelenewt then feeling just how strong a Guard Vent is as Leon stuck it across the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" Leon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then heard a slightly distorted visor announce \"Attack Vent.\" As a chameleon appeared on the scene, striking both of the riders with its fast tounge. This wasn't hat surprised the riders, what surprised them was the fact that a female dragon themed rider, looking similar to Blank Knight from the series, except white and with feminine armor, had appeared alongside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello riders.\" Blank Knight said. Leon was shocked, the voice was the same as the one who had informed him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Leon shouted, suddenly able to find his voice. \"You sent me after Onyx to vent him didn't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blank Knight ignored the question, aslowly approaching the two riders as Dragblanker, as the two riders had dubbed it, disengaged from Dragredder and curled around it's master protectively \"I think that this chameleon Advent Beast belonged to another person close to you, his yelps of pain were good enough to drown out the obnioxious sword clanging and fireball blasting.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon growled. \"What did you do to Mitch?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank Knight laughed. \"Oh don't worry, you'll both be joining him soon enough.\" She said, taking out and sliding in a card<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent!\" The visor announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blank Knight leapt into the air, Leon suddenly realized that she'd target Anthony first, not him \"Move!\" Leon shouted, quickly sliding in his own card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon quickly ran at Blank Knight, Dragredder coming at a different angle than usual. When Blank Knight flew toward Anothony, covered in flames, Dragredder propelled Leon towards the female rider. The resulting collision was enough to knock Anthony backwards into a set of nearby trees. As the smoke cleared, Leon landed roughly on the ground, while Blank Knight landed gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So easy to minipulate, little dragon.\" Blank Knight said. \"I knew you'd take the blow for him.\" As she finished speaking, Leon's form started to dissolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Leon said, disbelieving. \"I can't be done... not yet!\" He said, struggling to get up, but failing, With one last try he managed to push himself up onto his feet, then looked at Anthony \"Beam me up Scotty.\" Leon said with a final defiant laugh before being vented fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony, quickly shaking himself out of the shock, growled at the female rider. \"You witch!\" He shouted, drawing a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll be seeing him soon.\" Blank Knight said, drawing out another Final Vent card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survive Mode!\" Anthony's visor announced after changing forms and having the card slotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent\" Blank Knight's visor announced. She had her feet wrapped around by the chameleon beast's long tongue, which then swung her upside down towards a rapidly heating up Survive Mode Onyx. The tounge retreating just before colision, both of the riders spun in the air, until finally Anthony landed headfirst and Blank Knight was on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy.\" She said, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent!\" She heard a visor say behind her. Quickly spinning around in shock, Blank Knight noticed that the Final Vent hadn't done enough damage as the obsidian armoured rider rode towards her, his black draconic steed blasting black fireballs at her. Seeing no other way out, Blank Knight leapt into a mirror. When Anthony saw that no one else was left, he disembarked Dragblazer, detransforming back to normal as he was left to experience what he thought was a hollow victory.</span></div></div>",

Instead, I impulsively pushed her sword aside with one arm and physically charged her, planting my best right hook onto her jaw before she could react.

It's at this point that Wing Knight notices Torque and Strike are unconscious, a pair of acid eaten Guard Vent bucklers discarded, along with Torque's larger cannon Shoot Vent, and Strike's Veno Visor. \"However, you forgot to mention something about Ryuki, that even toward the end when Shinji, the most outspoken against the fighting, decided to fight, he did so because of good intentions...\" He said, now in-between the two riders, Torque's Magna Visor now clearly visible in his other hand, pants of exhaustion audible from where he was, the ground where the fight had happened was scorched. \"In fact, aside from those few who were truly heartless, none of them fought with malicious intentions!\" He shouted, mainly towards Blank Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why fight a pointless fight?\" Wing Knight asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight snorted, although the irony that it was a Dragon Knight giving a Wing Knight advice was not lost on either him nor Blank Knight. \"Did you listen to what I just said? Everyone has a reason. You fight to unite the riders, like Shinji did originally. I fight to avenge and rescue my family, something more related to Ren and Len's goals... but what do you fight for?\" He asked, suddenly addressing Blank Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank Knight snorts, getting into a fighting stance. \"Thats something you'll never know!\" She said, rolling onto the ground, slotting in a card, which she had obviously taken from one of her controlled riders during the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy Vent!\" Her visor announced as she posed, copying a two sword stance as the vent copies the twin swords of Kamen Rider Wrath, currently in the same pose as he fights Sting, who was trying to hit him with his Swing Vent. As she rushed forward, Dragon Knight managed to fire off a single shot before being forced to defend himself against the dual swords, using his own heavier broadsword in a clumsy defense, the second gauntlet having been discarded for the now on the ground Magna visor. Wing Knight, realizing that thing were getting bad, rushed forward, starting to assist in the defense, but the two were rapidly finding their heavier swords outmatched for Blank Knight's powerful twin swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Blank Knight rolled away, dodging yet another stream of fire, noticing that all of the other riders, including a second, uncontrolled Kamen Rider Spear, were all staring her down, each with their Final Vent cards out, barring Onyx, who's right arm was still outstretched from firing out the Strike Vent <br>\r\n\"Surrender, you're outnumbered\" Onyx says simply, another scorch mark in place where he had fought, a black flame still burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank Knight started chuckling slowly, then went into full blown maniacal laughter. \"You fools have no idea what kind of power you face... nor will you ever.\" She said, revealing a green Final Vent card that she had taken and the Magna Visor in her hand, sliding it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent!\" The visor announced, Magnugiga rose up from below as she loaded the visor into the Advent Beast's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the riders start to scramble for their cards, at least one being played to counter the attack. But does it allow her to get away, or not?</span></div></div>",

She was so fast that I hardly managed to block any of them, I was getting the beating of my life. Unfortunately, or so I thought, she was only forcing me to lose my temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to learn that there is a price for jumping in without knowing your opponent!\" She told me, kicking my left side hard with her high heeled boot. \"Prepare for oblivion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her foot in for another kick but, this time, I was ready. I caught her foot, holding it firm, then I threw in a heavy kick of my own! I did not hold back and landed a full swing into her side, releasing her foot. The woman was thrown to the ground for the first time since the fight began and I took full advantage by charging her, throwing myself into the air with the intention of bringing my foot down, full force, onto her sword arm, so she could not take it back up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never underestimate!\" I yelled, coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never do.\" The woman replied coldly, quickly rolling out of the way. Just before I landed, she kicked my leg, throwing me off balance, and I landed hard onto my back, screaming for a moment in sheering pain, I barely managed to get out of the way of her own stomping foot before she hit me in the left side again, sending me backwards, stumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it!' I thought, struggling to stay conscious. 'Who is this woman!?! I've only seen Todd move like that after a heavy blow to the side!' I was ejected from my thoughts with another series of heavy kicks and punches from the unknown woman, I knew I was not going to be able to last much longer. One final kick to the head from her sent me onto my back, moaning miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a stubborn fool!\" The woman said, retrieving her sword. \"It would have been much easier if you had just given up and allowed me to vent you quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished yet!\" I hissed, painfully forcing myself to my feet. \"I may be a fool, but I'll go down fighting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head, raising her sword. \"As you wish it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came at me, but someone jumped in the way, blocking her blow. I did not get the chance to see who it was as the last of my strength failed me and I crumpled to the floor, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up on the couch in what seemed to be Todd's living room. I tried to sit up, but my body was in too much pain to to allow it and a moan escaped my lips. I then heard footsteps approaching me and I thought saw Todd, standing over me, looking very disappointed, most likely with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Todd...\" I managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head. \"Guess again.\" He said. \"We need to have a serious talk...

'He's temperamental and impulsive, a dangerous combination.' I thought, trying to stay calm. 'I wonder how this Todd puts up with him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I tried to reach him again. \"The woman you fought is called Blank Knight.\" I told him. \"She had vented and enslaved all of the Riders we were fighting when you stepped in. Even if you had full knowledge of all your powers, you would not have stood a chance alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric suddenly looked down, as if his pride had been given a blow. \"I had to try.\" he said, far more quietly. \"I thought all of the riders were on the 'good side'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought wrong.\" I said, more calmly, glad that I could reach him. \"Your actions have earned you a powerful enemy and I can not protect you forever. You need to use your head before you act upon your gut instincts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked me in the eye again as if to say something but turned away, remaining silent. I told him, \"If you have something to say to me, say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am going to be of any use here, I'm going to know more of what is going on.\" He said, looking me in the eye. \"It pains  me to ask anyone this but...\" he paused and I could tell he was swallowing some pride. \"...will you help me... please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's a hard guy to reach.'

I go to a spot where nothing will be knocked over when I transform, then I thrust my Advent Deck forward, and focus on transforming, causing energy to course down from the deck and summon the rider belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamen Rider!\" I exclaim, sliding the deck into the belt buckle, causing the black tinted energy field to surround me, the suit materialising in the process. I then walk to a mirror and go into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Normal point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Anthony, his sister's door opens right after he goes into the mirror. She comes out holding the Siren Advent Deck. She has never seen the series, so she doesn't know how the decks work, or what the sound she heard earlier (when the monster appeared) was. She came out because she heard the sound of the transformation, and is wondering what the sound was. She walks by a mirror, then stumbles a little, still being half asleep, and falls towards it. She tries to stop herself from crashing into the mirror, but she instead goes into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Anthony's point of view-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come to the area where the monster is at, and I see that I have come out of a small stream nearby on our neighbor's land, the mirror world version of it, anyway. I look around, and I see a bunch of Minion mirror monsters who had been walking to my location in order to use the stream's reflective surface to enter my world the same way I came out of it while entering the mirror world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where do you think you're going?\" I ask with a smirk, not that they can see it. The Minions get in battle stances as I pull out my Sword Vent card and place slot it in the Black Drag Visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword Vent!\" The visor announces, the sword coming to my hand. I charge at the Minions and begin to attack them. I slash one, then spin around in a complete circle and slash four of them who tried to surround me. One tries to hit me, but I do a back flip while holding the sword out, causing the Minion to get slashed as I dodge. I then pull out and slot my Strike Vent card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike Vent!\" The visor announces as the Gauntlet based on Dragblacker's head appears. I pull back my arm as Dragblacker flies behind me, then I thrust my arm forward and blast a large amount of the minions. Then I hear the sound of someone going into or coming out of a reflective surface. I look back at the stream and see Kamen Rider Siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" She wonders out loud. She then looks towards the spot where I'm fighting the Minions. \"What's going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later, but could you help me out?\" I ask, considering that there are still a large amount of Minions. She pulls out her rapier, the Blanc Visor, and charges forward, but she stumbles in the heels of the suit (obviously not used to fighting in heels), and falls to the ground. A couple Minions come at her to attack while I'm stuck fighting many other Minions, when suddenly Thrust stumbles out of the stream and sees the Minions advancing on Siren. He then tackles the Minions before they can get Siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" He asks Siren, bending down and holding out his hand to help pull her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks.\" She replies, taking his hand and pulling herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could somebody please help me out here?\" I ask, as many more Minions and a Dispider come to help the Minions I've been fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there!\" Thrust says, charging forward. Looking at how he moves, I can see that he obviously is someone who usually focuses on speed, which doesn't work out too well since the Thrust armor focuses on brute force, also, the heavy armor slows Thrust down. This makes him an easy target for the monsters, as proven by Dispider, who hits him with its webbing and wraps him up in it. Dispider then pulls on the webbing, causing the webbing covered Thrust to drop to the ground. Meanwhile, Siren is trying to get used to moving around in heels, not to mention actually fighting in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a tough battle...\" I say with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I let out a small groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is not good.' I think. I pull out my Sword Vent card and slotted it into the Black Drag Visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword Vent!\" The visor announces. The sword once again comes to my hand as I get into a battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Thrust says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do?\" Siren asks, stopping for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know about the Advent Cards?\" I ask in surprise. \"They give us new abilities and powers. Just take one from your deck and use it. You can usually pull the one you want, but since you apparently don't know your cards, you'll just get a random one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let me try that.\" Siren replies, pulling out a card. \"Where do I put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, open a slot on your sword, put the card in, then close the slot.\" I instruct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" She slots the card into the Blanc Visor like I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack Vent!\" The visor announces. Blancwing appears and strikes Dispider and a group of Minions, defeating that group of Minions and damaging Dispider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a really lucky draw.\" I reply, cutting down another two Minions. Siren has reached Thrust by this point and cuts him free. He then gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do it?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The slot you need is on your left shoulder.\" I tell him, before pulling out and slotting my Final Vent card in order to take out the remaining Minions, which will leave only Dispider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final Vent!\" My visor announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" He says, pulling a random card and slotting it in his Metal Visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confine Vent!\" Thrust's visor announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" I shout in annoyance as Thrust accidentally cancelled my Final Vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did my card do?\" Thrust asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Confine Vent negates the last card used by another rider, so you just stopped me from wiping out a large numbers of these guys!\" I reply in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Thrust says, obviously embarrassed. The monsters actually start laughing at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! I don't care if it is only supposed to be for emergencies only, you're going down!\" I say, pulling out my Survive Mode card. The background of the card shines with a spinning black flame effect and my slot changes into the Black Drag Visor-Zwei. I slot the Survive Mode card inside the dragon mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survive Mode!\" The visor announces. Black flames surround me as I transform into Survive Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Thrust says looking at me. I pull out my Shoot Vent card and slot it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot Vent!\" The visor announces. Dragblazer comes down and starts shooting a burst of flames at the Minions, destroying every single one. I then pull out my Final Vent and slot it. \"Final Vent!\" Dragblazer transforms into a motorcycle that I hop on and drive towards Dispider. Dragblazer starts shooting fireballs at Dispider, before coming to it and ramming into it, finishing it. I hop off Dragblazer, who turns back into Dragblacker as I end survive mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That was so cool!\" Thrust says as he runs towards me, Siren following behind, starting to get used to the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, anyway?\" Siren asks. I begin to explain the information the Onyx Deck gave to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these decks chose us...\" Thrust says, looking down at his deck in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we change back?\" Siren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and focus on changing back.\" I explain. They do so and suddenly turn into forms I recognize quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrisy, Robbie!\" I exclaim in surprise. I then turn back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scottie/Anthony!\" Christina and Robert shout respectively, Christina using my family's nickname for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, you two are riders.\" I say with a sigh. \"That means that I still need to find about 11 more riders. Let's get back home.\" I reply, getting a nod from them. \"Remember you two, don't tell anyone without my ok, it'll just cause problems.\" They agree, and we all go back to our world using the reflection of the stream. Robbie gets his mother to drive him over to my house, which isn't very unusual. We gather in my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Monsters are invading both our world and dimensions of the TV shows: Power Rangers, Beetleborgs, Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog, Masked Rider, Kamen Rider Ryuki (the 13 Riders special is off limits, so don't try using it or I will delete the chapter(s) in question), Kamen Rider Dragon Knight. The Advent Decks, along with a new deck appear on our world and appear to different humans, bonding with their DNA and making them Kamen Riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian stuff or incest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep any names of characters the same throughout the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off characters or ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning the good characters evil or changing a character's personality unless I state otherwise (and I'll only approve that if the person who creates the character asks me).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I find out that someone who adds has stolen someone else's chapter, and then posted it as their own, then I'll delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't have Kamen Rider Dragon Knight and Kamen Rider Onyx be vented at the same time, and if one is vented, they must be back soon afterwards, as they will awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dragon Knight, Onyx, Blank Knight, or Ryuga awakens after being vented, they will be able to search in the Advent Void for a little bit, and if they find any Rider before the time expires then they can free the person, but when time runs out or they free two people, then they will automatically be ejected from the Advent Void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Onyx, Dragon Knight, Blank Knight, and Ryuga can be awake in the Advent Void, and anyone they free turns into a ball of light attached to them until they leave the Advent Void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kamen Riders can enter any Power Rangers series, along with Beetleborgs (including Metalics), Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog, Masked Rider, Kamen Rider Ryuki, and Kamen Rider Dragon Knight and interact with each other. Only other riders will be able to see the altered show. While in Power Rangers, the Advent Beasts will become Zords. While a Kamen Rider is inside a series, time is frozen, although Kamen Riders can still move around. Later, after many trips into a series and back, the Decade characters can come into the other shows and our world (and likewise, our world's riders will be able to go into the Decade series).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike in the TV series, these decks (but not the Advent Beasts) go with the Riders when the Rider is vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA contracted Advent Beast can and will fight on its own if it comes into contact with any of its Rider's enemies, and will also do what it believes its rider would want (they're usually right because of the bond between them). The Advent Beasts will travel around, and if they encounter a foe (as opposed to being called on by the Advent Cards), they can fight for as long as they want (if they are called on by the Advent Cards, they will vanish after a while and return to where they were). The Advent Beasts will continue to do this even while their rider is vented (unless captured by Blank Knight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Advent Beasts will naturally track down their Riders while said Riders are in a battle so that they can help (although if they can get there in time in time to help or not is another question altogether). A non contracted Advent Beast will just do whatever it wants, usually just fighting monsters and trying to avoid contact with humans, unless they want to make a contract. The Advent Beasts will be able to possess their Riders' bodies with the Riders' permission, or if the Rider is asleep/unconscious. If this happens, the Advent Beast possessing its Rider can't use their Final Vent or Attack Vent, or cards that only have the Advent Beast come out, such as Wing Knight's Nasty Vent, but not cards like Onyx/Dragon Knight's Strike Vents, where the Advent Beast only aids them. Dragblanker can't possess Blank Knight while the two of them are under the spell, and the same goes for any Advent Beasts that Blank Knight has captured with a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no Advent Master in our world, and even if a Rider would go into the Kamen Rider Dragon Knight series, Eubulon wouldn't be able to mess with the decks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decks can fix any damage caused by monster attacks or battles if the Rider focuses on it. A Rider can also use his or her deck to wipe the memories of anyone who isn't a Rider about things involving them being a Rider. The decks can materialize and dematerialize a motorcycle for the rider at any time (the design is based on the rider power), also, the decks make it so the people they choose have the knowledge and abilities to ride their motorcycle. The decks can also create mirror images of their Rider, that will act as the Rider would, as replacements so that they can do other things while their duplicate takes their place (all knowledge from duplicates is given to the Rider). The duplicate will have no desire to steal the life of their original. A duplicate can be made for other people in order to keep others from realizing something is wrong if that person is kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a mirror world in this story, it isn't Ventara (I don't know if I spelled it right) though, although it works more like Ventara than the one in Ryuki since the riders can spend unlimited time in it. There are no people or animals in that world. Everything that is made in our world is in the mirror world (except for meat, since all meat was at one point a living animal). The only creatures that live there are monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character's voice is different from normal while in Kamen Rider form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to use the Kamen Riders from this story in another one for a cross-over, then you are allowed so long as you get permission from me and the person who is the character, with the exception of people without accounts, in that case, with the exception of Evan, you must ask only me (for Evan, you must get permission from Kidwolf22)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony: Kamen Rider Onyx, and the main character of this story, as such the story mostly focuses on him. He finds the Onyx deck one day, and becomes a hero. A lone-wolf, but not a mean person and is very stubborn. 19 years old (Birthday: May 23rd). He is ambidextrous, and by that extention, so are his clones. Won't betray his friends and will always be there for them if he can; become his enemy and you will have a hard time. Very serious, but will every so often do something unexpected. He is not a lone-wolf towards his friends. Tall, with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Wears dark blue jeans or shorts, black shoes, with the shirts he wears being either completely dark blue, completely yellow, completely red, very dark blue with the word Nintendo written on the front, or black with a picture of Sonic on the front, and a dark blue headband (except when he's out in public so that he doesn't get mistaken for a gang member). Unlike in the TV series, this Onyx has a Survive Mode card. (Me)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina has recently made me aware that I have a verbal tick that causes me to sometimes end sentences with \"You know,\" so I'm going to be going back to edit chapters to include it to my character's speech. Obviously, at the time and period that this occurs in, my character won't know about it, since this starts about a year before I was made aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.photobucket.com/image/kamen%20rider%20onyx/AnimeZodiac/Kamen%20Rider/KamenRiderOnyx.jpg?o=2\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.photobucket.com/image/kamen%20rider%20onyx/AnimeZodiac/Kamen%20Ride...</a><br>\r\nSurive Mode Onyx: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.toyzhunt.com/files/users/605/Ryuuga_Survive.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.toyzhunt.com/files/users/605/Ryuuga_Survive.jpg</a><br>\r\nDragblacker: Onyx's Advent Beast. Dragblacker is a black Japanese dragon. When Onyx activates his Survive Mode card, Dragblacker transforms into Dragblazer (created by me), a dragon that can turn into a motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx's Advent Deck: Onyx slots his cards on the dragon-like slot on his left arm called the Black Drag Visor.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Dragblacker to directly attack his opponents.<br>\r\nSword Vent: Conjures a black dragon-designed broadsword.<br>\r\nStrike Vent: Attaches a black dragon-like gauntlet on his right hand to shoot a burst of black flames assisted by Dragblacker.<br>\r\nGuard Vent: Attaches black dragon-like guards on his arms.<br>\r\nFinal Vent: Summons Dragblacker for Onyx's Final Vent. Onyx jumps into the air while Dragblacker emits dark energy that paralyzes the opponent's legs, then he delivers a flying side kick with Dragblacker flying behind to boost the attack's power with its dark flame.<br>\r\nSurvive: Allows Onyx to access Survive Mode and transforms Dragblacker to Dragblazer. When activated, the background of the card shines with a spinning black flame effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnyx's Survive Mode Advent Deck: Onyx's slot changes from his arm slot to a dragon-like gun called the Black Drag Visor-Zwei. The Survive card is inserted inside the dragon mouth and the cards are slotted on the side of the slot.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Dragblazer to directly attack his opponents. <br>\r\nSword Vent: Opens a blade on the slot (similar to a pocket knife). <br>\r\nShoot Vent: Summons Dragblazer who shoots a burst of flames. <br>\r\nGuard Vent: Dragblazer coils around Onyx which protects him from attacks. <br>\r\nStrange Vent: An odd card which, upon being slotted, will become any card that any of the other Riders in the area use (excluding Final Vent, Attack Vent, and Survive). The new card must be reslotted to use. <br>\r\nFinal Vent: Summons Dragrblazer for Onyx's Survive Mode's Final Vent. Dragblazer transforms into a motorcycle that Onyx rides on as it shoots fireballs at its enemies while ramming into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon (short for Leonite): Kamen Rider Dragon Knight. He is a fond player of card games and of Kamen Rider. Tries to be loyal to those who he sees as friends, but appears to be arrogant. If you get on his bad side, then you better run as fast as you can. Views Onyx with some suspicion, given the nature of the decks. Tends to accidentally refer to the riders by the show's Japanese counterparts (Kamen Rider Ryuki) names, eg Onyx as Ryuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/2267/dragonknightvd2.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/2267/dragonknightvd2.png</a><br>\r\nSurvive Mode Dragon Knight: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.d3publisher.us/Walkthroughs/images%5CSurvive%20Mode%20Dragon%20Knight_Wii.bmp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.d3publisher.us/Walkthroughs/images%5CSurvive%20Mode%20Dragon%20Knight...</a><br>\r\nDragreder: Dragreder is a red mechanical Japanese dragon which is Dragon Knight's Advent Beast. When Dragon Knight activates his Survive Mode card, Dragreder transforms into Dragranzer, a dragon that can turn into a motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight's Advent Deck: Dragon Knight slots his cards on the dragon-like slot on his left arm called the Drag Visor. <br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Dragreder to directly attack his opponents.<br>\r\nSword Vent: Conjures a dragon-designed broadsword.<br>\r\nStrike Vent: Attaches a dragon-like gauntlet on his right hand to shoot a burst of flames, assisted by Dragreder.<br>\r\nGuard Vent: Attaches dragon-like guards on his arms.<br>\r\nFinal Vent: Summons Dragreder for Dragon Knight's Final Vent. It consists of him jumping into the air, delivering a flying side kick powered by Dragreder's flames.<br>\r\nSurvive: Allows Dragon Knight to access Survive Mode and transforms Dragreder to Dragranzer. When activated, the background of the card shines with a spinning red flame effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight's Survive Mode Advent Deck: Dragon Knight's slot changes from his arm slot to a dragon-like gun called the Drag Visor-Zwei. The Survive card is inserted inside the dragon mouth and the cards are slotted on the side of the slot.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Dragranzer to directly attack his opponents.<br>\r\nSword Vent: Opens a blade on the slot (similar to a pocket knife).<br>\r\nShoot Vent: Summons Dragranzer who shoots a burst of flames.<br>\r\nGuard Vent: Dragranzer coils around Dragon Knight which protects him from attacks.<br>\r\nStrange Vent: An odd card which, upon being slotted, will become any card that any of the other Riders in the area use (excluding Final Vent, Attack Vent, and Survive). The new card must be reslotted to use.<br>\r\nFinal Vent: Summons Dragranzer for Dragon Knight Survive Mode's Final Vent. Dragranzer transforms into a motorcycle that Dragon Knight rides on as it shoots fireballs at its enemies while ramming into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni (created by me): Kamen Rider Blank Knight. A clone of Anthony. Her body is that of a 19 year old, even though she was recently created. She was placed under a spell that infused her with evil while being created, and thus, she is evil. Please wait until later to add her in, but I won't stop you from putting her in earlier. She can be broken free from spell, but please make it at least 10 actual chapters (flashback chapters aren't included in that count) after she is introduced if you do. If she is hit by a blow that would vent her, then she a manifestation of the spell will be knocked out of her without her being sent to the Advent Void, and thus, the spell will be broken. A lone-wolf and is very stubborn. Very serious, but will every so often do something unexpected. A little shorter than Anthony, with long, dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Her creator was a pervert, who gave her large breasts, although it was his undoing, because she destroyed him the first time he groped her. She does use her appearance to get the better male opponents though (it won't work on Anthony though, since he is the one she was cloned from). She wears a dark blue skin tight bodysuit with heels on it (which she can fight in) and, like Anthony, a dark blue headband. She won't do any low blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe use a spell can capture the Advent Beast of a Rider who is sent to the Advent Void if she finds it (except for Dragredder and Dragblacker), and if she does, she can use the Rider's Advent Cards (But if Anthony or Leon rescue the Rider from the Advent Void, she loses them). She must weaken the Beast(s) before capturing it/them. She can use the power of her deck to enter the Advent Void (although it takes a lot of energy, allows Anthony and Leon to locate her, takes time to charge, and needs a couple days for her to use again), awaken a Rider whose Advent Beast she's captured, and control them (she has the same limits of time that Anthony and Leon have, so she won't always be able to find someone, and like them, she can only free two people at a time). If someone is under her control, they can be set free by venting them or by breaking the spell on the Advent Beast(s). As she is a clone of Anthony, she has his verbal tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank Knight: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/czonea/ryuukibrank04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.geocities.jp/czonea/ryuukibrank04.jpg</a> (except pure white, with the exception of the deck, with a skirt, heels, and breasts).<br>\r\nDragblanker (created by me): Dragblanker is a white mechanical Japanese dragon which is Blank Knight's Advent Beast. Unlike Dragon Knight and Onyx, Blank Knight doesn't have a Survive Mode card.<br>\r\nWhen Toni is set free from the spell, her deck will go from blank to having a white dragon image (with her gaining all of the counterparts of Dragon Knight's and Onyx's cards, with the exception of Survive Mode), and her suit will be a feminine white version of the Dragon Knight/Onyx suit, instead of a feminine white version of the original Blank Knight suit. She loses the ability to capture a Vented Rider's Advent Beast at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank Knight's Advent Deck: Blank Knight slots her cards on the slot on her left arm called the Blank Visor. She doesn't have counterparts to all of Dragon Knight's and Onyx's cards at first, but will gain them after being broken free from the spell.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Dragblanker to directly attack her opponents.<br>\r\nSword Vent: A white dragon designed katana (unlike the Blank Knight in the show, hers won't break easy). She gains a second Sword Vent card upon being freed from the spell, which conjures a white dragon-designed broadsword (she can dual-wield the two swords).<br>\r\nFinal Vent: Summons Dragblanker for Blank Knight's Final Vent. It consists of her jumping into the air, delivering a flying side kick powered by Dragblanker's flames.<br>\r\nAs mentioned above, she can also use the cards of riders whose Advent Beasts she's captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh: Kamen Rider Wrath. 18 years old. A little short compared to most people his age, but he was once very short compared to people his age, to the point in 5th grade he was afraid he'd be shoved into his locker in middle school (he had good reason to fear the possibility with his height). Anthony's best friend since 4th grade, although they argue/debate a lot (they enjoy it however), and sometimes call each other idiots jokingly. Josh is certifiably insane (although not the world domination kind of crazy), and very random, but loyal to his friends. He's hyper, and doesn't always think before he acts. He can be serious if it is needed however. Very fast, especially when not wearing shoes since he is flat footed. Has asthma, but it doesn't effect him very much anymore. Doesn't like Randy very much, but can tolerate him (although he has said that if Randy annoys him, that he'll tie Randy to a table and gag him with a dirty sock). Loves most categories of fictional media (such as games and anime).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrath: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CcuBCSF5vtk/TEcEf58qk9I/AAAAAAAAXdk/x-kiOJEZwsg/s1600/Wrath+1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CcuBCSF5vtk/TEcEf58qk9I/AAAAAAAAXdk/x-kiOJEZwsg/s1600/...</a><br>\r\nGoldphoenix: Goldphoenix is a golden mechanical phoenix which is Wrath's Advent Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrath's Advent Deck: Wrath slots his cards in his staff called the Gold Visor.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Goldphoenix to directly attack his enemies.<br>\r\nSword Vent: Conjures dual sabers in the shape of a phoenix's wings.<br>\r\nGuard Vent: Conjures a shield in the shape of a phoenix's tail.<br>\r\nSteal Vent: Steals any equipment that another rider has conjured.<br>\r\nTime Vent: Allows Kamen Rider Wrath to control time.

He can be a little perverted, and is the most likely to get distracted by Toni. He loves Wolves. In the TV series, his favorite Kamen Rider is Siren. He doesn't think before speaking, which annoys Anthony's mother some times when he accidentally offends her. He has great computer skills, and is good at sneaking around and telling riddles, but he is a bit of a slacker. Fairly tall, with short, brown hair and brown eyes. He likes Josh, although as mentioned above, the feeling isn't mutual.

A bit of a tomboy, and she can't stand cheerleaders. Loves video games, playing on the computer, music, and reading (especially the Twilight series, which Anthony doesn't care for). Fairly tall, with brown eyes, and her hair is brownish (used to be dirty blonde, but it changed over the years), her hair is long and naturally curly, but she works to keep it straight because she doesn't like her hair being curly. Loves making friends, although it seems they usually stab her in the back. She is very strong, and a good fighter, but she doesn't usually wear high-heels, and thus, doesn't know how to fight in them.

One of Christina's best friends, and one of the only friends who hasn't stabbed her in the back. Looks up to Anthony, and loves video games. Whenever he does something wrong, he regrets it and confesses soon after.

When activated, the background of the card shines with a spinning blue wind effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWing Knight's Survive Mode Advent Deck: Wing Knight's slot changes from a rapier to a shield with a sword sheathed inside it called the Black Visor-Zwei.

Toni herself was the first of Project R, whose goal is to make an army of evil riders by cloning the Earth Riders. Toni does not know any of this herself as she is a test to see how well the experiment works. After Toni killed the one who cloned her, the group decided to make the following clones have no soul (so the clones can't get angry at them), and to be completely under their command. Of course, in any experiment, there is bound to be at least one mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna: Kamen Rider Ryuga. Has the body of a 19 year old, although she was created sometime afther Toni. She is the mistake of Project R. She has a soul, and is on the side of good. She is a second clone of Anthony, and shares many personality traits with him, although she is more open than him, more easygoing, and, of course, a little girly (not quite a tomboy, but not a girly-girl). She has all of Anthony's skills and hobbies (along with typical girl things for hobbies). Anthony and her can contact each other mentally, and he can take direct control of her body (he is the better fighter). If he is vented, he will be in her body until his body awakens in the Advent Void. Her appearance is very similar to Toni's (but not exactly the same), but since the group members aren't perverted like the person who made Toni, she doesn't have quite as big breasts as Toni. She wears a black, short sleeved shirt, a black skirt with black shorts underneath, black elbow length gloves, black knee-length boots with heels, and a headband like Anthony's (she wears it under the same conditions that Anthony does). Her armor looks like the Onyx armor, but more feminine, complete with a skirt. She has the exact same deck as Onyx with the exception of no Survive Mode card. As with Toni, since she is a clone of Anthony, she has his verbal tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProject R stands for Project Ryuki, as such, all of the rider powers of the clones from Project R (with the exception of Toni) are called by the Ryuki versions of the Rider names (their decks work like the Dragon Knight ones instead of the Ryuki ones, however). All of the clones from Project R resemble the one they were cloned from, but don't look exactly the same. Shade and Abyss don't have clones, and the armor of every clone, with the exception of Blank Knight (since she's the first Blank Knight) and Ryuga, is darker than the original's armor. The riders from Project R are contained in a tube similar to the ones that the clones from Pokemon the first movie were in before being released. I don't care when Anna is introduced, but the others must be after Toni is set free from the spell (if Anna is introduced before then, she must have accidentally been released early), I will not budge on this, and I don't care how many chapters are made afterwards, even if they are really good, and I will delete the chapters if necessary to make it so this rule isn't broken. All of the clones are the same gender as the original, with the exception of the ones cloned from Anthony (which annoys him when he discovers it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProject R Riders:<br>\r\nToni/R1: Blank Knight. Advent Beast: Dragblanker<br>\r\nR2: Ryuki. Advent Beast: R Dragreder.<br>\r\nR3: Knight. Advent Beast: R Black Wing. Note: This rider is a younger clone of Eric without the high blood pressure (the people in charge of project R made sure of that).<br>\r\nR4: Verde. Advent Beast: R Biogreeza<br>\r\nR5: Gai. Advent Beast: R Metalgelas.<br>\r\nR6: Ohja. Advent Beast: R Venosnaker.<br>\r\nR7: Scissors. Advent Beast: R Volcancer.<br>\r\nR8: Zolda. Advent Beast: R Magnagiga.<br>\r\nR9: Raia. Advent Beast: R Evildiver<br>\r\nR10: Imperer. Advent Beast: R Gigazelle (aided by multiple of Magazelle, Omegazelle, and Megazelle).<br>\r\nR11: Tiger. Advent Beast: R Destwilder<br>\r\nR12: Femme. Advent Beast: R Blancwing.<br>\r\nR13: Odin. Advent Beast: R Goldphoenix.<br>\r\nAnna/R14: Ryuga. Advent Beast: R Dragblacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the execption of Dragblanker and R Dragblacker, all of the project R Advent Beasts are a darker shade than the original. R Dragblacker has pink eyes. As a side effect of not having a soul, all of the riders from Project R, with the exception of Toni and Anna, will not go to the Advent Void when vented, but will be destroyed. Their decks will stay behind and be blank as the contracts will end (the DNA lock will then be undone). The escaped Project R Advent Beasts can then be contracted by another rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProject Alternative: Another project by the evil group in charge of Project R. They managed to take the Alternative and Alternative Zero decks out of the series after the holders were killed and completely fixed them, also making them officially Advent Decks. Afterwards, Alternative Zero is known as Kamen Rider Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Kamen Rider Zero. 15 years old (his birthday is Aug. 30th). He has a red t-shirt which has a tri-force symbol on the front. He also wears a grey zip up sweat shirt which he carries his cell and a toy morpher in. He has blue jean shorts and has black and red stripped shoes. Kind and caring, as well as loyal to his friends. He doesn't give up with out a fight, even if the enemy is more powerfull than him or he is just out numbered. He simply laughs in the danger's face and then kicks it's head in. He will never let a friend go into battle allow even if he/she is more than capable of taking on the threat alone. He loves to play videogames as well as read manga. He watches a lot of power rangers (mostly re-runs of the Operation Overdrive saga since it's his favorite) as well as watches a little bit of Kamen Rider Dragon Knight when he gets the chance. He can drive a motorcycle rather well as well as do various tricks on it. He is also a sort of techy so he can repair various things. Knows some Kung-fu as well as some boxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/halojones/75/ryuuki/af00.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/halojones/75/ryuuki/af00.jpg</a><br>\r\nPsycorogue: Psycorogue is a Robotic cross between a human and a cricket. Since this power and Psycorogue come from the Kamen Rider Ryuki TV show, and were just removed and altered by the group, Psycorogue will not act like the other Advent Beasts. Alternative has a Psycorogue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero's Advent Deck (Note: Alternative has the same deck): Zero doesn't slot his cards, his card reader, named the Slash Visor, and which is mounted on his right forearm, requires him to slide his cards through it. The cards burn up instead of vanish, but they return the same way that other Advent Cards do.<br>\r\nAttack Vent: Summons Psycorogue. <br>\r\nSword Vent: Conjures a lance. <br>\r\nSpeed Vent: Increases Zero's movement speed. <br>\r\nWheel Vent: Transforms Psycorogue into its motorcycle form, Psycoroader. <br>\r\nFinal Vent: Psycorogue transforms into Psycoroader, then Zero and Psycoroader spin-out faster and faster until they ram into the opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozan Shoku: A 17 year old caucasian boy with spikey black hair and green eyes. He is left handed, is an expert swordsman, and knows everything about Kamen Rider Dragon Knight, Power Ranger, and Beetleborgs. He wears blue jeans, a white undershirt and a black leather jacket with red streaks on the shoulders. He is a bit of a lone wolf with very few friends but those friends are close as brothers and sisters to him. At first he will only help if the other riders are on the brink of defeat but as time goes on and he sees the others as friends he will always be on the frontlines to protect his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozan has a strong sence of justice will never standby when innocent people are in danger or are being bullied. Kozan has a kind heart which is covered up by his dark demeanor and scary phisical power, but once he warms up to you, you'll find he's a nice guy who has a great sence of humor and is good with kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll put more into for Kamen Rider Alternative and Kamen Rider Zero, including their Advent Beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere can be wild Advent Beasts that can be contracted, but the person who makes the Advent Beast must put the info for it in the chapter that the Advent Beast is shown. Advent Cards and armor description (for when they are contracted to a blank deck) must be told in the chapter that a contract is made.</td>",
