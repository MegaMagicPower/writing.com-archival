You have heard stories about the 'Vore Courts' and were aware of the popularity, amongst women, of the televised trials. Getting called to the Vore Courts was a very rare occurrence, however, and you never really expected to find yourself here. You look around, taking in the scene. The judge is a stern-looking older woman. Two woman police officers stand behind you, preventing you from trying to escape. Up in the gallery, you can see a live audience of women and girls watching you intently. Cameras are rolling and you know that your case will be broadcast to the nation for the amusement of womenfolk everywhere. Finally, you look in the direction of the claimant, the woman who has applied to have you shrunk so she can swallow you alive. She meets your  gaze and smiles back at you, but who is she? </span></div></div>",

Ever since you received the summons, you\u2019ve wondered who on Earth would want to do this to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your great surprise, the claimant is a stranger to you.. Although you have seen her around occasionally, you\u2019ve never spoken to her and don\u2019t even know her name. The woman, probably aged in her 30s, is an attractive looking Latino lady, with long curly black hair, attractive features and the softest, most kissable lips you have ever seen. She is also easily the biggest and fattest woman you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. She must easily weigh over 400 lbs. Her massive belly hangs down over her thighs whilst her gargantuan breasts are each larger than your head. This huge woman is watching you closely, her rich brown eyes appraising you in much the same way that a hungry woman might cast an approving eye over a gourmet meal. Understandably, you feel deeply uneasy under her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge calls the court to order and looks at you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis court is now in session.\u201d she says. \u201cYou are here because the claimant has applied for you to be reclassified as food so she can shrink you and swallow you alive. You will be given the opportunity to defend yourself. I will consider both the claimant\u2019s request to eat you and your defense carefully before I reach my verdict. My decision is final. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge turns to face your claimant. \u201cMadam, please state your name clearly for the court.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, your honour.\u201d says the huge woman. \u201cMy name is Mandy Martinez.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoted.\u201d acknowledges the judge. \u201cNow please present your opening statement to the court. Why do you want to shrink and eat the defendant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour honour, I am a woman with simple pleasures. I pride myself on an exquisitely sensitive sense of taste and I have made a living for myself as a food critic. Nothing makes me happier than enjoying a particularly fine meal. I have a well-developed palate and enjoy expanding my culinary experiences. I have a particular love of meat and I\u2019ve made it my mission to eat as many different species of animal as possible. I\u2019m proud to say that there are very few animals I haven\u2019t eaten at some time. To date, however, I\u2019ve never had the pleasure of eating a live man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d says the judge. \u201cAnd may I ask how you know the defendant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know him at all, your honour.\u201d Mandy replies. \u201cWe live in the same neighbourhood and I\u2019ve seen him around a few times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, then, do you feel that the court should rule in your favour? Isn\u2019t it the case that the defendant is an innocent man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is, your honour, but then this is not a criminal court.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fair point.\u201d concedes the judge, a wry smile playing across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy Martinez grins as she proceeds with her argument. \u201cSince this isn\u2019t a criminal court, there is no need to establish guilt. My claim isn\u2019t based on the defendant\u2019s guilt or otherwise. My case rests on the inalienable principle at the heart of our society; that women are superior to men and, thus, that women\u2019s desires are more important than men\u2019s rights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur society condones the eating of men. In fact, every woman is constantly told how delicious men are. Indeed, the eating of men is positively encouraged, within the law, so that men appreciate the true superiority of women and learn to behave respectfully towards us. Of course, there have to be restrictions, otherwise we would very quickly eat every man we could find. The Vore Court IS that restriction. We are allowed to eat men, but only once we have a court order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know all this, Ms. Martinez. Please get to the point.\u201d the judge prompts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course your honour. Put simply, I\u2019ve wanted to eat a man for a very long time. I\u2019ve put in applications to the Vore Court before, but this is the first time my case has been heard. I\u2019ve seen the defendant around and, I think you\u2019ll agree, he looks absolutely scrumptious! He would be the perfect meal, your honour. I think he is wasted, living his normal life, and believe it\u2019s time he became food. As a food critic, I would be sure to savour the experience and my belly would be very appreciative. I respectfully ask that you reclassify this man as my food so I can show him what it REALLY means to be a man in our society.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Ms. Martinez. This is an interesting case and it would seem a shame to deprive you of the opportunity to gobble up this man. I certainly agree that the defendant does, indeed, look particularly delicious. This is a court of law and I am obliged to ensure that we follow due process.\u201d With that, the judge turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have heard the claimant\u2019s request and you may now respond. I caution you to choose your words with care. I appreciate that these proceedings can be very upsetting for our defendants but we expect you to speak respectfully at all times. If I do not like your tone, I shall have no hesitation in granting the claimant\u2019s request. Now, we appreciate that you do not really know the claimant, but it seems clear that she is passionate about food and about eating you, in particular. What would you like to say at this stage?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My daughter, Sarah, has always been a huge fan of \u201cVore Court\u201d on TV and absolutely loves the thought of getting to gobble up a scrumptious little tiny man.

He\u2019s always been a close friend to me and my daughters and, as you can see, he does look particularly delicious.

Your honour, I\u2019m asking you to find in my favour and reclassify the defendant as food for my daughter. She\u2019s a good girl with an exemplary record at school and I really want to show her how much I love her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge listens carefully and then replies. \u201cAn excellent opening statement. The court certainly looks favourably on such a selfless request. I think your daughters are very lucky to have such a kind and considerate mother.

She then turns to face the judge and starts to make her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour honour, let me first make it clear to the court that I bear this man no ill will. The defendant is a neighbour of ours and has shown my daughters and me nothing bot kindness. He\u2019s a very sweet man, always popping in to help out with odd jobs or, even, just to chat. We are very fond of him indeed. However, as I\u2019m sure the court will understand, as a mother my first responsibility is always to my daughters, Sarah and Chloe. As a woman, I also have a responsibility to maintain the social order and keep the menfolk in their place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge nods, solemnly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. Please continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThank you, your honour. My youngest daughter, Chloe, has grown particularly fond of the defendant. He\u2019s kind and thoughtful to her. In fact, he\u2019s probably a little over-indulgent. He brings her sweets whenever he pops round to visit me and is very patient with her when she wants to play. I haven\u2019t discouraged him, because he\u2019s a lovely man. I think he might be sweet on me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused as you listen to Caroline. Everything she is saying reinforces how much she and her girls like you. Why, then, has Caroline called you to the Vore Court? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline continues to lay out her case. \u201cYour honour, I think it is only fitting that men are mindful of their role in our society and never forget the females are the superior sex. Indeed, it is probably wise for them to think of us in much the same way as a mouse might think of a cat. The very existence of the Vore Court should be a reminder to every man that, whilst it isn\u2019t an everyday occurrence, we womenfolk do occasionally EAT men. This, then, is the crux of my argument. I ask the court to consider; what should a mouse expect if it lets a cat taste it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly have a sinking feeling, remembering a game that little Chloe was playing with you the other week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge leans forward in her seat, a serious expression on her face. \u201cAny mouse that was foolish enough to allow itself to be tasted should, of course, fully expect to get gobbled up. Are you telling me that the defendant actually allowed your daughter to TASTE him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying, your honour. Apparently, they were playing a game together and, during that game, the defendant allowed Chloe to take a play bite out of his arm. I must confess to feeling slightly responsible for not intervening sooner. I had no idea that the defendant would be foolish enough to let Chloe taste him. Perhaps I should have...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not responsible for the foolish actions of any man.\u201d the judge said, glancing at you with a look of pure disapproval. \u201cYou, sir, should be prepared to take full responsibility for the consequences of your actions. We womenfolk have a particularly acute sense of taste. Men make the <i>very finest eating</i>. You are, without doubt, the most appetizing food any woman will ever taste. It is difficult enough for an adult woman to suppress the urge to eat a man she has tasted. I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be for a <i>young girl\u201d</i> The judge turned her attention back to Caroline. \u201cPlease tell the court, how has this incident affected your daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline continued her account. \u201cIt has caused her a great deal of upset, your honour. I know you won\u2019t be surprised when I tell you how much she loved his flavour. She was really happy at first, saying that she had never tasted anything so delicious It\u2019s all she wants to talk about. She\u2019s desperate to eat him and was inconsolable when I told her that women have to be 16 or older before they can file a case with the Vore Court. She\u2019s only 9 years old, your honour. I just don\u2019t think it is fair for her to have to put up with this craving for another 7 years. Not only that, since the defendant is both a  neighbour and a friend, she sees him practically every day. That\u2019s why I am bringing the case against the defendant. I think it was grossly unfair of the defendant to let my little girl bite him and then deny her the pleasure of finishing her meal. Knowing the defendant as I do, I am happy that he\u2019s in good health and I think he would make a delicious meal for my little girl. It would be no less than he deserves after getting her hopes up so carelessly. Your honour, I\u2019m asking you to find in my favour and reclassify the defendant as food for Chloe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge listens carefully and then replies. \u201cAn excellent opening statement. The court certainly agrees that it is grossly unfair to appeal to a young girl\u2019s taste buds without giving her the opportunity to satisfy the insatiable hunger that she must feel as a direct result. I certainly agree that the defendant does, indeed, look particularly delicious. Although I AM tempted to rule in your daughter's favour without wasting any more time, this is a court of law and I am obliged to ensure that we follow due process.\u201d With that, the judge turns to face you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have heard the claimant\u2019s request and you may now respond.

If I do not like your tone, I shall have no hesitation in granting the claimant\u2019s request.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">There has been a female revolution. Women now have the power to shrink men down to an inch in height. Men are seen as a delicacy and women enjoy nothing more than swallowing men whole and alive, to be digested just like any other food. In the interests of maintaining world order, however, women can only shrink and eat a man if they are able to obtain a court order. Any woman from the age of 16 onwards can place a legal claim to shrink and eat a man of her choosing. The man is duly notified and required to attend court to defend himself against the claimant. Men who refuse to attend court for their trial are ruled guilty, arrested, shrunk and delivered to the claimant to be eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courts are heavily biased in favor of the women (the claimant) and it is very rare that a decision ever goes in the man\u2019s favor (95% of cases end with the defendant being shrunk and awarded to the claimant to be eaten). Nevertheless, there is a slim chance that the defendant might be able to convince the judge to spare him on this occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis system works well for women, providing them with entertainment (court cases are televised and are extremely popular) and ensuring that the world\u2019s supply of men does not dwindle too quickly. Indeed, most men manage to live out their lives without being called to court. |Very few court orders are awarded reach week. Men have learned to tread carefully, treating women with the utmost respect for fear that they might receive a court summons. However, even perfect behavior is no guarantee of safety. Many court cases are on completely spurious grounds but are still treated with the utmost seriousness by the courts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you are a defendant who has been called to appear in court. Who wants to eat you and why? Will you be able to defend yourself successfully (unlikely) or are you destined to be shrunken and eaten alive?<br>\r\n</td>",
