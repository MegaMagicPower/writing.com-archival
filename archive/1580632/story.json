It was, of course, the highly-anticipated end-of-the-year costume party that one of your best friends, Jamie, threw every year. Due to her popularity, this was one of the largest and most anticipated parties ever, and had been happening since the 6th grade (both you and Jamie were finishing up your junior year of high school). The theme this year, you notice, is \"Unusual.\" This in itself is unusual because the theme's are usually quite specific, things like Athletics, Disney Stars, Animals, Monsters, and Stereotypes, just to name a few of the past themes. You notice that there is a list of suggestions for costumes at the bottom that appear to have been custom-written for you. You decide to pick:</span></div></div>",

Upon hearing that you had indeed received an invitation, she asks if her name was on your list of suggestions, since your name was on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling her that it was, she asks, \"Well how about if we go as each other?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways looking to please your girlfriend like the gentleman that you are, you quickly reply, \"Sure, sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"Pick out an outfit for me, something casual that still looks good, and come over her right away and we'll pick something out for you.\" She then hangs up. You quickly grab a set of clothes (white undershirt, brand-name t-shirt, a pair of red/black striped boxers, and your best pair of jeans) and rush out the door, grabbing your keys and wallet along the way. You hurry out to your car, which you quickly start and drive to Alexis' house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter her room, you see that she has already picked out a few outfits for you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to wear her insanely beautiful prom dress, since most people had seen it before and because it was so unique that everyone would recognize you. Alexis hands you her biggest pair of panties, which are quite tight, but you want to go all the way with this. She also hands you one of her bras, along with a set of fake boobs to stuff it with. You go into the bath room and change into her lingerie while she changes into your clothes. When you come back out, she helps you with the dress. She also gives you the shoes she wore to with the dress, 3\" red pumps. You just manage to stuff your feet into the shoes. As you look in the mirror, you see that the fake breasts do a very good job of imitating her very real breasts, but everything else just looks kind of weird. She then hands you a wig that perfectly matches her gorgeous blonde hair color and style in a way she would wear it to a party, which you promptly put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish dressing, you stand up and realize how difficult it is to walk in pumps. Alexis, of course, has no problem with your black loafers. She also stuffs her hair into a skin-colored rubber cap, which she covers up with hair that matches yours. You head out to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the door, you are greeted by Jamie, who is dressed in an amazingly sexy cheerleader outfit, which she tells you was bought from NBC. Apparently it was the outfit used by Hayden Panettiere in her cheerleaders scenes. She tells you that her birthday was just a week ago, and that she asked for this specifically to be her one present this year (her parents are head doctors at the two local hospitals, so they have plenty of money, even if they're house/cars don't say so). She tells you that both of your costumes are quite amazing, possibly the best she's seen all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to mingle with the other guests, your attention is turned to Jamie who is standing in the middle of the room. She announces that the final two guests just arrived (you and Alexis) and that the first activity of the night will now begin. After she finishes her announcement, she mutters something that sounds a lot like gibberish to you. Although it seems to be nonsense, the words still seem to be quite powerful. As soon as she finishes this, your vision blurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your vision returns to normal, you look to see none other than Hayden Panettiere standing in the middle of the room clad in her old sexy cheerleader uniform. Looking around, you see a familiar face looking at you. As you stare you realize that the face is yours. Suddenly, you realize several things: you have shrunk down to 5' 4\", your costume is fitting like it was fitted specifically for you, even your shoes, and your 'fake' breasts are feeling quite a bit heavier than they used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look in a mirror, you gasp in Alexis' voice and immediately grab your (Alexis') hand and the two of you walk over to Hayden, who you assume is really Jamie, and demand an explanation. She tells you, in Hayden's amazingly seductive voice, that her parents hired a wizard who told her a spell to change people into what they dress as. Quite obviously, it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Wanting to show some privacy for Alexis, you decide to take Steve into the bathroom. As you shut the door, he grabs your boobs and you fall over due to the unexpected amount of pure pleasure. However, you quickly regain control and demand that s/he strips down completely as you do the same. Once you have traded clothes, your vision blurs once again. When in clears, you see Alexis standing in front of you with a disgusted look on her face. Apparently s/he remembers the boob grabbing. You look in the mirror and confirm that you are indeed the sexy porn star. You also notice that your breasts are much heavier (which means that they're much bigger too). As you look back to Alexis, your pants get wet and you feel a sudden urge to grab her boobs, which you do, causing her to fall over out of pleasure. You then leave the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return, you find you nipples erect and your pants even wetter as you see your porn star counterpart Morgan, the playboy bunny twins Jeff and Robert, and finally Hayden, in your mind the sexiest of the bunch. She notices you staring at her and demands that you return to your spot in the circle. Steve, as Alexis, follows you out the door and sits in his/her old spot next to Morgan, who instantly drapes her arms around him/her and chewing his/her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp next is Alexis, still in your body.

However, your lesbian mind doesn't spend much time on this. As soon as she completely dons Morgan's costume, the changes into a sex goddess, which instantly turns you on more than anything else so far. Seeing this, she immediately comes and sits next to you and you two make out passionately, tongues darting in and out of each others mouths. Meanwhile, Morgan seems glad to finally be rid of her lesbian thoughts, although she doesn't seem to thrilled about the penis between her legs or the testosterone running through her blood, causing her to still like girls.</span></div></div>",

No matter how many times we tell her the right size, she always gets it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis went to the bathroom while Mark changed into the jeans. They were a tight fit, but he managed to get into them. When Alexis came back, she was wearing the clothes Mark had brought. She eyed him up and down, then handed him something, and said, \"Take off your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Mark. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a corset\", she said. \"It'll help give you a more girlish figure. I borrowed it from my Mom. She's kind of amused by this whole idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis helped Mark put the corset on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to breathe in this thing\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is\", said Alexis,\"That's why Victorian women were always fainting. their corsets cut their air off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped Mark put one of her loosest sweatshirts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\", she said. \"Needs a little work. How do you think <b>I</b>look? Am I a convincing boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tell you what\", said Alexis, \"Let's not do this half-heartedly. Let's do a little shopping, We've got plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them changed into their regular clothes, and went to the mall.  An hour later, they returned to Alexis' home.  Alexis took some of the purchases and left the room. She returned  about half an hour later, in full costume. Mark was impressed. He could still tell it was her, but she looked a lot more \"boyish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had my Mom help me bind my breasts with some bandages\", she explained. \"You'll suffer with the corset, I'll suffer with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was gathered up under a baseball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about dyeing it, she explained, \"But my hair color isn't <i>that</i> different than yours. Mom did a little make-up on me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had what looked  a bit like five-o'-clock shadow, so long as you didn't look at it too closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you taller?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lifts in my shoes\", explained Alexis. \"Anyway, let's get to work on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had him put the jeans back on, along with some frilly blue socks, and a cheap pair of mary-janes they'd bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least with those jeans on\", she said, \"you won't have to shave your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he put the corset back on, and a bra they'd procured. Alexis stuffed it with tissue paper until she was satisfied. Over this, he put on a sky-blue blouse they'd found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the sort of thing that I'd wear, it's just in your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis put some fake fingernails on him, and then carefully polished them in her favorite color. She's had him shave earlier, so she set about making him up, and putting false eyelashes on him. Then she put a wig they'd bought on him, and fussed with it a bit  She put a multi-colored silk scarf on him to cover up his Adam's apple, and topped it off with the bomber jacket that she'd \"liberated\" from her brother, which she wore everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad job, if I say so myself\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at himself in the mirror.   Alexis <i>had</i> done a good job. No one would mistake him for her, but if she'd had a cross-dressing big brother, he might have looked like a bit like Mark did right now.  Alexis, on the other hand. still managed to look as cute as a button, even dressed as Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a deep breath, and showed themselves to Alexis' mom, who laughed and took a picture to send to Mark's mom. She and Alexis gave Mark a few pointer on how to move like a girl, and he and Alexis practiced doing each other's voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time to go to the party, which was being thrown by their friend Jamie. Alexis' mom drove them to Jamie's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, kids\", she said. \"I'll be back to pick you up around. Be good, and have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alexis left the car, and walked up to the front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin was colored dark red, and her eyes were bright yellow. Shiny black horns projected from her forehead, and her teeth came to sharp points.  She was wearing an elegant black dress, and her feet seemed to have been replaced by shiny black hooves. A tail with a pointed barb on the end projected through a hole in the back of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, she looks amazing</i>, thought Mark.  There was an unspoken that guests made their own costumes for these parties, and did not use professionally-made  outfits.  Jamie was pretty amazing, but Mark had to wonder if she has really made her costume and done her make-up herself. Still, she was the hostess, it wouldn't  be polite to call attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she saw them, and said, \"Ha-ha-ha, awesome! Why, if it isn't Mark Johnson and Alexis D'Arcy! Or is it 'Marcia D'Arcy' and 'Alexander Johnson'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed them in a three-way hug and kissed them both on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <b>so</b> glad that you both came! Come on in and join the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ushered them in, and pointed out two figures standing to one side. \"Allow me to introduce you to our chaperones\", she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chaperones in question were two teachers from their school, a man and a woman.  The party wasn't an official school function, but since the guests were all students from their school, Jamie had persuaded two staff members to come .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was Maria Ferzoco,  the world history teacher. She was a pretty, dark-haired woman in her late twenties, who was generally known as one of the \"fun\" teachers, sympathetic to the students and with a good sense of humor. She was dressed as an ancient Egyptian queen, with a long flowing robe and an ornate headdress. Her costume was decorated with the astrological symbols for the various planets, as well as the symbols of various nations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other teacher was Matthew O'Donnell, the chemistry teacher. He was a sandy-haired fellow in his forties who known for being a quiet man who seldom missed anything that was happening. He was dressed as a grandfather clock, with his face painted yellow and the numbers written in a circle. Clock hands were gummed below his nose like a lopsided mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie bowed and said, \"Please say hello to the Pharaoh of the Solar System and Grandfather Clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Pharaoh of the Solar System'?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as well dream big\", smiled Ms. Ferzoco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Grandfather Clock'?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"A character from <i>Captain Kangaroo</i>, a show I used to watch when I was a kid\", explained Mr. O'Donnell.  Mark and Alexis made small talk with the two teachers for a few minutes, and then...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took them a second to figure out who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cal\", said Mark, \"How you doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal was a slim, quiet boy who was the son of the local Baptist pastor, and the star of the school's gymnastics team.  Mark didn't know him well, but stopped to chat with him briefly.  It was kind of a surprise that his parents let him out of the house like that, they were fairly conservative. It wouldn't have surprised Mark if Cal had change dinto his costume rafter he left home, but it wasn't his business to worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering near a long table of snacks were what looked like the ghost of Pikachu, an evil black doll, a ghost-woman and a ghost tree.  The ghost Pikachu  looked up and emitted a horsey laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mark, lookin' good!\", it said. Mark recognized the voice of Jimmy Davis, which meant that the other three were almost certainly  his inseparable pals, Paul McArdle, Andy Young and Joey Dubois.  They were affable fanboys who were experts on the obscure corners of popular culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jimmy, who are you guys supposed to be?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're each our favorite Ghost Type Pok\u00e9mon\", said Jimmy. \"Mmikyu\" (himself), \"Banette\" (Paul), \"Froslass\" (Andy), \"and Trevenant\". (Joey)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, you guys\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they saw what looked like two girls talking to each other.  One was wearing a long, tattered gown, a battered-looking ice hockey goalie's mask and a crown of flowers.  Her skin was made up to look grey and corpse-like, and she was wearing a straggly blonde wig.  The other was wearing a pink gown with various gears and tube attached, all painted a metallic pink. She wore a flowing blonde wig, a small crown and a red eyepiece over her left eye.  Her skin was made up to look chalk-white. Mark thought that the overall effect was to make her look like Princess Peach, if she was assimilated by the Borg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo, laaadies\", said Alexis, doing her best \"Mr. Smooth\" voice, and leering comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys\", said the masked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, is that you?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", the girl said.  Mark realized that the masked girl was Anne Ogawa, a friend of Alexis' who was in the Literature Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you supposed to be, Anne?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ophelia Voorhees!\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia from <i>Hamlet</i> crossed with Jason Voorhees from the <i>Friday the 13th</i>  movies.  Both characters drowned, so I figured that was a nice thematic connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you, Annie, only you\", replied Mark.  \"And who's your charming friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Prunuspersica of Borg\", the other girl answered. It was then that Mark realized that Anne's friend wasn't a girl at all, but was Bobby Dalton, another member of the Lit Club.  Bobby always did drag for costume parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Prunuspersica'?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Latin name for the peach tree\", explained Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they saw four people chatting together.  Two were obviously dressed as Link and Zelda from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.  They took only a minute to recognize \"Link\" as Jenny Swenson and \"Zelda\" as Anita Crawford, tow girls who were fast friends. You never saw one without the other, to the point where there was speculation that they were a couple and not just \"friends\". Neither Mark nor Alexis knew or cared particularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alexis looked at the other two girls. One was wearing what looked a bit like a black bondage outfit that emphasized her cleavage, a long purple wig and a metal crown.  She was carrying a plastic axe and a hardcover book.  Mark recognized her as Paula Ortiz, another of the school's star athletes. Mark gaped at her chest. Paul was fairly stodgy - maybe even a little bit stodgy - so she almost never dressed up \"sexy\".  Mark recognized the other \"girl\" as Paula's brother, Benny, who was also an accomplished athlete. He was wearing a white and red outfit that was as \"sexy\" as his sister's. His hair was dyed bright red, and he carried a toy spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Alexis. \"I never thought I'd see you dressed like that, Paula.  Who are you supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Princess Camilla and Princess Hinoka from <i>Fire Emblem Fates</i>\", said Paula.  \"Benny dared me to dress as Camilla, but I said I'd only do it if he came as Hinoka. He double-crossed me by agreeing to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others got a good laugh out of this. They chatted for a while, and then Mark and Alexis mingled some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they encountered a three-headed golden dragon. Three gold-painted faces poked out from the dragon's chest, and there were holes which six hands poked out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the Three D's\", said Alexis.  The Three D's was the Chang triplets, Deborah, Diana and Danielle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you three supposed to be?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Ghidorah, from the Godzilla movies\", they replied, all speaking at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty impressive\", said Mark, \"But aren't you three kind of stuck with each other in that outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\", said Danielle, who was in the middle. \"If you look between the costume's 'necks', there are clasps that we can undo, if one of us needs to go do something by herself, or if we just get sick of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a laugh at this, and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they saw Bill Hanson and Phoebe Wepner. These two <i>were</i> a couple, and were sneaking a kiss.  Bill was dressed as the Thirteenth Doctor from <i>Doctor Who</i>.  Phoebe wore a floor-length red skirt studded with golden globes and a black border at the bottom. She wore arm-length golden gloves, and a head-piece designed to look like the top of a Dalek, her eyes covered by mirror sunglasses,  She carried two wands, one made up to look like a Dalek gunstick, and the other a Dalek sucker arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never thought I'd see the Doctor kissing a Dalek\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked up  sheepishly and said in his best \"Jodie Whittaker\" voice, \"Well, Chibnall's taking the show in a new direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, Pheebs, the Dalek Princess?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalek <i>Empress</i>, please\", smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are Steve and Morgan here?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're over there\", said Bill. pointing to where Steve Peters and Morgan Francis, Mark and Alexis' two best friends, were helping themselves to a snack.  Mark smiled. Steve and Morgan were dressed as Winged Monkeys from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe you should stick with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends chatted amiably for a while.  There was music playing, and when a slow dance came on, Alexis grabbed Mark's arm, and said, \"Come on, babe, let's dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him out on to the area that had been set aside as a dance floor, and took him in her arms, and the two began slow dancing, Mark having to remember to let Alexis lead. He rested his head on her chest, and inhaled the cologne she had put on.  It was only they'd been dancing a few minutes that something occurred to him: Even with the lifts in her shoes, she shouldn't have been so much taller than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have noticed something in his expression, because she frowned at him and said, \"Something wrong, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'd swear you're taller than you should be\", Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious\", said Mark.  \"Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at arm's length from her, and she looked at him, dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny, but it almost looks like you're right. But, no, that's crazy. It must be these lifts. Come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him over to a couch, where she sat down and made him sit next to her. \"I'll  show you\", she said, pulling off her shoes and socks.  She looked up and saw Cal walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Batgirl\", she said, \"Come over here a minute, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK', said Cal. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need your help judging something\", said Alexis. \"OK, Mark stand up straight.\" Mark obeyed, and Alexis stood up straight  in her bare feet, back-to-back with Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Batgirl\", Alexis said,\"Which of us is taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal looked closely, and a mystified look crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", he said. \"Very interesting. Alexis, you've got a good three inches on Mark. Funny, I would  sworn Mark was taller than you. What do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\" said Alexis. \"You're not messing with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not messing with you\", said Cal. \"But let's get a second opinion. Paula, could you come here a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula, who happened to be passing  by, came over in answer to Cal's summons.  To Mark's eyes, she looked taller, too, Her boobs looked bigger, as well. She'd always had a smallish rack, but now her chest seemed to be bursting out of her outfit.  She looked a good deal more like Princess Camilla  of Nohr than she had before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Cal?\", asked Anita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's taller here, 'Marcia' or 'Alex'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita took a careful look, and said, \"Alex, definitely, by a few inches. How about that? Hey, come on, Cal, let's go to the game room, and play some table tennis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Cal, and the two walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy\", said Alexis, pulling her shoes and socks on, taking the lifts out of the shoes, first.  \"I <i>know</i> you're taller than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anita seemed to be taller, too\", said Mark. \"And her boobs seem to have blown up like balloons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you young hussy\" said Alexis in mock anger.  \"Don't. Be. Checking. Out. Other. Girl's.Boobs.P, she said, punctuating each word by repeatedly poking Mark's left \"breast\" with her right forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\", he said.  \"I...I...I felt that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly, Mark\", said Alexis. \"They aren't real\", she continued, squeezing his 'boobs'  with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww!\" repeated Mark, trying not to yell. \"I'm telling you that <i>hurt</i>!\"  He patted at his chest, gingerly.  \"This is crazy\", said Alexis.  \"I must've just hurt your real chest by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure feels real.\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go check it out\", said Alexis. Making sure the teachers weren't watching, she  led him to  an empty room that turned out to be a bedroom that happened to have a full-length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, show me\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took off the jacket and shirt, and then undid the bra, revealing an impressive rack. He stared at them in shock, poking at them gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis gaped at him open-mouthed.  \"Those aren't just <i>any</i> boobs, those are <i>my</i> boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my own boobs when I see them, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at himself in the mirror. It seemed to him that his face looked a little different, more feminine, more like Alexis'. In the meantime, Alexis had pulled off her shirt, and bandaged that were binding them.  Sure enough, her chest was as flat and hairy as Mark's had been previously.  She looked at herself in wonder, and then, coming up behind Mark, cupped his breasts in her hands and began jiggling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, these are fun to play with\", she said. \"No wonder guys go so crazy over them.\" She began lightly nibbling Mark's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe we're hallucinating, maybe someone drugged us?  My grandmother's brother was at Woodstock, and he saw some some pretty wild stuff after someone dosed him with some acid. Geez, Grandma almost killed him when she found out he told me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, cutie\", said Alexis. \"I can't believe anyone  of our friends would have dosed us with anything like that.  Plus, I don't know when they could have done it - we haven't eaten a or drank anything since we got here.  Besides, while I wish I could believe this wasn't real, it didn't feel like an illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is real, what could do this?\", asked Mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\", said Alexis, \"But I'll find out if I can.  I suppose we better get dressed again, but before we do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis spun Mark around do they were face-to-face, and then grabbed him in a fierce embrace, pressing her  bare torso against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this feels sooo good\", she said. She pressed her mouth over his , and he felt her tongue meet his. After a long kiss, she pulled away. She swiveled her hips a little, and smirked. \"I guess you're still male down <i>there</i> For now, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was breathing heavily, and felt ready to faint. \"Alex...hannhhh..i-if w-we're g-g-g-going to figure out what's happening to us, we better get dressed and start looking.   If we keep this up, one of us is going to end up pregnant, and I'm not sure <i>which</i>, anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis laughed, and released him. \"Alright, sweetie, but sometime...real...soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed back. \"It's a promise, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got dressed again. They didn't bother with the corset and bandages, instead rolling them up as small as possible, and sticking them in the pockets of Mark's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they finished getting dressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least you were used to being a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are\", said Bill, speaking with Jodie Whittaker's Yorkshire accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups began to chatter excitedly, comparing notes on what was happening to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex spoke to Anne. \"Does it - if you don't mind me asking - does it hurt, Annie? Sorry, that's tacky, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK\", said Anne, \"It doesn't hurt. there's no pain. I just feel so...cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia spoke with Cal and the Ortiz siblings.  \"I have to say, 'Hinoka', you make a pretty cute girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back atcha, Marcia\", said Benny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me?\", said Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were <i>already</i> a cute girl, 'Camilla'\", said Marcia. Marcia turned and looked at Cal. Sorry, 'Batgirl', didn't mean to leave you out of this 'lovefest'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me 'Barbara'\", said Cal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Barbara\", said Marcia, remembering that \"Barbara Gordon\" was Batgirl's secret identity.  \"I have to say, you seem to be the least freaked out of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal/Barbara smiled, and said, \"Well, this is something I've never discussed with anyone, but I suppose there's no harm in talking about it now.  I'm, well, I'm a trans girl. I realized it years ago, but I also realized pretty early on that I could never tell anyone, you know what my family's like.  My whole life, I could never be my real self.  I hoped that maybe some day I could transition properly, but that seemed so far away.  I can't imagine what this has been like for the rest of you, but for me, it's been like suddenly becoming the me I've always dreamed of being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Camilla/Paula, \"I never knew you were going through that. I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Alex spoke up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, maybe we better get moving, we still need to find the Changs. Say, where did Phoebe and Bill go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw them go back around the corner\", said Marcia. \"I'll go get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back around the corner, Marcia heard Bill and Phoebe talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I could try to induce a regeneration\", said Bill, \"And try for a male form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do not do that\", said Phoebe. \"I will admit that the thought of you as a woman was a shock at first, but I realize now that I love <i>you</i>, no matter what form you wear. I mean, if you can love me, even though I look like<i>this</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can\", said Bill.  Marcia turned the corner just in time to see Bill kissing Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Doctor kissing a Dalek</i>, she thought <i>It's like the worst slash fic ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \"Um, sorry to disturb you, ladies, but we really ought to move along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Phoebe looked up, sheepishly, and rejoined their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they...</span></div></div>",

The armholes on their costume were gone, and the golden scales that had been painted on were real.  Instead of six legs there were now only two heavyset legs carrying them along. Weirdest of all, their faces seemed to be sinking into the costumes, with only their mouths and eyes visible.  The costumes seemed to be larger, too, as the serpentine heads on the costume's three necks were now brushing against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, you've got to help us!\", the three D's said in tandem.  \"We can't feel our arms anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Danielle, alone, \"and my sisters can't feel their legs anymore,  and my legs feel all heavy!  Can you help us get out of this outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia looked at the girls' costumes. The clasps she had seen earlier were gone.  Alex, Phoebe and Camilla/Paula went over to explain the situation to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we're turning into a monster?\", they cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, darlings\", said Camilla, \"But unless we can figure out a way to undo this, we may all be stuck this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meanwhile\", said Alex, \"You're probably going to get a lot bigger.  It might be best to get you out of this house before you bring it all down on our heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, destroying this house sounds pretty good to us, but alright\", they replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along the three sisters' heads continued to sink into their costume until they vanished entirely. At that moments, the costume heads began moving on top of their long necks, emitting high-pitched, ululating whispery wails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\", said The Doctor/Bill, nervously.  \"Are you still, well, 'you', in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three heads looked at her. One nodded an affirmative, one shook negatively, and the third made a noncommittal gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said the Doctor.  \"Phoebe, darling, could you scan these rooms and see if one of them has a pen and paper in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I obey\", said Phoebe. The first room she scanned seemed to be an office, and she returned with a large pad of paper and a large novelty pencil.  \"Have you noticed that these rooms seem to have whatever we need in themmmm?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor held out the pencil to  the \"Ghidorah sisters\", who took it in their central mouth. and wrote on the paper that the Doctor was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"STILL US, BUT NOT.  HARD TO EXPLAIN. THOUGHTS BLENDING IN TO EACH OTHER.  STILL THREE, BUT ONE ALSO.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand\", said the Doctor.  \"Still, we do need to get you outside quickly.  Coincidentally - or perhaps not - I think this is an outside door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opened the door, and then stepped outside.  \"Yes, there's a sort of patio out here\", she said. \"The doorway's too small for the Misses Ghidorah, here, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhidorah made a shooing motion with their right head. The Doctor suddenly realized what they were planning, and said. \"Everyone get out, and then keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others rushed out of the house, and ran as far as they could into the surprisingly spacious back yard. When they were in the clear, Ghidorah's heads shot what looked like lightning bolts into the wall, blasting a hole big enough for them to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Alex, \"I want to see her explain that to Jamie's parents. Actually, it occurs to me that I've known Jamie for years, and I've never met her parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I, come to think of it\", said Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's missing?\", said Link/Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought about it, and said, Steve, Morgan, Bobby Dalton, and the two teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go look for them?\", asked \"Link\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we should go for help?\", asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bobby Dalton - now completely transformed into Princess Peach (if she was the Borg Queen) - came out next, pushing a two-wheeler on which Mr. O' Donnell (now full changed into Grandfather Clock) was resting.  Steve and Morgan, now completely changed into winged monkeys, came out next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her two best friends turned into animals affected Marcia more than anything else she had seen so far.  She ran over to them. and embraced  them.. They hooted  softly at her, and she began to cry as she realized that she might never be able to speak to her friends again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Camilla walked over to Phoebe and Prunuspersica/Bobby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you found everyone except Ms. Ferzoco\", he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's coming\", said Phoebe. \"Wait until you see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she spoke, they saw a blue glow coming from the house.  Ms. Ferzoco came out, floating a few inches above the ground.  They saw that she was the source of the glow, as she was surrounded by an azure aura, matched by the glow coming from her eyes.  The assembled group gasped at the sight of her.  She was still recognizably herself - but a glorified version of herself. Just looking at her made them want to pledge eternal loyalty and obedience to her - she looked like someone born to be the queen of the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saw them all gaping at them open-mouthed. \"Snap out of it, people, it's still me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, ma'am\",  the ones still capable of human speech said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone here?\", asked Maria.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone except Jamie\", said Camilla. \"Should we go look for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

S/he and Maria began herding people and animals into the time machine.  \u201cSome of you carry Mr. O\u2019Donnell in.\u201d  Alex and Jenny raced to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the Changs?\u201d, said Anita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, said Bill.  \u201cI have an idea.  Girls, stand still!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill raced over to the control console and began working the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m reconfiguring the ship\u2019s internal architecture to create a space big enough to fit the Changs and then I\u2019m going to materialize the TARDIS around them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know how to do that?\u201d, asked Cal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just do\u201d, said Bill.   There was a wheezing, groaning sound, and then Bill said, \u201cI think that\u2019s done it. Let me see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS/he activated a viewscreen which showed \u201cQueen Ghidorah\u201d resting in a vast storage space.  Bill spoke into an intercom: \u201cSorry, girls, I\u2019ll get you out of there as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dematerialized the TARDIS once more.  When it stopped, Anne said, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a remote section of the Yukon\u201d, said Bill.  S/he addressed the Changs again, \u201cGirls, I\u2019m going to let you outside, then we can come out and talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey understand you?\u201d, asked Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI speak kaiju\u201d, said Bill, guiding them out of the TARDIS.  \u201cI suggest we leave your steeds inside for now. We may not want to stay here long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing Jenny, Paula and Benny a paddock in the TARDIS where they could house their steeds, Bill led them all outside where Queen Ghidorah stood waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, we might not be noticed here\u201d, said Alex, \u201cbut someone\u2019s bound to notice Their Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do something about that\u201d, said Maria.  She spoke a few words in an unfamiliar language. \u201cI\u2019ve cast a spell of invisibility around us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do magic?\u201d, asked Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cThis character I dressed up as, the Pharaoh of the Solar System, was one I made up as a kid.  She was a powerful sorceress who was in charge of everything. A bit of a Mary Sue, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a sorceress now, does that mean you can turn us back to normal?\u201d, asked Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cI can try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria tried several times, but without luck.  \u201cI was afraid of this\u201d, she said.  \u201cI had a feeling that however powerful I am now, Jamie wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and probably couldn\u2019t \u2013 make me more powerful then she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what can we do?\u201d, asked Anne.  \u201cI\u2019m not wild about being an undead princess for the rest of my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what if they send the cops \u2013 or the army- after us?\u201d, asked Anita. \u201cHow are we supposed to go back to our lives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s think about this\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to be able to go back to \u2018normal\u2019 lives.  Maybe some of us can go back to something like normal, but you\u2019d best steel yourselves for the probability that your lives as you knew them are over.  As for the authorities, it occurs to me that we have a certain amount of leverage.  Between us \u2013 if we stick together, we represent a vast amount of power. I think I can \u2018persuade\u2019 the government to leave us in peace if we leave them in peace. Will you all trust me to speak for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked it over, but eventually, Marcia, Alexander, Matthew, Cal, Anne, Bobby, Jenny, Anita, Paula, Benny, Bill and Phoebe gave their assent. Maria turned to the four Pok\u00e9mon and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys have been quiet, what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, Paul, Joey and Andy looked at her amiably but uncomprehendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyu?\u201d, said Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria moved over and looked at them worriedly.  \u201cDo you guys understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure they do\u201d, said Bill.  \u201cI\u2019m not getting any vibe of intelligence off of them. No sense of their old personalities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean they\u2019re animals now?\u201d, said Marcia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks that way\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cIntelligent animals, maybe, but not human-level intelligence. I get that vibe off the Changs, but not these guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, where are Steve and Morgan?\u201d, asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked around, until finally Anne said, \u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Have you found them? Are they OK?\u201d, asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re, um\u2026th-they\u2019re\u2026uh\u2026mating\u2026\u201d, said Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the others say that the two winged monkeys were locked in an intimate embrace.  Bill and Maria soon determined that they, like the four Pok\u00e9mon, no longer retained any aspect of their human personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sat and chatted until the next morning, when Bill brought out breakfast from the TARDIS for those who wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, the President should be in his office by now\u201d, said Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to fly you there?\u201d, asked Bill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can get there on my own\u201d, said Maria, who then vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria reappeared in the Oval Office, using a spell to temporarily freeze the President\u2019s aides and bodyguards to silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. President, I\u2019ve come to speak to you about the unusual situation that occurred in the town of North Rafflesia last night. I take it you\u2019ve been informed about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Maria was growing increasingly angry and frustrated. The President was insisting that all of the transformed people should surrender themselves to the government. Every time she tried to speak, he interrupted her. Finally, she\u2019d had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP INTERRUPTING ME!\u201d, she said, unconsciously unleashing a wave of magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the President\u2019s face went slack. \u201cYes, Mistress\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, Maria realized that she had accidentally enthralled the President.  Well, maybe not that accidentally.  Still, it would be easy to have the President as a thrall.  Thinking of the future, she put a hex on the Oval Office so that any future Presidents would automatically become her thralls, too.  For now, she enthralled the President\u2019s aides and bodyguards, and then stuck around for a Cabinet meeting, so she could enthrall them, too.  Leaving them with commands to allow the transformees to live their lives in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was at it, she flew home to North Rafflesia and enthralled the mayor and the town council.  Deciding she\u2019d done enough for now, Maria returned to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were starting to wonder where you were\u201d, said Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, said Maria. \u201cIt took a little longer than I expected.  I\u2019ve made arrangements so that those of you who can go home and who want to go home can do so in peace.  I\u2019m going to be creating a special \u2018head quarters\u2019 for myself in the Rocky Mountains. Those of you who can\u2019t go home, or who find yourself \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 at home will be welcome there.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill took the ones who wanted to go home back to North Rafflesia in hir TARDIS.  Among these were Marcia Johnson and Alexander D\u2019Arcy, who had been Mark Johnson and Alexis D\u2019Arcy before they effectively swapped bodies.  <br>\r\nMaria went with them to explain to their parents what had happened and to help the Johnsons accept that they now had a new daughter and the D\u2019Arcys that they had a new son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first things Marcia did when she got home was to pack up all of \u2018Mark\u2019s\u2019 clothes and beings them over to the D\u2019Arcy home.  They\u2019d be no use to her and would now fit Alexander perfectly. While she was there, Alexander gave her what had been \u201cAlexis\u2019\u201d old clothes, for similar reasons. <br>\r\nMarcia then set about living her new life.  It was odd. It certainly felt strange having a girl\u2019s body, but somehow not \u201cwrong\u201d.  She felt no trace of the dysphoria Cal \u2013 except that she was Barbara now, had to remember that - had described feeling as a trans woman. Instead, it was like moving into a new room, or wearing a new set of clothes, unfamiliar now, but which she knew she\u2019d eventually get used to.<br>\r\nPerhaps it was a side effect of Jamie\u2019s magic. If so, it was a mercy, because Marcia had so many other things to adjust to.  One thing was that all of her relationships \u2013 inside her family and outside \u2013 had to be severely \u201creadjusted\u201d.  Her parents and younger sister adjusted reasonably well, all things considered, realizing and more or less accepting that Marcia was the same person they had known as \u201cMark\u201d.<br>\r\nExtended family members, neighbors and friends often had more difficulty. Everyone had heard what had happened \u2013 or at least a version of it \u2013 but not everyone believed it.  Some people even thought that the Johnsons and the D\u2019Arcys had traded children!<br>\r\nAs for Mark\u2019s and Alexis\u2019 friends \u2013 some of them expected Marcia to be Alexis and Alexis to be Marcia. Fortunately, you had each other \u2013 although they each had to admit that it was a bit weird kissing someone who had their old face!  Each of them helped the other as Alexander learned how to be a boy and Marcia learned how to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had ensured that the government provided free counseling to all the transformed people, and Marcia had taken advantage of it.  She was still coping with living her new life when she encountered one of the delayed \u201csurprises\u201d  that Jamie had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had to deal with being somewhat famous. It wasn\u2019t too bad. While their transformations had been drastic enough, some of the others had been changed even more drastically, and so they didn\u2019t get as much attention as some of the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One Saturday morning about a month after her transformation, Marcia was showering, thinking as she frequently did about how often Mark had fantasized about seeing Alexis\u2019 body naked and wet.  He\u2019d never guessed that he\u2019d end up wearing her body and seeing naked and wet every day!  This led to her wondering if Alexander felt the same way. This in turn led to her imagining Alexander naked and wet, which led to her getting a little worked up. The fact that she was getting worked up over her old body weirded her out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was through showering, she went to her room to begin getting dressed. She was joined by her little sister, Elizabeth, who would often come to visit her first thing in the morning and chat, often offering advice about how Marcia should wear her hair, some of it even useful. Elizabeth was an early riser, and even on a Saturday had been up for hours.<br>\r\nElizabeth was thirteen years old and would be starting eighth grade in the fall.  She was short (4\u20198\u201d) and flat-chested and somewhat insecure about her looks. Marcia thought this was a shame, because it was obvious to her that her little sister would be quite pretty in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcia dressed, Elizabeth looked at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not fair?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that my brother ended up being cuter than me! I wish I was as pretty as you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Liz, just give it time!\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say!\u201d, said Elizabeth. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I feel weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy clothes feel so tight\u201d, said Elizabeth.  \u201cI\u2026um\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcia watched, her sister started to grow. She got taller and her figure began to rapidly develop, her virtually nonexistent breasts swelling so quickly that they demolished the training bra that she had worn more out of hope than necessity. Her shirt buttons all burst and her jeans split up the back. Her face began to change as well, becoming one that was all too familiar to Marcia \u2013 it was her own!  When the transformation was complete, Elizabeth had become Marcia\u2019s physical twin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth noticed Marcia staring at her.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d then, beginning to notice the changes in her body. \u201cWhat happened to me? Why does my voice sound so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Marcia guided Elizabeth over to her mirror. Liz gasped at what she saw. \u201cI-I\u2019m you! How? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of those little \u2018surprises\u2019 Jamie talked about\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cYou wished you were as pretty as I am. Well, now you\u2019re exactly as pretty as I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my God\u201d, said Elizabeth, running her hands over her new body. \u201cI wanted to be pretty like you are, I didn\u2019t want to be your twin!  What am I gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first thing, let\u2019s get you into some of my clothes, and then we\u2019d better go tell Mom and Dad.\u201d Marcia sighed, \u201cAs if my life wasn\u2019t weird enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Marcia had to get used to having a twin little sister. <i>It was a shame</i>, she thought.  <i>Liz should have had a chance to grow up and become who she\u2019d been meant to be. Of course, I suppose I did, too, Damn it, Jamie, why did you have to do this to us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only positive out of it was their discovery that Alexander could always tell them apart, even when they tried to fool him.  It soon became easier, as Liz quickly developed an almost manic determination to have her own \u201clook\u201d, as different from Marcia\u2019s as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had the time, Marcia took note of things going on outside her own family. From time to time, she met some of the other transformees, and learned of the \u201csurprises\u201d one or two of them had encountered, and of the \u201csurprises\u201d that had occurred to various people in town.  In particular, several people in town, apparently unconnected to one another, had transformed into Pok\u00e9mon and winged monkeys, all of whom were taken into custody by Maria, or Meryet-Ra, as she had taken to calling herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia noticed how much the authorities cooperated with the Pharaoh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I was of a suspicious nature</i>, thought Marcia, <i>I might wonder if the great Meryet-Ra had been using her magical powers to \u201cgrease the wheels\u201d, so to speak. Well, nothing I can do about it even if she is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, three months after her transformation, Marcia received an unexpected invitation\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcia read the invitation. It was a hand-written note from Meryet-Ra inviting her to a gathering of the original transformees at her new estate in Colorado, with the necessary transportation provided. She talked it over with her parents and with their permission she decided to go, especially after learning that Alexander had decided to go as well.  When the day came, she packed the overnight bag that the invitation had recommended and left her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParked out front was a vehicle that looked like a cross between a stagecoach and a limousine. A young, dark-haired woman dressed in an elaborate uniform stood next to it.  She smiled and held out her hand when she saw Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcia shook her hand, the woman said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Emiko, I work for Meryet-Ra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you\u201d, said Marcia, as Emiko helped her into the coach. Emiko climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and began to drive down the street.  People came out to watch it as it passed, and Marcia had to fight an urge to wave at them as though she were the Queen or the Pope or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko drove them out of town, eventually turning on to a side road that Marcia was reasonably certain hadn\u2019t been there before.  This led to a tunnel that Marcia knew for sure hadn\u2019t been there before. It was large \u2013 far larger than any tunnel she\u2019d ever seen, and well lit. The walls were painted cheerful, nonthreatening colors.  After a fifteen-minute ride, they emerged onto a mountain road which led to a walled estate. The wall was decorated with Egyptian hieroglyphics. An ornate gate opened automatically as the coach approached. They pulled up in front of a modest mansion \u2013 \u201cmodest\u201d in the sense that Marcia\u2019s family\u2019s house would only have fit into it ten times. As Emiko helped her out of the car, Marcia breathed in the fresh mountain air. They were obviously somewhere in the Rockies. So, this was the Pharaoh\u2019s magic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Emiko\u201d, she said, \u201cHow long has that tunnel been there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that tunnel is wherever the Pharaoh wants it to be.  She could have teleported you here, but some people find that a bit disconcerting, so she sent us out to pick you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many drivers does she have?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs many as she needs\u201d, came Emiko\u2019s reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko took her leave of Marcia and drove off.  Marcia turned and approached the front door, which was opened by a young man in a butler\u2019s uniform.  He was tall, with long blonde hair tied back in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a beautiful boy!, she thought, before guiltily thinking of Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Lady Marcia\u201d, he said, in a purring voice.  \u201cHow good of you to come. My name is Wilson. Please allow me to greet you of behalf of Lady Meryet-Ra.  She apologizes for not greeting you personally, but she is still making some last-minute preparations. If you will follow me, I will show you to your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Marcia noticed Wilson\u2019s lack of an Adam\u2019s Apple, and the ever-so-slight curves of \u201chis\u201d hips and chest. Wilson was a girl! (Albeit a handsome, somewhat androgynous one.) She took Marcia\u2019s bag and led her into a main hall that was much larger than it should have been, even given the size of the mansion. Wilson then led her to an elevator that took her to the third floor, then showed her to her room, giving her the key before telling to call if she needed anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere will be a gathering for luncheon\u201d, she said, bowing. \u201cUntil then, please make yourself at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia turned to look at her room. It was about three times the size of her room at home and decorated luxuriantly but tastefully. There was a large, comfortable-looking bed, a desk with a computer and an old-style telephone on it, a make-up table, a full-length mirror and a large dresser.  At one end of the room was an entertainment system with audio equipment and a big screen TV, and a large couch, next to which was a mini-fridge which proved to be stocked with her favorite non-alcoholic drinks. It was exactly how she would have furnished a room herself if she\u2019d had the money.  There were even pictures of her with Alexander and her with her parents and Elizabeth on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the room was a kitchenette with a full-size fridge, stove and microwave, and cabinets stocked with her favorite foods. (As was the fridge.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia found a walk-in closet filled with a wide range of clothing, all of which were the sort of things she would have picked out for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther exploration led her to the biggest bathroom she\u2019d ever seen with a huge shower and a bathtub that could have seated five.  The medicine chest was well-stocked with a variety of items, including, she noted, condoms. Apparently, Meryet-Ra was planning for a number of eventualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she found a doorway leading to a balcony from which she had a breathtaking view of the Rockies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back out and sat on the bed. A clock on the nightstand said that it was 8:45 a.m.  It had been 10:00 a.m. Eastern when she\u2019d left the house. The drive here had taken 15 minutes, and she\u2019d taken another fifteen to explore the room, so it ought to be 10:45. It took her a minute to remember that she was on Mountain time, so the clock was right after all.  This meant that there was a fair amount of time until lunch. What should she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could just stay in her room and relax, or go explore the mansion, or go see who else had arrived.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a tee shirt, jeans and sneakers, but still managed to look elegant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Camiila!\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting Marcia, Camilla jumped up and grabbed her in a bearhug, burying Marcia\u2019s head between her mammoth breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcia, darling, how wonderful to see you!\u201d, said Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph, mmmph!\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, sweetie\u201d, said Camilla, releasing her.  \u201cIt\u2019s this wretched spell of Jamie\u2019s.  It overwrote my personality to be like Camilla in the game. I still remember being Paula, but it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been made over into someone else. It\u2019s really been quite distressing. But, come on, darling, let\u2019s sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla led them over to some chairs, and they sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, tell me, sweetie, how have you been?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I guess\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cYou heard about what happened to my sister Elizabeth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dear\u201d, said Camilla.  \u201cIt must have been quite unpleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been an adjustment\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cHow\u2019s it been for you? I heard you caught one of Jamie\u2019s little surprises, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that, dear\u201d, said Camilla. \u201cIt was bad enough being turned into someone else, but suddenly finding myself in a new body pretty much killed my - that is, Paula\u2019s -hopes of a gymnastics career.  I\u2019m not exactly built for it, you know.  It was even harder on poor Hinoka, of course. Not just becoming a girl \u2013 you know what that\u2019s like - but Benny had dreams of the NFL, you know, and from what his coach said, he\u2019d had a real chance at it.  All gone, just like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and took some needlepoint out of a bag that Marcia hadn\u2019t noticed before and began sewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always sewing these days\u201d, she said.  \u201cI\u2019ll sew something for you, dear. No, don\u2019t object, I just seem to sew whether I really want to or not.  It\u2019s just part of who I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed before continuing.  \u201cAnyway, we had to deal with the publicity \u2013 as we all did \u2013 as well as the scientists who wanted to examine my wyvern and Hinoka\u2019s pegasus, plus those darling creatures need to be fed and cared for.  So, we cut a deal with the nice people who own the Fire emblem games to do publicity for them.  Tedious, of course, but the money comes in handy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHinoka and I had taken to spending a lot of time together, flying around. It was so good to get away from it all. Then one morning, we were all eating breakfast together - our parents, me, Hinoka, and our little brother and sister \u2013 when our little \u2018surprise\u2019 happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201clittle brother and sister\u201d were Pedro (aged 14 and known as \u201cPetey\u201d) and Rosalia (aged 12 and known as \u201cRosie\u201d).  Petey was the typical sullen teenage boy, whereas Rosie was loud, friendly and outgoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRosie was needling Petey, as usual.  \u2018Well, I got one brother upgraded, I wish we could upgrade you, Petey, and we could all be princesses together\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Petey could come up with a witty riposte, they both began to change.  Rosie became a demure-looking, slight-framed girl with her hair in a red bob, and Petey became a perky-looking little blonde girl with improbably long curled ponytails. In other words, they became the characters Sakura and Elise from the same game as Camilla and Hinoka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet your parents freaked out\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo say the least\u201d, said Camiila.  \u201cAnd of course, Petey was outraged.  We soon discovered that Elise had come with a horse. She was Strategist class which meant she could do healing magic and had a tome of her own, as well. Sakura was Priestess so she could do healing magic, too, as well as now being an expert archer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Class\u2019?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game.  I\u2019m Malig Knight class and Hinoka\u2019s Falcon Knight class. It doesn\u2019t matter.  It was sad, watching over the next few days as the spell overwrote their personalities - Rosie becoming the timid introvert Sakura and Petey becoming the bubbly and extroverted Elise.  For all their flaws, I liked them the way they were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chatted, a maid appeared as if from nowhere, pushing a tea trolley.  The two friends accepted some tea and a plate of pastries. They continued conversing as the maid apparently vanished into the woodwork.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they noticed someone coming down the hall towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon Camilla and Marcia noticed that the person was Prunuspersica, who had been Bobby Dalton, but was now an amalgamation of the Borg Queen and Princess Peach of the Mushroom Kingdom. She held up a hand as Camilla got up, apparently intending to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, Prunuspersica said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to seem antisocial, but it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t touch you. My control is getting better, but for now I\u2019m keeping my distance from people for the moment. I don\u2019t need any more trouble just now.  I suppose you\u2019ve heard what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, sweetie\u201d, said Camilla. \u201cThere\u2019ve been rumors about, but nothing concrete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrunuspersica sighed. \u201cIt started about a week after the party.  My older sister Karen and my younger sister Bridget, were teasing me about being turned into a \u2018robot girl\u2019, as they put it.  They were poking at me, asking if my \u2018robo-boobs\u2019 were real.  I got fed up and went to brush them away. When I touched them, these tubes came out of my arms and I \u2013 I assimilated them.  I swear it wasn\u2019t deliberate \u2013 it just sort of\u2026happened.  It was the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.  I felt their minds flowing into mine \u2013 everything they were became a part of me.  I knew them better than I\u2019d ever known anyone. I knew things about them that I\u2019d rather have never known. We became a collective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow terrible for you, darling!\u201d, said Camilla. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents must have gone ballistic\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did, but It gets worse\u201d, said Prunuspersica. \u201cKaren\u2019s boyfriend Danny insisted on seeing her. He grabbed her hand, trying to \u2018snap her out of it\u2019, and she assimilated him, and he became part of my collective. Naturally, his parents went nuts. A few days later, Bridget\u2019s best friend Violet came up and grabbed me by the arm, practically pulling it out of its socket. It startled me and I assimilated her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and looked out the windows for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce she was part of me, I realized why she\u2019d done it. Apparently, her father had been\u2026well\u2026doing things to her\u2026for years. Her mother didn\u2019t believe her \u2013 or maybe wouldn\u2019t believe her.  Anyway, her home life was so bad, she preferred to be one of my drones. At least that way, she\u2019d be with Bridget and safe from\u2026him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Meryet-Ra helped us smooth things over with Danny\u2019s family. As for Violet\u2019s parents, they disappeared.   Took off, or so the police figure. The next morning, the father\u2019s car was gone, their bank accounts were cleaned out and most of their clothes were gone.  There\u2019s an APB out, but no one\u2019s seen hide nor hair of them since.  Anyway, I\u2026we\u2026my collective lives here now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Wow\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Prunuspersica. \u201cMeryet-Ra gave us our own section of the palace to live in.  As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, this place is bigger on the inside, just like Bill\u2019s TARDIS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, has anyone seen Bill?\u201d, asked Marcia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill and Phoebe took off in the TARDIS shortly after the party. No one\u2019s seen them since\u201d, said Prunuspersica.  \u201cAlthough I gather they were over in Britain last month, letting the BBC do some publicity shots or something.  After that, nothing. Meryet-Ra has assured me they will be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave either of you seen any of the others?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I came with Hinoka, of course\u201d, said Camilla. \u201cApart from that, I haven\u2019t seen anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ran into Link and Zelda earlier. They were going exploring\u201d, said Prunuspersica. \u201cOh, and Ophelia, but she lives here now, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes?\u201d, asked Marcia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, Prunuspersica replied. \u201cI gather her family couldn\u2019t handle having their daughter turn into a zombie. So, Meryet-Ra worked it out with her family for her to come and live here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcia darling, where\u2019s that young man of yours?\u201d, asked Camilla. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t come down together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI was going to try looking for him, but then I got caught up talking to you two. Actually, I don\u2019t know where to start looking for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on\u201d, said Prunuspersica. \u201cI\u2019m linked to the palace\u2019s computer system.  I can tell you where he should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting perfectly still for a few seconds, she said.  \u201cActually, Alexander\u2019s in the room right next to yours, Marcia, one door to the left.  Or at least, that\u2019s the room the Pharaoh assigned to him. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t see him coming in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must have just missed each other\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cIf you two ladies will excuse me, I think I\u2019ll go see if he\u2019s in his room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, darling\u201d, said Camilla.  \u201cWhen you find him, give him a hug for me!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she heard a sleepy \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex?\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cIt\u2019s me, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on\u201d, he said.  A few seconds later, he opened the door, smiling when he saw her. He was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, hon\u201d, he said, leaning down to kiss her. C\u2019mon in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia followed him into his room.  It was similar to hers, and like hers was decorated about the way she figured Alex would have furnished his room if he\u2019d had unlimited funding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d, she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got in around 9:00 local time\u201d, he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must have just missed each other\u201d, she said.  \u201cI got in just before that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u201d, said Alex. \u201cI looked around the room a bit, then I stretched out on the bed to see if it was as comfortable as it looked, and it was. I dozed right off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI looked around my room a bit\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cThen went looking around and ran in to Camilla and Prunuspersica and talked to them a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d, said Alex. \u201cHow are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go out on your balcony and talk\u201d, said Marcia.  They went and sat on an ornate bench on Alex\u2019s balcony. They sat quietly for a moment, taking in the view.  A Flying-Type Pok\u00e9mon, a Fearow, flew by, circling as if looking for something.  <br>\r\nFinally, it made a beeline for something it had spotted on the ground. It vanished out of sight before they could see what it was hunting and whether it caught it. It occurred to Marcia that all of the Pok\u00e9mon were transformed humans.  Could the Fearow have been hunting another Pok\u00e9mon?  Surely Meryet-Ra wouldn\u2019t allow that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia and Alexander chatted for a while.  She filled him in on what she\u2019d learned about Camilla and Prunuspersica, while he talked about his ride there.  He\u2019d been amused by the butler Wilson calling him \u201cLord Alexander\u201d. Marcia had been amused to discover that Alex hadn\u2019t noticed that Wilson was a woman.  Eventually they talked about more inconsequential things, like school and family gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex\u2019s transition from Alexis to Alexander had been somewhat easier than Marcia\u2019s.  Her relationship with her father seemed to have improved, once the initial shock had started to pass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad never really \u2018got\u2019 having a daughter\u201d, he\u2019d said. \u201cWe \u2018relate\u2019 better, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them sat together for a while until Marcia noticed that it was 11:30.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we oughta find out where this \u2018luncheon\u2019 is gonna be\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, they heard Alex\u2019s phone ring.  He went in and answered it. It was Wilson the butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a reminder, Lord Alexander, that luncheon is at noon on the patio.  Simply use the elevator and press \u2018G\u2019 for the ground floor. There will be servants who will guide you to the outdoor dining area.  Dress will be informal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding there was no harm in being early, Marcia and Alex left his room, went to the elevator and took it to the ground floor.  When they exited the elevator, the first person they saw was Barbara Newborn \u2013 who had been Cal Powell.  Marcia remembered what Barbara had told her when they\u2019d met a month after the transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad refused to acknowledge me as his kid, wouldn\u2019t even let me in the house.  Mom wouldn\u2019t stand up to him, of course. Meryet-Ra set up a new identity for me.  I kept the \u2018Barbara\u2019, but dropped the \u2018Gordon\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t want DC Comics\u2019 lawyers after me, ha-ha. Anyway, I\u2019m working as a librarian over in New Koenigsberg now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday she seemed happy and energetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, lovebirds!\u201d, she said when she saw Marcia and Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio chatted as they walked towards the rear of the palace.  Barbara seemed to know the way so there was no need to speak to any of the numerous servants whom they saw busy at their tasks. Eventually they existed the rear of the building and found themselves on a large open patio with an amazing view of the mountains in the distance.  There was a large semi-circular table, so positioned that anyone sitting at it would be able to see anyone else at the table and also have a good view of the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other transformees were there, even the four Pok\u00e9mon who had been Jimmy Davis (Mimikyu), Paul McArdle (Banette), Andy Young (Froslass) and Joey Dubois (Trevenant) and the winged monkeys who had been Steve Peters and Morgan Francis.  Morgan was obviously pregnant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Morgan came over to Marcia, chittering happily when they saw her.  They\u2019d been good friends of Mark\u2019s and some vestige of that remained in what was left of their minds.  Marcia spoke to them amiably, they way one might to animals that one might reasonably hope were friendly.  It was hard for her to see them like this, and she did not stay with them long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person they saw was Ophelia Voorhees (n\u00e9e Anne Ogawa), who merely nodded at them and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe can still talk, but she doesn\u2019t much, these days\u201d, said Barbara. \u201cOh, there\u2019s Mr. O\u2019Donnell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew (now Grandfather Clock) was being rolled in on a two-wheeler by two servants.  Marcia, Alex and Barbara stopped to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wife isn\u2019t with you, sir?\u201d, asked Barbara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, he said. \u201cShe\u2019s up in our room.  For whatever reason, she wanted this first luncheon to be just for those of us that were at the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all had heard of how Sheila O\u2019Donnell had received one of Jamie\u2019s little \u201csurprises\u201d.  She\u2019d had trouble adjusting to Matthew\u2019s transformation, and had said, \u201cOh, Matthew, I wish I could really understand what\u2019s happened to you!\u201d, only to find herself transforming into Grandmother Clock.  Now, the pair shared a room together in Meryet-Ra\u2019s palace, with a voice-activated entertainment system and personal servants to meet any other needs they might have.  Perhaps fortunately, the pair had no children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next people that Alex and Marcia ran into were Link and Zelda, who had been Jenny Swenson and Anita Crawford.   If there had been a question as to whether or not Jenny and Anita had been a couple, there seemed to be no such question about Link and Zelda, as they came in arm-in-arm in much the way that Marcia and Alex had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia hadn\u2019t seen either of them in a while.  Link, too, had had an encounter with one of Jamie\u2019s post-party \u201csurprises\u201d.  There had been some kind of an incident, but it had been hushed up, mostly, and Link and Zelda had dropped out of sight afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Link, long time no see\u201d, said Marcia.   \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi, Marcia\u201d, said Link.  \u201cZelda and I are living here, now.  I suppose you head what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI heard that something happened, but no details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d, said Link. \u201cWell here\u2019s what happened\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After the party, Link had returned to the Swenson home, and tried to get on with his new life.  The Swensons tried their best to deal with it, but it wasn\u2019t easy.   Link\u2019s fifteen year-old younger sister, Andrea, in many ways a typical middle child, had resented all the attention that Link was getting.  Their ten year-old sister, Virginia (known as Ginny), on the other hand, thought it was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Saturday afternoon, Andrea was hanging out at home with three of her friends:<br>\r\n\u2022\tFaith Duncan, whose parents were fairly strict religious fundamentalists.  She had taken a long time to come out of her shell.<br>\r\n\u2022\tTiffany Donne-Forbes, a girl from a rich family, she was something of a wild child, and had gotten kicked out of the elite girls\u2019 school she\u2019d been attending, which was why she\u2019d been enrolled in the local public high school where she met Andrea.<br>\r\n\u2022\tAlana Hamilton, a small, thin, studious Black girl who regularly got the highest grades in their class with an ease that aroused jealousy in many of her more academically-challenged classmates.<br>\r\nThe four girls had gotten roped into watching Ginny while Mrs. Swenson went shopping.  They were playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate with Ginny when Link had returned from a Nintendo publicity shoot. Zelda had come with him, since she\u2019d been at the shoot as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea had rolled her eyes when she saw them come in, still in full costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, look\u201d, she said.  \u201cIt\u2019s my sister \u2013 sorry, \u2018brother\u2019 \u2013 who became a media sensation because a sorceress turned her into a video game character!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you\u2019re just jealous, Andi\u201d, said Ginny.  \u201cI wish we all could be video game characters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda watched in shock as the five girls were transformed into the characters they had been playing in the game:<br>\r\n\u2022\tAndrea had become King Dedede, a man-sized rotund penguin, wearing royal robes and carrying an improbably large mallet.<br>\r\n\u2022\tGinny had become Isabelle, a cute little anthropomorphic dog.<br>\r\n\u2022\tFaith had become Bayonetta, a sexy, bespectacled, gun-toting witch.<br>\r\n\u2022\tTiffany had become Bowser, an extremely large, fire-breathing turtle.<br>\r\n\u2022\tAlana had become Captain Falcon, a tall, muscular \u2013 and white male \u2013 bounty hunter.<br>\r\nNeedless to say, there\u2019d been a huge stink with their own families and those of the other girls. Meryet-Ra had intervened and the girls were now living with her.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJenny\u2019s story was interrupted by a wheezing, groaning sound as Bill\u2019s TARDIS materialized.   Phoebe and Bill came out.   Bill was obviously pregnant \u2013 more than three, more like six \u2013 and wearing a \u201cmaternity\u201d version on the Thirteenth Doctor\u2019s costume.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re here\u201d, said Link.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s here but the triplets and the Pharaoh herself. I suppose \u2018luncheon\u2019 will be starting soon. We can talk more later.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all looked up and saw Queen Ghidorah flying overhead. They landed a safe distance away and sprawled so that her heads were resting in front of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my friends\u201d, they said.  \u201cThe Pharaoh has cast a translation spell so we may converse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by unspoken agreement, they all went to sit at the table, finding their places as if by instinct.  Marica ended up between Alex and Barbara. She noticed that there was a separate smaller table for Steve and Morgan and the four Pok\u00e9mon, where they were being attended by Meryet-Ra\u2019s servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they seated themselves, they heard Meryet-Ra\u2019s voice: \u201cThank you all for coming, it\u2019s good to see you all again.  Please consider my home as your home.  You\u2019re all always welcome here, stay as long as you like. Don\u2019t worry about staying too long.  Time passes differently in this realm of mine. For now, let\u2019s enjoy lunch and catch up with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the head of the table, dressed like Cleopatra on her day off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumerous servants brought out the food. Marcia noticed that no matter whether they were uniformed as maids, butlers or footmen, all of Meryet-Ra\u2019s servants were female. She wondered what reason there might be behind that but was a little afraid to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was good, and soon everyone was eating happily.  Well, almost everyone - Grandfather Clock, Ophelia Voorhees and Queen Ghidorah were not.  It made sense that a clock and a zombie wouldn\u2019t eat, but she did wonder what \u2013 if anything \u2013 the triplets would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she\u2019d read Marcia\u2019s mind, Camilla spoke up and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGhidorah, darlings, aren\u2019t you eating? What do you eat, dears?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGhidorah replied, \u201cWe consume life force, as all living things do in their way, though we do it somewhat more directly than most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that reminds me, dear\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of exploring around this galaxy.  We\u2019ve found a number of worlds with life but no intelligent beings, enough to keep you fed for thousands of years.  I\u2019ll give you the info after lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Bill\u201d they replied.  \u201cI am grateful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen lunch was winding down, Meryet-Ra addressed them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you all again for coming. There will be a formal reception this evening, including dinner and a ball.  I wanted this initial luncheon to be just those of us who were at Jamie\u2019s party, but there will be additional guests this evening.  The servants will be at your disposal for any necessary preparations.  I apologize for being busier than I would like, but I will make of point of speaking to you all individually before you leave.  Meanwhile, please feel free to explore the palace and the grounds.  As most of you already know, the palace is dimensionally transcendant and the grounds are located in what you might call a \u2018pocket dimension\u2019.  It may look like we\u2019re in Colorado, but we\u2019re not, really. Go wherever you like, there is nothing here that can harm you.  My servants will help you with anything you need. I\u2019ll see you all this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Summoning a servant, Camilla procured some packs of water and snacks for them to carry of their perambulations.  Marcia couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the way Camilla effortlessly acted the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey five of them set out through the gardens at the back of the palace and into the untamed hills beyond.  As they walked, they saw a troop of winged monkeys flying overhead, as well as numerous types of Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it me or are there a lot of different Pok\u00e9mon here?\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cIt\u2019s seems as though there\u2019s a lot than I\u2019d heard about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that more people fell victim to Jamie\u2019s little \u2018surprises\u2019 than we\u2019ve been told\u201d, said Barbara.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors about people disappearing.

Sure enough, they saw what looked like some centaurs off in the distance. It was hard to tell, but they looked to be all female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like it, doesn\u2019t it\u201d, said Hinoka.  \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard about anyone being transformed into a centaur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe either\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI guess a lotta things have gone on that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they came to a lake with a large, flat rock next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like a good place to sit for a while\u201d, said Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea\u201d, said Barbara. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pretty spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quintet sat down and began to eat their snacks and talked over what they\u2019d seen.

Just like the centaurs look after the land, and the harpies look after the trees, and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d, said Barbara, \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d been \u2018recruiting\u2019\u201d, said Barbara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes\u201d, said Bridget. \u201cShe\u2019s being doing it discreetly.

Follow me\u201d, said Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five friends dove into the water and followed Bridget, soon coming to a hatch with two windows on either side.   They followed Bridget into her home, and she led them to an inner air-filled room.   It was furnished like a luxurious living room, albeit one with a full bathtub in one corner.  Bridget smoothly leapt into the tub, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my guest area.  There\u2019s a bathroom and kitchenette, and a bed for people who stay overnight.  There\u2019s some towels in the closet there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla took out some towels and distributed them to her friends, who began toweling themselves off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t give you the grand tour\u201d, said Bridget, \u201cBut it might test your ability to hold your breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were dry enough, the five air-breathers sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBridget, how long can you breathe air?\u201d, asked Barbara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can breathe air for quite a while\u201d, said Bridget.  \u201cBut I dry out pretty quickly if I stay out of the water too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you keep this room so neat?\u201d, asked Marcia.  \u201cI\u2019d think it would be hard for you to clean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t\u201d, said Bridget.  \u201cI mean, I clean my own living space, but there\u2019s a cleaning woman who comes through once a week in scuba gear and cleans all the mermaids\u2019 air rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever feel constricted?\u201d, asked Marcia.  \u201cI mean, being stuck in the water all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u201d, said Bridget.  \u201cThere\u2019s waterways all through the estate, and lots of underground channels, so we can get almost anywhere on the grounds.  So, I\u2019m no more restricted than you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you ever leave the grounds?\u201d, asked Zelda.  \u201cDo you ever go to see the outside world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, said Bridget.  \u201cIf I really wanted to, I\u2019m sure the Pharaoh would let me, but I\u2019m content with my life here. I keep track of the outside world\u201d \u2013 she pointed to a large television at the far end of the room \u2013 \u201cbut I have no desire to go back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued chatting pleasantly for some time, until Barbara noticed that it was nearly 3:00 p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to have to rush out, Bridget\u201d, she said, \u201cbut if we\u2019re going to get back to the castle in time to get ready for dinner, we\u2019d better head out now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI quite understand\u201d, said Bridget.  \u201cIf you look in the bottom of the closet, there are some towels in waterproof bags, so you can dry yourselves off once you get back to land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking their hostess, the five friends swam out of her home and back to sure. She accompanied them to the water\u2019s edge.  Seeing that their clothes were where they had left them, they toweled themselves off and began getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so nice meeting you all\u201d, said Bridget. \u201cPlease do come back anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we will, darling\u201d, leaning over and giving Bridget an enthusiastic kiss, leaving the mermaid somewhat dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back to the palace, they discussed their new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a lovely girl\u201d, said Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she was nice\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cI wonder how many other people Meryet-Ra has recruited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, when they got back to the palace, Meryet-Ra was outside, almost as it they\u2019d been waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my ladies\u201d, she said, \u201cBeen exploring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty\u201d, said Camilla.  \u201cThe grounds are quite beautiful, and we met a charming young mermaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes?\u201d, said Meryet-Ra.  \u201cWas it Bridget, by any chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d, said Camilla. \u201cA lovely girl. We could have stayed much longer, but we needed to get ready for this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes\u201d, said Meryet-Ra.  \u201cGood thinking.  Don\u2019t worry, there will be servants to help you prepare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the Ortiz sisters aside.  \u201cCamilla, Hinoka, I wonder if I might have a moment of Your Highnesses\u2019 time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the other three, smiled at them, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you ladies this evening\u201d, in an obvious dismissal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Say, sis, you look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look good yourself, Liz\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cWell, shall we head down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Julie and Agnes, she said, \u201cThanks so much for your help, ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, My Lady\u201d, they said, curtseying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza and Marcia left Marcia\u2019s room and went over and knocked on Alex\u2019s door.  Alex opened the door. He was wearing the most elegant suit Marcia had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, babe, you clean up nice\u201d, she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, sis, you\u2019re drooling\u201d, said Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look pretty good yourself, hon\u201d, said Alex, kissing Marcia.  \u201cYou, too, squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Alex\u201d, said Liz. You look presentable, yourself.  Shall we head down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda were there (both also elegantly dressed), as were a large penguin with a big hammer, and a cute bipedal dog wearing an elegant dress.<br>\r\nMarcia, Liz and Alex exchanged greetings and compliments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllow me to introduce my little brother, King Dedede, and my little sister, Isabelle\u201d, said Link.  Marcia, in her run, introduced Liz to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chatted, they heard a voice from behind them.  \u201cMy goodness, what a striking collection of beautiful people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to see Camilla and Hinoka coming down the hall towards them, accompanied by two girls who proved to be their sisters Elise and Sakura. Barbara was with them, as well. They exchanged greetings and compliments and then got into the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the ground floor, servants directed them to the great hall, which proved to be a huge room, half taken up by tables, and half taken up by a large dance floor.  An all-woman orchestra was off to one side, playing instrumental versions of popular hits.   One wall was missing -  Queen Ghidorah\u2019s heads were visible outside the building, looking in. <br>\r\nAs they entered the hall, a footwoman announced them loudly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis Majesty, King Dedede!<br>\r\nTheir Highnesses, the Princesses Camilla, Elise, Hinoka, Sakura, and Zelda!<br>\r\nLords Alexander D\u2019Arcy and Link Swenson!<br>\r\nLadies Barbara Newborn, Elizabeth Johnson, Isabelle Swanson, and Marcia Johnson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia looked round the room and saw Grandfather and Grandmother Clock, Ophelia, Prunuspersica and her four drones, Bill and Phoebe, Bayonetta Duncan, Bowser Donne-Forbes and Captain Falcon Hamilton.  There was no sign of Steve and Morgan or the four Pok\u00e9mon, but everyone she might have expected to be there was there, except for Meryet-Ra herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably waiting to make a big entrance</i>, thought Marcia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard someone say, \u201cGood evening, Lady Marcia!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wore resplendent jeweled robes and a jeweled Egyptian-style crown.  She looked every inch a queen.  Despite how well-dressed they all were, she outshone them all. She waved, greeting the people nearest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, another voice rang out: \u201cDinner is served!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat down at the tables, and those of them that could eat did so.  The meal was excellent.  Meryet-Ra gave a brief speech, and then servants began busily bringing out food and drink - although no alcohol, Marcia noted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, there was dancing.  Marcia danced with Alex, Link, Camilla, and even Bowser and King Dedede.  In between dances, she chatted with the other guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Ghidorah remained outside, of course.  She told Marcia of her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will leave this world tomorrow, to seek out the worlds Bill told me of where I may feed, and to see the universe.  We have already taken leave of my human family.  I will miss our home, but it is too small for us now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia Voorhees was wearing a beautiful gown, and her hair was carefully styled.  Her usual mask was replaced by one of gleaming silver, and her machete hung at her side in a jeweled scabbard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you a personal question?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ask\u201d, said Ophelia.  \u201cI might even answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with Camilla and Hinoka, and they\u2019ve both talked about how their personalities were \u2018overwitten\u2019 by the personalities of the characters they turned into \u2013 even though they still have their old memories.  I was just curious -have you felt any of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really\u201d, said Ophelia.  \u201cI\u2019ve felt no desire to kill anyone \u2013 not even horny teenagers \u2013 nor am I pining away for a \u2018Hamlet\u2019.  It\u2019s true that I\u2019m not the chatterbox I used to be, and I do like to have my machete with me,  and I seem to know a lot of bawdy Elizabethan songs now, but I\u2019m still me. Mostly I just regret my costume choice.  If we\u2019d known what was going to happen, I think that most of us \u2013 except maybe Barbara, or Meryet-Ra \u2013 would have chosen differently.  Have you felt yourself turning into \u2018Alexis\u2019 - I mean, the Alexis that was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been learning to be a girl.  It hasn\u2019t been easy, but as difficult as it has been, it maybe hasn\u2019t been as hard as it might have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, said Ophelia. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the least thing about magic, or how it works.  Maybe Meryet-Ra could tell you, if she would. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re living here now?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, Ophelia replied.  \u201cMy parents tried their best, but they just couldn\u2019t hack it.  I don\u2019t blame them.  Either I creep people out, or they become obsessed with seeing what I look like under the mask, and then I creep them out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia started to say something, then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d, said Ophelia, in response to what she assumed was Marcia\u2019s unspoken question.  She looked around and then lifted her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy a heroic effort, Marcia managed not to flinch.  Apart from the mottled gray skin and the blurry, lifeless eyes, there was nothing wrong with Ophelia\u2019s face \u2013 no scars or deformities.  It was the face of a pretty young woman \u2013 but it was the face of a pretty young dead woman, and that made all the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia lowered her mask back on to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamilla actually kissed me when I showed her\u201d, she said.  \u201cSo, anyway, here is where I live now. Don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do with my life. Meryet-Ra has said I can stay here as long as I like, and she doesn\u2019t seem to expect me to do anything.  I mostly explore the grounds, occasionally scaring the crap out of the gardeners.  Wow, this is the most I\u2019ve talked in ages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted a little more, and then Marcia went to talk to someone else...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bayonetta and Falcon were in evening wear, while Bowser was merely wearing a bow tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was downing a plate of <i>hors d\u2019oeuvres</i> singlehandedly when Marcia approached them and struck up a conversation, asking them the same question she\u2019d asked Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true for me, at least\u201d, said Bayonetta.  \u201cMy personality was overwritten. Although to tell the truth, as Faith I was so repressed, that I didn\u2019t have much of a personality to begin with.  Becoming Bayonetta was like a liberation for me. Of course, it drove my parents berserk, having their dutiful little daughter become a witch. Did you know they tried an exorcism on me? When that failed, they disowned me. I guess they were afraid I\u2019d corrupt my little brothers and sisters.  Anyway, Meryet-Ra offered me a place here. Like most of us that became video game characters, I make the odd public appearance, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still mostly feel like me\u201d, said Captain Falcon, \u201cI mean, the \u2018me\u2019 that was Alana. I don\u2019t feel too \u2018overwritten\u2019, except for being interested in racing - which I never was before \u2013 and a tendency to say stuff like \u2018Show me your moves!\u2019 to people.  My parents never really accepted that I was the same person as Alana.  Not emotionally, anyway. I mean, I proved to them that I knew all sorts of things that only she could know.  They sorted of accepted it on a purely intellectual level \u2013 but not deep down inside, really.  It\u2019s been weird, suddenly being white and a guy.  Cops hardly even look at me twice, anymore, not even when I\u2019m dressed in my full \u2018Captain Falcon\u2019 outfit. Also, people listen to me now.  My parents never flat-out disowned me, but it just got weird at home.  They were happy enough when the Pharaoh offered me a place here. My mom even comes and visits me sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents are convinced I did this deliberately\u201d, said Bowser, \u201cjust to get back at them.  It did get them off my back about being a \u2018good little princess\u2019. Heh. I told them if they wanted a little princess, I\u2019d go kidnap one for them.  I think they thought I was serious.  Speaking of that, want to hear something weird? I\u2019ve actually had offers form a few \u2018princesses\u2019 to let me \u2018kidnap\u2019 them, if you know what I mean.  Not sure how I feel about that.\u201d<br>\r\nShe paused to inhale a tray of Vienna sausages.<br>\r\n \u201cMother and Father never actually disowned me, but they were happy enough to see me move out.  The funny thing is my father helps us invest the money we\u2019ve made from personal appearances for the video game companies.  He\u2019s most at ease when he\u2019s dealing with numbers.  So, we\u2019ll be well off.  As for what we\u2019ll do with our lives - we still haven\u2019t decided.  We may not stay here forever.  The three of us have been thinking it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the three of you?\u201d, asked Marcia.  \u201cNot Dedede, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah\u201d, said Bowser.  \u201cHe seems content to just laze around here, live off of Meryet-Ra.  Frankly, there isn\u2019t much difference between Dedede as he is now and Andrea as she was.  Bossy, lazy, likes to eat, unambitious\u2026Not much has changed.  No, he\u2019ll stay here, and like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re being a little unfair to Dedede\u201d, said Bayonetta. \u201cOnly a little, though.  Of course, Isabelle seems to be well on her to becoming Meryet-Ra\u2019s secretary.  She seems to have become an expert administrative assistant. As for us three \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou three should talk to Ophelia\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of at loose ends, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we will\u201d, said Bowser.  \u201cMaybe we will.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it meant we couldn\u2019t keep on living as we were\u201d, said Grandfather. \u201cI suppose it was lucky we had no children. It made it easier for us when Meryet-Ra offered to give us a place here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s set us up very nicely\u201d, said Grandmother.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lovely room with a view of the grounds, and voice-activated TV, music, audio books and internet. Also, there\u2019s a lovely young girl who comes in a few times a day to tend to us, see that our works are, well, \u2018working\u2019, seeing if we need anything, and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf nothing else, it\u2019s a very restful life\u201d, said Grandfather.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, Marcia went back to her room and changed into more casual clothing, before joining Alex on the balcony of his room.  Alex had also changed and the two sat and talked and cuddled, and eventually did more than cuddle.  In time, Marcia said \u201cYes\u201d to Alex\u2019s unspoken question and, after a quick side trip to the medicine cabinet, allowed him to lead her to his bed, where nature took its course.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, as she lay in Alex\u2019s arms, listening to his gentle snoring, Marcia reflected that while it hadn\u2019t been how Mark had imagined his \u201cfirst time\u201d, it had been quite good indeed.  In the morning, Marcia and Alex showered together and, donning silk robes, ordered breakfast in bed sent up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were finishing their breakfast, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d, said Alex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, darlings\u201d, said Camilla.  \u201cMay I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia shrugged at Alex, giving him a resigned look.  Obviously, Camilla had guessed what they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure\u201d, said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla came in, dressed in Alpine wear.  She smiled at the sight of Alex and Marcia in bed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do hope you children have been playing safely\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mom, we have\u201d, said Marcia, provoking a gale of laughter from Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeveral of us are going on a little hike up into the mountains. Since you\u2019re obviously so well-rested, perhaps you\u2019d like to join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia looked at Alex, who nodded assent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d, she said, \u201cJust give us a few minutes to get ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, dear\u201d, said Camilla.  Meet us downstairs in half an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, Marcia returned to her room to change.  The dress she had worn the night before had been put away by the ubiquitous servants. She put on some hiking clothes, collected Alex from his room, and took the elevator downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to Alex and Marcia, the hikers included Camilla and her sisters Hinoka, Elise and Sakura, Link and Zelda, Barbara, Elizabeth, Bayonetta and Captain Falcon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth caught Marcia\u2019s eye, smirked and gave her a thumbs up. Marcia rolled her eyes. Did everyone know what they\u2019d been up to?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia noticed that Link looked quite pleased with himself, and that Zelda had a big, happy smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can guess what you two\u2019ve been up to\u201d, said Marcia to Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing as you and Alex, I imagine\u201d, replied Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve friends set out, accompanied by four servants who were carrying a picnic lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ve done some re-shaping of our own, after all.  The worlds we\u2019ve directed Queen Ghidorah to - none of them have intelligent life now, but some of them would have, in time. Some of them would in time have given rise to powerful malign intelligences, but Phoebe and I have chosen to use Queen Ghidorah to prevent them from ever developing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra in her turn pondered what Bill and Phoebe\u2019s plans would be.  She had to believe that they had visited Earth\u2019s future, but she knew better than to ask them to tell her what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Prunuspersica.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat plans does the Collective have?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe, too, intend to seek a world of our own\u201d, said Prunuspersica.  \u201cHowever.  Before we go, we intend to do some recruiting. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Recruiting\u2019?\u201d, asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, said Prunuspersica.  \u201cOur plan is to build a vessel capable of interstellar travel and seek out a world that the Mushroom Borg can call its own.  To do so, the Collective must grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you plan to do this recruiting?\u201d, asked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs mundane as it may sound\u201d, said Prunuspersica, \u201cby advertising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Advertising\u2019?\u201d, said Meryet-Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, said Prunuspersica.  \u201cWe will present the truth of what becoming part of the Collective means.  We will accept only volunteers, and only adults capable of making an informed choice.  We will screen the applicants carefully and accept only those with the sort of abilities and attitudes that we find desirable. Meryet-Ra, we would welcome your oversight and input regarding this process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly\u201d, said Meryet-Ra, \u201cI\u2019d be glad to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe might be able to help as well\u201d, said Bill. \u201cWe can pinpoint a world for you that would be perfect for your purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure</i>, thought Meryet-Ra. <i> You\u2019ve already seen what world they\u2019ll settle on in the future, haven\u2019t you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeryet-Ra\u201d, said Prunuspersica, \u201cthere\u2019s another favor I\u2019d like to ask.  When we begin to build our star vessel, may we build it here, where it will not be in the public view?  We won\u2019t any damage to the grounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly\u201d, said Meryet-Ra.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You\u2019re certainly being careful to do everything where I can watch you, aren\u2019t you?</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them talked together some more before Bill, Phoebe and Prunuspersica left Meryet-Ra alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last three months, Meryet-Ra had built up her palace and had extended her influence. It hadn\u2019t been deliberate, but in order to operate without interference, she had found it expedient to take control of more and more government officials, until now, without having set out to do so, she now effectively controlled the Federal government, as well as the Colorado state government, as well as several state and county governments.  She really hadn\u2019t meant to, but it seemed that the more people she took control of, the easier it was.  It was far more preferable than dealing with officials who were all too often corrupt, venal and foolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, she\u2019d caught several spies by various corporations and by various countries\u2019 intelligence agencies.  They had found themselves adding to the diversity of her estate\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon population, as did the people who\u2019d sent them.  She took control of their successors, thus finding herself with a growing number of thralls around the world.   It wasn\u2019t like she was planning to take over the planet or anything like that. It was just that she knew that things in general would go more smoothly with certain elements under her control.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even she may someday be brought up against the fact that what we plan to do and what we end up doing are often quite different.

Queen Ghidorah was standing in in a flat, open space about a mile away, which was a close as she could get without fear of accidentally stepping on someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye, our friends\u201d, she said.  \u201cWe go to seek the stars.\u201d So saying, she took to the air and flew off into the distance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking off, too\u201d, said Bill, indicating herself and Phoebe.  \u201cSpacetime won\u2019t explore itself, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making their goodbyes, Bill and Phoebe got into the TARDIS, which vanished, wheezing and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other dispersed or broke up into little groups to speak to one another, Marcia found herself on her own.

She walked through Meryet-Ra\u2019s garden, eventually coming to a cornfield.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the rows of corn, Marcia heard a rustling sound behind her.

We\u2019re linked in a way that I don\u2019t think other people can understand. If I can offer you all a sanctuary if and when you need one, it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we really appreciate it\u201d. said Marcia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome\u201d, said the Pharaoh. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m thinking of it, let me give you this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra removed a necklace from her pocket and place it around Marcia\u2019s neck.

It had a green stone attached to it, in a setting crafted to look like an ankh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cAre you sure\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d, said Meryet-Ra. \u201cIt\u2019s magically attuned to you. It can\u2019t be lost or stolen, and nr can it be given away or worn by anyone else but you.  It\u2019s not just pretty, though.  Anytime you want to come here, just hold the ankh and wish, and you\u2019ll be teleported to your room here. Don\u2019t wait to be invited, come anytime you like, and stay as long as you like. And if you ever have any problems, let me know and if it\u2019s something I can help with, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarica hugged the Pharaoh and kissed her on the cheek.  \u201cThank you so much\u201d, she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been good to us \u2013 as a teacher before and as you are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always tried my best\u201d, said Meryet-Ra. \u201cAnd now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got some business to attend to.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marcia thought about trying to start a conversation with the goat-girl, but she seemed busy, so she left her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d, said Elise, when they were some way away.  \u201cTo think they\u2019re all volunteers.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d volunteer to be half-goat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the impression that a lot of these girls are from bad backgrounds.  Being goat-girls in a magical garden probably seems like a sweet deal to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe so\u201d, said Elise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the garden, they came to a forest.  In the distance, a Trevenant was leading several Phantumps. It eyed the two girls warily and then, having apparently decided they were acceptable, waved an arm/branch at them before shepherding its charges further into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if that\u2019s Joey Dubois</i>, thought Marcia. <i>I guess we\u2019ll never know.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcia and Elise continued to chat as they walked along a path through the forest.  From time to time they saw various creatures \u2013 some normal forest animals and some Pok\u00e9mon.  Finally, they came to a pool of water. The water was smooth and crystal-clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all sweaty\u201d, said Elise.  \u201cI could go for a swim. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cI suppose our stuff will be alright here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Elise, who began stripping off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s just us girls\u201d, she said, when she saw Marcia looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK\u201d, said Marcia, stripping off her clothes.  She noticed that Elise had a necklace like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you got one of those, too?\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Meryet-Ra gave it to me earlier.\u201d   Soon, the necklaces were all they were wearing.  They dove int the pool together.  The water was comfortably warm, and it didn\u2019t hurt their eyes when they opened them underwater.  There were plants growing in the pool, and a few small fish swimming around. Elise pointed to one side of the pond where there was a large, round hole, apparently the entrance to an underwater tunnel.  Then, she pointed up. Marcia took the hint, and the two girls surfaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, shall we investigate?\u201d, asked Elise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, but let\u2019s be careful\u201d, said Marcia. Elise nodded, they took deep breaths and dove under again. They swam into the tunnel, which proved to be big enough for both of them to swim side by side. It was pitch dark inside once they got a little way inside, so they had to grope their way along.  The tunnel seemed long to Marcia, but to her surprise, she had no trouble holding her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they realized that the tunnel was curving upward, and they saw a faint green light ahead.  Moving towards it, they emerged out of the water into a room that was lit by a large, glowing green crystal embedded in the ceiling. The air was pleasantly warm, so that they didn\u2019t feel a chill even though they were soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was roughly circular, maybe thirty feet in diameter.  The tunnel mouth was on one side, and there appeared to be no other exits.  There were small vents near the top that allowed for air circulation.  In the middle of the room was what appeared to be an extra-large bean bag chair, one easily big enough for half a dozen people to lie on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this doing here?\u201d, said Elise.  \u201cDo you suppose someone lives here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look \u2018lived in\u2019, though.  Maybe Meryet-Ra left it here for anyone like us who found this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u201d, said Elise, \u201cI think I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d  She plopped herself down and sank int the chair. She smiled and said, \u201cOh, yeah, this is comfy, alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia lay down next to her. It was comfortable, alright, and the green light was soooo soothing.  She yawned and closed her eyes.  Soon the room was silent except for the gentle snores of the two sleeping girls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She surfaced and stood still for a moment, savoring the sensation of the cool water running down her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the human city that spread around the edges of the bay and extended far inland. As always, the sight enraged her.  She could not articulate why it enraged her, it just did. It was wrong, it was an offence. It had to be destroyed, so she would destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a loud roar and began to walk to shore.   Several boats labored to get out of her way.  Those that failed to do so, she sank.  The humans on shore had noticed her, and by the time she reached the shoreline, hastily-gathered units of soldiers began firing small arms at her.  She barely noticed their bullets, but nevertheless, Cherenkov light danced along her dorsal spines and she spat a stream of blue fire at them, incinerating them.   She was indifferent to the cries of the few survivors as she marched onto land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans fled from her as she entered the city. She didn\u2019t particularly care if they lived or died.  Those that moved quickly enough lived, those that were too slow she trampled or burned, occasionally adding a little variety by swiping at them with her massive tail.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she smashed and burned buildings and vehicles. When she crossed a train line, she picked up a train car, watching with mild curiosity as humans spilled out of it, and then tossing it aside.  Planes came and fired missiles at her. She swatted at those that came too close to her and burned one with her heat beam.  The rest flew away. It didn\u2019t matter, the missiles were nothing more than pinpricks to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore soldiers came, this time with tanks and artillery.  They fared no better than their comrades.  She proceeded through the city, spreading death and devastation, until all was a sea of flames. Finally, her rage was sated.  She returned to the sea, smashing a few more boats almost absented-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving under the waves, she returned to her lair and went to sleep.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia woke up.  For one bizarre, disorienting moment she was uncertain whether she was Marcia who had dreamed of being Godzilla or Godzilla who was dreaming of being Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up. It felt weird to be human again. She looked at Elise, who opened her eyes and looked at Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d, said Elise.  \u201cI just had the weirdest dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d, said Marcia.  She saw a haunted look in Elise\u2019s eyes that she suspected was mirrored in her own.  Neither of them asked what the other had dreamed about, and neither of them volunteered to tell her own dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence that lasted a few minutes, until Marcia finally noticed that she was ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I could eat a horse\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d, said Elise.  \u201cI wonder how long we were asleep for.  I hope it wasn\u2019t a Rip Van Winkle thing where we were asleep for a hundred years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, Meryet-Ra wouldn\u2019t allow that\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not\u201d, said Elise.  \u201cHowever long it\u2019s been, let\u2019s go score some chow,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls dove into the water and swam through the tunnel and back out into the pool. Their clothes were where they had left them. Next to their clothes was a bag with two large towels and two small towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to have servants, isn\u2019t it?\u201d, said Elise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I could get used to it\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dried themselves off with the large towels and wrapped the smaller towels around their hair.  Marcia looked at her phone.   It was nearly five. They had been asleep for a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got dressed and headed back to the palace. When they reached the palace grounds, a maid appeared and took the bag with the large towels from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla was sitting on a lounge chair reading and looked up when she saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you are, darlings\u201d, she said. \u201cWe were starting to think you two had run off together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u201d, said Elise, winking, \u201cWe just went for a swim and then slept together. I think I\u2019m gonna go up and grab a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia went up to her room.  She ran into Alex outside her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, babe, where ya been?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went swimming with Elise\u201d, she replied.  \u201cI was just gonna grab a shower. Care to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that would be fun\u201d, he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were in the shower together, they were playful at first, but after a moment Marcia found herself clinging desperately to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, babe?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told him about the room she and Elise had found, and about her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were Godzilla?\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, or like something an eight year-old boy would have loved, but it was awful! I was filled with rage and killing people, stepping on them like they were ants. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex held her tight, and after they left the shower, they found their way to her bed and just held each other for a long time.  Eventually, nature took its course, but when it did, Alex went out of his way to be especially gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, she remembered that she was really, really hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, I\u2019m about to faint from hunger\u201d, she said.  \u201cWould you mind satisfying another of my appetites?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled and went over to the kitchenette.  \u201cWhat would you like, kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise me\u201d, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he returned to the bed with ham sandwiches, potato chips and Cokes for them both. Marcia practically inhaled hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that hit the spot\u201d, she said.  \u201cNow I\u2019ve got enough strength back to go find some dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed. The two of them got dressed and went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner that night was a much less formal affair.  They gathered together in a small, intimate dining room, and they were all dressed in casual clothes, even Meryet-Ra.  For the first time since their transformation, she looked like Maria Ferzoco the teacher and not the \u201cPharaoh of the Solar System\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone was there:  It was Marcia, Alex, Elizabeth, Meryet-Ra, Barbara, Link, Zelda, Camilla, Hinoka, Elise, Sakura, Isabelle, Bayonetta and Captain Falcon.  No one asked where the others were, presumably they were attending to business of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was buffet-style, self-serve with only a minimal number of servants. It was low-key but pleasant.  At one point in the evening, Marcia took Elise aside and said, \u201cHow ya holdin\u2019 up, kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m OK\u201d, said Elise. \u201cI told Camilla about the room, and my dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cI told Alex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know\u201d, said Elise. \u201cthe funny thing is, I\u2019m gonna go back there, someday.  Not right away, but someday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d, said Marcia, and it was only as she said it that she realized that she meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the night, Alex came over and kissed Marcia goodnight.  Somehow, he\u2019d sensed that she didn\u2019t want to sleep with him that night, and secure and mature enough not to take it as a rejection. Sometimes it was good to have a boyfriend who used to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat alone on her room\u2019s balcony for a long time, before she went into her room, and called Liz\u2019s room on her room phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d, said Liz, sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Liz\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cRemember when we were little kids, and you\u2019d have a nightmare or there was a loud thunderstorm, and you\u2019d come and slip into my bed? Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t notice until the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so?\u201d, said Liz. \u201cOh! Did you want to come over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cC-can I? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Liz, I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz greeted Marcia at her room door, giving her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d, asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cFor now, I just want to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Marcia was fast asleep, secure in her little sister\u2019s arms, which were identical to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shall I order up some breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI could eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the breakfast arrived, they took it out onto Liz\u2019s balcony. While they were eating, Marcia noticed that Liz was wearing a necklace like her own.  Apparently, Meryet-Ra had given her one, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Marcia returned to her room, showered and got dressed. Then she went to Alex\u2019s room, where he was sitting on his couch, listening to music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, babe\u201d, he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, I was just thinking it was probably time for us to head home\u201d, she said, \u201cwhat with the weekend nearly being over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose so\u2019, he said.  \u201cToo bad. I could get used to this lifestyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cMaybe Meryet-Ra will give us jobs after we get out of school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you, babe\u201d, said Alex.  \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to hire guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d, said Marcia, \u201cI\u2019ll get a job and you can be my kept man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Alex said: \u201cWhen do you want to head home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter lunch, I guess\u201d, she replied.  \u201cWe should talk to Liz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went and talked to Liz, and they all agreed to go home after lunch.<br>\r\nThey passed the rest of the morning hanging out with their friends.  Lunch was quiet. Afterwards, they leave of Meryet-Ra and their friends.  When they returned to their rooms, they found their bags already packed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to everyone, they used their necklaces to return home, as Meryet-Ra had in structed them.  After a brief flash of cool light, Marcia found herself back in her room at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out into the hall and saw her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcia? What are you doing here? I just saw you leave.\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been gone for -\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her phone and looked at the date and time. It was a minute after she\u2019d left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get it\u201d, she said. \u201cMeryet-Ra said time worked differently there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained to her mother that she\u2019d been at Meryet-Ra\u2019s for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a lovely necklace you have there\u201d, her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it? Meryet-Ra gave one to each of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys\u201d, said Elizabeth from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello, dear, you\u2019re back, too?\u201d, said their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind their mother\u2019s back, Marcia pointed to her necklace with her right hand and covered her mouth with her left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, Marcia said, \u201cHey, I was just telling Mom about how Meryet-Ra sent us back right after we left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s cool\u201d, said Elizabeth. \u201cI got all my homework done while I was there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz made an \u201cOK\u201d sign behind their mother\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and tell me all about it?\u201d, said Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cI just gotta go real quick\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was in the bathroom, she quickly texted Alex: \u201cPLZ TELL ME U DINT TELL UR RENTS ABT WHAT NECKLACES CN DO.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gratified when he answered immediately: \u201cNO WORRIES. WY AHED OF U.  LUV U.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe another text to Camilla and Hinoka (Elise and Sakura didn\u2019t have cellphones yet). She didn\u2019t get an answer, but she wasn\u2019t sure when they\u2019d left.  Hopefully, they\u2019d pick up on what she\u2019d picked up on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the necklaces returned them home right after they left, then they could go use it to go to Meryet-Ra\u2019s palace whenever they liked, and spend as much time there as they wanted, with their parents none the wiser.  She supposed that there was a possibility that Meryet-Ra might tell their parents, but somehow Marcia didn\u2019t think she would. She was reasonably certain that the Pharaoh had known exactly what she and Alex had been up to \u2013 certainly everyone else seemed to have figured it out \u2013 but she\u2019d said nothing about it. Also, she\u2019d told them to come and go as they pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a perfect hang-out, and a place where she and Alex could \u201cdance in the sheets\u201d whenever they liked.  Ah, the possibilities. Fortunately, Liz and Alex seemed to have picked up on it. She\u2019d have a little chat with Liz later to make sure. Finishing up in the bathroom, she went downstairs to join her mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia continued with her new \u201cnormal\u201d life, alternating time in the \u201cmundane\u201d world with time in Meryet-Ra\u2019s realm. She and Alex had regular \u201cdates\u201d there, and, as she\u2019d expected, Meryet-Ra showed no interest in them. Interestingly, her grades improved, as she now had as much time as she wanted to do homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mundane realm, Princess Prunuspersica launched a worldwide recruitment campaign for membership in the Mushroom Borg Collective. Marcia saw ads in print, on-line, ad on TV and radio.  The campaign was carefully slanted to convey the notion that membership was a rare privilege that would only be granted to those who met the Collective\u2019s rigorous standards. (This had the added advantage of being true.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia met Prunuspersica during one of her visits to the Pharaoh\u2019s realm, where the Princess was overseeing the construction of her cube ship.  Hundreds of drones were busily working on the shell of the vessel, which was bigger than Marcia had expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Princess\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cHow\u2019s the recruitment campaign going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty well, actually\u201d, said the Princess. \u201cWe\u2019ve had over a hundred thousand applicants worldwide, and more of them met our standards than I had expected. We\u2019ve accepted two thousand people for assimilation. We\u2019re going to announce this afternoon that recruitment is being closed \u2013 for now, at least.   We may open it up again once we\u2019ve settled our new world, if it seems necessary, and Meryet-Ra has no objection.   Actually, we have a recruit coming in this morning. Would you like to witness her assimilation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if that\u2019s OK\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrunuspersica led her over to a platform near the cube ship.  A drone materialized on the platform, accompanied by an athletic young woman dressed in casual clothing. She looked vaguely familiar to Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Charlotte, I\u2019m Princess Prunuspersica. Are you ready for assimilation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u201d, said Charlotte.  \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold still\u201d, said Prunuspersica, holding her arm out towards Charlotte\u2019s neck.  Thin tubules extended from Prunuspersica\u2019s and touched Charlotte\u2019s skin.  Charlotte\u2019s skin turned white and her clothing turned into pink cybernetic armor.  A surprised look briefly passed over Charlotte\u2019s face, and then the new-made drone marched over to the cube ship and began helping in its construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it\u201d, said Prunuspersica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much like the assimilations were on TV\u201d, said Marcia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur Collective has elements of magic as well as science\u201d, the Princess replied, \u201cso the process is somewhat smoother for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looked familiar\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was Charlotte van Dijn\u201d, said Prunuspersica. \u201cOlympic boxer, genius mathematician, high-level chess player and a pretty good saxophonist.  A real Renaissance woman.  We are privileged that she chose to become part of us.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had never been her plan to take over the world, but of the futures she had seen, the most hopeful one she had seen showed humanity united under her guidance, so she felt she had no choice.

She now controlled every elected official at every level in the United States of America.  Oh, she still allowed elections, even though it didn\u2019t matter who won.  She\u2019d placed spells on the offices themselves, so that whoever held them became hers, even though they didn\u2019t know it themselves.  She knew that it was important to maintain the familiar forms while she was cementing her control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, she had taken control of all the military leaders, police departments, and intelligence agencies. Leading industrialists and media figures. The general public knew nothing of this. If anything, they may have noticed that the government was running more smoothly.  Certainly, prison overcrowding was becoming less of a problem.  Numerous prisoners who should never have been locked up in the first place were freed, and numerous prisoners who were deemed incorrigible found themselves living out their lives as winged monkeys and Pok\u00e9mon on the grounds of Meryet-Ra\u2019s estate. Almost every kind of Pok\u00e9mon were represented there, except for certain of the Mythicals and Legendaries.

Until then, humanity would have her gentle hand to guide them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a lot of work to do \u2013 while she now had footholds in every government on Earth, it would be some time before she controlled the whole world the way she controlled the U.S.A.

Now that they were of age, they lived openly together in their rooms in Meryet-Ra\u2019s palace, commuting to their schools using their amulets. Link and Zelda were doing likewise, and the foursome spent a lot of time together. They were frequently joined by Camilla and Hinoka, who were still living at home, but who visited the palace frequently.  While the two sisters had begun dating, they had not yet found that special someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka (who had once been Benny Ortiz) discussed it with Marcia one afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what it was like, Marcia\u201d, she said. \u201cIt was strange enough becoming a girl, but realizing that I was now attracted to guys was like an extra level of weirdness, especially when I found myself getting the hots for a guy I\u2019d been buddies with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think I felt?\u201d, said Marcia, \u2018\u201dHaving what had been my girlfriend\u2019s body while she had mine was off the hook, and it got really weird when my little sister turned into a copy of me.  Imagine if all four of you had turned into Camillas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s a disturbing thought\u201d, said Hinoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u201d, smirked Marcia, \u201cwhen we started the naughty stuff, it was helpful that I knew exactly where the sensitive spots on Alex\u2019s body were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, TMI\u201d, said Hinoka, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been interesting for the scientists, anyway\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cThey say Liz and I are genetically identical. Even identical twins have some differences, so there\u2019s lots of things they can test with us that they can\u2019t test with anyone else.  They say that if either of us ever needs a transplant, the other would be a perfect donor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d, said Hinoka.  \u201cI wonder if her body would respond to nerve impulses from yours, or vice versa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s occurred to them. I don\u2019t know that I want to be that close to her. Oh, well. We don\u2019t really look exactly alike, anymore. It\u2019s not just that we both go out of our way to dress and wear our hair differently, but she\u2019s always been more of a jockette than I have. She\u2019s a star on the track team, and her muscles have developed differently, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, on a different note\u201d, said Hinoka, \u201cHave you ever gone back to that \u2018dream room\u2019 that Elise told me about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019ve never worked up the nerve to go back there. Why, did you want to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Hinoka, \u201cI\u2019m a little scared, but I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s late tonight\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cShall we go in the morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d, said Hinoka. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met the next morning. Each of them was carrying a bag with a swimsuit and a towel in it.  They chatted casually as Marcia led Hinoka to the pond. When they got to the pond, they changed into their swimsuits. Marcia couldn\u2019t help but take note of what a hot body Hinoka had.  Hinoka usually was very tomboyish \u2013 that was her character, complemented by the remnants of Benny\u2019s personality that still lived within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it\u2019s her choice, thought Marcia. But it\u2019s kind of a shame.  She could look really good if she ever wanted to dress like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dove into the pool and made their way through the tunnel to the room.  The chamber was just as Marcia remembered it. Wordlessly, they settled onto the bean bag couch. As they fell asleep, Marcia felt Hinoka reach out to hold her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kay and Emmy lived in a simple but sturdy cabin outside a town about fifty miles east of the Loovill Dead Zone. They were twin four year-old girls and while theirs was a harsh environment in which children had to grow up fast, at their age, they weren\u2019t expected to work yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father eked out a hardscrabble living as a farmer, supplementing the family\u2019s diet with whatever animals he could successfully hunt.  Their mother worked the farm as well and had a sideline as a seamstress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls themselves never went outside the cabin alone- there weren\u2019t so many bandits around these days, and no one had seen any wild folks near the town in over three generations, but still, there were plenty of wild animals around, bears and wolves and such, that would see two unattended little girls as tasty snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d been born in the cabin and had never been as much as a mile from it. For that matter, their mother seldom went far from home, either.  It was nearly always her father who went into town, when it was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lonely life \u2013 they had not yet met anyone else their own age. Still, at least they had each other. And although they knew only a little about it, life was better these days.  The Dead Zone shrank year by year, albeit slowly. When the town had been founded, many generations ago, shortly after the Burning War, the edge of the Dead Zone had been only twenty miles away.  And if there were more predator animals in the woods these days, there were more food animals, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly the girls played with their few toys, and watched as their mother did her chores, carefully explaining to the girls the things they would be expected to do when they were only a few years older. At night, after dinner, their father would gather them all together for story time.  Sometimes he would read \u2013 both parents could read, but their father was the best for reading out loud, possessing a deep, rich voice. The family owned a few books, rare items that had been in the family for generations. All were reprints of much older books from before the War \u2013 the Bible, Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales (which the girls loved), the Complete Works of Shakespeare (which the girls didn\u2019t really understand), The Annotated Sherlock Holmes (which made Emmy want to be a detective), and something called The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide (which none of them understood).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the girls liked best when their father would tell them stories, stories of the world before the Burning War, stories of heroes like Superman and Luke Sidewalker, and monsters like Godzilla and Frankensense. Some were old stories handed down over the years, others were ones he\u2019d made up himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, they were sitting on the couch in front of the fireplace, nestled between their parents. Their father was telling them a story about Batman fighting the Riddler, and every time the Riddler told a riddle he would challenge them to solve it, and when one of them solved it (often with a gentle hint from their mother), he looked pleased and said that it was good they were learning to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished up the story (Batman won, Batman always won), the girls drifted off to sleep, feeling as safe as they could in such a dangerous world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia woke up in the chamber, noticing that Hinoka was still holding her hand.  On a hunch, she said, \u201cHey, Kay, wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka looked surprised for a second, then smiled and said, \u201cOK, Emmy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we did have the same dream!\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cI wonder why. Maybe because we were holding hands?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, said Hinoka, \u201cI was a little nervous. The way Elise described what happened was a little scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand\u201d, said Marcia. \u201cThat one was weird in a different way. A strange, terrible place, but those two little girls were happy and loved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you can feel loved anywhere\u201d, said Hinoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that was just a dream, or was it a real place, a link to another world, another time?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, said Hinoka. \u201cIt sure felt real.   Maybe every dream is real, somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they\u2019d always been friendly, the shared dream led Marcia and Hinoka to become even closer friends, and they began to spend a lot more time together than they had in the past.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To Alex she gave a position in the corporation which she had created for her business dealings with the outside world. To Marcia, she gave a position with the literary division of the same corporation, overseeing books about and by Meryet-Ra.  Barbara was now serving as Meryet-Ra\u2019s Librarian, so she and Marcia worked together a lot as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Sunday afternoon shortly after they began working at their new jobs, Alex took her on a hike in the hills, ostensibly for a picnic, but she\u2019d suspected that he\u2019d had an ulterior motive, and he soon proved her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they\u2019d reached a beautiful spot that overlooked a valley, he\u2019d gotten down on one knee, presented her with a diamond engagement ring, saying \u201cMarcia, will you marry me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been certain it was coming.  They\u2019d had several serious talks about the future, and he\u2019d obviously been sounding her out. He should\u2019ve known what her answer would be, and probably he was 99% certain, but there was enough in that 1% for him to have a tiny amount of doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she smiled at him, and gave the only answer she could: \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he eventually stopped kissing her, he broke out a bottle of champagne he\u2019d brought with him and they\u2019d celebrated \u2013 and \u201cpracticed\u201d for their honeymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlter, they went and notified their friends and family. A few weeks later, Link and Zelda announced their engagement, as well.  The two couples had toyed with the idea of a double wedding, but in the end had decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Marcia were married first, in a ceremony at their local church.  Elizabeth was Marcia\u2019s maid of honor, and Barbara, Hinoka, Camilla, and Elise were her bridesmaids.   Before she left her home on the morning of her wedding, Marcia looked at herself in her wedding dress in her bedroom mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great, Sis\u201d, said Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, really lovely, darling\u201d, added Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGorgeous\u201d, said Hinoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia\u2019s mother stuck her head into the room.  \u201cAre you ready to go, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony went by in a blur until she found herself saying \u201cI do\u201d and kissing her new husband.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe reception was at a nearby restaurant. Among the guests was a woman in plain beige dress. It took her a minute to recognize her as Meryet-Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize you without your \u2018Pharaoh\u2019 gear on\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t try to outshine a bride on her wedding day\u201d, said Meryet-Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you gave us a home in your realm as a wedding present\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, think nothing of it\u201d, said Meryet-Ra, smiling. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got power like mine, the least you can do is make life easier for your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra watched as Marcia mingled with her other guests.  It was good to relax, especially since she\u2019d been so busy the last four years.  She now had complete control over North America, from the Arctic to Panama.  Her control of Western Europe and Japan was nearly complete, and she was making progress in other areas. All in all, she\u2019d earned another brief rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the reception, Alex and Marcia left for their honeymoon in Niagara Falls. By the next morning - although she wouldn\u2019t know it for a while - Marcia was pregnant.  By the time they attended Link and Zelda\u2019s wedding, Marcia was already starting to \u201cshow\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda had also been given jobs by Meryet-Ra, and a home in her realm near Alex and Marcia\u2019s.

And somehow, just being in her magical realm was invigorating all by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia and Zelda made the usual circuit of Showing Off the New Babies, first to \u201cAunts\u201d Camilla, Hinoka and Barbara, all of whom now lived and worked in Meryet\u2019s realm, and then to \u201cAunt\u201d Bridget the mermaid, and to \u201cAunts\u201d Elise and Sakura when they came to visit, and of course, to her literal Aunt Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra had been one of the first to see the new babies, and even Bill and Phoebe had come to visit with their own daughter, Susan, the first of the Dalek/Time Lord Hybrids.  Of course, the children also met Isabelle and King Dedede, both of whom were now aides to the Pharaoh.  Prunuspersica had sent a congratulatory message by subspace radio, as had the four Wanderers Bowser, Ophelia, Bayonetta and Captain Falcon.  Bill had even promised to let Queen Ghidorah know the good news when next they saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Marcia and Zelda went to see Grandfather and Grandmother Clock. They were amiable but distant. After the ritual Admiration of the Babies, they made small talk which petered out somewhat awkwardly.  As soon as they could do so politely, the two young mothers beat a hasty retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey described their visit to Meryet-Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just you\u201d, the Pharaoh said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been increasingly remote with everyone over the years.  They\u2019ll speak when spoken to, but they never initiate conversation anymore, not even with their servants.  They haven\u2019t been out of their room in years and seem perfectly content not to have any interactions with others.  In fact, we\u2019re not even sure they talk to each other, anymore. I don\u2019t really know what to make of it \u2013 but as far as we can tell, they don\u2019t seem unhappy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their room, the two clocks stood, apparently unspeaking, the only sound the ticking of their mechanisms as  they marked off the hours and the low murmur of the television, set on  a news channel, although they seldom paid much attention to  it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey knew that the humans were concerned about them and wondered why they so seldom spoke. The humans didn\u2019t understand that it was through their ticking that they communicated with one another, on a much deeper level than speech.  They\u2019d transcended the flesh, in a way that they suspected even Meryet-Ra couldn\u2019t understand.  It had been a difficult transition at first, but in a surprisingly short time, they had found they themselves developing a serene acceptance of their situation.  True, they\u2019d lost physical intimacy, but in time they\u2019d found themselves developing a kind of \u201cspiritual intimacy\u201d beyond what they\u2019d known as humans. As time had passed and they lived their lives marking off the hours, they\u2019d begun to lose interest in human affairs.  It wasn\u2019t that they bore any ill-will towards their friends, it was just that they had acquired a new perspective on time.  It passed, humans would go about their mundane affairs, and everything they did would eventually become part of the past  They were glad that their friends were happy, but they understood that happiness \u2013 like everything else, really \u2013 was transitory.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around and saw that she was in the most elegant shower she ever seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, five people could shower in here at once!</i>, she thought. As she bathed, knowledge drifted into her head, just as Jamie had said it would. So it was that Marcia knew where she was - in one of the many guest rooms in one of the many palaces owned by Her Divine Immortal Majesty, the Pharaoh Meryet-Ra, Ruler of the Human Race in the Solar System and Its Colonies Beyond. <i>Wow</i>, thought Marcia, <i>Ms. Ferzoco's really moved up in the world. But, what am I doing here? Well, I can't stay in the shower all day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of the shower, and looked at herself.  How Mark had dreamed of seeing Alexis' body naked. he'd never expected to end up wearing it!  She had only a moment to enjoy the sight before several young women in maid's uniforms appeared as if from nowhere and began toweling her off and drying her hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia found herself being rushed into what looked like the most ornate beauty salon she'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ms. D'Arcy\", one of them said while putting a terrycloth robe on her, \"We'll have you ready in plenty of time for the ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ceremony\"?</i>, thought Marcia, <i>What \"ceremony\"?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted buy a wall-sized TV.  It showed a scene of an enormous crowd, its attention focused on a raise platform. The Pharaoh stood behind a large table, flanked by Camilla and Hinoka. To Meryet-Ra's right was Empress Phoebe, with two Daleks in gold livery behind her and the Doctor at her side, and to her left was Princess Prunuspersica of Borg, flanked by two bright pink Borg drones.   An announcer spoke in reverent tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we see the leaders of the three great powers preparing to sign the treaty of alliance which will assure peace ans stability throughout the known galaxy.  Her Divine Immortal Majesty is signing now. Standing behind her are two of favored vassals - and close friends - Princess Camilla of Nohr and Princess Hinoka of Hoshido.  The woman next to her Her Dalek Majesty, Empress Phoebe, is Her consort, the Time Lord known as the Doctor, who was instrumental in facilitating the treaty. One should also note that the female drone next to Her Collective Highness, Princess Prunuspersica of  the Mushroom Kingdom of Borg is Ms. Jennifer Alice Langmeyer, who was assimilated into the Collective in a ceremony broadcast earlier today.  Her Divine Immortal Majesty allowed the assimilation as a gesture of goodwill towards her new ally. Ms. Langmeyer was chosen by lottery from among hundreds of eager volunteers. In an interview, Ms. Langmeyer, or Three of Nine, Secondary Adjunct of Unimatrix  four Seven, as she is now known,  reports that the assimilation was painless, and that she is now operaitng at maximum efficiency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was she really a volunteer?</i>, thought Marcia. <i>Of course, Jenny did have the flaming hots for the Princess there back when she was Bobby Dalton, so I suppose it makes a sort of sense.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer continued, \"We can also see on the platform General Ophelia Voorhees, leader of Her Divine Immortal Majesty's Undead Army, and Princess Zelda of Hyrule, another favored vassal.

But before she could react any further, four maids entered the room carrying her wedding clothes and began to dress her. When they were done, she looked at herself in the mirror. She was wearing the most beautiful wedding dress she had ever seen.  <i>Damn, I look <b>gorgeous</b>!  But I'm only sixteen!  Of course, the Pharaoh can order anything she likes, I suppose. She could make me marry a Pikachu, if she wanted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids adjusted her dress, hair and make-up, and then led her into another room where her maid of honor and bridesmaids were waiting.  Her maid of honor was a gorgeous redhead in her early twenties.It took Marcia a moment to recognize her as the local librarian, Barbara Gordon, an old friend of her family who had been something of a mentor to Marcia.  Marcia was one of the privileged few who knew that Barbara was secretly the duly-deputized masked crime-fighter Batgirl.  Marcia dimly remembered that in another life, Barbara had been Cal Powell. Her bridesmaids were Anne and Zinnea Johnson, who had been Mark's thirteen and twelve year-old sisters, but were now Alex's sisters, since they had traded families -  and Kylie Davis and Angela Parker, Marcia's two best female friends. In the old life, Mark had barely known them, but Marcia found that sshe now had memories of having hung with them since they were in kindergarten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all exchanged compliments, chattering away happily, until the maids herded them out into a hallway. At the end of the hallway stood Joseph D'Arcy, who had been Alexis' father, but was now  Marcia's. He walked her through the door, which led out into a huge, crowded stadium.  Wagner's Bridal March began to play over loudspeakers. More or less in shock, Marcia walked down the aisle with her father. When they got to the stage where the Pharaoh was standing. Alex was standing there as well, looking extremely handsome in a tuxedo. Marcia recognized his best man as Joey Andrews, but wasn't sure who his groomsmen were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was even with Alex, the pair of them curtseyed/bowed deeply to the Pharaoh.  Meryet-Ra leaned down to them.  Those at home heard the announcer say, \"Look, Her Divine Immortal Majesty is bestowing a private, personal blessing on the happy couple! How fortunate they are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Pharaoh actually whispered to them was, \"Sorry, you two, this wasn't my idea. More of Jamie's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \"Arise, My children\", and commenced the wedding ceremony  It was short and simple, and ended with the Pharaoh saying, \"By the power invested in Me by My Father, Ra, I now pronounce you husband and wife. What I have joined, let no one tear asunder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex leaned down to kiss Marcia, after which the newlyweds  were led to a small room where several maids helped Marcia changed into a somewhat more manageable dress.

The four Ghost Pok\u00e9mon were seated at a small table to one side where an attendant was apparently feeding them. Marcia wondered they felt about having to live the life of animals. Still, it could be worse -  Grandfather Clock was placed alongside one table so he could join in the conversation . He could no longer move or eat, but he could at least still speak.  Winged monkeys flew from table to table, serving as waitstaff.  The sight of them made her think of Steve and Morgan for a moment, but she was already finding it hard to remember their faces. She hoped that Jamie would keep her word and take good care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra stood up as they entered, and said:  \"As Pharaoh, I claim the singular honor of being the first to introduce to you Mister and Mrs. Alexander and Marcia Johnson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newlyweds entered the room to general applause, greeting all of their guests as their wended their way to their seats at the head table. As the wedding feast commenced, Marcia looked around the room at the guests and information about their new lives filtered into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pharaoh was sitting to her left, having granted the happy couple the incomparable honor of sitting at the head of the table. The process of changing from history teacher Maria Ferzoco into the divine immortal Pharoah, Meryet-Ra, had been bizarre.  She now remembered Her childhood in Egypt some six thousand years before. As a little girl, She had been struck by a bolt from out of the sky, granting Her the vast mystical powers marking Her as the daughter/self of the sun god, Ra. Her rule had spread from Egypt all over the Earth, across the Solar System, and out into the stars themselves. To Her awed astonishment, she suddenly realized:  <i>There's only <b>one</b> religion in the world, now: Worship of <b>Me</b>!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA functionary came up to Her and discreetly whispered in Her ear, \"Divine One, which of Your harem do you wish to attend you in your bedchamber this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My \"<b>harem</b>\"?</i>, thought Meryet-Ra, momentarily stupefied, until the information.  As Pharaoh, she could claim any man or woman she wanted for her own.  Of course, as a merciful monarch, she never took anyone by force, but most were eager to serve Her in the most intimate way, as it was well known that with Her powers, intimacy with Her was a uniquely pleasurable experience.  There had been thousands in Her harem over the millennia, and She had borne numberless children, who had gone forth and multiplied so much that literally every living human was descended from Her. One of Her titles was \"All-Mother\", and it was pretty much <b>literally</b> true. As the members of Her harem aged, they were sent to a comfortable retirement. At the moment, only a handful of her active harem were with her (the rest were at her palace in the world capital of Heliopolis in Egypt)  her \"old life\" husband, George; her college boyfriend, Jack McDonough; Gracie Cortez, her best friend with whom she had \"experimented\" a few times during their college days; Phil, the older brother of her high school buddy Angela Bellucci (Maria'd had a huge crush on him but never worked up nerve to ask him out); Angela herself (Well, she'd always thought Angela was cute!); her high school boyfriend, Donny Parker; Billy Wilson (whom she and her \"BFF\" Becky Swenson had fought over in eighth grade; Becky herself (<i>OK, that's interesting</i>, she thought) and  - Oh! My! God! Adam Levine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I - I - I  I have <b>Adam Levine</b> at my beck and call! Adam Levine is one of my sex toys!</i>, She thought.(She'd had a huge crush on him when She was sixteen, and had never quite gotten over it 100%)  <i>I think that I am going to <b>like</b> being the Queen of Everything!But, as for this evening...Hmmm....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered back to the functionary: \"Have the Ladies Graciela, Angela and Rebecca attend me this evening. I feel like a \"ladies' night\". She smirked happily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Marcia....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As time passed their memories of their old lives continued to fad, until they seemed like little more than a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, things were drawing towards an end.  Meryet-Ra stood up, and began to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go on our separate ways, I would like to offer My special personal  blessing to Alexander and Marcia, and to all this company, and to all persons of good will everywhere.   As you may know, in one month's time, Alexander and Marcia will be taking up residence in My Grand Palace in Heliopolis as My newest acolytes.  I look forward to seeing them live and grow in My service. However, before then, they will be going on a lengthy honeymoon trip as My personal guests, visiting My personal residences in Hoshido, Nohr, and Tranquility Base. It is My command that you two enjoy yourselves to the fullest, because when you get to Heliopolis, you will really be put to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at this, and the newlyweds thanked Her Divine Immortal Majesty effusively. Then, after receiving extensive congratulations from all assembled, they went to change into travel clothes. After this, an attendant took them to join the others on a viewing platform outside that was high enough off the ground that it was level with the base of Ghidorah's necks. They could see that a small cabin had been harnessed to the base of the <i>kaiju</i>'s central neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said the Pharaoh, \"I wanted you to travel to your first destination in style, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Marcia said their farewells - with much weeping from both mothers, and boarded their unusual \"mount\". They had a luxurious flight - Ghidorah flew very smoothly as it took them to Hawaii, where they spent their first night together.  By the time they got into to be that evening, they had all but forgotten their previous lives. They enjoyed one another immensely, and had a good time on their honeymoon, generally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, they found themselves winging their way to Heliopolis - not that they weren't looking forward to their new lives there, but they had seen so many amazing things on their travels.  Meryet-Ra greeted them personally on their return, and they began their new work the next day, as apprentices to mentors appointed for them by the Pharaoh.  About two weeks into her new job, Marcia went into her mentor's office, and asked, \"Do you have a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mentor, Bao, a friendly Chinese woman in her early thirties, smiled affirmatively and waved Marcia to a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\", Bao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Marcia, \"I've noticed something coming up a lot lately that's probably going to affect my work performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\", asked Bao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breakfast\", said Marcia.  \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\", asked Bao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took two separate pregnancy tests, and they've both come out positive.  I made a medical appointment for Tuesday morning, so I also wanted to ask if I could have Tuesday morning off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course\", said Bao, \"and congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Marcia. \"I hadn't really planned on this so soon. Who could have guessed that a month of regular sex might result in a pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry\", said Bao, laughing.  \"I had my first around your age, too. Here's what we'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marcia's pregnancy went relatively smoothly. She worked up until shortly before her delivery date, and shortly thereafter was delivered of a healthy daughter.  She and Alex named the child, Maria, and the Pharaoh Herself stood as godmother when the child was christened, and as it happened, Empress Phoebe, and the Princesses Prunuspersica, Camilla and Hinoka were all in attendance, they all having for some reason taken a personal interest in her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, Marcia and Alex had several more children. Marcia discovered a gift for childcare, and in time came to work in the daycare center at the Royal complex in Heliopolis. Marcia lived a long, happy life, and lived to see her great-grandchildren.  About the only thing that bothered her was being around winged monkeys. Oh, she wasn't afraid of them, and she didn't hate being around them, really, and they certainly seemed to like her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was just that, whenever she saw one, she had a feeling of loss.
