It was, of course, the highly-anticipated end-of-the-year costume party that one of your best friends, Jamie, threw every year. Due to her popularity, this was one of the largest and most anticipated parties ever, and had been happening since the 6th grade (both you and Jamie were finishing up your junior year of high school). The theme this year, you notice, is \"Unusual.\" This in itself is unusual because the theme's are usually quite specific, things like Athletics, Disney Stars, Animals, Monsters, and Stereotypes, just to name a few of the past themes. You notice that there is a list of suggestions for costumes at the bottom that appear to have been custom-written for you. You decide to pick:</span></div></div>",

Upon hearing that you had indeed received an invitation, she asks if her name was on your list of suggestions, since your name was on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling her that it was, she asks, \"Well how about if we go as each other?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways looking to please your girlfriend like the gentleman that you are, you quickly reply, \"Sure, sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"Pick out an outfit for me, something casual that still looks good, and come over her right away and we'll pick something out for you.\" She then hangs up. You quickly grab a set of clothes (white undershirt, brand-name t-shirt, a pair of red/black striped boxers, and your best pair of jeans) and rush out the door, grabbing your keys and wallet along the way. You hurry out to your car, which you quickly start and drive to Alexis' house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter her room, you see that she has already picked out a few outfits for you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to wear her insanely beautiful prom dress, since most people had seen it before and because it was so unique that everyone would recognize you. Alexis hands you her biggest pair of panties, which are quite tight, but you want to go all the way with this. She also hands you one of her bras, along with a set of fake boobs to stuff it with. You go into the bath room and change into her lingerie while she changes into your clothes. When you come back out, she helps you with the dress. She also gives you the shoes she wore to with the dress, 3\" red pumps. You just manage to stuff your feet into the shoes. As you look in the mirror, you see that the fake breasts do a very good job of imitating her very real breasts, but everything else just looks kind of weird. She then hands you a wig that perfectly matches her gorgeous blonde hair color and style in a way she would wear it to a party, which you promptly put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish dressing, you stand up and realize how difficult it is to walk in pumps. Alexis, of course, has no problem with your black loafers. She also stuffs her hair into a skin-colored rubber cap, which she covers up with hair that matches yours. You head out to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the door, you are greeted by Jamie, who is dressed in an amazingly sexy cheerleader outfit, which she tells you was bought from NBC. Apparently it was the outfit used by Hayden Panettiere in her cheerleaders scenes. She tells you that her birthday was just a week ago, and that she asked for this specifically to be her one present this year (her parents are head doctors at the two local hospitals, so they have plenty of money, even if they're house/cars don't say so). She tells you that both of your costumes are quite amazing, possibly the best she's seen all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to mingle with the other guests, your attention is turned to Jamie who is standing in the middle of the room. She announces that the final two guests just arrived (you and Alexis) and that the first activity of the night will now begin. After she finishes her announcement, she mutters something that sounds a lot like gibberish to you. Although it seems to be nonsense, the words still seem to be quite powerful. As soon as she finishes this, your vision blurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your vision returns to normal, you look to see none other than Hayden Panettiere standing in the middle of the room clad in her old sexy cheerleader uniform. Looking around, you see a familiar face looking at you. As you stare you realize that the face is yours. Suddenly, you realize several things: you have shrunk down to 5' 4\", your costume is fitting like it was fitted specifically for you, even your shoes, and your 'fake' breasts are feeling quite a bit heavier than they used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look in a mirror, you gasp in Alexis' voice and immediately grab your (Alexis') hand and the two of you walk over to Hayden, who you assume is really Jamie, and demand an explanation. She tells you, in Hayden's amazingly seductive voice, that her parents hired a wizard who told her a spell to change people into what they dress as. Quite obviously, it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Wanting to show some privacy for Alexis, you decide to take Steve into the bathroom. As you shut the door, he grabs your boobs and you fall over due to the unexpected amount of pure pleasure. However, you quickly regain control and demand that s/he strips down completely as you do the same. Once you have traded clothes, your vision blurs once again. When in clears, you see Alexis standing in front of you with a disgusted look on her face. Apparently s/he remembers the boob grabbing. You look in the mirror and confirm that you are indeed the sexy porn star. You also notice that your breasts are much heavier (which means that they're much bigger too). As you look back to Alexis, your pants get wet and you feel a sudden urge to grab her boobs, which you do, causing her to fall over out of pleasure. You then leave the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return, you find you nipples erect and your pants even wetter as you see your porn star counterpart Morgan, the playboy bunny twins Jeff and Robert, and finally Hayden, in your mind the sexiest of the bunch. She notices you staring at her and demands that you return to your spot in the circle. Steve, as Alexis, follows you out the door and sits in his/her old spot next to Morgan, who instantly drapes her arms around him/her and chewing his/her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp next is Alexis, still in your body.

However, your lesbian mind doesn't spend much time on this. As soon as she completely dons Morgan's costume, the changes into a sex goddess, which instantly turns you on more than anything else so far. Seeing this, she immediately comes and sits next to you and you two make out passionately, tongues darting in and out of each others mouths. Meanwhile, Morgan seems glad to finally be rid of her lesbian thoughts, although she doesn't seem to thrilled about the penis between her legs or the testosterone running through her blood, causing her to still like girls.</span></div></div>",

No matter how many times we tell her the right size, she always gets it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis went to the bathroom while Mark changed into the jeans. They were a tight fit, but he managed to get into them. When Alexis came back, she was wearing the clothes Mark had brought. She eyed him up and down, then handed him something, and said, \"Take off your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Mark. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a corset\", she said. \"It'll help give you a more girlish figure. I borrowed it from my Mom. She's kind of amused by this whole idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis helped Mark put the corset on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to breathe in this thing\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is\", said Alexis,\"That's why Victorian women were always fainting. their corsets cut their air off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped Mark put one of her loosest sweatshirts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\", she said. \"Needs a little work. How do you think <b>I</b>look? Am I a convincing boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I tell you what\", said Alexis, \"Let's not do this half-heartedly. Let's do a little shopping, We've got plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them changed into their regular clothes, and went to the mall.  An hour later, they returned to Alexis' home.  Alexis took some of the purchases and left the room. She returned  about half an hour later, in full costume. Mark was impressed. He could still tell it was her, but she looked a lot more \"boyish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had my Mom help me bind my breasts with some bandages\", she explained. \"You'll suffer with the corset, I'll suffer with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was gathered up under a baseball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about dyeing it, she explained, \"But my hair color isn't <i>that</i> different than yours. Mom did a little make-up on me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had what looked  a bit like five-o'-clock shadow, so long as you didn't look at it too closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you taller?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lifts in my shoes\", explained Alexis. \"Anyway, let's get to work on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had him put the jeans back on, along with some frilly blue socks, and a cheap pair of mary-janes they'd bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least with those jeans on\", she said, \"you won't have to shave your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he put the corset back on, and a bra they'd procured. Alexis stuffed it with tissue paper until she was satisfied. Over this, he put on a sky-blue blouse they'd found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the sort of thing that I'd wear, it's just in your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis put some fake fingernails on him, and then carefully polished them in her favorite color. She's had him shave earlier, so she set about making him up, and putting false eyelashes on him. Then she put a wig they'd bought on him, and fussed with it a bit  She put a multi-colored silk scarf on him to cover up his Adam's apple, and topped it off with the bomber jacket that she'd \"liberated\" from her brother, which she wore everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad job, if I say so myself\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at himself in the mirror.   Alexis <i>had</i> done a good job. No one would mistake him for her, but if she'd had a cross-dressing big brother, he might have looked like a bit like Mark did right now.  Alexis, on the other hand. still managed to look as cute as a button, even dressed as Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a deep breath, and showed themselves to Alexis' mom, who laughed and took a picture to send to Mark's mom. She and Alexis gave Mark a few pointer on how to move like a girl, and he and Alexis practiced doing each other's voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time to go to the party, which was being thrown by their friend Jamie. Alexis' mom drove them to Jamie's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, kids\", she said. \"I'll be back to pick you up around. Be good, and have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alexis left the car, and walked up to the front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin was colored dark red, and her eyes were bright yellow. Shiny black horns projected from her forehead, and her teeth came to sharp points.  She was wearing an elegant black dress, and her feet seemed to have been replaced by shiny black hooves. A tail with a pointed barb on the end projected through a hole in the back of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, she looks amazing</i>, thought Mark.  There was an unspoken that guests made their own costumes for these parties, and did not use professionally-made  outfits.  Jamie was pretty amazing, but Mark had to wonder if she has really made her costume and done her make-up herself. Still, she was the hostess, it wouldn't  be polite to call attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she saw them, and said, \"Ha-ha-ha, awesome! Why, if it isn't Mark Johnson and Alexis D'Arcy! Or is it 'Marcia D'Arcy' and 'Alexander Johnson'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed them in a three-way hug and kissed them both on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <b>so</b> glad that you both came! Come on in and join the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ushered them in, and pointed out two figures standing to one side. \"Allow me to introduce you to our chaperones\", she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chaperones in question were two teachers from their school, a man and a woman.  The party wasn't an official school function, but since the guests were all students from their school, Jamie had persuaded two staff members to come .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was Maria Ferzoco,  the world history teacher. She was a pretty, dark-haired woman in her late twenties, who was generally known as one of the \"fun\" teachers, sympathetic to the students and with a good sense of humor. She was dressed as an ancient Egyptian queen, with a long flowing robe and an ornate headdress. Her costume was decorated with the astrological symbols for the various planets, as well as the symbols of various nations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other teacher was Matthew O'Donnell, the chemistry teacher. He was a sandy-haired fellow in his forties who known for being a quiet man who seldom missed anything that was happening. He was dressed as a grandfather clock, with his face painted yellow and the numbers written in a circle. Clock hands were gummed below his nose like a lopsided mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie bowed and said, \"Please say hello to the Pharaoh of the Solar System and Grandfather Clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Pharaoh of the Solar System'?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as well dream big\", smiled Ms. Ferzoco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Grandfather Clock'?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"A character from <i>Captain Kangaroo</i>, a show I used to watch when I was a kid\", explained Mr. O'Donnell.  Mark and Alexis made small talk with the two teachers for a few minutes, and then...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took them a second to figure out who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cal\", said Mark, \"How you doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal was a slim, quiet boy who was the son of the local Baptist pastor, and the star of the school's gymnastics team.  Mark didn't know him well, but stopped to chat with him briefly.  It was kind of a surprise that his parents let him out of the house like that, they were fairly conservative. It wouldn't have surprised Mark if Cal had change dinto his costume rafter he left home, but it wasn't his business to worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering near a long table of snacks were what looked like the ghost of Pikachu, an evil black doll, a ghost-woman and a ghost tree.  The ghost Pikachu  looked up and emitted a horsey laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mark, lookin' good!\", it said. Mark recognized the voice of Jimmy Davis, which meant that the other three were almost certainly  his inseparable pals, Paul McArdle, Andy Young and Joey Dubois.  They were affable fanboys who were experts on the obscure corners of popular culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jimmy, who are you guys supposed to be?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're each our favorite Ghost Type Pok\u00e9mon\", said Jimmy. \"Mmikyu\" (himself), \"Banette\" (Paul), \"Froslass\" (Andy), \"and Trevenant\". (Joey)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, you guys\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they saw what looked like two girls talking to each other.  One was wearing a long, tattered gown, a battered-looking ice hockey goalie's mask and a crown of flowers.  Her skin was made up to look grey and corpse-like, and she was wearing a straggly blonde wig.  The other was wearing a pink gown with various gears and tube attached, all painted a metallic pink. She wore a flowing blonde wig, a small crown and a red eyepiece over her left eye.  Her skin was made up to look chalk-white. Mark thought that the overall effect was to make her look like Princess Peach, if she was assimilated by the Borg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo, laaadies\", said Alexis, doing her best \"Mr. Smooth\" voice, and leering comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys\", said the masked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, is that you?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", the girl said.  Mark realized that the masked girl was Anne Ogawa, a friend of Alexis' who was in the Literature Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you supposed to be, Anne?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ophelia Voorhees!\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia from <i>Hamlet</i> crossed with Jason Voorhees from the <i>Friday the 13th</i>  movies.  Both characters drowned, so I figured that was a nice thematic connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you, Annie, only you\", replied Mark.  \"And who's your charming friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Prunuspersica of Borg\", the other girl answered. It was then that Mark realized that Anne's friend wasn't a girl at all, but was Bobby Dalton, another member of the Lit Club.  Bobby always did drag for costume parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Prunuspersica'?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Latin name for the peach tree\", explained Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they saw four people chatting together.  Two were obviously dressed as Link and Zelda from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.  They took only a minute to recognize \"Link\" as Jenny Swenson and \"Zelda\" as Anita Crawford, tow girls who were fast friends. You never saw one without the other, to the point where there was speculation that they were a couple and not just \"friends\". Neither Mark nor Alexis knew or cared particularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Alexis looked at the other two girls. One was wearing what looked a bit like a black bondage outfit that emphasized her cleavage, a long purple wig and a metal crown.  She was carrying a plastic axe and a hardcover book.  Mark recognized her as Paula Ortiz, another of the school's star athletes. Mark gaped at her chest. Paul was fairly stodgy - maybe even a little bit stodgy - so she almost never dressed up \"sexy\".  Mark recognized the other \"girl\" as Paula's brother, Benny, who was also an accomplished athlete. He was wearing a white and red outfit that was as \"sexy\" as his sister's. His hair was dyed bright red, and he carried a toy spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Alexis. \"I never thought I'd see you dressed like that, Paula.  Who are you supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Princess Camilla and Princess Hinoka from <i>Fire Emblem Fates</i>\", said Paula.  \"Benny dared me to dress as Camilla, but I said I'd only do it if he came as Hinoka. He double-crossed me by agreeing to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others got a good laugh out of this. They chatted for a while, and then Mark and Alexis mingled some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they encountered a three-headed golden dragon. Three gold-painted faces poked out from the dragon's chest, and there were holes which six hands poked out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the Three D's\", said Alexis.  The Three D's was the Chang triplets, Deborah, Diana and Danielle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you three supposed to be?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Ghidorah, from the Godzilla movies\", they replied, all speaking at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty impressive\", said Mark, \"But aren't you three kind of stuck with each other in that outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\", said Danielle, who was in the middle. \"If you look between the costume's 'necks', there are clasps that we can undo, if one of us needs to go do something by herself, or if we just get sick of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a laugh at this, and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they saw Bill Hanson and Phoebe Wepner. These two <i>were</i> a couple, and were sneaking a kiss.  Bill was dressed as the Thirteenth Doctor from <i>Doctor Who</i>.  Phoebe wore a floor-length red skirt studded with golden globes and a black border at the bottom. She wore arm-length golden gloves, and a head-piece designed to look like the top of a Dalek, her eyes covered by mirror sunglasses,  She carried two wands, one made up to look like a Dalek gunstick, and the other a Dalek sucker arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never thought I'd see the Doctor kissing a Dalek\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked up  sheepishly and said in his best \"Jodie Whittaker\" voice, \"Well, Chibnall's taking the show in a new direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, Pheebs, the Dalek Princess?\", asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalek <i>Empress</i>, please\", smiled Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are Steve and Morgan here?\", asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're over there\", said Bill. pointing to where Steve Peters and Morgan Francis, Mark and Alexis' two best friends, were helping themselves to a snack.  Mark smiled. Steve and Morgan were dressed as Winged Monkeys from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe you should stick with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends chatted amiably for a while.  There was music playing, and when a slow dance came on, Alexis grabbed Mark's arm, and said, \"Come on, babe, let's dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him out on to the area that had been set aside as a dance floor, and took him in her arms, and the two began slow dancing, Mark having to remember to let Alexis lead. He rested his head on her chest, and inhaled the cologne she had put on.  It was only they'd been dancing a few minutes that something occurred to him: Even with the lifts in her shoes, she shouldn't have been so much taller than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have noticed something in his expression, because she frowned at him and said, \"Something wrong, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'd swear you're taller than you should be\", Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious\", said Mark.  \"Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at arm's length from her, and she looked at him, dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny, but it almost looks like you're right. But, no, that's crazy. It must be these lifts. Come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him over to a couch, where she sat down and made him sit next to her. \"I'll  show you\", she said, pulling off her shoes and socks.  She looked up and saw Cal walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Batgirl\", she said, \"Come over here a minute, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK', said Cal. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need your help judging something\", said Alexis. \"OK, Mark stand up straight.\" Mark obeyed, and Alexis stood up straight  in her bare feet, back-to-back with Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Batgirl\", Alexis said,\"Which of us is taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal looked closely, and a mystified look crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", he said. \"Very interesting. Alexis, you've got a good three inches on Mark. Funny, I would  sworn Mark was taller than you. What do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\" said Alexis. \"You're not messing with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not messing with you\", said Cal. \"But let's get a second opinion. Paula, could you come here a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula, who happened to be passing  by, came over in answer to Cal's summons.  To Mark's eyes, she looked taller, too, Her boobs looked bigger, as well. She'd always had a smallish rack, but now her chest seemed to be bursting out of her outfit.  She looked a good deal more like Princess Camilla  of Nohr than she had before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Cal?\", asked Anita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's taller here, 'Marcia' or 'Alex'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita took a careful look, and said, \"Alex, definitely, by a few inches. How about that? Hey, come on, Cal, let's go to the game room, and play some table tennis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Cal, and the two walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy\", said Alexis, pulling her shoes and socks on, taking the lifts out of the shoes, first.  \"I <i>know</i> you're taller than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anita seemed to be taller, too\", said Mark. \"And her boobs seem to have blown up like balloons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you young hussy\" said Alexis in mock anger.  \"Don't. Be. Checking. Out. Other. Girl's.Boobs.P, she said, punctuating each word by repeatedly poking Mark's left \"breast\" with her right forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\", he said.  \"I...I...I felt that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly, Mark\", said Alexis. \"They aren't real\", she continued, squeezing his 'boobs'  with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww!\" repeated Mark, trying not to yell. \"I'm telling you that <i>hurt</i>!\"  He patted at his chest, gingerly.  \"This is crazy\", said Alexis.  \"I must've just hurt your real chest by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure feels real.\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go check it out\", said Alexis. Making sure the teachers weren't watching, she  led him to  an empty room that turned out to be a bedroom that happened to have a full-length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, show me\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took off the jacket and shirt, and then undid the bra, revealing an impressive rack. He stared at them in shock, poking at them gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis gaped at him open-mouthed.  \"Those aren't just <i>any</i> boobs, those are <i>my</i> boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my own boobs when I see them, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at himself in the mirror. It seemed to him that his face looked a little different, more feminine, more like Alexis'. In the meantime, Alexis had pulled off her shirt, and bandaged that were binding them.  Sure enough, her chest was as flat and hairy as Mark's had been previously.  She looked at herself in wonder, and then, coming up behind Mark, cupped his breasts in her hands and began jiggling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, these are fun to play with\", she said. \"No wonder guys go so crazy over them.\" She began lightly nibbling Mark's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe we're hallucinating, maybe someone drugged us?  My grandmother's brother was at Woodstock, and he saw some some pretty wild stuff after someone dosed him with some acid. Geez, Grandma almost killed him when she found out he told me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, cutie\", said Alexis. \"I can't believe anyone  of our friends would have dosed us with anything like that.  Plus, I don't know when they could have done it - we haven't eaten a or drank anything since we got here.  Besides, while I wish I could believe this wasn't real, it didn't feel like an illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is real, what could do this?\", asked Mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea\", said Alexis, \"But I'll find out if I can.  I suppose we better get dressed again, but before we do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis spun Mark around do they were face-to-face, and then grabbed him in a fierce embrace, pressing her  bare torso against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this feels sooo good\", she said. She pressed her mouth over his , and he felt her tongue meet his. After a long kiss, she pulled away. She swiveled her hips a little, and smirked. \"I guess you're still male down <i>there</i> For now, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was breathing heavily, and felt ready to faint. \"Alex...hannhhh..i-if w-we're g-g-g-going to figure out what's happening to us, we better get dressed and start looking.   If we keep this up, one of us is going to end up pregnant, and I'm not sure <i>which</i>, anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis laughed, and released him. \"Alright, sweetie, but sometime...real...soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed back. \"It's a promise, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got dressed again. They didn't bother with the corset and bandages, instead rolling them up as small as possible, and sticking them in the pockets of Mark's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they finished getting dressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least you were used to being a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are\", said Bill, speaking with Jodie Whittaker's Yorkshire accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups began to chatter excitedly, comparing notes on what was happening to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex spoke to Anne. \"Does it - if you don't mind me asking - does it hurt, Annie? Sorry, that's tacky, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK\", said Anne, \"It doesn't hurt. there's no pain. I just feel so...cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia spoke with Cal and the Ortiz siblings.  \"I have to say, 'Hinoka', you make a pretty cute girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back atcha, Marcia\", said Benny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me?\", said Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were <i>already</i> a cute girl, 'Camilla'\", said Marcia. Marcia turned and looked at Cal. Sorry, 'Batgirl', didn't mean to leave you out of this 'lovefest'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me 'Barbara'\", said Cal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Barbara\", said Marcia, remembering that \"Barbara Gordon\" was Batgirl's secret identity.  \"I have to say, you seem to be the least freaked out of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal/Barbara smiled, and said, \"Well, this is something I've never discussed with anyone, but I suppose there's no harm in talking about it now.  I'm, well, I'm a trans girl. I realized it years ago, but I also realized pretty early on that I could never tell anyone, you know what my family's like.  My whole life, I could never be my real self.  I hoped that maybe some day I could transition properly, but that seemed so far away.  I can't imagine what this has been like for the rest of you, but for me, it's been like suddenly becoming the me I've always dreamed of being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Camilla/Paula, \"I never knew you were going through that. I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Alex spoke up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, maybe we better get moving, we still need to find the Changs. Say, where did Phoebe and Bill go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw them go back around the corner\", said Marcia. \"I'll go get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back around the corner, Marcia heard Bill and Phoebe talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I could try to induce a regeneration\", said Bill, \"And try for a male form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do not do that\", said Phoebe. \"I will admit that the thought of you as a woman was a shock at first, but I realize now that I love <i>you</i>, no matter what form you wear. I mean, if you can love me, even though I look like<i>this</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can\", said Bill.  Marcia turned the corner just in time to see Bill kissing Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Doctor kissing a Dalek</i>, she thought <i>It's like the worst slash fic ever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \"Um, sorry to disturb you, ladies, but we really ought to move along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill and Phoebe looked up, sheepishly, and rejoined their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they...</span></div></div>",

The armholes on their costume were gone, and the golden scales that had been painted on were real.  Instead of six legs there were now only two heavyset legs carrying them along. Weirdest of all, their faces seemed to be sinking into the costumes, with only their mouths and eyes visible.  The costumes seemed to be larger, too, as the serpentine heads on the costume's three necks were now brushing against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, you've got to help us!\", the three D's said in tandem.  \"We can't feel our arms anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Danielle, alone, \"and my sisters can't feel their legs anymore,  and my legs feel all heavy!  Can you help us get out of this outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia looked at the girls' costumes. The clasps she had seen earlier were gone.  Alex, Phoebe and Camilla/Paula went over to explain the situation to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we're turning into a monster?\", they cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, darlings\", said Camilla, \"But unless we can figure out a way to undo this, we may all be stuck this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meanwhile\", said Alex, \"You're probably going to get a lot bigger.  It might be best to get you out of this house before you bring it all down on our heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, destroying this house sounds pretty good to us, but alright\", they replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along the three sisters' heads continued to sink into their costume until they vanished entirely. At that moments, the costume heads began moving on top of their long necks, emitting high-pitched, ululating whispery wails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls\", said The Doctor/Bill, nervously.  \"Are you still, well, 'you', in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three heads looked at her. One nodded an affirmative, one shook negatively, and the third made a noncommittal gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said the Doctor.  \"Phoebe, darling, could you scan these rooms and see if one of them has a pen and paper in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I obey\", said Phoebe. The first room she scanned seemed to be an office, and she returned with a large pad of paper and a large novelty pencil.  \"Have you noticed that these rooms seem to have whatever we need in themmmm?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor held out the pencil to  the \"Ghidorah sisters\", who took it in their central mouth. and wrote on the paper that the Doctor was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"STILL US, BUT NOT.  HARD TO EXPLAIN. THOUGHTS BLENDING IN TO EACH OTHER.  STILL THREE, BUT ONE ALSO.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand\", said the Doctor.  \"Still, we do need to get you outside quickly.  Coincidentally - or perhaps not - I think this is an outside door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opened the door, and then stepped outside.  \"Yes, there's a sort of patio out here\", she said. \"The doorway's too small for the Misses Ghidorah, here, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhidorah made a shooing motion with their right head. The Doctor suddenly realized what they were planning, and said. \"Everyone get out, and then keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others rushed out of the house, and ran as far as they could into the surprisingly spacious back yard. When they were in the clear, Ghidorah's heads shot what looked like lightning bolts into the wall, blasting a hole big enough for them to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Alex, \"I want to see her explain that to Jamie's parents. Actually, it occurs to me that I've known Jamie for years, and I've never met her parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I, come to think of it\", said Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's missing?\", said Link/Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought about it, and said, Steve, Morgan, Bobby Dalton, and the two teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go look for them?\", asked \"Link\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we should go for help?\", asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bobby Dalton - now completely transformed into Princess Peach (if she was the Borg Queen) - came out next, pushing a two-wheeler on which Mr. O' Donnell (now full changed into Grandfather Clock) was resting.  Steve and Morgan, now completely changed into winged monkeys, came out next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her two best friends turned into animals affected Marcia more than anything else she had seen so far.  She ran over to them. and embraced  them.. They hooted  softly at her, and she began to cry as she realized that she might never be able to speak to her friends again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Camilla walked over to Phoebe and Prunuspersica/Bobby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you found everyone except Ms. Ferzoco\", he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's coming\", said Phoebe. \"Wait until you see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she spoke, they saw a blue glow coming from the house.  Ms. Ferzoco came out, floating a few inches above the ground.  They saw that she was the source of the glow, as she was surrounded by an azure aura, matched by the glow coming from her eyes.  The assembled group gasped at the sight of her.  She was still recognizably herself - but a glorified version of herself. Just looking at her made them want to pledge eternal loyalty and obedience to her - she looked like someone born to be the queen of the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saw them all gaping at them open-mouthed. \"Snap out of it, people, it's still me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, ma'am\",  the ones still capable of human speech said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone here?\", asked Maria.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone except Jamie\", said Camilla. \"Should we go look for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

S/he and Maria began herding people and animals into the time machine.  \u201cSome of you carry Mr. O\u2019Donnell in.\u201d  Alex and Jenny raced to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the Changs?\u201d, said Anita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, said Bill.  \u201cI have an idea.  Girls, stand still!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill raced over to the control console and began working the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m reconfiguring the ship\u2019s internal architecture to create a space big enough to fit the Changs and then I\u2019m going to materialize the TARDIS around them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know how to do that?\u201d, asked Cal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just do\u201d, said Bill.   There was a wheezing, groaning sound, and then Bill said, \u201cI think that\u2019s done it. Let me see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS/he activated a viewscreen which showed \u201cQueen Ghidorah\u201d resting in a vast storage space.  Bill spoke into an intercom: \u201cSorry, girls, I\u2019ll get you out of there as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill dematerialized the TARDIS once more.  When it stopped, Anne said, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a remote section of the Yukon\u201d, said Bill.  S/he addressed the Changs again, \u201cGirls, I\u2019m going to let you outside, then we can come out and talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey understand you?\u201d, asked Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI speak kaiju\u201d, said Bill, guiding them out of the TARDIS.  \u201cI suggest we leave your steeds inside for now. We may not want to stay here long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing Jenny, Paula and Benny a paddock in the TARDIS where they could house their steeds, Bill led them all outside where Queen Ghidorah stood waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, we might not be noticed here\u201d, said Alex, \u201cbut someone\u2019s bound to notice Their Majesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do something about that\u201d, said Maria.  She spoke a few words in an unfamiliar language. \u201cI\u2019ve cast a spell of invisibility around us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do magic?\u201d, asked Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cThis character I dressed up as, the Pharaoh of the Solar System, was one I made up as a kid.  She was a powerful sorceress who was in charge of everything. A bit of a Mary Sue, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a sorceress now, does that mean you can turn us back to normal?\u201d, asked Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cI can try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria tried several times, but without luck.  \u201cI was afraid of this\u201d, she said.  \u201cI had a feeling that however powerful I am now, Jamie wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and probably couldn\u2019t \u2013 make me more powerful then she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what can we do?\u201d, asked Anne.  \u201cI\u2019m not wild about being an undead princess for the rest of my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what if they send the cops \u2013 or the army- after us?\u201d, asked Anita. \u201cHow are we supposed to go back to our lives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s think about this\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to be able to go back to \u2018normal\u2019 lives.  Maybe some of us can go back to something like normal, but you\u2019d best steel yourselves for the probability that your lives as you knew them are over.  As for the authorities, it occurs to me that we have a certain amount of leverage.  Between us \u2013 if we stick together, we represent a vast amount of power. I think I can \u2018persuade\u2019 the government to leave us in peace if we leave them in peace. Will you all trust me to speak for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked it over, but eventually, Marcia, Alexander, Matthew, Cal, Anne, Bobby, Jenny, Anita, Paula, Benny, Bill and Phoebe gave their assent. Maria turned to the four Pok\u00e9mon and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys have been quiet, what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, Paul, Joey and Andy looked at her amiably but uncomprehendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyu?\u201d, said Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria moved over and looked at them worriedly.  \u201cDo you guys understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure they do\u201d, said Bill.  \u201cI\u2019m not getting any vibe of intelligence off of them. No sense of their old personalities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean they\u2019re animals now?\u201d, said Marcia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks that way\u201d, said Maria.  \u201cIntelligent animals, maybe, but not human-level intelligence. I get that vibe off the Changs, but not these guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, where are Steve and Morgan?\u201d, asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked around, until finally Anne said, \u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Have you found them? Are they OK?\u201d, asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re, um\u2026th-they\u2019re\u2026uh\u2026mating\u2026\u201d, said Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the others say that the two winged monkeys were locked in an intimate embrace.  Bill and Maria soon determined that they, like the four Pok\u00e9mon, no longer retained any aspect of their human personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sat and chatted until the next morning, when Bill brought out breakfast from the TARDIS for those who wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, the President should be in his office by now\u201d, said Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to fly you there?\u201d, asked Bill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can get there on my own\u201d, said Maria, who then vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria reappeared in the Oval Office, using a spell to temporarily freeze the President\u2019s aides and bodyguards to silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. President, I\u2019ve come to speak to you about the unusual situation that occurred in the town of North Rafflesia last night. I take it you\u2019ve been informed about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Maria was growing increasingly angry and frustrated. The President was insisting that all of the transformed people should surrender themselves to the government. Every time she tried to speak, he interrupted her. Finally, she\u2019d had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP INTERRUPTING ME!\u201d, she said, unconsciously unleashing a wave of magical energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the President\u2019s face went slack. \u201cYes, Mistress\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, Maria realized that she had accidentally enthralled the President.  Well, maybe not that accidentally.  Still, it would be easy to have the President as a thrall.  Thinking of the future, she put a hex on the Oval Office so that any future Presidents would automatically become her thralls, too.  For now, she enthralled the President\u2019s aides and bodyguards, and then stuck around for a Cabinet meeting, so she could enthrall them, too.  Leaving them with commands to allow the transformees to live their lives in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was at it, she flew home to North Rafflesia and enthralled the mayor and the town council.  Deciding she\u2019d done enough for now, Maria returned to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were starting to wonder where you were\u201d, said Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, said Maria. \u201cIt took a little longer than I expected.  I\u2019ve made arrangements so that those of you who can go home and who want to go home can do so in peace.  I\u2019m going to be creating a special \u2018head quarters\u2019 for myself in the Rocky Mountains. Those of you who can\u2019t go home, or who find yourself \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 at home will be welcome there.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Among these were Marcia Johnson and Alexander D\u2019Arcy, who had been Mark Johnson and Alexis D\u2019Arcy before they effectively swapped bodies.  <br>\r\nMaria went with them to explain to their parents what had happened and to help the Johnsons accept that they now had a new daughter and the D\u2019Arcys that they had a new son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first things Marcia did when she got home was to pack up all of \u2018Mark\u2019s\u2019 clothes and beings them over to the D\u2019Arcy home.  They\u2019d be no use to her and would now fit Alexander perfectly. While she was there, Alexander gave her what had been \u201cAlexis\u2019\u201d old clothes, for similar reasons. <br>\r\nMarcia then set about living her new life.  It was odd. It certainly felt strange having a girl\u2019s body, but somehow not \u201cwrong\u201d.  She felt no trace of the dysphoria Cal \u2013 except that she was Barbara now, had to remember that - had described feeling as a trans woman. Instead, it was like moving into a new room, or wearing a new set of clothes, unfamiliar now, but which she knew she\u2019d eventually get used to.<br>\r\nPerhaps it was a side effect of Jamie\u2019s magic. If so, it was a mercy, because Marcia had so many other things to adjust to.  One thing was that all of her relationships \u2013 inside her family and outside \u2013 had to be severely \u201creadjusted\u201d.  Her parents and younger sister adjusted reasonably well, all things considered, realizing and more or less accepting that Marcia was the same person they had known as \u201cMark\u201d.<br>\r\nExtended family members, neighbors and friends often had more difficulty. Everyone had heard what had happened \u2013 or at least a version of it \u2013 but not everyone believed it.  Some people even thought that the Johnsons and the D\u2019Arcys had traded children!<br>\r\nAs for Mark\u2019s and Alexis\u2019 friends \u2013 some of them expected Marcia to be Alexis and Alexis to be Marcia. Fortunately, you had each other \u2013 although they each had to admit that it was a bit weird kissing someone who had their old face!  Each of them helped the other as Alexander learned how to be a boy and Marcia learned how to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had ensured that the government provided free counseling to all the transformed people, and Marcia had taken advantage of it.  She was still coping with living her new life when she encountered one of the delayed \u201csurprises\u201d  that Jamie had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had to deal with being somewhat famous. It wasn\u2019t too bad. While their transformations had been drastic enough, some of the others had been changed even more drastically, and so they didn\u2019t get as much attention as some of the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One Saturday morning about a month after her transformation, Marcia was showering, thinking as she frequently did about how often Mark had fantasized about seeing Alexis\u2019 body naked and wet.  He\u2019d never guessed that he\u2019d end up wearing her body and seeing naked and wet every day!  This led to her wondering if Alexander felt the same way. This in turn led to her imagining Alexander naked and wet, which led to her getting a little worked up. The fact that she was getting worked up over her old body weirded her out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was through showering, she went to her room to begin getting dressed. She was joined by her little sister, Elizabeth, who would often come to visit her first thing in the morning and chat, often offering advice about how Marcia should wear her hair, some of it even useful. Elizabeth was an early riser, and even on a Saturday had been up for hours.<br>\r\nElizabeth was thirteen years old and would be starting eighth grade in the fall.  She was short (4\u20198\u201d) and flat-chested and somewhat insecure about her looks. Marcia thought this was a shame, because it was obvious to her that her little sister would be quite pretty in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcia dressed, Elizabeth looked at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not fair?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that my brother ended up being cuter than me! I wish I was as pretty as you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Liz, just give it time!\u201d, said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say!\u201d, said Elizabeth. \u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I feel weird\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d, asked Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy clothes feel so tight\u201d, said Elizabeth.  \u201cI\u2026um\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcia watched, her sister started to grow. She got taller and her figure began to rapidly develop, her virtually nonexistent breasts swelling so quickly that they demolished the training bra that she had worn more out of hope than necessity. Her shirt buttons all burst and her jeans split up the back. Her face began to change as well, becoming one that was all too familiar to Marcia \u2013 it was her own!  When the transformation was complete, Elizabeth had become Marcia\u2019s physical twin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth noticed Marcia staring at her.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d then, beginning to notice the changes in her body. \u201cWhat happened to me? Why does my voice sound so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Marcia guided Elizabeth over to her mirror. Liz gasped at what she saw. \u201cI-I\u2019m you! How? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of those little \u2018surprises\u2019 Jamie talked about\u201d, said Marcia.  \u201cYou wished you were as pretty as I am. Well, now you\u2019re exactly as pretty as I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my God\u201d, said Elizabeth, running her hands over her new body. \u201cI wanted to be pretty like you are, I didn\u2019t want to be your twin!  What am I gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first thing, let\u2019s get you into some of my clothes, and then we\u2019d better go tell Mom and Dad.\u201d Marcia sighed, \u201cAs if my life wasn\u2019t weird enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Marcia had to get used to having a twin little sister. <i>It was a shame</i>, she thought.  <i>Liz should have had a chance to grow up and become who she\u2019d been meant to be. Of course, I suppose I did, too, Damn it, Jamie, why did you have to do this to us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only positive out of it was their discovery that Alexander could always tell them apart, even when they tried to fool him.  It soon became easier, as Liz quickly developed an almost manic determination to have her own \u201clook\u201d, as different from Marcia\u2019s as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had the time, Marcia took note of things going on outside her own family. From time to time, she met some of the other transformees, and learned of the \u201csurprises\u201d one or two of them had encountered, and of the \u201csurprises\u201d that had occurred to various people in town.  In particular, several people in town, apparently unconnected to one another, had transformed into Pok\u00e9mon and winged monkeys, all of whom were taken into custody by Maria, or Meryet-Ra, as she had taken to calling herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia noticed how much the authorities cooperated with the Pharaoh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I was of a suspicious nature</i>, thought Marcia, <i>I might wonder if the great Meryet-Ra had been using her magical powers to \u201cgrease the wheels\u201d, so to speak. Well, nothing I can do about it even if she is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, three months after her transformation, Marcia received an unexpected invitation\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, I'll be leaving soon, and then I'll re-write your world.  The memories of your re-written lives will start filtering into your heads gradually over the next day or so.

I asked my parents if I could keep you all as souvenirs, but they said I could only keep two of  you, so I decided to keep Steve and Morgan. Come up here, you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Morgan obediently flew up and landed on Jamie's outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You - you can't keep people as souvenirs!\", said Marcia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can\", said Jamie.  \"Don't worry, though, I'll take good care of them, heck, I'll probably make them immortal. They'll certainly have longer, happier lives with me than they would have had here.  Actually, I think I'll breed them. I know a number of my friends back home, who'd love to have one of these as a pet. <br>\r\n And in a day or two, you won't even miss them. There will still be winged monkeys here, though, so they'll sort of live on here. Anyway, gotta go now. Oops, almost forgot!  Marcia, I've got an additional 'surprise' for you! Enjoy! Bye, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie - and Steve and Morgan with her - vanished in a sphere of white light which seemed to grow larger and larger, until it engulfed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia felt herself being spun gently around, and when the light faded, she found herself....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, what am I doing here? Well, I can't stay in the shower all day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of the shower, and looked at herself.  How Mark had dreamed of seeing Alexis' body naked. he'd never expected to end up wearing it!  She had only a moment to enjoy the sight before several young women in maid's uniforms appeared as if from nowhere and began toweling her off and drying her hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia found herself being rushed into what looked like the most ornate beauty salon she'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ms. D'Arcy\", one of them said while putting a terrycloth robe on her, \"We'll have you ready in plenty of time for the ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ceremony\"?</i>, thought Marcia, <i>What \"ceremony\"?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted buy a wall-sized TV.  It showed a scene of an enormous crowd, its attention focused on a raise platform. The Pharaoh stood behind a large table, flanked by Camilla and Hinoka. To Meryet-Ra's right was Empress Phoebe, with two Daleks in gold livery behind her and the Doctor at her side, and to her left was Princess Prunuspersica of Borg, flanked by two bright pink Borg drones.   An announcer spoke in reverent tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we see the leaders of the three great powers preparing to sign the treaty of alliance which will assure peace ans stability throughout the known galaxy.  Her Divine Immortal Majesty is signing now. Standing behind her are two of favored vassals - and close friends - Princess Camilla of Nohr and Princess Hinoka of Hoshido.  The woman next to her Her Dalek Majesty, Empress Phoebe, is Her consort, the Time Lord known as the Doctor, who was instrumental in facilitating the treaty. One should also note that the female drone next to Her Collective Highness, Princess Prunuspersica of  the Mushroom Kingdom of Borg is Ms. Jennifer Alice Langmeyer, who was assimilated into the Collective in a ceremony broadcast earlier today.  Her Divine Immortal Majesty allowed the assimilation as a gesture of goodwill towards her new ally. Ms. Langmeyer was chosen by lottery from among hundreds of eager volunteers. In an interview, Ms. Langmeyer, or Three of Nine, Secondary Adjunct of Unimatrix  four Seven, as she is now known,  reports that the assimilation was painless, and that she is now operaitng at maximum efficiency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was she really a volunteer?</i>, thought Marcia. <i>Of course, Jenny did have the flaming hots for the Princess there back when she was Bobby Dalton, so I suppose it makes a sort of sense.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer continued, \"We can also see on the platform General Ophelia Voorhees, leader of Her Divine Immortal Majesty's Undead Army, and Princess Zelda of Hyrule, another favored vassal.  And, if our cameraman will pan up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameraman obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We can  see the Royal <i>Kaiju</i>, Ghidorah, here from her home on Monster Island. As is known, only her Divine Immortal Majesty can control the great <i>Kaiju</i>, another sign of her great powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Marcia watched the TV, the maids were doing her hair and nails and making her up. What were they dolling her up for? She didn't know it, but she was about to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

But before she could react any further, four maids entered the room carrying her wedding clothes and began to dress her. When they were done, she looked at herself in the mirror. She was wearing the most beautiful wedding dress she had ever seen.  <i>Damn, I look <b>gorgeous</b>!  But I'm only sixteen!  Of course, the Pharaoh can order anything she likes, I suppose. She could make me marry a Pikachu, if she wanted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids adjusted her dress, hair and make-up, and then led her into another room where her maid of honor and bridesmaids were waiting.  Her maid of honor was a gorgeous redhead in her early twenties.It took Marcia a moment to recognize her as the local librarian, Barbara Gordon, an old friend of her family who had been something of a mentor to Marcia.  Marcia was one of the privileged few who knew that Barbara was secretly the duly-deputized masked crime-fighter Batgirl.  Marcia dimly remembered that in another life, Barbara had been Cal Powell. Her bridesmaids were Anne and Zinnea Johnson, who had been Mark's thirteen and twelve year-old sisters, but were now Alex's sisters, since they had traded families -  and Kylie Davis and Angela Parker, Marcia's two best female friends. In the old life, Mark had barely known them, but Marcia found that sshe now had memories of having hung with them since they were in kindergarten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all exchanged compliments, chattering away happily, until the maids herded them out into a hallway. At the end of the hallway stood Joseph D'Arcy, who had been Alexis' father, but was now  Marcia's. He walked her through the door, which led out into a huge, crowded stadium.  Wagner's Bridal March began to play over loudspeakers. More or less in shock, Marcia walked down the aisle with her father. When they got to the stage where the Pharaoh was standing. Alex was standing there as well, looking extremely handsome in a tuxedo. Marcia recognized his best man as Joey Andrews, but wasn't sure who his groomsmen were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was even with Alex, the pair of them curtseyed/bowed deeply to the Pharaoh.  Meryet-Ra leaned down to them.  Those at home heard the announcer say, \"Look, Her Divine Immortal Majesty is bestowing a private, personal blessing on the happy couple! How fortunate they are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Pharaoh actually whispered to them was, \"Sorry, you two, this wasn't my idea. More of Jamie's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \"Arise, My children\", and commenced the wedding ceremony  It was short and simple, and ended with the Pharaoh saying, \"By the power invested in Me by My Father, Ra, I now pronounce you husband and wife. What I have joined, let no one tear asunder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex leaned down to kiss Marcia, after which the newlyweds  were led to a small room where several maids helped Marcia changed into a somewhat more manageable dress. After a short rest, they were led to a reception, where the first thing Marcia saw was....</span></div></div>",

The four Ghost Pok\u00e9mon were seated at a small table to one side where an attendant was apparently feeding them. Marcia wondered they felt about having to live the life of animals. Still, it could be worse -  Grandfather Clock was placed alongside one table so he could join in the conversation . He could no longer move or eat, but he could at least still speak.  Winged monkeys flew from table to table, serving as waitstaff.  The sight of them made her think of Steve and Morgan for a moment, but she was already finding it hard to remember their faces. She hoped that Jamie would keep her word and take good care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryet-Ra stood up as they entered, and said:  \"As Pharaoh, I claim the singular honor of being the first to introduce to you Mister and Mrs. Alexander and Marcia Johnson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newlyweds entered the room to general applause, greeting all of their guests as their wended their way to their seats at the head table. As the wedding feast commenced, Marcia looked around the room at the guests and information about their new lives filtered into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pharaoh was sitting to her left, having granted the happy couple the incomparable honor of sitting at the head of the table. The process of changing from history teacher Maria Ferzoco into the divine immortal Pharoah, Meryet-Ra, had been bizarre.  She now remembered Her childhood in Egypt some six thousand years before. As a little girl, She had been struck by a bolt from out of the sky, granting Her the vast mystical powers marking Her as the daughter/self of the sun god, Ra. Her rule had spread from Egypt all over the Earth, across the Solar System, and out into the stars themselves. To Her awed astonishment, she suddenly realized:  <i>There's only <b>one</b> religion in the world, now: Worship of <b>Me</b>!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA functionary came up to Her and discreetly whispered in Her ear, \"Divine One, which of Your harem do you wish to attend you in your bedchamber this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My \"<b>harem</b>\"?</i>, thought Meryet-Ra, momentarily stupefied, until the information.  As Pharaoh, she could claim any man or woman she wanted for her own.  Of course, as a merciful monarch, she never took anyone by force, but most were eager to serve Her in the most intimate way, as it was well known that with Her powers, intimacy with Her was a uniquely pleasurable experience.  There had been thousands in Her harem over the millennia, and She had borne numberless children, who had gone forth and multiplied so much that literally every living human was descended from Her. One of Her titles was \"All-Mother\", and it was pretty much <b>literally</b> true. As the members of Her harem aged, they were sent to a comfortable retirement. At the moment, only a handful of her active harem were with her (the rest were at her palace in the world capital of Heliopolis in Egypt)  her \"old life\" husband, George; her college boyfriend, Jack McDonough; Gracie Cortez, her best friend with whom she had \"experimented\" a few times during their college days; Phil, the older brother of her high school buddy Angela Bellucci (Maria'd had a huge crush on him but never worked up nerve to ask him out); Angela herself (Well, she'd always thought Angela was cute!); her high school boyfriend, Donny Parker; Billy Wilson (whom she and her \"BFF\" Becky Swenson had fought over in eighth grade; Becky herself (<i>OK, that's interesting</i>, she thought) and  - Oh! My! God! Adam Levine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I - I - I  I have <b>Adam Levine</b> at my beck and call! Adam Levine is one of my sex toys!</i>, She thought.(She'd had a huge crush on him when She was sixteen, and had never quite gotten over it 100%)  <i>I think that I am going to <b>like</b> being the Queen of Everything!But, as for this evening...Hmmm....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered back to the functionary: \"Have the Ladies Graciela, Angela and Rebecca attend me this evening. I feel like a \"ladies' night\". She smirked happily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Marcia....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While her memories of the old life were fading, Marcia remembered dimly that Jenny and Anita had been extremely close friends, to the point where many people had suspected that they were more than \"friends\".  Whatever the case had been, it now certainly seemed that they had a closer than \"liege/retainer\" relationship, at least by the way Link was whispering into Zelda's pointed ear, causing her to smirk and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As time passed their memories of their old lives continued to fad, until they seemed like little more than a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, things were drawing towards an end.  Meryet-Ra stood up, and began to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go on our separate ways, I would like to offer My special personal  blessing to Alexander and Marcia, and to all this company, and to all persons of good will everywhere.   As you may know, in one month's time, Alexander and Marcia will be taking up residence in My Grand Palace in Heliopolis as My newest acolytes.  I look forward to seeing them live and grow in My service. However, before then, they will be going on a lengthy honeymoon trip as My personal guests, visiting My personal residences in Hoshido, Nohr, and Tranquility Base. It is My command that you two enjoy yourselves to the fullest, because when you get to Heliopolis, you will really be put to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at this, and the newlyweds thanked Her Divine Immortal Majesty effusively. Then, after receiving extensive congratulations from all assembled, they went to change into travel clothes. After this, an attendant took them to join the others on a viewing platform outside that was high enough off the ground that it was level with the base of Ghidorah's necks. They could see that a small cabin had been harnessed to the base of the <i>kaiju</i>'s central neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said the Pharaoh, \"I wanted you to travel to your first destination in style, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Marcia said their farewells - with much weeping from both mothers, and boarded their unusual \"mount\". They had a luxurious flight - Ghidorah flew very smoothly as it took them to Hawaii, where they spent their first night together.  By the time they got into to be that evening, they had all but forgotten their previous lives. They enjoyed one another immensely, and had a good time on their honeymoon, generally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, they found themselves winging their way to Heliopolis - not that they weren't looking forward to their new lives there, but they had seen so many amazing things on their travels.  Meryet-Ra greeted them personally on their return, and they began their new work the next day, as apprentices to mentors appointed for them by the Pharaoh.  About two weeks into her new job, Marcia went into her mentor's office, and asked, \"Do you have a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mentor, Bao, a friendly Chinese woman in her early thirties, smiled affirmatively and waved Marcia to a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\", Bao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Marcia, \"I've noticed something coming up a lot lately that's probably going to affect my work performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\", asked Bao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breakfast\", said Marcia.  \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure?\", asked Bao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took two separate pregnancy tests, and they've both come out positive.  I made a medical appointment for Tuesday morning, so I also wanted to ask if I could have Tuesday morning off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course\", said Bao, \"and congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Marcia. \"I hadn't really planned on this so soon. Who could have guessed that a month of regular sex might result in a pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry\", said Bao, laughing.  \"I had my first around your age, too.

After she was done with the eye shadow, foundation, fake ear rings, and lipstick, she put a wig on your head which very closely resembled her dirty blond hair. After all of that, she stripped down to just her bra and panties, which made you blush but you hoped she didn't notice. She then pulled out a feminine sort of trench coat, which was white and pink, and looked to be silky and smooth. She made you strip down to just your underwear, and then you both stood shoulder to shoulder, kind of overlapping with her in front, and you put both of your right arms into the right sleeve, and both of your left ones into the left sleeve.

You were very aroused, being so close to her, and you wondered if she had a secret crush on you because she allowed you to be so close to her mostly naked body. At the party, you and her went to the front room, and she got everyone's attention and made some kind of toast, thanking them for showing up. She then muttered some sort of jibberish that you didn't understand and suddenly everyone blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you seemed to be by yourself in your costume. There was no one in it with you, for your arms were only one pair. However, due to the odd sensation you felt, you looked down and realized that you were a female. You looked at your hands and they were perfectly manicured. You then hear moaning right beside your head, and you look to your right and see Jamie's head. You gasp in a feminine voice that sounds just like her's, and you look a little lower and realize that her head is also on your shoulders. <br>\r\nAt first you were scared, but then you were excited to see that you were actually her twin. She was equally as enthusiastic for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you get up in unison, with your one set of legs shared between you, and walk back to the front room. <br>\r\n\"Attention everyone\" you hear your twin say \"I'm responsible for the changes.\" </span></div></div>",
