            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't believe it. You have to spend yet another summer with Aunt Fiona and Uncle Harvey. Last summer was nearly the death of you thanks to a little trip into the basement of your Aunt and Uncle's home. They told you not to go down there, that they avoided the basement because the last owner of their house had been slightly eccentric, but like any normal twelve-year-old you ignored them and went down anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in their basement you found loads of old furniture, stuff neither of them had bothered to get rid of in the three years they'd owned the house. You went down there to avoid your cousins, Barney and Dora, two of the worst human beings on the planet, at least to you. While down there you discovered an old fridge, like something out of the nineteen-fifties. You hadn't eaten anything that day except a bag of stale peanuts on the plane. Your stomach rumbling you opened the fridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were two food items you hadn't expected to find. One was an average thing that just looked to be out of place, the other was like nothing you'd ever seen before. The first was a piece of chocolate cake from a place called Effy's Bakery in a nearby town. Considering the layer of dust covering everything you were amazed that the cake still looks moist, despite the fact that it must have been sitting in that basement fridge for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other item was something that looked like peanut butter, yet had a purple color to it. Placing your finger inside you found that this purple peanut butter was just like regular peanut butter in texture, though the smell was an odd mixture of aromas you couldn't place. Your stomach growling so loud your afraid your cousins will hear it and come down, you decided that one of these items will fill you belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of indecision later you were sitting on a dusty armchair with the jar of purple goo in your hand. Cautiously you stuck you finger in again and brought out a large wad of the stuff. You sniffed it again just to make sure that it wasn't rotten or spoiled or something, and then you slowly stuck the tip of you tongue into the purple goo. To your utter amazement the stuff tasted awesome. Like a mixture of peanut butter, jelly, and chocolate. Quickly you scraped the jar clean with your finger, and found that you felt as if you'd eaten an entire meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next twenty-four or so hours of your life sucked. After a brief run in with Dora in the basement you were forced to play dolls with her, and you got your first suspicions that something was wrong with you. That night at dinner you found the table seemed to be getting bigger as you were sitting in your seat, and you were finding dozens of other things in the house, especially the people, seemed to be growing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to bed that night hoping that you were hallucinating. That maybe this feeling that you were getting smaller was just a reaction of being near Barney, who, despite being only a year older than you, was almost twice your size. You slept fitfully, waking up twice in the night covered in sweat, but somehow you managed to keep yourself calm both times and get back to sleep. That morning you groggily got out of your bed, and then were startled when the bottom of you pajamas fell to the floor, you'd become so small that they didn't fit at all any more, none of your clothes did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the shirt and jeans you'd worn the day before. It didn't take your panic stricken mind to realize that something from the day before must have caused your size problems, though it took you over fifteen minutes to realize what it must have been. You'd been so worried about the feeling of shrinking that you'd forgotten all about the purple peanut butter you'd found in that strange fridge in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a cannonball out of a cannon you raced through the house to the basement door, and as you did so you noticed that it was almost ten in the morning, you'd slept much later than usual thanks to the bad night. Still you got to the basement in record time and threw the door open to find something that chilled you to you soul. The basement, which had been like a junk heap the day before, was empty today, and the fridge with the purple peanut butter jar was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounding you searched the house until you found your Aunt by the front door. You found out two things from her. One was that you should not trust Dora. Despite the fact that you'd played dolls with her she'd still tattled on you and told her mother that you were in the basement. The second, and far more import piece of information was that the fridge and supposedly the purple peanut butter were now at the local dump, having been picked up that morning by two of you aunt and uncle's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down to kiss you on your head your aunt didn't notice that you were more than a foot shorter than you were when you'd arrived yesterday, and she rushed out he door and left to her job at a university nearby. You just stood there for a long while, staring at the door, it was when you realized that you could actually see the door knob getting higher as compared to your head that you sprang into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you tried calling a doctor, but they were quick to decide that it was a prank call and the lady at the other end hung up on you. Your next action was to try and catch a bush to you aunt's university, which proved problematic, but you did it anyway. You were lucky that there were people getting off at the university themselves, because by the time the bus had arrived at that stop you were only about six inches tall, and still shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on campus you decided to try for something closer than the administration building across the way, the place where your aunt worked, and instead rushed to the scientific research building. Inside you were nearly killed for being a mouse, and then ended up in the lab of a Doctor Abbot, a nutty professor who's attempts to help you resulted in his own shrinking, and forced you to find a route back to your aunt and uncle's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hitching a ride with a girl who lived next door you were again inside the home where your problems had started, and breathed a quick sigh of relief that Dora's cat had apparently run away for the day, or your one inch high body would have looked like a very yummy treat to her. Still you had to get someone to notice you, and then help you, and the only two available people were Dora and Barney. You were quick to decide to get Dora's attention, though ended up nearly getting squished under her shoe as she walked through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get her attention by climbing onto a makeup pencil she was using, something from her mother's makeup kit that the eleven year old girl probably shouldn't have been touching. Unfortunately for you Dora panicked at the sight of you, and decided you were a bug without a second thought. Shaking you off her pencil, caused you to fall right into a nearby sink, and then washed you down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that you found yourself in the sewers. This would have been the lowest point of an extremely low day, except for the fact that you found a ride in the form of a water beetle, and were soon soaring over the city, and in short order found the dump, and the fridge. With a kick you sent the beetle down towards the fridge, but it refused to land so you were forced to jump off its back and roll to a landing a ways away from your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief run in with a lizard that was probably only a few inches long in which you almost got up close and personal with the food chain from the wrong side, you at last got to the fridge, which had luckily lost its front door. Looking up you saw that the upper shelf did not hold the jar of purple peanut butter anymore, but it did still hold the box of chocolate cake, and you had a small glimmer of hope that maybe the two items had been in the fridge together for a reason. Such as a poison and antidote thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking your way up to the shelf you were disappointed to find the box empty of everything save a single crumb and a smear of icing, but you decided to try your theory anyway and quickly downed the last bits of cake. Feeling odd and disoriented you discovered that the cake box, which had been an enormous airplane hanger a moment ago, was now about the size of a house, and still shrinking. You were right. The cake had been the antidote to the purple peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce restored to your original height you made your way back to your aunt and uncle's house, and found Barney waiting to beat you up in the lawn. A brief confrontation left Barney with a sore wrist, and you staring at your own hands. You were faster and stronger than you'd ever been before, probably as a result of your adventure. You were also quite hungry as a result of your escapades and went inside to the fridge. Upon opening the door you got two more surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first you should have expected, after all you aunt is a bit of a pack rat and the chocolate cake still at least looked good. Siting on a plate in the back of the fridge it looked perfectly ordinary. The second was the jar of purple peanut butter, the same jar you'd licked clean the day before. You were sure it was empty when you left the basement, but when you pulled it out of your aunt's fridge, you found that the jar is almost twice as full as when you'd found it the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, and stealthily you grabbed the two items. You didn't know why, but you just couldn't stand the thought of Barney or Dora figuring out what they do, so with a thief-like grace you snuck back up to the guest room you were sleeping in, and then hid the two things in your luggage. At the time it had seemed the right thing to do, though really you wouldn't have been able to keep them hidden for the rest of the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily your parents never got to Europe. Their business trip was canceled before they even got on their flight thanks to a hostile takeover, and they came for you as quick as they could, getting you away from Dora and Barney. One the long flight home your thoughts constantly went to the plastic wrapped cake and the strange unmarked jar stuffed among you clothes. Their power was under your control then, and is now as you pull back up to the house of your aunt and uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again your parents are off to do business overseas, and you are again dumped on your closest relatives for the summer while they are away. Only this time you have two items that you have kept carefully hidden all year. Somewhere buried deep within your socks is a jar of purple peanut butter, and nearby is the piece of chocolate cake. As you lug the suitcase up the stairs to the guest room you can't help but smile. This is gonna be a fun summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking your clothes away in the dresser near your new bed you stare at the cake and jar. You have so many ideas as to what to do with them, yet you have to choose one. Somewhere below you hear the door close again as your aunt and uncle rush off to their jobs, having taken a little time off to get you at the airport. Down in the living room you can hear the TV blaring as Barney and Dora watch something loud and obnoxious, probably looking for tips on how to annoy you. Alone with those two, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

It was obvious that he would be willing to do just about anything to get on your nerves.  That gives you an idea about how to get him to eat some of the purple peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the kitchen with the purple peanut butter and try to be loud enough so that Barney and Dora will know you are there.  After you find some bread, jelly, and regular peanut butter you start to make a sandwich.  You spread the regular peanut butter on the edges of a slice of bread and spread the purple peanut butter in the center of the same slice of bread.  Then you spread the jelly on the other slice of bread and put the two slices of bread together, completing your peanut butter and jelly surprise sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and wait for the noise on the TV to die down.  When it does you pretend to start eating the sandwich while having your back to the room where Barney and Dora are watching TV.  You hear Barney come walking into the kitchen and snatch the sandwich out of your hands before you can take a bit, just as you expected.  Due to the regular peanut butter concealing the purple version, Barney does not suspect a thing.  \u201cThanks for the snack squirt,\u201d he casually says to you while taking a bit out of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it back,\u201d you pretend to whine while making a half-hearted effort to get it back.  He laughs at you while continuing to eat your little surprise.  You really do not think that your acting is that good, but Barney was never really that smart.  Barney was just the type of person that gained joy out of picking on people and you were saying what he wanted you to say while acting just like he would want you to act.  Frankly, you think he acts like an eight year old bully and it will be funny when he really is the size of an eight year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the TV start to blare up again.  Barney throws the small portion of the sandwich that is left into the trash.  \u201cThat was actually pretty good twerp.  Now you can make one for yourself,\u201d Barney says derisively as he walks back to continue watching TV.  You chuckle to yourself.  It will be nice to see what happens when his sister sees him shrinking.  You will have to keep an eye on him too, even though you do not like him he has not done anything that means he deserves death.  Depending on how small he gets, that might be a real possibility.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMmm\u2026!\u201d Dora\u2019s mouth was so full with the last bite of chocolate cake that a few precious crumbs were tumbling down her Hello Kitty! T-shirt and over the small slope of her stuffed stomach to land with other evidence of her thievery upon the lap of her white shorts, staining them with brown streaks as she picked at the bigger pieces and licked her fingers clean. Her lips were caked with splotches of chocolate frosting as she diligently went to work chewing her last mouthful before swallowing it down with her tummy visible swelling just the slightest bit. The cake was once a double-layered piece of chocolate perfection roughly twelve inches in diameter. Now, it was nothing but a pile of crumbs on an empty plate and on the not-so-empty stomach of an eleven-year old girl. Dora licked her lips clean of the frosting, using her fingers to swipe away the rest before she patted her tummy with a pleased smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the best chocolate cake I\u2019ve ever had! Thanks for saving it for me, Bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hated nickname flew right over your head because you could hardly believe your eyes. How on earth had she managed to eat the entire cake so quickly? No, better yet, why hadn\u2019t she immediately started growing after the first bite just as you had last summer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare feet dangled off her chair, her toes lightly touching upon the straps of her mother\u2019s sandals, which had likely fallen free from her feet before the start of her afternoon snack. Likely \u201cborrowed\u201d from her mother\u2019s room, they were a pair of platforms that would give their wearer an extra four inches to their overall height. Sliding forward on her seat, Dora placed her feet back into her mother\u2019s slip-ons and rose to her full stature, surprising you yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite wearing her mother\u2019s platform sandals and being only a year younger than you, Dora was still a half-a-head shorter than you. She started walking and she made all of two steps before she tripped and fell flat on her face, the sandals flying free from her feet and landing far and away from the girl whose feet were frankly still too small to keep their straps tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, knowing what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrippy Dora had nothing to do with a snotty nose or a salivating mouth. Dora earned the nickname, which was never spoken when she could hear it lest she live up to it, by the fact that she was a tremendous crybaby in every sense of the word. There they were now as she slowly sat upright with slightly skinned knees but otherwise none the worse for wear. She sniffled loudly, her eyes watering and open her mouth wide to unleash the first wave of wails\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>Grumble\u2026</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked and took a step back from your younger cousin. \u201cWhat\u2026 was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora appeared just as startled as you and her voice wavered as she spoke, \u201cI-I th-think that wa-was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i>Gurgle\u2026</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dora\u2019s turn to blink with twin tears falling down her face as she looked down at the culprit, placing a hesitant hand upon it. \u201cMy tu-tummy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another step back wondering what that meant for Dora.</span></div></div>",

The cake was supposed to make Dora grow just like it had you, maybe even give her some strangely subtle superpower too, but all that it seemed to have done was make her tummy tremble and shake like it was the epicenter of an earthquake. You took a step forward, hand outstretched to try and calm Dora down when you suddenly slipped and fell on your behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, and more than a little surprised, you shake your head and rub your sore bottom as you looked down at the cause of your stumble. A massive puddle of Dora\u2019s tears was spreading out beneath your cousin as she wailed her agony to the heavens, her legs kicking out at the air. One of her bare feet launched itself at the leg of a nearby chair and sent it flying across the room and into the wall. You gaped at your cousin in shock. Had the cake somehow given her super strength and an endless supply of tears?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026 Your eyes narrowed. No, she was getting bigger!

Dora continued to sob and complain about her stomach pains not aware that she was now over 7 feet tall sitting on the ground. Your eyes almost bug out of your head as you see her thighs swell and maker her shorts very tight, you can see her the outline of her underwear and her tummy continues to balloon slightly. Her chubby arms were getting longer and you could see her mid-drift very clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora was weeping still and it seemed bizarre that she still had not noticed what was happening. When her torso filled the t-shirt she was wearing till it looked skin-tight She opened her eyes and realized her perspective was slowly shifting upward. \"What is happening to me?\" Dora said as she looked at her lengthening fingers. It didn't take more than a moment for her to realize. \"I'm getting bigger?\" She questioned as her now skin tight shorts began to make noises of strain. She could feel her round bottom being wedgied by her panties. Dora stood up now over 10 feet tall. The sudden shift made you feel a chill down your spine. You could see her smiling now and wiping away her tears as her round belly was eye level with you. \"At this rate you really are going to be a bug!\" she said as her shorts began to tear at the seams. Her flat chest began to fill and you could see the outline of her training bra and what clearly was her now swelling nipples. Dora felt the ceiling press against the top of her head. She did nothing to stop what came next as her head began to break through the ceiling. now almost face to face with her private area you couldn't help but see her white shorts keep ripping and were shocked to see waistband of her shorts give away. Her T-shirt was barely covering her chest and her swollen tummy stuck out some. She rubbed her belly and knew the cake was far from done with what it was doing to her. Her T-shirt began to rip at the seams and in a moment Dora was 13 feet tall. Her head had gone through the ceiling and Dora giggled as her shoulders continued to add to the size of the hole.    <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou had to look up now as she kept filling the room. Her white shorts had ripped away and she was standing in a pair of light green panties with little hello-kitty heads printed on. You begin to blush when you look past her round tummy and see she is filling out her light-pink training bra. Her roughly A cup breasts had budded from her swollen nipples and you couldn't help but see the outline forming against her light-green underwear. Dora raised her arms up and began to make the hole she had created larger. Her lower body was still in the kitchen but her head was pressed against the underside of the house's roof. She felt the sting of pain as her head thumped against the hard-wood of the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Dora grunted and in a swift motion fell down on her butt. She had her legs in a V and you could see her underwear was growing with her. You were about 10 inches from her groin area and just stood shocked as her body continued to expand. Dora let out a loud wail and began to cry again not willing to ignore the thump on her head. \"That really hurt!\" She cries loudly and at her size the sound was near deafening. The windows in the kitchen began to crack from the power of Dora's voice. Dora was balling her eyes out yet again. Dora was over 20 feet tall you estimated and you could feel the warmth of her tears raining down on you. Her body was getting closer to you from your perspective as her long legs filled the kitchen and began to press against the walls. You could see dark marks on her underwear from her tears and were not sure what to do. She kept growing and crying the sound getting louder and louder as she expanded. You decided to escape while you could and left the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora's head and shoulders and broken through the roof with some strain. She was now rubbing the sore spot on the top of her head and still growing over 25 feet tall. You could see the roof was breaking away and the house was looking very damaged from the effects of Dora. She suddenly flung her right hand into the roof and let out a rage filled cry. \"Stupid house! That really hurt!\" She stood up over 30 feet tall. She kicked out and knocked over a whole wall, nearly ruining the whole house in the process. She lifted her left leg and stepped out into the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her ankles were eye level with you and when you looked up you were very worried, Dora looked angry and kicked the house again. The house was in ruins and Dora kept attacking her former home. She had punched and kicked at the hose till it was a pile of rubble. You were not sure if Barney was ok but hoped he had managed to get outside in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora put her hands on her waist and looked down proudly at her destruction. \"Stupid house hurting my head.\" She said to herself and had seemed to calm down. Dora was over 40 feet tall and still showing no signs of stopping. You look past her very large feet and as your eyes travel up her once chubby now tree-like thick legs. From your angle you couldn't avoid seeing the outline of her crotch. The massive crease in underarea of her panties was alarming to you, it was gross to see something like that especially your cousin's cameltoe, the size and continuously expanding nature of her body made you realize she could be right about you looking like a bug now. You keep looking up and could see her now B cup breasts had overfilled her light-pink training bra which had dark pink spots all over it from her tantrum. You didn't know what to do as Dora looked down at the now tiny world before her. \"I wonder if I am going to stop growing?\" Dora asked herself now over 70 feet tall and still expanding. You were not sure what was going to happen next as she looked at her surroundings.    </div></span></div></div>",

So, you have time before you have to start watching over Barney.  When you are about halfway through your snack, you hear a scream of delight from Dora.  You start to run into living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora is skipping to her room with a six inch tall Barney in one hand when you get there.  Well, that happened a lot faster than you thought it would.  Maybe that overactive pituitary gland of his has had an odd reaction to the purple peanut butter.  Even though this is unexpected, it is a little amusing.  He is pounding on his formerly little sisters hand and demanding that she let him go in an amusingly high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarney is being handled a bit roughly by his sister, but he does not appear to be in any danger.  You follow Dora and see what she is planning to do to him.  It is hilarious to see Dora start to play dress up with him.  The pink ballroom dress she forced him to wear was the best costume in your opinion.  Barney is swearing bloody revenge on both you after he gets back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Barney is alright for now you decide to go finish your snack real quick.  Barney was starting to put his real clothes back on while Dora prepared a tea set when you started walking away.  You had not made it halfway to the kitchen when you heard Dora scream.  When you run back to her room you cannot see Barney anywhere.  You ask Dora where he is.  \u201cHe bit me when I picked him up and I accidentally threw him out the window,\u201d she said meekly while holding her hand.  You look over to the window and notice that it is indeed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a disaster.  Who knows what could happen to him out there.  You rush out the front door and pray that Barney is still alive.  If he is dead you have no idea how you will explain this to his mother.  You may have wanted him to get a little humiliated, but now you are feeling really bad about creating this situation.</span></div></div>",

There are a few bushes in the area that he could have landed in.  He could have landed in the grass too which is why you are careful to watch your step as you near where he could have landed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no sign of him at first.  You are fairly certain he is not in the grass since you would have noticed a six inch tall teenager by now.  The foliage on the bushes is so thick that you would have trouble spotting a person of Barney\u2019s size.  Then you hear a faint high pitched moan.  You look in the direction of the noise, but still cannot see anything.  Just as you were about to mark the noise off as something you had imagined, you hear Barney\u2019s voice again.  It sounds like he is yelling at something and that makes him easier to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you find him there is a strange scene being played out.  An overly curious squirrel has taken an interest in Barney and he is trying to get it to back off.  Barney\u2019s protests do not seem to affect the squirrel in the least since it is at least twice as tall as he is.  The squirrel takes a quick look at you and does not seem the least bit bothered by your presence, people in the area must be feeding it and it is used to human presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for Barney to rescue him from his furry assailant.  When your hand is halfway to him Barney starts to shrink once again.  You had thought that the shrinking process had stopped at six inches.  Your own shrinking had been a pretty constant thing.  This looks like a case of a drug affecting different people in different ways.  He is decreasing in size much more rapidly than you did.  It only takes a couple of seconds for him to shrink to an inch in size.  This appears to have interested the squirrel even more in Barney since it picks him up and starts to run away with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome back here,\u201d you yell at the squirrel.  It pays no attention to you and darts up a tree, jumps onto a power line near the tree, and soon darts out of your vision.  Looks like Barney is about to go on an adventure similar to the one you had on your previous summer vacation.  He will have to depend on his wits, intelligence, and cunning if he wants to survive.  That means you won\u2019t see him again unless you do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should go into the house and get some of the cake before you go looking for him.  That way you could try to reverse this situation the moment you find him.  Then again, the squirrel could be getting further and further from you as time goes on.</span></div></div>",

The cake is still in your room and you rush to go get it.  You are running out of the house when there is a crunch beneath your foot and you slip on something.  Whatever you stepped on causes you to fall flat on your back.  Then you remember that you have left the purple peanut butter in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are afraid to look at what, or who, you have stepped on.  When all you see is a doll, you breathed a sigh of relief.  It would be a good idea to get that dangerous substance out of Dora\u2019s reach though.  Unfortunately, the jar of purple peanut butter is empty when you get to it.  \u201cDora,\u201d you call out.  \u201cDora, answer me,\u201d you call out again with rising panic in your voice as she does not respond.  Great, this situation is spiraling out of control.  You have two shrunken cousins you must find now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarney is in more danger right now so you should find him first.  You make your way out of the house while looking for any signs of Dora on the way out.  Failing to do so, you head in the direction the squirrel took Barney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not take nearly as long to find him as you thought it would.  You hear a dog barking and growling at something right next door.  When you see what the dog is barking at, there you find Barney trapped in a corner.  You would have to guess the squirrel had a run in with the dog and abandoned its captive in its own attempts to escape what is a fairly large Golden Retriever.  If that dog has been living next to Barney, he has probably been tormenting the animal whenever he can get the chance.  You had best go rescue him before the dog should decide to do something irreversible to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little nervous to be approaching the angered dog.  However, when you get close to it the dog calms down and acts as friendly as can be towards you.  That confirms your thoughts about how Barney has been treating the dog.  You pet it to show you are friendly and get it to leave Barney alone.  Barney is yelling something at you, but his voice is way too high pitched for you to easily understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into your pocket and pull out the piece of cake you brought from the house.  That is probably not the best way to carry a cake around, but you will have some crumbs around if you need them.  You hold out your hand and tell Barney he needs to eat the cake.</span></div></div>",

It just licks your face in thanks for the treat.  Eating just a crumb sized portion was enough to return you to your normal size when you were the size of a bug.  That dog had just eaten a palm sized piece of cake.  You hope that the cake is just an antidote for the purple peanut butter, but as you concentrate on the dog you can see it growing at a very slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember Barney if still there and reach into your pocket to try to find some of the cake crumbs.  There are a few crumbs stuck to your fingers when you pull your hand out of your pocket.  You brush the crumbs off in front of Barney and tell him to eat.  The dog tries to lick up the crumbs, but you are ready for it this time and restrain it from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you see Barney eat a crumb you pick him up.  The Golden Retriever finally notices Barney again and begins to growl at him once more.  You put Barney in the pocket that had not been holding the cake for safe keeping.  If Barney ate more pieces of cake and became a giant that would probably be even worse than the dog growing into a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coax the dog into coming with you to your aunt\u2019s house.  If you can get the dog some peanut butter in time you should be able to avoid an awkward situation.  You walk inside with the dog and go to the kitchen where you had once again left the purple peanut butter.  Then you look on the kitchen table and see the object of your search is not there.  What could have happened to it you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you came looking for me.  Huh, you brought Max over,\u201d a Dora that was six inches shorter than she should be said to you as she ran over to the dog, Max.  When they are standing right next to each other it make the growth and shrinking process a little easier to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDora, why didn\u2019t you answer me when I called for you and where is the peanut butter that was on the table,\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had answered you it would have been too easy to find me.  Oh yeah, I am not going to tell you where the magic peanut butter is.  It refills on its own and you would just keep it for yourself if you found it,\u201d Dora giggles as she plays with Max and answers your questions at the same time.  That is kind of true.  You have kept the peanut butter to yourself and you definitely would not give it to Dora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will have to find a way to get Dora to reveal the location of the peanut butter.  The dog looks like it is growing at the same rate you shrank last summer.  If things go on like this, that dog will be monstrously tall by tomorrow night.  Max may be friendly now, but he is still just an animal.  Even if he decided not to eat anyone he would be able to do a lot of harm just by being a careless animal.</span></div></div>",

At least he should be back to normal soon.  It should also be pretty easy to reverse the effects on Dora too.  One crumb of cake dropped in her food should take care of her.  But there is the matter of what you will do with the dog if you cannot find the peanut butter real quick.  It will only be a matter of time before the neighbors wonder where their dog is.  You will also have to make sure the cake is well hidden now.  It would be bad if Barney figured out that the cake could make him grow into a giant and then try to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Barney is large enough to peek out of your pocket he starts yelling gibberish at you.  He hides in your pocket again when Max starts growling at him.  You decide to lock him in his own room.  That will make it so you do not have to deal with him again until he is tall enough to unlock his own door and keep him safe from Max.  Then you make a snack for Dora and place a single cake crumb in it.  Dora is happy that you made her a snack and quickly eats it.  The ungrateful little girl still won\u2019t tell you where the purple peanut butter is though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend most of the day searching all over the house for the peanut butter but have no luck.  Your aunt comes home and is surprised to see Max in the house.  \u201cNephew, how did you know we were supposed to be taking care of the neighbor\u2019s dog while they are on vacation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that explains why the neighbors have not noticed that their dog is gone yet.  You just mutter an incoherent response to your aunt and keep searching.  Before you know it your uncle has come home as well and it is time for dinner.  Barney and Dora have returned to their normal heights by now, but Max is a good foot taller than he should be.  Barney is much quieter than he normally is.  He is probably wondering if he has gone insane after today\u2019s experience.  Nobody seems to pay attention to the fact that Max is taller than they remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue searching after dinner until it is time to go to sleep.  Max has taken a liking to you and sleeps in your room tonight.  You drift off to sleep and hope you will be able to totally resolve this situation before Max gets too big for you to handle.</span></div></div>",

By the position of the sun, it looks like you have overslept.  Your aunt and uncle have already left for work by now.  Taking one look at Max, you are glad he slept next to the bed instead of on it.  He is slumbering quietly, but he looks large enough for you to ride him.  You decide to let sleeping dogs lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one thing you can do and that is find that purple peanut butter before the dog gets much larger.  Your search eventually takes you into the living room where Barney is waiting for you, all 9 feet of him.  He does not look too happy with you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know cousin.  I\u2019ve been doing some thinking.  All that weird stuff yesterday didn\u2019t start happening until I ate that sandwich you gave me yesterday,\u201d Barney said and you did not think it would be a good idea to mention that he was the one who stole the sandwich.  He continued talking while you started edging out of the living room.  \u201cYou also seemed to know how to reverse what had happened to me awfully easy.  Now, you have turned me into some type of freak.  And don\u2019t think I forgot about what you did to me last summer.  You have made a mistake this time though.  You should have kept me small because now I am going to pound you into oblivion squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you started racing out of the room with Barney in hot pursuit.  His long legs let him easily catch up to you and he tackled you to the ground.  It felt like getting hit by a sack of bricks.  Barney had you pinned down and was laughing as he raised a fist to begin your pounding.  You do not know if Barney realizes what the size difference between you means.  If he were to put all the effort he could into hitting you he very well may end up killing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a terrifyingly loud growl comes from up the hallway.  Max has woken up and has gotten even larger since you last saw him.  He would have to be eye level with a large horse and is only a foot or two shorter than Barney.  Barney does not take more than a second to figure out he needs to run from the large dog.  He makes a hasty retreat out of the house and as Max is about to pursue you try to block his path.  What Barney was about to do to you was making you seriously rethink whether or not he deserved to be mauled by a dog, but it would still take to much effort to explain the situation to your aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope the dog will stop because there is simply no way you can make him stop.  To your good fortune, Max likes you more than he hates Barney.  He stops when you request him to and simply looks at you like he is wondering how you became so small.  You pet Max under his chin and tell him what a good dog he is just to stay on his good side.  It would probably be a good idea to get Max outside before he destroys the house.  His growth seems to have picked up speed and you wonder why.  As you are walking him outside you can see why, the place you had hidden the cake has been broken into recently and the cake is gone.  Looks like Max was hungry when he woke up.  It complicates the situation, but Max probably saved your life just now and you can live with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember Dora.  Where has she been during all this commotion?   The solution hits you like lightning.  What else would a kid with magic chocolate flavored peanut butter be doing right now?  You run back into the house and search for Dora.</span></div></div>",

Max looks a little excited by your sudden activity and tries to follow you back inside but he can no longer fit through the door.  He whines a little as you leave him behind but you pay him no mind as you search for Dora.  You burst into her room and see the jar of purple peanut butter sitting in the middle of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jar is empty and by a few purple stains in the room you can tell this is not the first time the jar has been emptied today.  You carefully walk into the room and search for Dora.  Then you spot what looks like an ant sitting next to the jar.  After a closer inspection you can see that the ant is actually Dora.  You have the decency to not try to crush her like she tried to do to you last summer.  She looks to small to handle without causing her harm so you leave her on the floor while taking the empty jar of peanut butter.  It would take her hours to get out of the room, so she should be safe on the floor for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are left with two problems.  You need the cake and the purple peanut butter to reverse the affects on your cousins and Max.  Both of them will take a little while to reappear and you need both of them fast.  You check to see if any crumbs of the cake are left but it looks like Max has licked up every last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do you go outside to keep an eye on Max.  He has gotten a lot larger since you went inside.  The dog could look into the second story of a house.  You hope Barney has not gotten much larger given his bad attitude.  Then you start to wonder why no one has called the police yet since there is a two story tall dog and a giant teen running around.  Think of that conversation with the police.  \u201cUhm, police.  There is a giant dog in my neighbor\u2019s yard\u201d or \u201cI saw a giant teen running down the street.\u201d  They would sure believe that.  That should give you some time before the police get enough calls that they send someone out to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so lost in thought that you did not notice Max walking up to you until he licked your entire body.  He may still be a lovable dog, but being covered in dog drool is not very pleasant.  You try to think of something you could do with Max.  It would be a good idea to find Barney.  There is no telling what he will do with his new found power and Max would make for a good body guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou convince Max to lie down so you can climb onto his head.  When you are on you tell him to find Barney and hope that he understands what he is supposed to do.  Max starts walking down the street while sniffing the ground while growing larger and larger with each passing moment.  It should only be a little longer before the police finally show up.  Then Barney finally comes into sight.</span></div></div>",

He appeared slightly taller than Max. Looking down you see his giant feet are half the size of yourself. He definitely had the power to stomp on you. You need to be careful on how you handle this situation. Even now, you can see his body is still getting bigger. What's worse, his growth process seems actually faster than Max's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he reaches out to grab you, but Max barks at him, quite loudly, giving him and yourself a jolt. As long as Max was as big as Barney, he couldn't get at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barney, you have to listen to me. Even now you are still growing bigger and if I don't help you it's gonna get out of control!\" You yell out to Barney, but he just laughs in response. He couldn't take you seriously anymore at his size. You need a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of two possible solutions. Fight fire with fire, that is, find a way to grow to Barney's size and stop this by force. Maybe the cake refilled itself in the fridge in the basement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you could find a way to get Barney close enough and get some purple peanut butter in his mouth.

He is standing next to a police car with his back turned to you.  The 13 foot tall Barney looks like he has captured the police officer the car belongs to and is forcing him to give a false report to the station.  Barney may be doing you a little favor, if the officer reports that all the calls that have been coming in really are just a bad prank, then you will have much more time to fix all your problems than you thought you would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised Barney cannot hear Max approaching.  Max has grown to the size of large whale and is still growing.  It does not take Max long to recognize Barney.  Using Max as a body guard is starting to look like a bad idea.  When Max has his typical reaction to Barney, he and the officer whirl around to look at the angry dog.  The officer faints at the sight of the dog and Barney takes off running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even have the chance to tell Max to stop, he starts pursuing Barney.  A few of your fears are realized as the two giants tear through the neighborhood.  Barney is running through fences like they are not even there.  Max is doing even more damage.  A crushed car here, the side of a house knocked down there.  Maybe you can claim a small tornado tore through town.  Fortunately, it is a nice day and most of the people who are not working are out doing other things so no one is hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax is gaining ground on Barney very fast.  You are having a hard time staying on Max as he runs through town.  There comes a point when you wish the dog would hurry up and catch Barney so you will not have to worry about falling to your death.  Then it finally happens.  Barney trips and Max pins him to the ground with a paw before he can get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation looks bad.  Max is bearing his teeth at the helpless Barney and it does not look like you will be able to stop the dog this time around.  You give it your best shot anyways.  Pleading, you ask Max to leave your cousin alone.  He does not even respond to your presence.  Barney\u2019s fate is about to be determined by a dog he has tormented for far too long.</span></div></div>",

He is growing fast and he starts to laugh with joy as Max backs away in fear from him.  You are glad he is going to survive, but you do not want to have a giant malevolent cousin running around.  Then you look to your side and see that the jar of purple peanut butter has refilled itself while you were not looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a handful of the peanut butter and lob it into Barney\u2019s laughing mouth.  The peanut butter is right on target and Barney\u2019s growth stops almost immediately.  You also take the opportunity to throw some of the peanut butter into Max\u2019s mouth while he is panting.  That will take care of two problems in a little while.  Max is shrinking faster than he grew and Barney\u2019s growth spurt turns into a shrinking spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Barney is still smaller than Max the dog remains wary of him due to that last growth spurt.  You stay close to Max until Barney returns to his normal size.  After he returns to normal, you try to coax a still elephant sized Max to come home with you.  Barney is shouting a few threats to get back at you, but he makes no move to get any closer to you and Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually make it home and you hope nobody has caught any of today\u2019s events on camera.  Max has shrunken to about twice his normal size by the time you home.  He does not look like he is shrinking anymore and you get out a little more peanut butter to feed to him.  That is when Max decides to be a little playful and tackles you to the ground.  The hand that had the peanut butter on it wound up in your mouth and you accidentally swallowed the tasty substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now you are about to have another shrinking adventure if the cake has not shown up again.  You race to where you left it and see that it is still gone.  Max has followed you around; he probably thinks you are playing some type of game.  If Barney gets back before the cake shows up again you could be in some real trouble.  And you still need to give some of the cake to Dora before someone steps on her.  All you can do is sit here and wait for the cake to reappear while Max sits faithfully by your side.</span></div></div>",

Everything around you seemed like it was growing as you were once again shrunk to the size of a bug. Max seemed to have lost sight of you as you shrunk; he was still so big that he couldn't recognise things if they were small enough, like you. Eventually, he got bored and walked away. You make note to stay away from Max from now on; being that size, he could kill you just by licking you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to hide in the food cabinet in case Barney comes wandering around. The boxes of cereal were enormous compared to you. Just then Barney comes storming into the kitchen. You could tell that the peanut butter brought him back to his original size, but he was still a giant compared to you. You could see him pushing over things and looking under tables. He was looking for the cake allright. And if that happened, life would about to get a whole lot harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarney left in frustration, probably to search other rooms in the house. You had to get to it before he does. But where would it be? Where is the one place that it could just appear? Just like that you figured it out; the fridge in the basement! Thats where you first encountered the cake! It could have transferred over to the fridge in order to refill itself. You step out of the cabinet into the tile flooring of the huge kitchen, and start your trek to the basement door. Everything looked so big, you just looked in awe at your surroundings on your way to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the door however, it was closed. But no problem! You're tiny now! You crouch down and go under the bottom slit of the door. But now was the hard part: the stairs. Looking down, it seems like the basement is miles away. But you start your climb down each stair, using cracks in the wood to set your feet and keep you from falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of descending the basement stairs, you finally reach the bottom, only to find that the fridge is closed, and there is no possible way to open it for a person of your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear someone coming down the basement stairs.

You stand right over him and lift one of your feet into the air.  Immediately Barney begins to cower.  You bring your foot down hard and fast with a stomp on the wooden floor, missing him only by an inch.  The impact of your weight knocks Barney backwards, and the sight of your massive sneaker beside him sends him running into the front door of the dollhouse.  You smile proudly at how easily intimidating it is when you have the advantage of size.  You pick Dora out of your pocket again and see that she has freed herself from most of the gum.   You drop her down as well and nudge her into the dollhouse with your toe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden dollhouse is larger, reaching up to your knees.  Inside are little figures of a family.  You announce loudly, so that Barney and Dora can hear, as they look out from the upstairs windows... that you are the giant alien, and that their only job is to live.  Without any further warning, you lift as high into the air as you can and stomp down on the window that Dora is peeking out of.  You smirk as her head darts in before your massive foot demolishes the entire upstairs bedroom of the dollhouse.  Wooden splinters go flying out from the hole you make in the roof.   Dora has run into a hallway.  You step over the dollhouse so that both feet are straddling the entire structure.  Then, you lift your other foot into the air and kick through the side of the house, ripping open the hallway.  You crouch down and inside you see Barney.  You move your face away and reach your arm through the hole in order to grab Barney.  Unfortunately he slips through your large fingers and makes it into another room.  You see exactly where he has gone and again stomp your foot through the roof, laughing all the while.  You look around through the broken furniture and floor to find him.  Not seeing either of them, you decide to do something even more exciting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over and pick the dollhouse entirely up with both arms into the air and shake it violently.  Inside you hear furniture crashing and breaking.  Suddenly Barney comes tumbling out of a window and lands on the hard wood floor, uninjured.  He begins to stumble away from you so you take the dollhouse and throw it across the room, caring little for what happens to Dora.  In your bloodlust, you quickly overtake Barney with a predatory grin across your face as he tries to escape and with your last stride, step on Barney. </span></div></div>",

She's like a gnat in soft center of your palm.  You shrug and drop her gently into your pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now time for some demolition.  You're at the stadium, which seems to be empty on account that there's no game playing today.  Wanna crush it?</span></div></div>",

Then Kevin came ashore, you ran in fear so as not to be trampled by the \"little\" kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little buddy, ready for that swim?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"sure\" you reply<br>\r\n\"how big am i?\" He asked, apparently seeing that he still grew<br>\r\n\" over 200ft. but im not sure just how much\" you answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he grabs you, and heads into the lake, but then the choppers return!</span></div></div>",

Inside the shoe, you find that the toe impressions are like metorite craters, after only a few minutes, he starts to sweat like mad,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this\" you yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your size, sweat is far bigger than you, in fact, above there is a \"little\" glob headed your way, an ordinary human probably wouldn't even see it. It engulfs you and drags you downward, you eventually fall off the foot, the ball breaks up with the force of hitting the ground. You gaze up and wonder just how tall the foot is, but then you realize that this place just aint safe, though isn't it ironic that  you'd started out so huge that others may have landed here on you, but here you are, smaller than just about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, enough was enough, you walked up and banged on the foot,, all that happens though is he starts it wiggle his toes, which you soon stand on top of from the massive movement. You continue to be an irritant, but not a thing happens, he shifts his foot and sends you falling, you manage to survive the huge drop, you nearly pass out at the bottom. Down below, you see that you are so small that your feet can slip through the weaving of threads that forms the shoe.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunatly, your glee overwhelms you, you attempt to grow while still in the shoe, you hit the \"ceiling\", but can not break-through, you continually try, not thinking about whats stopping you, on your 20th try, you are1/4 inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna come out?\" Kevin asks after you've been in there for 10 min. You walk towards the end of the shoe and he pulls you out placing you on the ground next to his foot.<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you any bigger?\" Kevin asks<br>\r\n\"im not sure, i couldn't grow\" you say<br>\r\n\"You probably couldn't get past the shoe\" he tells you<br>\r\n\"great, so now i have to wait another hour before i can try to grow.\" you moan<br>\r\n\"At least now your big enough to ride my sandals\" Kevin says, running to get them, when he returns, you see that his feet are still far bigger than you, your only 1/4 the hight of his smallest toe, he puts his sandals on and has you in with his feet before you can complain. You are squeezed against the side straps, its unbearable, you subconciously think \"i want to be smaller\", which unfortunatly worked, you saw things grow bigger, you stopped at 1/8 in. tall, the small toe now towered 8 times your hight. Meanwhile, Kevin breaks into a run, apparently wanting to burn some energy, as he does so, you are forced under his small toe, the imprint of is toe is deeper than you are tall, his toe comes down forcing you to eat the grim of the shoe, it continues like this for a while, but Kevin does pull you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sits down and takes off his shoes, placing you on the ground in front of his feet as he sits leaning to the side.<br>\r\n\"How'd ya shrink little buddy?\" he asks<br>\r\n\"not sure, it must've been the tight space\" you reply<br>\r\n\"can you grow yet\" he asks<br>\r\n\"im not sure\" you reply \"i wanna give it some time yet\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, back in you go\" he says<br>\r\n\"ohh noo\" you tell him, \"just put me in my own shoes, at least i can't be stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin obliges, you also tell him to put them on their side. During your relaxing, Kevin continues to play, after a while he runs into the cave, more or less just so he can run, he knocks the shoe over, but doesn't realize it, you land out on the cave floor in time for him to again, get you underfoot, you are stuck in his big-toe, and BIG is right, its over 15 times your hight! He runs back to the cave, you screaming every profanity you know. Inside the cave, he tries on one of your shoes, the left one, which he knows you are not in, also, by some fluke, the other shoe had righted itself. In the shoe, you are amazed at just how big it was, your socks crammed in the bottom are like titans, Kevin withdrawls his foot when he hits them, but you are left behind, you find that the weave of your sock is such that you can't climb it, each block is bigger than you. Kevin heads out.<br>\r\nYou crawl out and discover something you soon may like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(heres what i believe Kevin looks like : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/earl6m/1461229118/\" target=\"_blank\">http://flickr.com/photos/earl6m/14612291...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grew about 20 more feet, now being 70 feet tall. He reached over his enormous hand towards you, signaling you to leap on. After getting on his hand, he gently places you in his pocket. <br>\r\n\"Alright, lets leave.\" Kevin announced. He starts to crawl out of the cave, since he is too big to fully stand up. While in his pocket, you suddenly sense his body stand up.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm out of the cave now. Woah!\" He said as you felt a rumble in his pocket. Suddenly it looked like his pocket was getting bigger. At this rate, who knows how big he'll get?<br>\r\nAfter the growth spurt ended, he reached back into his pocket and pulled you out, bringing you up to his enormous face, which was a lot bigger than when you saw him 2 minutes ago. <br>\r\n\"I don't get it...I just took a little bite, why am I getting even more growth spurts than you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I think thats exactly it. I ate a good portion of the cake, and I only grew a few times a day. You take just one bite, and your growing more times than I ever did every hour. The amount of cake you eat counts.\" you explained to the giant. <br>\r\n\"Oh...I see now.\" Kevin replied. Just then, you heard a loud rumbling sound.<br>\r\n\"Here it comes again!\" he said. <br>\r\nSlowly his body started to expand even further, although this time his growth was quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can accidentally kill someone if you're not careful. <br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" he asked you.<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go back to the lake, or go into town and see how people really react to the new you.\"<br>\r\n\"Awww, I can't decide what to do, they're both good choices.

Hes an inch tall, just enough to reach the edge of Tom's small toe, you though, aren't even as big as Kevin's toe, as he runs you get caught in his toes as he jumps up on Tom's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aint the big one, but at least im close\" Kevin says as he cllimbs up pulling you out.<br>\r\n\"We're still both tiny\" you say<br>\r\n\"we'll fix it\" he answers, Tom remains in his pj's and heads to his living room, minutes later the door bell rings. He opens it and there stands 8 of his friends, whering PJ's as well, planning on a sleep-over. Kevin slips and falls off Tom's foot taking you with him. A crumb of cake falls from his pocket which at least got you to 1/7th of his hight. As tom's friends enter, you find that they're not paying any attention to the floor. Quickly you scurry up the sock as the cake wheres off on Kevin, as in for the PB over-powered it, he shrank to you size as you climbed the sock. On top, the boy scratched this foot with the other, you are covered in the bit of sweat in the sock and hold on as they walk on.</span></div></div>",

You came out at what would've been mid-foot, on the bottom, theres huge fuzz about twice your hight, you wade through it, making sure not to knock any on you. Afterward, you find a section of sweat and dirt that formed a giant swamp, coming up to your waist, and just past Kevin's, who knows whats in this gunk? Then you reach the end of the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you find that you are way smaller than you thought, you have to watch out for the screws, they're chasms, deep enough to kill you.

Tom gets behind him and holds him from the back, placing his heels on the boy's feet, You and Kevin can only gaze up at how huge it is, then it comes down flat, knocking you both through to his foot as they call the round to an end.</span></div></div>",

A glob of sweat falls from above and knocks you onto the strand carrying you towards Tom's forehead. You and Kevin land on Tom's huge forehead, after that boy stopped kicking Tom reached up to wipe away the sweat, which so far, you were still stuck in it, he catches you in his hand, you are broken free of the liquid, but find that you as tall as the grooves of his hand. You both hang on tight as he starts to scratch his foot, both of you get caught on a piece of dirt and fall off onto his toes, well, so much for luck.

Your feet have completely pulverized the ground beneath them from their huge weight, and they've grown over the house the kid belongs to, including a few others nearby.  Convenient.  You didn't even need to lift one foot up, and you still crushed the kid's place and whoever was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat a few more bites of the cake, which has grown with you (which is awesome) and you reach probably around 800 or so feet.  A few whole blocks are right now smothered beneath your vast feet.  Like a child playing with ants, you stare down at the neighboorhood below you and shuffle and stamp your feet around, smiling.  It's pretty cool being a giant, you think.  You feel like godzilla.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to go Bond for right now and spy on you cousins. You don't know why, but you found it pretty cool to be so small that you were looking at people without them having any idea you were there. You did a little experimenting over the last year, and found out that if you just eat a small bit of the purple goo you shrink instantly, rather than over a long period of time if you eat a whole bunch at once. Why is still a mystery, but you've never really taken the time to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnscrewing the lid to the jar, you notice again that despite the fact that you cleaned out the jar only a few weeks ago, it is now almost full with the strange substance you have yet to think of a better name for than purple peanut butter. You stick the tip of your finger inside the gooey soft gunk, and are surprised that it is still cool, even though it must have been sitting in your hot suitcase for over an hour on the ride from airport to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your finger out again you make sure that a little dollop of the purple goo remains on its tip. Looking at it you are once again amazed that something that so resembles a common foodstuff, even though it is not the right color, can do something so weird. Sniffing it you find that the aroma, a mixture of peanut butter, jelly, and something else you can't identify, seems even stronger now than it did the last time you opened the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are just about to eat the little bit of purple peanut butter when you suddenly remember the cake. It is the only antidote you know to the shrinking effect. Whether this is because it was designed to be, or if it is supposed to make you grow, you have no idea. You've never eaten the cake alone. After all as a shrunken kid it's easy to sneak around, but as a hundred foot tall goliath you're pretty sure someone would notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you can't just leave the cake on top of the dresser. You remember the first time you shrank at home, and you ended up having to climb up your own dresser to get at the cake. Your parents had chewed you out terribly about being missing for almost twenty-four hours. They had nearly called the police, little knowing that their son was still in his room, just feeling a little down. Down to about a forth of an inch actually. Luckily you left your top drawer open and a handy thread was there to help you finish your climb hours earlier than you would have otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring around the room you don't see any really place to put the cake. At your own home you just slip it under the bed, but the guest bed in your current room is only about an inch off the floor, way to low to slip the cake under. With no better place in sight you finally decide to put the cake on the other side of the dresser, out of sight of the door. Hopefully you'll want to grow back long before anyone comes searching for you in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the cake down you take one last tentative look around your room. Considering you've only been in it for about twenty minutes the only thing that looks out of place is the suitcase, which is stuffed into a corner. With nothing else left to do you place you finger on you tongue and then suck the purple goo off it. The taste is even better than you remember, and you wonder somewhere in the back of your mind if this is what doing drugs is like, but then the pink dots begin to play in front of your eyes, and everything around you seems to be getting farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shrinking and quite fast. Within a few seconds everything in the room looks like a scenic mesa view, with shag carpeting for waving plains, and an oak wood dresser and bed frame for mesas. The scene is beautiful, or at least it would be if you didn't have this nagging voice in the back of your mind that insisted on reminding you that you are now smaller than most household pests, and that you were nearly killed last time you did this in this particular home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout down that nagging little voice. As you always do in this situation, and begin the trek to the living room. You are quickly of the opinion that maybe you should have shrunk after you were in sight of the two you wanted to spy on, as at your current height it will take you hours to get to the living room, most of those spent traversing the stairs. Still you can't back out now. You're gonna go spy on Barney and Dora for a while, hear what they say about you when you're not around, and then get them back for it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jog to the living room takes less time than you thought, as you find a helpful baseboard running along the bottom of the stairs that you find just the right height to climb onto. Pulling yourself on top of it you ride it like a slide down to the ground floor of the house. Unfortunately you find yourself unable to stop and then slide along the tiled floor as you land with several grunting noises as you collide with the hard surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the rather rough landing you are still conscious. Pulling yourself up you check your arms and legs to see if you broke anything, and then rub your temples to try and fight off the headache which is a result of righteous face plant you did right off the bat. Luckily you don't seem very injured, and besides a splitting headache you are pretty sure you're going to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you are dismayed to discover that the two you are planning on spying on are getting up. The television beyond them is showing the credits of whatever show it was they were watching, and now, bored with the TV, their going into other parts of the house. You notice a moment later that both their massive forms are coming towards you. You realize almost instantly that you can leap onto one of their shoes, or try and follow them on foot, though that annoying voice in the back of your mind is screaming at you to hide, or go back upstairs. You could of course ignore everything and just sit right where you are as they pass by and watch them from here for a few minutes. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

With that task done he then walks away from the counter, and you are forced to run for cover as his big feet come very close to turning you into a little red smear on the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are just able to run out from under his sole when it comes crashing down, and Barney walks over to the refrigerator. You hear various clinking noises as he moves stuff around inside, and are surprised when a blast of cold air suddenly washes over you. It feels like an arctic wind. You can't believe how cold it is to you, after all you don't see why cold air should feel any different. It's not like you inside the fridge when it's shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are startled when Barney quickly pops his head out of the fridge and slams the door shut. The boom from the door is so loud that you are forced to cover your ears, and then the gale force winds strike and you have to dig your nails into the ground to stay where you are. Barney, unknown to both him, no surprise, and to you, because of your preoccupation with staying where you are, nearly steps on you again, but as before just barely misses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you nearly get blown away by a simple thing like a door slamming shut you are really beginning to consider going back upstairs, but before you do you want to see what Barney just tried to kill you to get.

You move out of the way where he is standing and hope that you are not anywhere near him when something starts to fall if it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thunder of a voice comes from overhead, even though Barney is only twelve years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we have to get Cherrios? I don't like 'em! I'd rather have some good food like pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take too long for you to realize that Barney is holding a huge box of Cherrios.  The yellow box is a standard to all cereal boxes, and it is definitely something you don't want to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you hear a light sound.  You look upward to the behemoth Barney to find that he let the box of Cherrios fall.  Thankfully you did move out of the way, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the box crashes, making you cover your ears, and tips to the side, making huge inner tube shaped pieces about a foot tall come barrelling towards you.  You hit the floor as one flies over you.  Another one glides right past your foot.  Then a final one comes by but you don't hear it whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it knocks you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on you wake up in a huge cavern.  The cavern seems to stretch for about a hundred feet.  You look around and see fairly little.  The little gleam of light shows something however.  You are in the box of Cherrios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that this is not so bad actually.  You think this until suddenly the world that you are in shakes.  It first shakes left, then right, and then opens up.  You look up and see...</span></div></div>",

He brings the spoonful up to his mouth, slurping up the cereal and milk and sighing happily as he chews the mouthful. He looks around his bowl, hungrily searching for his next morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again breaching the surface of the ice cold milk, you wipe your eyes and look up at your cousin to see him bringing his spoon back down, directly towards you. You cry out as you watch, nowhere to swim as you tread thick milk in the center of a cheerio, Barney's spoon scooping below you and lifting you up with another spoonful of food to be nourishment for his body. \"B-Barneeeeey! Noooo! D-don't eat meeeee!\", you beg your cousin as he lifts you up to his plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, surprised you're still in there, squirt...\"<br>\r\nYour milk covered face froze as you hear your cousin's booming voice. You look up into Barney's eyes that are squarely locked on you in his spoon. \"B-Barney? Help meeee!\", you scream up to him desperately, waving your arms over your head.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I can't hear ya' buddy, since you're too small now. Oh well. Try not to squirm to much in my gut, 'kay speck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare speechless for a moment as Barney smiled at you like he was looking down on just another cheerio instead of his shrunken cousin in his spoon. Barney laughed and lifted the spoon to his lips, his tongue flicking out a little as he slowly and teasingly ushered you into his gaping maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-noooo! Barneeeeey! Dooooon't!\", you scream and thrash in the spoon as Barney's hot breath washes over you, his lips closing behind you, enclosing you in the dark hot cavern. The spoon slips out from under you, letting you and the rest of the spoon's contents fall onto Barney's wet squishy tongue. Barney smiles to himself as he feels you squirming in his mouth, chuckling softly as he starts chewing his food around you. His tongue tosses you around carelessly as he chews, your screams going unnoticed by your hungry cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great dramatic effect, Barney tilts his head back, swallowing the mashed up remnants of his spoonful with a squirming little morsel in the middle. With an audible 'glrk' from the back of his tongue, he sends you down into his gullet. He traces the lump of food down his throat with his fingers, patting his round stomach as he feels it deposited into it. He burps loudly before going back for one spoonful of cereal after another, finishing his breakfast and flopping onto the couch to watch tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where's the cousin?\", Dora asks as she walks in. Barney burps again as he rubs his stomach idly. \"How should I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squirms, screams and struggles in Barney's gut go only barely noticed by your cousin, who becomes your final destination this summer, which means you're at an</span></div></div>",

Each one of them could step on a city without feeling anything. They will no doubt level dozens of cities and crush millions of people in just one race that they still haven't started.

There is no sign of them slowing down at all until they reach 300 miles tall. Their massive feet are about 50 miles long, and have blades of grass and clumps of dirt that dwarf even the tallest of mountains.  What's really frightening about the whole situation is that these kids could destroy whole cities just by lifting their small toe, and there is nothing that anybody could do about all the damage they would cause. How much worse it would be if they want to destroy cities and kill. That's when you notice several earthquakes larger than any you have heard of, but these were too small to be the giants walking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, these were massive crumbs of cake that had fallen from the giants eating it.

But landed on his strand of hair right next to his ear, so the drop from where you're at to his shoulder is at least 1500 feet, even though it's mere inches to the boy. Thankfully, the strand of hair is about a foot in diameter, meaning it isn't too wide nor too narrow to get a grip on. But if the boy grows much more, you're gonna have a hard time holding onto his strand of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titans look like they are having so much fun, and it looks like they wouldn't complain if they grow even more, which would be a problem for you and everyone else on the planet. You are quite jealous of these titanic kids. You've always wanted to be a giant, and now your carelessness around Dora has allowed her and several other kids roughly your age to be 40,000 foot tall walking mountains of destruction. Their feet alone are over a mile long, which means that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still wanna be taller, I wanna be the tallest ever,\" you hear the big, blond boy mutter to himself which interrupted your train of thought. You shudder at the thought of this boy being even bigger. He starts to walk over to Dora, which almost made you lose your grip but you held on tight. Just as this boy came up to Dora, he reached out and stole the whole chocolate cake from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HECK, ALEC!\" Dora yelled at the big, blond boy (whose name is apparently Alec). \"WE ALL AGREED THAT I WOULD HOLD THE CAKE!\" Dora tries to swipe the cake back, but Alec moves the cake out of the way so that Dora misses and unintentionally swats an airplane down instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that's what we agreed on, but I want to be EVEN BIGGER!\" said Alec. So Alec lifts the whole cake up to his maw, and takes a massive bite out of it. \"MMM, that's REALLY good cake, Dora! Especially since it will make me way taller. You may want to take a couple steps back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlec then starts to shake uncontrollably and grows up and up and up. His hair is starting to get wider, so you quickly make the decision to start sliding down to get to his shoulder. Your hands start burning from the sheer amount of friction. You finally make it to his shoulder safe and sound, and he seems to be done growing. You look over his shoulder and see that Dora and the rest of the \"giants\" are not even up to Alec's knees. He is absolutely MASSIVE and must be around 360,000 feet tall, which means his feet must be about 10 miles long. The flip-flops he is wearing are probably a mile thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big bro, can I have some cake too?\" the younger blond boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about the 'BIG BRO' part, Logan\" joked Alec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, Alec. I don't want to be a short giant; I want to be a big giant like you,\" replied the brother (and apparently his name is Logan). You also note how Logan considers himself to be short, which would be funny if these giants weren't also destroying literally everything in their paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think..\"</span></div></div>",

You reach on top of the dresser and bring down the cake and the purple peanut butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them, you again have that strange feeling, that feeling that something weird is about to happen, that you always get when you eat the purple peanut butter. For a moment you pause, unsure if you should be doing this or not, but again the strange feeling overcomes you. Why shouldn't you? You ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Aunt Fiona had put a snack up in your room, which you had unsatisfactorily eaten. However, now there was a plate and a knife to cut the cake with. You get to work. First, you cut a thing, thin slice of cake, and then stick your finger in the cool purple stuff, getting out just a dollop of it. You look at this hungrily for a moment before carefully putting it on the cake. Now it looks like the cake has been decorated with violets. You stare at it until you can stare know more. You attack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are done, you carefully wipe your mouth and lick your finger, than sit down and wait for something to happen. Suddenly, blue lights start to play in front of your eyes. You grow dizzy for a second, and as it clears up you watch the world grow around you. You close your eyes; the process is a bit more disorienting than usual. When you open your eyes, the world has changed. Your standing knee deep in the multicolored grass of your carpet, looking up at the building sized furniture of your guest room. You frown. Something\u2019s not right. Than it hits you. YOU\u2019RE TOO BIG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had eaten a small enough dollop of purple peanut butter to make you a half inch tall, yet here you are, almost six inches tall. Suddenly, it hits you. You had eaten too much cake! You tried to keep the amount low, but the cake is equally as potent as the peanut butter. You usually eat only a crumb and some icing to get you back to full size. You had eaten what looked like the same amount, but what was really at least a hundred times that size. You guess that with the large amount of cvake you had eaten, and the small amount of peanut butter, you had shrunk less, but now the effect is permanent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of yelling and waving your arms in the air, you calm down enough to realize that maybe this size isn't so bad, you can explore the house! And that also the power of the food is probably still there, if only you make the right choice about it. So right then and there\u2026</span></div></div>",

Your newly toughened body withstands his rough handling, but you still feel as if you are in a vice. He stands up and brings your struggling body closer to examine.

She quickly drops to her hands and knees in front of you, causing you to fall backwards. She giggles that awful giggle.

Oh no you think to yourself. Now you can't get back into your room for the cake! Dora heads down the hall, carelessly swinging you around. It's like a rollercoaster.

You begin to tear up, you just wanted to have a nice summer, and yet that adventurous spirit of just wanting to have some fun was the reason you would die today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on your hands and knees, sniffling and sobbing. You're body gets smaller, tinier, weaker. Soon the hair seems like it\u2019s the size of a city. You get up, and run towards Kevin\u2019s chest. Maybe if you climb up his skin you can make it to his ear. You get there after a few minutes and realize that a flake of skin is the size of the entire town that you lived in. You get on his skin and start climbing up the first flake, but soon your body is too small. Insignificant the flake, maybe only 1/64th of an inch in size, is the size of a large city, then a country, then the world itself. You think about it, you must be inconceivably small. You sob even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give up. There\u2019s no way, the only option is to wait and see how small you get. The flake of skin begins to seem like your entire universe as you start to see cells. They get bigger and bigger. You slip inside past the cell wall and start traveling into the cell on a flake of skin on the chest of a boy named Kevin. You shrink even smaller still, the skin cell seems bigger than the largest house you've ever seen. You realize you\u2019re not breathing! You gasp violently, but you can\u2019t seem to take in any air. But you\u2019re not actually suffocating. You seem to not need any oxygen. You wonder how... Soon you notice something very odd pass by. A very large Red squiggly thing just outside the cell. It's a red light wavelength... You remember the graph from your science class on some of the smaller things in the universe, one of them being light particles. You shrink smaller as you notice that there\u2019s a very strange creature floating in the cell. It\u2019s the common cold virus, but it's looks pretty dead... You shrink even smaller, Colors of all kinds flash just outside the cell that now seems like an entire planet of its own. The \"sky\" above is flashing with light wavelengths of all kinds. It\u2019s so beautiful that you almost forget that you were shrinking. You pass by some DNA, and land on one of the proteins it\u2019s made out of. The protein starts out the size of a large beach ball, than the size of a truck. Smaller and smaller your body still shrinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you notice an atom fly by, it\u2019s the size of a pea to you. Soon they become the size of golf balls, then basket balls. You grab on to one, hoping to survive the trip. You're now smaller than an atom, it seems like a carbon atom to you if you remember your chemistry right. it gets to be the size of a state soon, you stand up, watching the neutrons fly by. Smaller still. You grasp your body, you can start to recognize the feeling you had been putting in the back of your mind, the feeling of your body reducing in size. You hold on tight, as it rushes through every nerve in your body, the feeling of helplessness covers you like a silk blanket. Smaller and smaller now, you grab onto one of the flying neutrons like you did with the atom, it becomes the size of Canada to you not before long. You wonder the wastes of this insignificant particle, smooth like the most perfectly polished glass in the world, yet seemingly squishy like a water balloon. You notice that other objects fly by. Maybe things that make up neutrons. You watch them, laying down as you look overhead at the most beautiful thing you have seen so far. Everything all at once. A symphony of colors pass overhead, you smile. Smaller now than anything else, the neutron is the size of the sun compared to you. You notice something that you never thought you would see. A string. A string of pure energy. They seem to hold together the entire universe. These things are unbelievably small. They are about 10^-35 meters long. And they're nearly ten times your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but energy now. You are the smallest thing in the entire universe. If you were to compare, the universe is roughly 93 billion light years across. That\u2019s 9.3x10^26 or 9,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Meters. You are 10x10^-40 at the moment, or .00000000000000000000000000000000000000001 meters tall. You are only a fraction of a fraction, of a fraction. The hair that you once were on is wider than the know universe compared to you. The flake of skin is ten times size of the Local Group. The cell you are in is the size of your own Milky way. The atom is the size of the Pillars of Creation. And the neutron you are still floating around on is the about a light year in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the smallest thing to ever exist, and you exist on a ten year old boy's chest, who now seemed like your entire world. You're body is to tiny to even think about and thus you no longer exist to even the smallest of things. Smaller now, you are so tiny that the strings that hold the universe, the smallest things in all of reality is one billion times bigger than you. You continue shrinking; it's not as bad as you thought it would be. You accept your fate as the smallest thing within everything, all on a boys chest. A quick pop and a flash. The last thing you see is the energy of the strings surrounding your tiny body. You truly no longer exist.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You guessed you were only about 1/256th of an inch tall. There was no way you were gonna make this in time. All of a sudden a piece of cake is jammed in. You seemed like you were miles away from it though. You ran, you ran as fast as you could, you ran as fast as you could with all the determination of the world. Your tiny body shrank faster and smaller. You were a speck on a speck at this point. The cure was right there, and you wouldn\u2019t make it time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear Baney come up from behind Kevin and slap him on the back. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in here pal, my dorky cousin must have ran off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap on the back sent a crumb towards you.

You had looked up to see him; a tall, or at least seemingly tall, boy with bright eyes and brown hair had crushed you with his foot the size of a city compared to you. You are stuck to his foot, as you slowly lose consciousness. The smell of mint soap used to clean his body and the shower that filled your tiny body was all that you felt before death.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are stupified, and cannot imagine what happened. Noticing your confused look, Barney pipes up \"that is probably the WORST cake I've ever tasted, thankfully I only had a little bite or I might have been sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words knock you out of your stupor and launch you into a full blown panic attack!

Taken aback, you back away a step or two from the German Shepherd. The dog casually wags his tails, panting casually. Appearing quite friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hi.\" You say as you cautiously approach and reach out with the back of your hand as it's snuffled over. You rub the dogs cheek. The shepherd gruffs happily. Tail thumping against the covers. His red collar has a large brass name tag.  MAX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say, \"Hi Max.\" And are rewarded with the dog's tongue slurping your hand and bumping his nose against it.  \"At least you're friendly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the dog's ears poink upwards. He gruffs. Outside your door, you hear feet pounding up the stairs. Thinking quickly, you move back to your suitcase and close the cloth lid atop it. Just in time too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora sticks her head into your room. \"Hey Bug!\" It's the nickname she gave you last summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is is Dora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you met Max. He belongs to one of Mom's weird university friends. We're dog sitting him for the week. And guess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got to stay in your room cause Barney's got an Albergie to dog fur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Allergy Dora..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever Bug. He has to stay here or in the backyard. And since we don't have a dog house outside, he's going to be in *your* room at night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I told Mom you'd be glad to take care of him! Bye now! He's your responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little brat turns and runs off, leaving you and Max alone. You quietly shut the door. Max sighs an almost Human sigh. You approach the bed sitting down on the edge next to the dog, rubbing his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel Max. We're both stuck here like inmates in the dog pound.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, thinking to yourself, at least Barney will be keeping his distance.  While rubbing Max's ears, you puzzle over this morning's events.  That voice..where did it come from? No one else, but Max was in the room. And who left that note on the suitcase? Barney? Dora said he was allergic to dogs. And had Dora had left the note, she would have taken the jar and wrapped up cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up from the bed, walk to the bedroom door, close it and return to the suitcase.

However, the top lid of the peanut butter jar is loose.  Twisting it open, you notice a furrow in the purple buttery stuff.  About the size of a finger. Did someone take a finger-full? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the jar, you stand up and glance outside your bedroom window. In the backyard, cousin Barney is tossing rocks at a tree in the next yard.  Doing what he does best. Being a vandal.  You take a step to the door and open it slightly. You can hear the TV blaring downstairs and what sounds like Dora singing along. She's occupied as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back and almost yelp when you feel something cold press against your backside. It's Max's nose. The German Shepherd is now standing atop the bed, head tilted, tail wagging.  The dog belches loudly. Grinning a most un-dog like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling flustered, you turn and reach down into the suitcase taking out a folded day pack.  Flopping it open, you place the cake inside it with one hand. Holding the peanut butter jar, you start to wonder. Is it still potent? Glancing at Max, you open the jar and take a small finger-full of purple peanut butter and hold it out to Max. \"Here Max, try some of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax hesitates, glancing up at you. And again grins that unnerving toothy grin. Ears perked, the dog extends his long muzzle towards your finger. He licks off the peanut butter with a huge tongue. You take a breath, expecting the dog to shrink. A minute passes. Nothing. Another minute. Nothing still. Max is still the same size canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe the peanut butter doesn't work anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the jar lid, you gather up a big glop of purple peanut butter in your finger and lick it down.  It tastes the same. You hesitate, waiting for that tingle you felt last summer that signaled the start of shrinking. Again, nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Max, I think we can say the peanut butter doesn't work at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax snorts in reply. You swear it almost sounds like a laughing gruff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd better go to the University to see Aunt Fiona. Since she knows I have the jar and cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging your shoulders, you screw on the lid and place the peanut butter jar into your day-pack with the wrapped up cake. Slithering the pack around your arms and shoulders, you see Max staring intently at you as you open the bedroom door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Max jumps off the bed and slithers between your legs and open door. Blocking your exit. The dog rears up, pressing his forepaws against your chest. The unexpected motion causing you to lose your balance and falling backwards against the Bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max!\" Lying atop the bed, day-pack underneath. You roll upright and suddenly feel a tingling running all over your skin. The same feeling you had when the peanut butter shrank you!  Your clothes start to feel loose as the room appears to grow around you!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oddly your shirt and shorts seem to stay with you in size as you fall backwards in a tangle of day-pack straps becoming slabs of giant flat ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of tingling ceases. Leaving your to squirm around atop a field of heaved, black weave and straps curved like arches atop a landscape of bed. The ceiling and bedroom window looms off in the distance.  Trying to get your wits about, you crawl over a mattress sized tag. The day-pack maker's tag a bit bigger than you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale, \"That purple stuff did shrink me.\" This time you're bigger than a bug, but somewhat smaller than a mouse.  At least most of your clothes shrank with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive tan and black shape erupts overhead and lands atop the bed. The day-pack you're on bounces upwards. Hanging on to the strap keeps you from being thrown off the bed. A gargantuan Max, muzzle looming above, parts cavernous jaws open as yard long fangs grip a day-pack strap. Max shakes the day-back, causing you to tumble off the day-back and onto frozen waves of bedding. The vast dog turns around. You roll sideways, avoiding a car sized hind paw impacting the bedding a mere shrunken foot away. The vast shape leaps off, carrying away your day-pack. Along with your peanut butter and the chocolate cake antidote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the dog will bolt out of the room, you shout out. \"Max!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog's vast head periscopes above the edge of the bedding. Jaws gripping the day-pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this day, you don't understand why you shouted out. \"You dumb mutt! Don't leave me here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead cocked, understanding running through the dog's eyes. A rumbling noise sounding like a laugh echos above you as the dog opens his jaws, dropping the day-pack on the floor. A vast, perspectively warped muzzle zooms towards you. Bristle lips parting exposing fangs framing a vast waterfall of pink zipping out like a front end loader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant tongue slaps against you, drowning out your shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's tongue scoops up the tiny figure on the bed. Jaws close. The German shepherd tilts his head upwards. Max lowers his muzzle to the floor, empty jaws snag the day-pack. The large dog trots out the door. Toe nails clitter clattering down the stair treads. The blaring TV masks the noise of canine paws pushing open a screen door and a dark furred shape darting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or that weird sensation of sliding down the slimiest of water slides and landing breathless within a damp humid sauna of pillow bumps. Pitch black, bouncing all around. Swaying madly. Gasping for breath in the dank. It dawns on you where you are. Inside the belly of dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber sways as you shout. \"Heeeeelp!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe internal noises of dog lungs and belly gurgles answer back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with another voice. \"Oye!

Illuminating the ridged gloom of moist, rippled walls inside Max's stomach. The whole affair swaying to and fro in tune to vast dog legs no doubt trotting briskly outside. The light attached to the tip of a sagging glowing pointy hat belonging to a soaked, gnome like being your own size. Dressed in dark clothing, badly slimed and wearing what appears to be a long thin beard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome, or what looks like one looks in your direction. \"Relax! The peanut butter you et will keep you from becoming a snack for Max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eerg! Who are you!?\" A jolt pitches you against the side of the belly wall as the gnome grumbles loudly. More to himself than answering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deliver a message Harlo, she sez. Sneak it in his suitcase. Max will keep an eye out fo ya. Damn mutt slept while you ran up the stairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer, \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the belly 'room' pitches upwards in a massive jolt, everything seems to free fall all around as Max has taken a huge leap. You're pitched up against the gnome as the two of you tumble into a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had to came home early!\" The gnome shouts. \"I snarfed down a chunk o peanut butter to shrink and hide from you. Got atop the bed just as you started to pound on the door. Course I had to pull Max's ear and open my big trap 'Hide me Max. Hide me!' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the 'room' brakes, causing you and the gnome to slide into one slimy side. The belly tilts as all seems to have gone still. Except for the frantic bellows noise of vast canine lungs panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome with the glowing hat tip pushes you off of him. \"And Max takes me literally. He shore taint  the brightest Fammy that Eleanor has got. But he had enough smarts to take that pack of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this. Being shrunk, riding inside the stomach of a dog, and having a grumpy gnome grousing at you is just too surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what's going on?\" You call out amidst the swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome gruffs, \"It's all about the peanut butter and cake you stole last Summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room sways again in a slow back and forth motion. Then becomes still. The gnome grumps, \"Feels like Max is where he wants to be. This is where we get off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHat tip still glowing like a flashlight, his soaked gnarled face glares at you. No doubt you're looking just as slimed and messy looking. He reaches out a gnarled clawed hand, gripping yours. You pull your hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\" The gnome gruffs, \"Are ya gonna stay here?\" You sputter as the gnome laughs. \"And wait for Max to let you out the slow way? Through the back door? I think not. Now take me hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the Gnome's hand grip yours.

A hard plain of linoleum beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby you hear that voice. \"That dog could have least had the courtesy to recline when I teleported us out of there!

More similar structures can be seen in the distance. Metal chair legs and the like. Other than Max, no one else, or at least their feet, can be seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" You stutter. Taking a breath, you calmly ask again. \"I mean, it...it looks like a classroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. North Annex. Room 5\" The Gnome replies. \"It's Eleanor O'Gelly's Language Lab. She teaches when she ain't making spells and stuff. Though the college stuff isn't my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed you stare at the gnome. He shrugs putting out a gnarly hand, \"I'm Harlo, former garden gnome.  Messenger for the Iletium Witches.\" He slaps himself. \"Oooo, I shouldn't have said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Iletium?\" You reply as you shake Harlo's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later. First things first. Let's get some stuff out of your day-pack.\" Harlo hikes over to the hillock of day-pack, wriggling his way through a partly opened flap leading to the cavernous interior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to chatter, voice sounding muffled. \"Hey! I forgot to ask your name! Even though I already know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Johnny.\" You reply to the day-pack flap entryway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet ya Johnny. Though I'd prefer in different circumstances.\" The muffled voice becomes clearer as Harlo emerges, one hand holding a huge, crumbly spongey piece of chocolate cake. The cake piece is comically enlarged as Harlo is just as small as you. The other hand is yanking on what looks like a tattered blanket of white. A Kleenex no doubt left in the bottom of your day-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo's gnarly hand drops the Kleenix 'blanket'. Out of a side, leathery leg pocket, he pulls out a wicked looking knife!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fuzzy white napkin piling around your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use that to wipe yourself down. Don't think you'd like to swimming in dog belly slime for the rest of yer days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo slices another length of Kleenix and begins to towel himself down. Singing a ditty. \"Never a bath I'll take! Give me rainwater, a birdbath and a garden to sleep..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Harlo's lead, you do the same, wiping your face, neck and clothes. Paying attention to clean off your shirt and summer shorts as best as possible. Grimacing at the yellowy, smelly stuff being swept up by the Kleenix. While wiping your bare legs, you notice that you have no socks or shoes. They didn't shrink with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  My shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You likely left them at the House. Come away from the table leg.\" Harlo calls out. He then looks up at the towering seated dog nearby. \"Max, stay where yer are. We're going to be elevating up in minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo hikes away to a clear spot in the class room, the row between desks. He motions for you to follow.  The gnome holds out a piece of chocolate cake. You take the over sized crumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat it yet. Give me some room too!\" Harlo moves several shrunken yards away from you. \"Snack away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair munch down on the cake. Almost at once, you feel that ticklish sensation, just like last Summer. Wobbling as you can feel the ground shift underneath the soles of your feet, the table legs start to descend. Everything is falling down around you as you grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, having grown back to your old size, all seems normal. Except for standing in an empty classroom, who knows how far away from your Aunt's house. With clothes still damp and smelling lightly of dog vomit and being barefoot as well.  The ceiling lights are unlit.  The nearby room door is shut. The latch turned to the lock position.  By the teacher's desk is a large window. Both side windows are open, letting a breeze in. Beyond the window is a view of a short bit of tall grass with some brush and trees in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, you ask. \"How did we get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eleanor usually leaves the window open during the summer. Max jumped through it while he carried us and the backpack.  Pretty smart for a familiar isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of Eleanor's circle keep cats, but she's allergic to cat fur. So she picked out a dog to be her familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a cold nose brushing your leg. It's Max, normal in size. The large silky furred German shepherd looks up at you, tail wagging as he wuffs.  You get the idea that Max sounds apologetic.  Despite the ordeal of traveling here, you find yourself petting the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Max. I'm not mad at you for swallowing me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's tail wags, kicking up a fair sized breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max tells me you're a fine lad too,\" said Harlo as he strides towards your day-pack. He picks it up, rummaging through it. \"I guess we can trust you to help us after all. Ah, the jar is safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mutters more to himself. \"I wish Eleanor would hurry up and get here. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harlo. What's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Long story short. Eleanor's a witch. She and others cooked up this purple peanut butter to condense magic. The shrinking effect and cake is just a side show.  But a few witches got jealous about her work. So she hid it for safe keeping last Summer. She gave it to your Aunt with a story about it being a rare sample jar that needed to be stored away in a cool spot. Of course your Uncle, the unknowing daft bugger, tossed out the refrigerator and you found the peanut butter and cake in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who printed the note I found in my suitcase? It's not my Aunt's handwriting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo opens his mouth, \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo paused as Max started to growl, the long haired German shepherd's ears swiveled in the direction of the Classroom door.  The dog glances back at Harlo, muttering a series of gruffs and huffs to the gnome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze!\" said Harlo, \"He's coming down the hallway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarlo runs over to you, shoving the day-pack into your hands. \"Take this!\"  He points to the open classroom window. \"Jump out there and hide underneath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoved by Harlo, you're almost thrown out the open window, along with the day-pack. Fortunately, the drop is a yard or so. You land roughly against the ground, grabbing your day-pack and hugging the building siding underneath the window.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome's head glances out the window, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!\" Harlo hisses, \"Stay there. Keep quiet and don't move till I tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug the side of the building, crouched, bare feet against the rough grass. quietly listening to the metallic sound of a door bolt opening inside the classroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hearing a thunderous roar you turned to look at the doors onto the playground and saw a class of titanous kindergarteners come out to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'little' kids were massive forces of nature, towering 20,000ft tall compared to you, though of course for the moment this was the smallest you'd ever been, probably something Harlo had done. Likely to avoid the kids who'd no doubt question your being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to ask what was up, four of the monstrous boys came running over in a game of tag, each step creating an earthquake. You couldn't see much besides there feet, the one in the lead was in skating shoes, the next was in sandals, and after that barefoot, the kid who was apparently 'it'  trailed behind in blue flip-flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped right in front of you and Harlo, beads of sweat the size of lakes splashing down all around, the titan slipped his feet out and sat them down right in front of  you, 714ft tall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....</span></div></div>",

The giant's hand came down next to you, and a bracelet slipped down right behind you, pinning your tiny little foot in a crack in the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might, the bracelet weighted tons, nothing on your scale was gonna move it, at least not any time soon. Meanwhile the giant moved his arm a bit and the whole bracelet moved, but still did you no good, then you saw the titan toes move closer as the kid adjusted his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only were you trapped by the bracelet, but also crushed by some 'little' kid's tiny toes, it was amazing how much things changed with size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the kid's hand suddenly moved and the sky overhead was blocked out by some weird, tube  covered object, a massive protrusion from it struck into the foot and it was jerked back and away from you. The enormous object moved and came down in front of you, it was Max's paw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at his 900ft long strands of fur, and at the dog's toes, 1500ft tall, at least last time you were bigger than them. The dog dug its paw into a near by mass of mad, ultra-sticky and moved his paw all over the board on which you stood, It neared, trapping you and Harlo between his toes and walking off, covering miles fractions of minutes, of course he had miles long strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he walked you examined your new enviroment, a landscape of massive boulders, fur bridges, and mud, which you were covered in anyway, what next?</span></div></div>",

Traveling inside Max and huddled next to a classroom annex building has been too much to handle. Spooked, you grip your daypack and slouch off as if to run away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you get the sensation of something invisible gripping your neck. Something like four points latching on your neck. Not painfull, but firm enough to be felt. And the strangest sensation of all...as if being a puppet on strings, your body decides to move on it's own accord. Crouching back down where to you where before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to make things even stranger, you hear something, almost like a voice inside your head, a gruffing growling voice telling you to stay where you are and not move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of being gripped goes away. Leaving you huddled by building siding, underneath the classroom window. Above, the sounds of two voices talking to one another drift downwards. One of them is Harlo's.
