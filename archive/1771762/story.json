Kakashi had already left, and the three genin were just about to do the same when something caught Naruto's attention. He saw something sticking out of a bush. He walked over to it and pulled it out to see what it was. It was a scroll. The blond ninja then opened it up to read its contents. \"It looks instructions for a jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of jutsu?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. It doesn't say.\" Naruto said. \"Guess we'll just have to try it out to find out what it does.\" he said as he started doing the necessary seals to preform it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think thats such a good idea. You have no idea what it could do.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. We should take that to someone like Kakashi-sensei before you try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't be so scared you two. It'll be fine.\" he said, just as he finished perfoming it. There was a flash of light that filled the three's vision.</span></div></div>",

Even if her body hadn't changed, she now believed that she was Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm the Hokage now.\" he thought to himself with a smirk. He then thought of how he had been called here before, and then thought up a quick excuse since he didn't really know the real reason Tsunade had called him there. \"Sakura, I just wanted you to practice with the basics medical jutsu today. You know its important not to become rusty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked a bit unsure, and Naruto knew it was a bit of a flimsy excuse, but she didn't really have any reason to doubt him so she replied \"Uh, okay Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to be a bit busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lady Tsunade.\" Tsunade replied before leaving to do as Naruto had told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was alone, Naruto looked around the office. \"Now that I'm Hokage, what should I do first?\" he thought to himself. It was then that a mischievous grin appeared on his face as he came up with an idea. Looking at the Life Swap Jutsu scroll, he thought up the perfect way to use it on people. Since as far as anyone else was concerned, he was Tsunade, the Hokage of the village, he could call in anyone he wanted. That would give him the perfect way to pick the people he wanted to swap around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who should I swap first?\" he wondered aloud. It was shortly after he said that when Shizune entered into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back, Lady Tsunade.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I guess Shizune would be a decent first victim.\" he thought. \"Now the only question is, who should I swap her with? I guess it should be someone that would make this funny, seeing them acting as Shizune and Shizune acting as them.\" After thinking a bit, Naruto got an idea of who. \"Shizune, could you please bring me...\"</span></div></div>",

Finally, he found a mission that seemed perfect for Shino\u2019s abilities and could be done solo. He put the mission in front of him on the desk just as Shizune walked in with Shino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need, Lady Hokage?\u201d Shino asked in his usual monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled as he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a special mission for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore continuing, Naruto opened the scroll and allowed the special jutsu to work its magic. When the light died down, Naruto struggled to contain his happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside his desk holding Tonton (Tsunade\u2019s pet pig) was Shino, but he was dressed in Shizune\u2019s clothes. He wore a blue kimono with white trimming held with an obi sash while low-heeled sandals adorned his feet. Shino\u2019s face was completely visible to Naruto now, including his brown eyes. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he like to show himself to people?\u201d Naruto wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the front of the desk, Naruto could only guess that Shizune was standing waiting to be given Shino\u2019s mission. Shino\u2019s clothes, which consisted of black pants, a black knee-length high-collared shirt and hunter green coat with hood, obstructed most of her body from view except for her nose and eyes. Even then, Shino\u2019s sunglasses covered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Tsunade,\u201d Shizune said, now with a monotone much like Shino\u2019s, \u201cwhat is this special mission you have for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back into reality, Naruto told Shizune, \u201cWell, Shino, I\u2019m sending you on a mission to the Land of Rice Paddies for a week. The citizens could use your expertise on insects to help create a method of farming that ensures insect swarms won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded and said, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d She then turned around and walked out the door. As soon as they were alone, Shino walked in front of Naruto\u2019s desk, gave a small smile and said, \u201cI thought for sure that kind of mission would make Shino show a little emotion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Shino and said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s still time for him to come out of his shell, Shizune. Just give it time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a more serious tone, Shino said, \u201cAnyway, Milady, I wanted to ask if you got those forms filled out yet. The Daimyo won\u2019t appreciate it if they\u2019re late this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto handed Shino the papers and said, \u201cHere, I got them done before I spoke with Sakura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino happily accepted the papers and said, \u201cI\u2019ll get these sent out right away. Is there anything else you need, Milady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto said, \u201cNot at the moment. I\u2019ll probably be asking for more people to be coming in before the day is done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Lady Tsunade. Call me if you need me for anything.\u201d With that, Shino walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burst out laughing as soon as Shino left. \u201cThis scroll really is incredible! Shino\u2019s finally has a personality! Man, if I could get him to show emotions, who knows what it could do with the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rummaged through the papers in the desk and fished out a file on a certain kunoichi. After getting a grin, Naruto called out, \u201cShizune, send in Hinata!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Naruto have planned for Hinata</span></div></div>",

However, he couldn't seem to decide on what would be funniest. There were plenty of people that it would be funny to see act like Hinata, and plenty of people it would be funny to see Hinata act like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he contemplated the idea, he thought of something. He could swap Hinata into Shizune's life, which would put Shino into her life. That way, it would be hilarious to see Shino act like the timid Hyuga girl, and putting Hinata into Shizune's life, she would always be around for him to \"save for later\" in a way if he came up with an idea of whose life to swap her into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis decision made, he looked around the pile of papers for a mission that would be a decent excuse to have called Tsunade. After a minute of looking, he found one that would be good enough, and placed it in front of his desk and waited for Hinata, and fortunately, he didn't have to wait long. A few minutes later, Shino entered in with Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need, Lady Hokage?\" Hinata asked in her usual timid tone, though Naruto noticed it lacked the stutter he would always hear from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I wonder why that is?\" he thought to himself briefly. \"Oh well, not important.\" \"Hinata, I've got a mission for you.\" he told her. Then like with Shino and Shizune, Naruto opened the scroll and used the Life Swap Jutsu once more. When the light died down, Naruto managed to contain his laughter once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Shino had been previously, Hinata now stood dressed in Shizune\u2019s clothes. He also noticed something else, in that her eyes seemed different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to where Hinata had stood, Shino was now in her place. He was now dressed in her lavender and cream colored jacket, blue pants, and a had the headband tied around his neck. He also noticed that Shino's eyes were now white, possessing the Hyuga clan's Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of mission, Lady Tsunade?\" Shino asked, now speaking with Hinata's timid tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a nearby village has been having some problems with wild animals ambushing traders on the routes between their villages. I want you to go with them and guard them from attacks since your Byakugan would be perfect to spot any attackers before they reach the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay Lady Tsunade.\" Shino replied, sounding slightly nervous. He then bowed politely before leaving the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Hinata is up for such a mission alone, Lady Tsunade?\" Hinata asked, sounding a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she can handle it by herself.\" Naruto replied. After Hinata left the room, Naruto once again burst out laughing. \"Man, this is hilarious! Seeing Shino go from acting like himself to acting like Shizune, then to acting like Hinata is a riot! Now, who should my next victim be?\" Naruto said as he looked though the files on the desk, and eventually came to one on a certain ninja. With another grin, Naruto called out to Hinata. \"Shizune, bring in Rock Lee next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what does Naruto have planned for Lee?</span></div></div>",

However, not wanting Hinata or anyone else to take a peek, he decided to hide it carefully in one of the pockets of Tsunade's coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata arrived with Lee and Shikamaru, Naruto wasted no time in switching the two. He again struggled to contain himself when he saw Shikamaru in Lee's green spandex jumpsuit and jacket while Lee stood uninterested and slightly embarrassed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade, what's the new mission?\" Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A request to help fortify a trading post on the edge of the Land of Fire. Lee will be going to set up a training regiment for those selected as sentries so they can defend their village. You'll set up defenses against any possible threats to the village. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Hokage!\" Shikamaru yelled out. \"Do not worry, my training regiment will make sure the sentries can defeat their enemies with the power of youth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, Lee,\" Lee told Shikamaru. \"I assume we'll be leaving right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an hour to get everything ready, then you leave for these coordinates,\" Naruto said, handing Lee a piece of paper with the location of the town in the request. \"Don't fail me, Shikamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" Lee responded. \"It's Lee that you should be worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do nothing to slow us down, Shikamaru, you have my word!\" Shikamaru cried out in response. \"Now, since there is an hour before we leave, I shall do 100 laps around Konoha!\" As Shikamaru ran out the door to do his laps, Lee followed, sighing, \"What a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata came up to Naruto's side and said, \"I don't think you've given out this many assignments before, milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just in that kind of mood. I think the mission requests have been piling up around here,\" Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some time at the Hot Springs? I know how tired you can get after a day like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a moment to think about it. On one hand, Naruto could accept Hinata's offer and take a moment to relax before continuing his fun, or he could blow it off and keep having fun swapping people around. \"Man, this is tough,\" he thought. \"What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Plus, since he had Tsunade's life, that meant everybody would see and treat him as if he were her, and that meant he could go into the women's side without any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.

It was then that he was reminded that he now had all of Tsunade's skills now in place of his own.

I need to use the rest room real quick.\" he excused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" she said and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then snuck up to the two, though kept his distance so as not to get caught. He then listened to the conversation between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Pervy Sage, I want to do some training! Teach me some new techniques!\" Sakura begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Naruto! Can't you see that I'm in the middle of my research?\" Jiraiya replied, annoyed by her pestering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held back his laughter so as not to be discovered. It was pretty funny watching this play out from the outside instead of doing the begging, plus it was funny seeing Sakura acting like him and begging Jiraiya to train her. But he knew how to make this even funnier. Taking out the scroll, he performed the Life Swap Jutsu once more, and when the flash caused by the technique disappeared, he saw that Sakura and Jiraiya had swapped places. Jiraiya was now dressed in Nruto's usual orange and black attire, while Sakura now wore Jiraiya's green short shirt kimono and matching pants, and red coat, complete with the head plate he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, leave me alone so I can finish my research.\" Sakura said in a lecherous tone as she picked up where the owner of her current life left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine! Be that way!\" Jiraiya complained as he crossed his arms in frustration, giving up for now, but staying nearby as he waited for Sakura to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wanted to explode with laughter as he watched the interactions between the two. It was absolutely hilarious seeing Sakura act like Jiraiya's perverted self, while seeing Jiraiya himself act like him was an added bonus, a sort of revenge for the times he had been in this situation. Leaving, he made his way back to the entrance of the hot springs, and let out some laughter at what he had just done. \"Now me and Sakura are the Sannin, while Tsunade and Jiraiya are our apprentices! Man, this jutsu is great!\" he thought as he put the scroll back in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then entered in, and when into the women's locker room and took off Tsunade's clothing that he now wore and deposited them in a locker before walking into the springs, and saw Hinata already inside sitting in the water. He looked around the spring at all the women in the springs, and enjoying the sight of being able to look into the women's side without repercussions for once. He may be male, but everyone else viewed him as Tsunade, so he wouldn't have any problems. He may not be on the Pervy Sage's level, but he was perverted in his own right, and right now, he was in a possition that Jiraiya could only dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is just great.\" he said as he stepped into the water next to Hinata, refering both to it and his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it sure is relaxing, Lady Tsunade.\" Hinata replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Naruto said as he took a look around, enjoying the sight of Hinata and the other women relaxing in the springs with him.</span></div></div>",

You can only wish to have a pair of boobs like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggled to contain his laughter as he watched Kiba brag about having boobs when he clearly didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked over to Kiba and said, \"Ino, you shouldn't act like that, even in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade, however, stood and angrily stared Kiba down. \"Well, excuse me for not being a big-breasted bimbo like you, Ino-Pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba returned Tsunade's angry glare and said, \"What did you say, Billboard-Brow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please!\" Hinata pleaded. \"This is supposed to be a time of relaxation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of where this was leading, Naruto stood and tried to calm the situation. Unfortunately, Kiba and Tsunade had gotten into a catfight that quickly got the attention of every other woman in the spring. In his mind, he screamed, \"Crap!

I'm actually surprised you sent Hinata and Shino on solo missions. Kiba's a great tracker and all, but it's just not the same without the whole team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Kurenai, but they needed to be on those specific missions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a load off my shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, milady,\" Tenten said as she bowed and walked out of the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly removed his (Tsunade's) clothes and waited while Hinata and Tsunade were just starting to disrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady, is there something wrong?\" Tsunade asked. \"If you're already done disrobing, you can go on ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to spend as much time off with my apprentices as possible, so I'll wait and we'll enter the spring together,\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Sakura,\" Hinata told Tsunade. \"Lady Tsunade does things like this from time to time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, Tsunade proceeded with removing her (Sakura's) clothes while Hinata continued to remove her (Shizune's) clothes. Naruto sat containing his excitement as he saw two beautiful and busty women disrobing in front of him. He was especially awed at Hinata. \"Whoa, Hinata's hot! Why doesn't she show off her body more?\" he thought. The best part of the experience for him, though, was neither Tsunade nor Hinata felt embarrassed about being naked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the girls were naked, Naruto walked with them to the spring, where plenty of other women sat and chatted with each other. Nobody in the room was disturbed that Naruto was the only male in the room. Pleased about the evening, Naruto sank into the spring's waters alongside Hinata and Tsunade with a content smile and a relaxed, \"I'll never get tired of this.\"</span></div></div>",

I need you both to go to a village on the outskirts of the Land of Fire. The place has been having trouble with some bandits raiding the village.\" he explained to the swapped duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some bandits? Doesn't sound like much. Hardly worth a B-rank.\" Tenten said, now speaking with Neji's stoic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bandits have shown the ability to use some ninjutsu, and are believed to be a group of low rank missing ninja. But its nothing you two can't handle.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it isn't.

Their trip here had been strange. Once back in the village, they had tried not to be seen at first, but they found that no one seemed to react to their state of dress, and weirder yet, they had run into their friends who treated them as if they were the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! I think I found something.\" Sakura called over Naruto to her location, and the book she had open before her. \"Its a book of myths, and I found a picture of a scroll with markings that match the one you found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then what does it say?\" Naruto asked as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says it the life swap jutsu.\" Sakura said as she began to read the book out loud. \"According to legend, using this jutsu will switch the lives of any two people. Those affected by this technique will switch lives with the other affected by it. Only those affected by the jutsu will be aware of change, and those who weren't will treat those affected by the technique as if they are the person whose life they now. When people are affected, they will switch abilities, including bloodlines, with those whose life they are in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats sounds strange, but we can't really deny it.\" Naruto said. \"Does it say why the scroll might have gone blank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see...

She moved her tongue around in her mouth and felt very pronounced canine teeth. Looked at her hands and saw her nails were much longer and shaped like claws instead of her regular nails. Though it looked like she was still a girl she was dressed in Kiba\u2019s clothes. Akimaru barked bringing Sakura\u2019s attention back to him.

She didn\u2019t even know what happened, but she did have an idea. She looked at Akimaru and said \u201cyou know what boy, I am in the mood to see what naruto is doing lets go find him.\u201d Akimaru cocked his head in a confused way then barked \u201co\u2026..k, why are we going to go find him?\u201d sakura though akumaru would just go with it, now she had to think on her feet coming up with the excuse \u201cwell\u2026naruto,,,,,,might know where sakura is and she could look at my head, it is kind of painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could see that Akumaru was skeptical about why she wanted to go see him but blew it off and stood up waiting for Sakura to climb on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a clumsy mount of akumaru then they were off\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, he was no longer outdoors at all. It didn't take him long to realize just where he was now, though. He had somehow been transported to the Hokage's office, and was now seated behind Tsunade's desk. \"Huh? How did I get here?\" he questioned out loud. He then started to get up, not wanting the old lady to yell at him if she walked in to find him sitting at her desk. As he started to walk away, he felt that something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he discovered just what it was. He was no longer wearing his usual orange and black clothes, but rather different, yet still familar clothes. He wore a green coat, and under it was a gray, sleeveless blouse that showed off his flat chest with a dark blue obi sash tied around his waste, and dark blue pants. On his feet were open-toed heels that showed his toenails were painted with red polish, and he then noticed that his fingernails were also the same way. \"What the hell? Why am I dressed like granny?\" he asked out loud. Indeed, everything about his state of dress currently was Tsunade's. Though stangely enough, the clothes fit him perfectly, as if they were meant for him and not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get a better look at himself, he walked over to a nearby mirror, not noticing he had no problem walking in heels, despite never having worn them before, his hips swaying unnoticed as well. In the mirror, he saw his his attire, as well as his face, with pink lipstick on his lips, and a violet colored diamond on his forehead. His hair, while still the same color, was now much longer, and styled into two ponytails with his bangs framing his face. \"Just what the hell is going on?\" he repeated, taking n the sight of how rediculous he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that someone walked without walking. \"I've got some paperwork for you, Lady Tsunade.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune!?\" he let out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for startling you, Lady Tsunade.\" Shizune apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" 'Does she think I'm Lady Tsunade or something? But how?' he though, taking a seat back at the desk as Shizune placed the paperwork on the desk, continuing to act as if Naruto were Tsunade. He then saw the scroll that he found earlier was sitting on the desk now. 'Does it have something to do with that scroll I found?'</span></div></div>",

I'll be back later. And please don't slack off like you usually do.\" she said, and with that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Naruto was alone, he stood up and took another look at himself. Here he was dressed like Tsunade, and even though he looked nothing like her, apparently people thought that he really was her. \"Man, this is just so weird.\" he said. He then looked at the scroll that he had found. He wondered just how the jutsu in it had done this. And what about Sakura? She had been nearby when he used it. And what about granny. If he was her, then did that mean she was him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the paperwork. \"Ah, forget that. I may not know what happened, but if I'm granny, then that makes me Hokage.\" he said with a smirk. That was a bright side to this whole situation. \"I gotta enjoy this while I can. The stupid paperwork can wait.\" he said, and with that, he pocketed the scroll and jumped out the window.</span></div></div>",

He now wore a white one-strap flak jacket, and under it was no shirt, and black pants. Around his neck was a white scarf, around his waist was a red rope, and he also had white hand and shin guards. Other things of note were that he had a pair of sunglasses on, explaining his darker vision, a tattoo on his shoulder, and seven sword sheathed on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned back to Sakura, who looked to just be finishing up taking her in change in attire. \"What happened?

The experiment was a machine that, if his theory was correct, could in effect, transplant the spiritual pressure of one into the other, and vice versa, which in layman's terms could essentially result swapping said people's abilities, or maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that should do it.\" he said as he finished the fine tuning of the machine. \"Nemu, get in here.\" he ordered, and his Lieutenant stepped into the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you assist me so that I can activate the machine so we can begin preparations for testing.\" he informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, press the buttons on the other side of the machine.\" She walked around to the other side as instructed, and he told her what to do and what to input as he did his own work from his console. Once done, he activated the machine, and its lights turned on as it started up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things would not go according to his calculations, and after a few momnets, it began to emit sparks, and suddenly parts of the machine exploded and pieces fell off. Mayuri sighed. \"Such a shame. All that effort for naught.\" Mayuri said. \"Oh well, back to the drawing board. Nemu! Clean up the mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" she complied and began to pick up the pieces of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets see, what went wrong in the test?\" he commented out loud as he read through his notes on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unknown to him, it the machine caused a strange distortion for an instant, sending a sort of \"ripple\" through the Soul Society, Karakura Town in the living world, and Hueco Mundo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the world of the living, the first to experience the results of Mayuri's failed experiment was none other than Ichigo Kurosaki. Currently, it was morning, and he was still asleep in his bed. As he was lying there, his body was suddenly surrounded by a strange glowing aura, and in an instant, he was replaced by Orihime in his bed. Said girl continued to sleep soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, in Orihime's home, Ichigo was just begining to awaken as an alarm clock went off next to the bed he now slept in. Reaching over to turn it off, he was half asleep, and still hadn't realized that he wasn't in his home yet. Absentmindedly walking over to the bathroom, he was glad that he hadn't had to deal with his father this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the bathroom, he looked at himself in the mirror, and noticed that something was off. \"That doesn't look like what I went to bed in...\" he said, and then looked down. \"WHAT THE HELL!?\" he yelled out in shock. For some reason, instead of his usual pajamas, he was now wearing a girl's nightie. \"How the hell did I get in this!?\" It was then that for the first time that morning, he began to realize that he wasn't in his home. Stepping out of the bathroom, he looked around and recognized the place as Orihime's home. \"What am I doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decides to look around the home to see if he could find Orihime and maybe how he got here. As he did, he then noticed something weird. As he passed by some of the pictures in Orihime's home, he had remembered seeing them when he had been here in the past. However, the pictures were not all as he remembered them. For example, there was a picture that had been of her and Tatsuki taken after school one day, where in it the two wore standing next to other. Now however, Orihime wasn't in the picture, but instead he was, and he was wearing her uniform! His expression and posture even matched how hers had been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" he wondered to himself.</span></div></div>",

Who ever that is at the door, I do not want them to see me like this...\" he said to himself, looking down at the nightie he was wearing. \"What am I gonna do now?\" he thought. He obviously had no intention of answering the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him,it didn't look like he woud have a choice, as he watched as the doornob turned, and the door opened, revealing Tatsuki. \"Oh sorry, Orihime. I didn't know you weren't dressed.\" she said. And she said that not as a joke or insult at his current embarrassing state of dress, but sounded casual and a bit apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked over to Tatsuki, ans studied her expression, which didn't seem to show any hint of a reaction to anything being strange. Now Tatsuki was perhaps his oldest friend, and they had known each other since they were kids, and he knew she'd never be able to stay calm at seeing him like this. Either she'd be laughing her ass off at him wearing the nightie, or be flipping out at him in Orihime's house alone dressed in what he assumed was Orihime's nightie. Either way, he normally would see some kind of reaction. Even if this was some kind of elaborate practical joke, she would have let things slip and burst out laughing by now.However, she showed none. She appeared to be acting normally, and didn't even bat an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Orihime, you're spacing out again.\" Tatsuki said, , interupting his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just call me Orihime?\" he thought to himself in confusion. And it was then that he started to realize that she had called him Orihime earlier. He then glanced back over to the pictures, in which he had replaced Orihime in all of them. \"Have I somehow swapped places with Orihime? How is that even possible!?\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you should get dressed already, Orihime.\" Tatsuki said. \"We don't want to be late for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right, I've got school today...\" Ichigo thought. Altough, from the looks of it, it was looking like he would be going to school as Orihime. \"Uh, give me a moment to get ready, Tatsuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then returned to Orihime's room alone, and took off the nightie and threw it into the laundry. After a few minutes, he stepped out of Orihime's room, dressed in Orihime's school uniform. It was strange, because even though he and Orihime were different sizes, all of it seemed to fit him perfectly, as if it had been made for him instead of her. He was also wearing, much to his chagrin, a pair of panties and a bra. The bra was the oddest part, and further proved that he had somehow swapped places with Orihime. Now, Orihime was quite gifted in the chest area, possessing pretty large assests. However, all the bras in her drawer looked to have been made for an extremely flat chested girl rather than someone as busty as Orihime. And if he had to guess, he'd say that all of her clothing now fit him better than they would her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" he replied as he grabbed Orihime's schoolbag, and the two left, and Ichigo wondered just what the hell was going on.</span></div></div>",

Each morning, they would be greeted by their friends Keigo and Chizuru, and those two had indeed been who greeted them, but they were not as they normally would be. Chizuru was currently lying on the ground by Orihime's feet, and she was wearing the school's boys uniform and didn't have her glasses on. And Keigo was currently lying on the ground under Tatsuki's foot, wearing the girls uniform, and even had Chizuru's glasses on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizuru?\" Orihime questioned quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keigo?\" Ichigo questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Chizuru got up and looked to Orihime. \"Why do you always do that, Ichigo?\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" she wasn't sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're annoying, Asano.\" another of their friend, Mizuiro said as he came up to them, Chad silently following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop calling me by my last name!\" she complained to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stop doing that to Orihime, Chizuru!\" Tatsuki yelled to Keigo as she took her foot of of him and he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't stop me. My passion is too strong to be dissuaded by your strength!\" Keigo said in response, which earned him another kick from Tatsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, Orihime, and Renji were speechless as they watched in confusion. Like with them, it looked like Keigo and Chizuru had swapped places with one another. But unlike with them, they were acting like and actually believed that they were who they swapped with! Keigo believed he was the proud lesbian Chizuru, and Chizuru believed she was the goofy and hyperactive Keigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things just keep getting weirder...\" Ichigo thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the Soul Society, Rukia had made her way to the Lieutenants meeting. And her trip there had been quite the odd one. Like with Byakuya, everyone was treating her as if she was Renji. \"I wonder if Renji is in the World of the Living in a similar situation?\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the Lietenants meeting, she entered. \"Hey Renji.\" Rangiku greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rangiku.\" Rukia replied. Looking around, she saw most of the other lieutenants were already there. The only ones missing were \"Rukia\", who was in the world of the living, and Yachiru and Nanao. Rukia then took Renji's seat and thought about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everybody!\" a voice with a cheerful and childish tone greeted everyone. Rukia assume that Yachiru, the young Lietenant of Squad 11 had arrived. Though she thought something was really off about the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yachiru.\"  someone greeted her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rukia turned to see the young girl, she was met with surprise. Instead of seeing Yachiru, she instead saw Nanao! She watched as Nanao ran over and took Yachiru's seat. She was wearing the normal uniform, but with the badge from the 11th Squad. Her glasses were also msiing from her face, and in her hair she also had the crossbone hairclip  that Yachiru had begun to wear lately. And she also seemed to have the same blush on her  cheeks that Yachiru always had. As she sat their, she happily ate the snacks that were on the table, a habit that Yachiru had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she \"Sorry I'm late.\" she heard someone say, and turned to see Yachiru walk calmly into the room. \"I had to do some things for my captain.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright, Lietenant Ise.\" Izuru said. \"You're exactly on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYachiru currently wore the standard uniform, now with the Squad 8 badge on her arm. She also had on a pair of glasses, which were the same one Nanao always wore, and was carrying a large book in her arms as Nanao often did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lietenant Abarai, what are you staring at?\" Yachiru asked Rukia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" Rukia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then please stop staring at me like that.\" Yachiru said, then looked around. \"I see Lietenant Kuchiki is still in the World of the Living. Now, lets see, the first oder of business is...\" she said as the meeting began, and Rukia noticed that Nanao was barely paying attention, if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia was dumbfounded by what she was seeing. Here was Yachiru, the childish, carefree and energetic young girl acting serious and calm. And then there was Nanao, who was acting nothing like her usual serious self, and was acting childishy and shirking off her responsibilities. And no one else noticed as they seemed to think that Yachiru and Nanao were each other, just as everyone else seemed to think she was Renji, though unlike her, they actually believed that was who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get to the World of the Living and see if I can find Renji...\" she thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

And then there was Nanao and Yachiru, who were viewed as each other similarly to her situation, but they actually believed they were each other as well! She watched as Nanao payed little attention to the meeting as she ate the snacks on the table, while Yachiru . Everyone except her was completely oblivious to the strange and sureal situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Abarai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving zoned out from her thoughts, she wasn't paying much attention. She was also not used to answering to Renji's name. Rukia continued thinking about just what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Abarai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the person addressing her that time, \"Huh? What?\" she let out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't ben paying attention to the entire meeting.\" Yachiru said, adjusting Nanao's glasses on her face. \"And you seem to have been staring at me and Lieutenant Kusajishi the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was? Sorry about that.\" Rukia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not feeling well, maybe you should go to Squad 4 and get yourself chacked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Rukia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I take you there and take a look at you, Renji?\" Isane suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" Rukia agreed, and the two left the meeting and went to Squad 4's facilities. Inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is everything alright, Renji?\" Isane asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've just got something else on my mind.\" Rukia replied truthfully. She was pretty sure that nothing was wrong with her, but this whole situation had her confused, and wondering what she was going to do. \"Say Isane, have you noticed anything strange lately? Like say, about me, or maybe Lietenant Ise or Kusajishi, or anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange? No, not really. Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Don't worry about it, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought of what to do, there was suddenly a bright flash next to her, and she turned to see that Isane was no longer next to her, and had instead been replaced by Hanataro Yamada. He also now had Squad 4's Lieutenant's badge on his arm, and Isane's thin, red earings dangling from his ears. \"Well, you seem perfectly okay, Renji.\" Hanataro said. He seemed to be completely unaware that anything was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, Lieutenant Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no problem at all, Renji.\" he replied, confirming Rukia's suspicion that he now believed that he was Isane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to get to the bottom of what is going on.\" Rukia thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

As class went on, they thought about their current situation. Ichigo, currently sitting in Orihime's usual seat, looked over to Orihime sitting in his own usual seat. Ichigo looked to the seat next to him where Tatsuki sat. As with this morning, she still thought he was Orihime, and so did everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been weird thus far, with everyone but the three of them believing that they were omeone else. And it was just as weird to see Keigo and Chizuru in a similar situation, but believing they were each other. It had also been a bit uncomfortable for Ichigo, as just as Chizuru would behave around Orihime, Keigo was acting around him. He had already made a few more attempts at \"groping\" him, though thankfully, Tatsuki was there to get him off of him. But Ichigo was confused as to why he seemed to be \"off\" and didn't seem to be able to react to him like he normally could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Renji, along with being viewed as if he was Rukia, he aslo had to deal with having to be in class. Now this wasn't the first time he had been in Ichigo's school, but it was the first time he actually had to participate in class. And he really didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Orihime, she was trying to work, but could seem to focus. It was weird enough that it had happened to her and Ichigo, and stranger when she found out they weren't alone and it had happened to Renji and Rukia. And it was stranger still with the situation with Keigo and Chizuru. It made her wonder, what if it happened to anyone else? And what if it kept happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs class went on, and Ichigo sat in his seat, there was suddenly a bright flash to his side, and when he turned to see what it was, he saw that Tatsuki, who had been sitting next to him moments ago, was no longer there. In her place was now a very familiar person; the Arrancar Nelliel! She was in her adult form, and now wearing the normal girl's uniform, and the mask that should have been on top of her head currently wasn't there. Noticing him staring, Nelliel looked over to him. \"Something wrong, Orihime?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I'm fine.\" Ichigo replied. \"So she thinks she is Tatsuki?\" he thought. He then looked over to Orihime and Renji, and he knew that they had noticed everything too. But they were evidently the only ones, as just like with them, no one racted in the slightest to the sudden change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later in the day when school ended, the three agreed, wordlessly and unanimously, that they needed to start investigating this weird phenomenon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I'm gonna go back to the Soul Society and check up on Rukia.\" Renji said. \"If I'm her, then she is me. I'm gonna see if she is as aware as us. And I'm also gonna check to see if there are any other people affected there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Me and Orihime will check around Karakura Town while you do that.\" Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Renji.\" Orihime said. \"And if Rukia is aware like us, make sure you tell her about whats going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" Renji agreed. And with that, the red head parted ways with the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two started walking, they realized that they didn't really know what to do. \"Now what?\" Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure.\" Orihime said. \"Maybe we could try taking to Urahara about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But would he believe us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But if he doesn't, maybe we could try to get him to believe us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how would we do that? I mean, its like reality itself has altered with this whole weird thing. Back in your house, all the picture of you had me in your place instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be hard, but maybe we should at least try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we could.\" Ichigo agreed. As the two walked down the street, they felt their stomachs grumble, letting them know that they were hungry. \"Hey, lets get something to eat first though. My house is nearby, so lets stop by there. We'll go to Urahara's afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Orihime agreed, and the two turned the corner and walked towards the Kurosaki residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember, everyone thinks we're each other, so answer to my name when my sisters address you. And announce that we're there.\" Ichigo reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" As the two entered in, Orihime did as he had said. \"Hey, its me. Uh, just stopping by for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ichigo!\" a voice with a friendly tone greeted. It didn't sound like either of his sisters, but they did think it sounded familiar. When they entered the kitchen, they were surprised to see Hiyori Sarugaki of the Visored wearing the sailor fuku uniform of Yuzu and Karin's school. She was currently by the stove, and looked to be cooking some food. She was acting much differently than normal, and rather thank her usually aggressive and short-tempered attitude, she was acting much more calm, and had a much friendlier demeanor. \"Oh, hello, Orihime. I didn' know you were stopping by with my brother as well.\" she said as she saw Ichigo. \"Lucky I just started, I'll make some extra for you if you want to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" Ichigo and Orihime exchanged glances. \"So now Yuzu and Hiyori have swapped as well?\" they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orihime is here as well, huh?\" a new voice said as someone entered the room. Turning to see who it was, they saw another of the Visored, Mashiro Kuna. Like Hiyori, she also was currently wearing the sailor fuku uniform of Yuzu and Karin's school. Unlike her usual childish self, she was actually calm right now, and had a bored expression on her face that looked pretty odd on her. She walked over to the fridge and took a can of soda out and took a sip from it. \"Hey Ichigo.\" she said casually as hse sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ichigo, it was quite the odd sight. Not only because his younger sister had swapped, but who they had swapped with. He knew both Hiyori and Mashiro well enough to know that they were pretty different from his sisters they had swapped with. So it was weird seeing Hiyori think she was Yuzu and act like her, and the same for Karin and Mashiro. And it was just as odd for Orihime.</span></div></div>",

He hoped his sisters would be okay. \"But lets get to Urahara's for now. And lets hope that we can convince him of what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Soul Socoiety, Renji had arrived back. When he had left the gigai, he had found that his usual robes were slightly alter in the way Rukia wore hers. He also had Squad 13's badge, and Rukia's sealed Sode no Shirayuki at his side. It was also pretty weird as he was being addressed as \"Lieutenant Kuchiki\" by people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering around, he wondered where Rukia might be. And as if to answer his silent question, he saw the familiar short figure of his oldest friend turn a corner. \"Hey!\" he called out to her, and she turned to see him, and was surprised based off of her expression. Not sure if she was aware of the situation, he chose his words carefully. \"Hey, uh, Renji. I just got back and was wondering if you noticed anything, uh, strange lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange? Like what? Maybe about you?\" Rukia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've noticed, Renji.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god. I was getting worried you might think you were me, Rukia.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but we're not the only people experiencng this strange phenomenon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Ichigo and Orihime are also in the same boat as us with each other.\" Renji told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo and Orihime too?\" Rukia said, snickering a bit at the mental image of Ichigo dressed as Orihime. \"Not just them, either. Nanao and Yachiru have also swapped and believe that they're each other, and the same is true about Isane and Hanataro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of two other sets from when I was in the World of the Living. Keigo Asano and Chizuru Honsho have swapped places and believe that they are one another, and Tatsuki swapped with that Arrancar girl Nelliel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thats at least 6 different swaps so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we're aware of.\" Renji added. \"Who knows of whoever else could have been affected. Just look at with us swappng places even though we were both in different worlds at the time, and the same for Tatsuki and Nelliel. Theres no telling what could happen and who could swap with who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia thought a few minutes. \"I'd rather not, but it might be best that we speak to Captain Kurotsuchi about this.\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess its worth a try...\" Renji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the World of the Living, Ichigo and Orihime had just arrived at Urahara's shop. \"So, how should we go about this?\" Orihime asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Ichigo said, thinking about the best way to go about things.</span></div></div>",

I assume you both haven't noticed yet, but you both currently have the others reiatsu, with only a very slight and normally undetectable amount of your own remaining as part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Orihime said. \"And what is the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is also traces of an unknown energy having affected you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see... Nope, nothing odd with the both of you.\" Mayuri Kurotsuchi said as he looked over a paper with the results of the tests he had just ran on the two lieutenants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all?\" Rukia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. If you ask me, you both seem pretty delusional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Renji said. \"Thank you for the time, Captain Kurotsuchi.\" And with that, the two left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they left, Mayuri was back at his computer. \"My, how fascinating! To think that my machine actually succeeded earlier! Of course, its effects are currently too strong and is uncontrolable, but things are much more interesting right now!\" he said typing up on his computer. He had lied to Rukia and Renji before. While examining the two, he had detected the strange energy traces on them, and it was the exact same he had discovered a spike of from his machine before it failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, some data appeared on his screen. \"Ah, I see. The machine has caused a distortion which is giving the same readings as the traces of strange energy that those two had. Now, lets see... It looks like the distortion is linked between Karakura Town in the World of the Living, here in the Soul Society, and even in Hueco Mundo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, he had a liquid pour out from a nearby machine and he used a syringe to inject it into himself. \"There. Now, lets see.\" He pressed a few buttons and a pair of of videoo screens displayed similar pictures. During the examination, he had placed his video microbes in both of the two lieutenants, and could now use them as some of his means to examine the effects. \"Ah, good, it worked. I can now see those two for who the really are.\" The liquid in the syringe had two effects. Like with Rukia, Renji, Ichigo, and Orihime, he could now see people as who they really were instead of the life they were in. And the other effect was that it had made him immune to the effects of the distortion, so he wouldn't be swapping with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lets see who else might come under effect.\" he said as he began devising a way that would detect each swap as it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure at the moment.\" Urahara replied. \"Its gonna take some time to analyze this phenomenon. I guess for now all you can do is continue on as each other, and keep an eye out for any more swaps, and watch those also affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed at the fact that he was stuck like this for now. As he contemplated what to do, there was suddenly a bright flash in front of him and Orihime, and when it died down, Urahara was no longer in front of them, and had been replaced by Yoruichi. She was now dressed as Urahara, and from the looks of things, didn't notice anything strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, turns out there was just another swap, and it was you this time.\" Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't feel any different, and I didn't notice anything. I feel like Urahara. Who am I supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoruichi.\" Orihime told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, this does give me some extra data to examine someone who has swapped but doesn't notice. I'll also get in touch with Yoruichi and fill her in. Or should I say, I'll get in touch with Urahara and fill him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Anyway, we'll get going. Let us know if you find anything out, Yoru... hara?\" Ichigo said, not sure how to address her before he and Orihime left.</span></div></div>",

We'll just have to use them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay.\" Orihime said. Using the power of the badge, she felt the sudden sensation as he spirit left her physical body. Her spirit body was currently dressed in Ichigo's personal Soul Reaper robes, including the newer details it had gotten when he had regained his Soul Reaper powers. And on her back was his newer Zangetsu, and despite its size compared to her frame, she didn't seem to have any problems with it being too heavy for her. \"It looks like I really do have your powers.\" she said, noting how different they felt from her own. She felt stronger than she ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ichigo, recalling his training on how to use Fullbring, drew upon that knowledge to activate what were now his powers, and activated her Shun Shun Rikka. \"C'mon, it not too far.\" Running to the location, they saw a few hollows, all of which looked to be pretty weak and mindless ones. Orihime had gotten there first thanks to being faster now, though she had gone slow enough for Ichigo to keep up. When they arrived, Orihime immediately cut one down. \"Koten Zanshun!\" Ichigo called out, sending the attack at the nearest hollow.</span></div></div>",

He let out a yawn as he noticed Uryu walking on the other side of the street, they nodded to eachother in acknowledgement. Continuing along<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ichigo!\" Orihime greeted him cheerfully with a wave. Jogging over to him, she noticed Uryu and waved to him as well. \"Good morning to you too, Uryu!\" Who waved back but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Orihime.\" Ichigo greeted her. \"Not with Tatsuki today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she went to school early for karate club stuff.\" she said. \"Hey Uryu! Why don't you come over here and walk with us?\" she called over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats alright, I'm fine.\" he replied and continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two could contiue, they heard someone call out to them. \"Hey! Ichigo! Orihime!\" Turning around, they saw Rukia and a group of other shinigami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Renji greeted with her. The group of shinigami consisted of familiar faces. Other than Rukia and Renji, there was Izuru, Hisagi, Momo, Rangiku, Toshiro, and Soi Fon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey.\" Ichigo greeted. \"What are you all doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were heading to Urahara's.\" Rukia said. \"We were bringing something to him to examine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be important to require all of you.\" Ichigo commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Orihime asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know.

We weren't given details.\" Toshiro said as he held up a black box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder whats in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it dangerous?\" Ichigo questioned, and received shrugs.

Inside, Toshiro handed hi the black box. Opening it, he was met with an interesting sight. \"Hm? Whats this?\" he said as he lifted it up out of the box for everyone to see. It was a round, pink object with a crescent moon symbol on it. They could all feel a strange energy coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.

He saw that he was in an unfamilliar city that didn't look like Karakura town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt a breeze on his legs, and when he looked down to discover why, he was met with the biggest shock of his life. No longer in his school uniform, he was now dressed in the most rediculous thing he had ever worn. He now wore a seifuku style white uniform with a very short blue skirt, and a red bow in front. He also had a red choker with a crescent moon on the front, and wore white gloves that went up to his elbows and red heeled boots that went up to his knees. And though he couldn't see it, there was a gold tiara on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I wearing!?\" he said with a tone that reflected just how shocked he was.

She had his red shirt over her torso, but closed in the front to cover her breasts. She had his shorts on her legs, tied with a yellow sash, while his sandals adorned her feet. Lastly, she had Luffy's straw hat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy took a look at himself, noticing that he was now wearing Robin's clothes. He found his chest covered with Robin's purple top and his legs covered with her sarong skirt. Her high-heeled sandals covered his feet while his stomach remained exposed for the crew to see. Instead of his straw hat on his head, Luffy found Robin's sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy and Robin noticed their clothes had changed, like Luffy's clothes were made to fit Robin's body perfectly and vice versa. Also, both had the necklace around their necks, raising further questions in the Straw Hat Pirates' archaeologist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could voice her opinions, Chopper let out a groan. \"All that necklace did was replicate itself and put the copy on Luffy. What a let down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Usopp added. \"I expected something more dramatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin cautiously asked Sanji, \"Is that really all the necklace did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji blew some smoke from his cigarette out of his mouth and said, \"Afraid so, Luffy. You found a dud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji's remark made Robin's heart skip a beat. <i>\"Luffy? He called me Luffy? Is it possible that...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'dud,' Sanji?\" Nami interrupted. \"Luffy might have found a goldmine! If this thing can replicate itself every time it's worn, then we can sell the replicas at a market and make a fortune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough,\" Zoro said. \"We've got no more business on this island, so let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm getting creeped out here,\" Luffy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Nami said to Luffy. \"I think that's the first time I've seen you creeped out by something, Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy asked, \"Robin? What are you talking about? I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was cut off by Robin covering his mouth and saying, \"Set sail for the next island. I need to talk with Robin for a while.\" Without another word, Robin left the confused crew on deck while she dragged Luffy to the Aquarium Bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami, taking charge of the situation, said, \"You heard Luffy, people! Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(At the Aquarium Bar)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop me, Robin?\" Luffy complained. \"I was just going to tell Nami--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you really are. I know, but she wouldn't believe you,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow, this necklace forced us to switch lives with each other; and, from what I observed, the rest of the crew doesn't seem to notice. I think they believe I'm really you and you're really me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy! How can I be anyone else but me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing she'd need to prove her point, Robin said, \"Luffy, please wait right here. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Robin walk out of the bar, Luffy got an uneasy feeling in his stomach, but decided to ignore it. After a few minutes, Robin returned, but she looked different.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Robin still wore the necklace around her necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! How'd you get Nami to give you her clothes?\" Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. I just put this necklace around her neck,\" Robin said. \"Come here, I'd like to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy followed Robin outside and looked over to where she pointed. There she saw Nami standing on the deck, but wearing Luffy's clothes. She was grinning from ear to ear and looking toward the sea. Luffy noticed that, unlike last time, Nami wasn't wearing a necklace around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami looked up to Zoro and shouted, \"Hey, when are we gonna set sail?

We're all friends, so you need to spend some time with the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Luffy,\" Robin and Luffy said, almost in unison. With that, Nami walked away to talk with the other crew members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned to Luffy and said, \"Get what's going on now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy said, \"I think so.\" Robin leaned in closer, hoping that her captain had uncovered the secret of the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Nami are playing a game with me where we all act like each other for a day! We should get the rest of the crew involved in this game; it's so fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of disappointment, Robin said, \"Luffy, this isn't a game. Right now, as far as the crew is concerned, you really are me, I really am Miss Navigator, and Miss Navigator is really you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of these necklaces,\" Robin said, lifting her and Luffy's necklace. \"Somehow, these necklaces allow us to switch lives with any person who puts this on. Why it copied itself when I put it on is still a mystery to me, but these things are responsible for the predicament we're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy thought about the situation for a while, then came up with an idea.</span></div></div>",

The only thing Vegeta seemed to care about was training, and trying to be oh so superior to Goku. Trunks thought that maybe by learning how to go super saiyan his father would be proud, but alas it was for naught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks tightened his orange karate belt before sitting down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a typical day at the Capsule Corp Training facility.' Trunks thought to himself before frowning. Trunks tugged at his orange wristbands before allowing them to snap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How can I-' Trunks began to think before he brought out of his musing by a loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman!\" the loud voice shouted. \"What are you doing with the Dragonballs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dragonballs' The lavendar haired youth thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks knew the sound of that voice. Trunks got off the ground, and made his way to his door carefully whipping off whatever dirt was on his hands on his dark green gi. Trunks carefully peeked his head out oh the door to spot his mother, and father in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma was in her typical red dress, and yellow scarf wrapped around her neck. Her bluish green hair was more frazzled than usual. Trunks could tell his mother was annoyed from the way she was tapping her yellow shoes against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta always wore his blue tank top, and his skintight spandex pants. His black spiked hair had a way of making Vegeta look intimidating to Trunks. Vegeta's fingers were practically twitching underneath his white gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look\" Bulma took a deep breath before continuing. \"There is always someone willing to use these Dragonballs for selfish ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma took a step forward getting in Vegeta's personal space before putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in everyone's best interest that we can keep them in our hands than theirs.\" Bulma finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta huffed before crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. It doesn't concern me in the slightest.\" Vegeta stated before making his way towards Trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks immediately moved out of his father's way by moving out of the door into the hall. Vegeta stopped at the door, and turned his head to a acknowledge Trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy.\" Vegeta stated simply. \"If you have time gawking than you have time to train.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta made his way into the training room. Trunks bit back a response before looking down at the floor. The sound of the door closing filled the hallway. Trunks then felt a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Trunks looked up to see his mother.\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks turned his head away from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fine.\" Trunks grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Bulma inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Trunks stated hastily before running down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trunks! Wait!\" Bulma yelled, but it was to late as Trunks already disappeared down the corridor. Bulma simply turned to face the training facility, and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks wasn't paying attention to where he was going he just wanted to be away from his mother. Trunks made his way through the nearest door before stopping. Trunks looking around to see if he followed by Bulma, and when the coast was clear he let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly light hit Trunk's eyes the and he made a move to cover them. As Trunks eyes adjusted he realized that he was outside in the courtyard. Trunks noticed that whatever was trying to blind him wasn't the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dragonballs!'Trunks thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks slowly made his way to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait.' Trunks stopped in his tracks. 'I should leave. I shouldn't-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonballs glowed softly. Trunks found himself staring at the orange orbs. A thought crossed Trunks' mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can get whatever I want with this.' Trunks thought. 'I can get Father's respect.'<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTrunks smiled deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALMIGHTY SHENRON!\" Trunks shouted. \"ARISE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words were spoken light sprung from the Dragonballs entering the sky. The sky turned dark as green, and yellow scales poked their way through the sky before a all to familiar snout popped through the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM SHENRON THE ETERNAL DRAGON!\" The ancient dragon bellowed. \"STATE YOUR WISH SO I MAY GRANT IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks couldn't help, but blurt out. \"I wish I was someone who held my father's utmost respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wish is a simple matter!\" The dragon stated as his eyes glowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the glowing light engulfed Trunks' smile widened. The Light remained there only for a second before fading away leaving a man in Trunks' place. That man was now wearing the same dark green gi, orange wristbands, and orange karate as Trunks once did. That man was Goku, and boy was he confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Goku question. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRUNKS!\" a woman shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku turned to face a very angry Bulma. Before Goku could get out a word Bulma reached out to grab his ear pulling it hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Goku shouted in pain. \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking young man!\" Bulma exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma immediately faced the dragon. \"There will be no wishes today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenron simply huffed. \"SO BE IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight engulfed the dragon before he faded from exsistance. The Dragonballs floated up in the sky before shooting off to the far corners of earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma turned her attention to Goku. \"Trunks! You are in so much trouble!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bul-\" Goku tried to get out before Bulma pulled his ear hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuses!\" Bulma  never let go of that ear as she led Goku into Capsule Corp. Goku could only try not to stumble over his steps while unwillingly following Bulma. Bulma stopped in front of an unfamiliar door to Goku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma simply pressed a switch on the side of the door. Goku peered over Bulma's shoulder to see a very annoyed sweaty Vegeta. Vegeta had long, but discarded his tank top leaving him shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman!\" Vegeta shouted. \"Why are you interrupting my training!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma without even missing a beat. \"Because your son just attempted to use the Dragonballs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait Son?!' Goku thought. 'This is insane!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta's eyes widen for only a moment before his gaze honed in on Goku. Vegeta gaze very quickly became a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku opened his mouth to speak only to be interrupted by Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! Brat!\" Vegeta demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku couldn't help but shut his mouth. Ordinary the taller man would have bit back with a response, but Vegeta's body language just screamed at him to be quite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma let go off Goku's ear allowing him to stand up. Goku could only watch as Vegeta grabbed the folding chair in the corner of the room, and brought it just close enough to the pair. Vegeta sat in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" Vegeta said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked at Bulma for support only to be met with her glare. Goku looked so hurt as he slowly made his way to Vegeta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undue your belt.\" Vegeta instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down to notice what he was wearing. Nearly gaping at the sight off articles of clothing. However, unfortunately for him Goku didn't have time to really soak it in as Vegeta growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undue your belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku hastily undid the karate belt. The lower part of the gi slid right down to his ankles revealing. Goku could only stare at new white briefs with the capsule corp logo on the waistband that now covered his nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down on my lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next instruction Goku realized exactly what was going to happen. Goku turned to run only to be tripped up by the lower part off the gii. Goku felt himself land on something hard. Goku looked up to see Vegeta's face. Goku was now laying Vegeta's lap. Vegeta laid his left hand on Goku's back to hold him in his lap. Vegeta raised his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please! I not-\" Goku tried to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right hand hit Goku in the buttocks leaving a painful sting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count\" Vegeta instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Goku tried to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COUNT!\" Vegeta Shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n smack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku could only find himself think about the ludicrousness of the situation. Here he was in his rival's slap being treated like his son, and is now being punished like a bratty child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This has to be a bad dream.' Goku thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku didn't have time to think as Vegeta continued his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID COUNT BRAT!\" Vegeta shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-One\"Goku gasped out shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on, and on due Goku eventually miscounted restarting said punishment again. By the time Goku successfully counted it had reached night time, and Goku's bum was so red that the backside of those white briefs appeared pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up Brat!\" Vegeta instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku slowly got up off Vegeta's lap. Goku pulled the lower part of the gi up, and retied it with the karate belt. Goku shakily made his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't mister!\" Bulma grabbed Goku's ear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a pained groan Goku let Bulma lead him out of the training room. Eventually the two reached a different room entirely. The room was the epitome of a kid's room. Toy's littered the floor, and the dresser. Some posters of the latest superhero hung around the walls of the bed. A train set was set up on the rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma marched over to the dresser and pulled out a t-shirt with Hercule Satan face, and an identical briefs to what he was wearing. Goku didn't comment on the fact that he wasn't her son, or the clothes looked sized to fit him even though he was clearly an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It just has to be a dream right?' Goku thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going right to bed.\" Bulma stated exhaustedly. \"I'm going discuss this with your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma turned to look at Goku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku could only stare at the spot Bulma was at. Goku stood there unmoving before reluctantly stripped out of the gi, and put on the clothes Bulma left for him. Hot tears left Goku's face as he made his way over to the bed. Goku immediately wrapped himself around the blankets and laid his head on the side of the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly closed Goku eyes. Trying desperately to stop the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let this nightmare end.\" Goku said to himself before going to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Everyone thought of Bulma as Goku. <br>\r\nBulma found herself lying unconscious on a battlefield that was destroyed by a spectacular battle between two powerful beings. The Planet Namek was in ruins but still intact. There could only be one victor ,Bulma had defeated Frieza. Bulma screamed out in pain her body was badly beaten up. Most of her clothes was torn off and drenched in blood , she was shocked to see pieces of clothing that looked like what Goku usually wears but fitted to suit her body. She could feel that her chest was also not getting its usual support , she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. The last thing she remembered was being engulfed by a mysterious light and then she ended up here.  <br>\r\n \u201cDaddy !! \u201c , she heard gohan shouting and saw him running towards her with Krillin and Piccolo. \u201c you defeated Frieza ! I knew you could do it goku . here\u2019s a senso bean goku.\u201d , krillin said taking a bag of beans out of his pocket. \u201c That was impressive goku. \u201c, Piccolo said standing and folding his arms. Bulma found this really strange and asked , \u201c where is goku ? \u201c . \u201c he is laying right in front of me \u2026 you still a bit out of it goku .\u201d , krillin said confused . \u201c Hurry Up and give him a Senso bean!!\u201d , Picolo shouted . krillin immodesty took out a senso bean and gave it to bulma. Bulma ate the senso bean and immediately began healing. As her body was healing she realised that she must have switched lifes with goku.   Bulma felt incredible , her body was completely healed. Her physique was much more muscular, athletic and sexier, she realised that this was the result of training in goku\u2019s place. She got up with much ease and could feel how extremely powerful her knew body is. \u201cso this is why goku keeps on training , I cant have enough of this incredible feeling. I cant wait to try this power out! \u201c , Bulma thought to herself. Bulma than looked at Krillin and said \u2026   </span></div></div>",

She let out a bored grunt as she leaned her head on her palm in front of the brigade's computer. She, Kyon, and Yuki were the only ones currently present in the club room, with Itsuki and Mikuru already having left. Kyon sat at the table, while Yuki was reading in the corner as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgement, Kyon decided to ask her what was bothering her. \"So whats got you down this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, its just been so boring around here lately.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured as much. \"Well, what can you do? Life is just like that sometimes.\" he said, hoping to discourage her from whatever she might be wishing this time. Those never ended well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kyon, have you ever wondered what it would be like to be someone else?\" Haruhi asked after a few minutes of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess. I'm sure everyone has thought about it at one point or another.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, our lives is so dull. Nothing really interesting ever really happens to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh how wrong you are...' Kyon thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now I really wish I had someone else's life. Its gotta be more interesting than mine.\" she said. After another few minutes of silence, Haruh stood up. \"I'm heading home. See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya.\" Kyon replied. At this point, the only other person left in the room was Yuki, so Kyon decided to head home as well. No point staying much longer. As he stood up, he looked over to Yuki, who was looking up from her book at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be prepared. Something is about to happen.\" Yuki stated simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going to happen?\" Kyon asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am unsure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great. Well, its not like I didn't expect thhe peace to end eventually.' Kyon thought as he exitted the room. The rest of the day was uneventful for him, and later that night, he evetually fell asleep, ignorant of what his and the SOS Brigade's next little misadventure would be.</span></div></div>",

He looked around the room for a bit before looking down at the bed he was currently in, and he was met with another, even stranger sight. No longer in the clothes he had gone to bed in, he now wore a nightgown in their place. Quickly getting put of the bed, he was nearly ready to freak out. He quickly took it off as fast as he could, not wanting even the smallest chance of being seen in it, and found a third strange sight; he was also wearing a pair of panties. \"Dammit Haruhi, what did you do this time?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue to ponder this strange occurence, he heard the ringing of a cell phone, and when he went to pick it up, he saw the number was one he recognized.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately nothing that really would cover his legs. With a sigh he settled for a knee-length black skirt and a white t-shirt. Before he had put on the shirt he noticed that he was not wearing a bra. Nothing he would normally notice but with the fact that he was now seen as Haruhi in the back of his mind, he grabbed a bra that would match the panties he was wearing and then began dressing himself, struggling a little with putting on the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was dressed he looked at himself in the mirror. He looked ridiculous in the skirt. Then he noticed a yellow ribbon on the desk beside him. It was the ribbon Haruhi usually wore. He sighed and grabbed it. It was nearly impossible to get the ribbon fit like it usually did with Haruhi but eventually he managed it. He hurried outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside he felt very self-concious walking around in a skirt but everyone thought of him as Haurhi and therefore did not think anything strange. \"Haruhi is always creating a big mess and I'm in the centre of it.\", he sighed and soon got to the park were they usually met. Haruhi, dressed in his clothes, was already there and began to giggle when she saw him. \"You look really cute, Kyon.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, very funny.\", he sighed in his usual monotonous voice. \"Do you have any idea how this happened?\", he asked her but only received the shaking of her head. \"I don't have the slightest idea but isn't this great?\". Her eyes began to sparkle. \"Maybe some aliens tried a device out on us. Maybe a time traveler changed us unknowingly with the time waves of his time machine. Maybe a magician casted a spell on us.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon shook his head when he heard all those theories she had. It were the usual ones she had when she could not explain something. The real reason was pretty obvious if you  were not called Haruhi: It was her doing. \"I think we should gather the gang.\", Kyon suggested. \"Maybe we can figure something out together.\". She nodded, grabbed his former cell phone and called everyone in her usual cheerful tone. Kyon sighed. \"They will think I've gon nuts.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later everyone had arrived and Haruhi had explained the situation. Mikuru looked at Kyon. \"You're really Kyon?\", she asked him in her usual sweet voice. The boy who was now wearing a skirt nodded slowly. Itskui looked at Kyon and Haruhi with his usual smile. \"Well then. I think we should go home for now and see what we all can find out.\", he suggested. \"And you two should try to act normal.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi crossed her arms infront of her chest. \"What? But that's no fun!\". Kyon looked at her. \"But it's the best we can do. Running around and looking for god knows what isn't going to help us.\". Haruhi sighed and gave in. \"Okay okay...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the group disbanded and Itsuki went over to Kyon. \"You think Haruhi's responsible for this?\", he asked him. Kyon nodded with a serious look.  \"Hm... Okay.\". Itsuki's face turned very serious. \"I think you should just play along. If she is really the reason for this, she might get tired of it in a day or two and everything will revert back to normal eventually.\", he explained. \"So don't worry.\". His ever lasting smile re-appeared on his face. Kyon just sighed, nodded and continued back home. Well, Haruhi's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before he arrived there he met someone on the street. It was...</span></div></div>",

Maybe some passing spirit or monster cursed you out of some belief that you'd learn a lesson. Maybe the magic wants you to understand Akane better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma threw his arms up bitterly. \"I've tried understanding her for years! She's angry and loud and... weird! Nothing I do is ever right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then consider this a chance to learn. To live a day in her shoes. To find ways to avoid getting hit with another hammer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well, when he phrased it like that, it was tempting. Still. Ranma blew some hair of his eyes. \"Are those your only ideas? Nothin' better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I have another, but you wouldn't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid of nothing, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor doctor sighed. \"Perhaps, after years of being underestimated, Akane just... broke. Every morning until you arrived, she was harassed by dozens of boys. She had to fight to protect herself, with no help from anyone. After meeting you, suddenly she was always being saved. From your description of your morning, it sounds like she would always wake up to the sounds of stronger fighters brawling out her window. It would have been hard for her not to feel helpless. She might lash out at others in an attempt to make herself feel stronger, only for that feeling to be temporary. Perhaps, her desperation and fear of falling behind culminated in a complete disassociation. Becoming the very person she envied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his glasses, cleaning them carefully. \"If that were the case, and she couldn't readjust to her actual life, she might require deep psychological counseling. If people learned about Akane's belief she was someone else, it could put her entire future at risk. She would be unfairly regarded as a nutcase for maybe the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence stretched over the clinic. Ranma gulped. He didn't want to acknowledge that analysis, but a few words stung in his mind. If he wasn't careful... Akane's entire life could be ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... be Akane, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a good idea.\"</span></div></div>",

Attack them directly!\" Jaden called out as the fusion of his and Jesse's ace monsters did just that, and winning them the duel. \"Gotcha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe we lost! We almost had you two.\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you guys did. The duel was great!\" Jaden said. \"Anyway, I'm still in the mood to duel. Who wants to go next?\" However, before one of them could respnd, Pharaoh came up to him, a card in its mouth. \"Huh watcha got there, Pharaoh?\" he said as he took it from the cat. He looked at the card, seeing it was a spell card labled 'Life Swap' but other than that, it was blank. There was no description of the effect on it, and the picture was blank, and colored a solid black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I sense something strange coming from that card.</i>\" Yubel said as she appeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats that card?\" Blair asked as she and the others gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life Swap? I've never heard of that card.\" Alexis said as she looked over Judai's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do? The effect is blank.\" Chazz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it sure looks weird.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should be careful. I've got a bad feeling about it.\" Jaden said. However, before he could say anything else, the picture on it began to glow, and turned from black to white, and the card emitted a bright light that engulfed all of them.</span></div></div>",

I mean look at us, we're waering their clothes that seemed to fit us perfectly despite being much smaller than them, and then theirs their Duel Runners.\" she says. \"What do you think Leo?\" she asks, but gets no response. \"Leo?\" she asks as she looks behind her at the one following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is so cool!\" Leo said with a big grin. \"I can't believe I'm driving a Duel Runner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo!\" she scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you, I heard you.\" he says. \"I'm just also enjoying this. Anyway, then if we've switched with Yusei and Aki, then where are the real Yusei and Aki? I mean, if we're them, than are they us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats a good question.\" she says. \"Maybe we could try looking for them. They might be just as confused as we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Leo agrees.</span></div></div>",

Back where we were before ended up like this.\" Luna suggested. \"It hasn't been to long, so maybe they'll be there or nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Leo said, and the two twins drove in the direction of where they had been before they were in their current strange situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take them long to get there thanks to the Duel Runners they rode. As they got there, though they didn't see them right away, they did spot them a bit farther ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding on what appeared to be a larger version Luna's duel board was Yusei. Yusei was wearing a red long sleeved shirt with yellow markings under a short sleeved light pink jacket that matched the shorts he wore. He also had on pink and white sneakers, as well as a pink helme and a normal sized version of Luna's pink and white duel disks. His face was also lacking his yellow criminal marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, also nearby was Aki riding a larger version of Leo's Duel Board. She was dressed similarly, wearing a a blue sleeveless shirt with yellow markings under a short sleeved white jacket the shorts she wore. She also had on blue and white sneakers, and a blue helmet and a normal sized version of Leo's blue and white Duel Disk, and on her arm where her back claw mark should have been was instead Leo's own heart mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei and Aki were both dressed in the twins' clothes, just as the twins were dressed in theirs. And like their larger clothes now fit the twins perfectly, the twins' clothes seemed to fit them perfectly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins got closer, they weren't really sure what they were expecting, but what happened deffinitely wasn't it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Yusei! Aki!\" Aki said and waved as she saw the two of them coming up. She spoke in a much different tone that she usually did, sounding more excitable and childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Did you two finish your duel already?\" Yusei said softly, speaking in a gentle and innocent childlike tone, notably different than his usual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say this was a sureal experience for the twins was an understatement. Here they were, dressed like Yusei and Aki with people believing them to actually be them, and then here was Yusei and Aki, both of them in a situation that was similar, but they were acting like and believing that they really were them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, we did. We were just in the area and saw you two and thought we'd stop and say hello.\" Luna said. She had been hoping that Yusei and Aki would be as aware of the situation as they were. The possibility that they might actually believe that they were really Luna and Leo hadn't occured to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Leo could tell what was going on in this situation, and he wasn't really sure about what to say. Then, he noticed something in one of Aki's hands. It looked like a card. Then he thought of something. \"Ak-Uh, Leo, whats that in your hand?\" he asked, almost calling Aki by her actual name instead of who she believed herself to be. He had almost forgotten that as far as anyone else knew, he was Aki for now. Still, it was so weird to be calling her by his own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this?\" she said as she held it up, revealing that it was indeed a card. \"Its some really weird card I found a little while ago. Its blank, and only has its name, \"Life Swap,\" on it.\" she explained, confirming Leo's suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Would you mind if I took a look?\" Luna asked as she got off of Yusei's Duel Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Yusei.\" Aki said as she handed it over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked it over and Leo got off of Aki's Duel Runner as well and looked over his sister's shoulder. It was definitely the card that he had picked up earlier, and what they could only think had caused this situation. \"Would you mind if I hold onto this for a while, uh, Leo? I'm curious about it.\" she asked, thinking to herself about how weird it was to call Aki by her brother's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, no problem. You can keep it if you want. Oh, unless it turns out to be a super powerful card! Then I definitely want it back!\" Aki said, early jumping a bit in her apparent excitement as she said the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sooo weird.' Luna thought to herself. \"Sure. I'll let you know if I find anything out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, Yusei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we should be getting home, Leo. We've got to go to our classes at the Academy tomorrow.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Anyway, see you guys tomorrow!\" Aki said and waved as the two rode off on the Duel Boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find that to be as weird as I did?\" Leo asked as soon as the two were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Luna replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a seemingly ordinary day, and Yusei was currently working on his Duel Runner alone in the garage. Crow was out on deliveries, and Jack was most likely at his favorite coffee place, leaving Yusei alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was working, he then heard the sound of the door opening. \"Yusei? Are you here?\" here could hear Aki say as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm working on my Duel Runner.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack and Crow aren't here?\" she asked as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Crow is working, and I don't know where Jack is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. By the way, I found this strange card on my way here.\" Aki said as she held out a blank spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life Swap?\" I've never heard of it.\" he said as he looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. I just found it on the ground and picked it up, and thought I'd ask you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the card began to glow, and then emitted a bright light that engulffed the two. Then the light died down, and things were obviously different for them. First, they had apparently swapped positions, with Yusei now standing where Aki had been and Aki standing where Yusei was. The second, and much more pronounced differece was their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei now wore a red corset and skirt with short, puffy light green sleeves, and over the corset he wore a magenta coat. He also now wore black gloves were elbow length and thigh high socks of the same color and red high heeled pumps. Around his neck was a red chocker and a necklace with an emerald crested golden cross medallion, and rolled in the front of his hair was also a silver device. On his face, his criminal mark was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki now wore a long sleeved blue jacket with amber gems on the elbows and shoulders and under that was a sleeveless black shirt with a red design, and brown gloves. She also had black jeans and brown boots. On her face was the yellow criminal mark that was now absent from Yusei's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were now dressed in the other's clothes. And despite their different sizes, they fit them perfectly, as if they were what they were made for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took the sight before her in, Aki recoiled back in surprise. \"Wh-whats going on here?\" she sputtered out. \"What just happened? And why are you in my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Yusei said, trying to remain calm and calm down the girl before him. \"Just relax and lets figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki breathed in deeply, and did as he said. \"You're right. Freaking out won't solve anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now lets try to figure this out.\" Yusei said. However, before they can discuss things further, they heard the door of the garage open, and two people enter.</span></div></div>",

Stop wasting our money at that damn coffe shop!\" Crow yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many times do I have to tell you thet you can't tell me what I can and can't do!\" Jack yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you got a job and contributed to our finances it wouldn't be a problem. Oh, but wait, you can't hold a job. So stop wasting money on needless things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you insult Jack Atlas like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shouted a bit more as they entered the main area of the garage. \"Hey Yusei. Oh, and hey Aki. Didn't know you stopped by.\" Crow said. Neither him nor Jack seemed to react to their current attire. They both just continued their argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki was a little surprised and confused that neither of them found her or especially Yusei's state of dress to be strange. Yusei on the other hand, while embarrassed by being seen like this, wanted to investigate it further. \"Jack was at the coffee shop again, wasn't he?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he was, Aki! What else would he be doing? He doesn't work, he doesn't help out around here, all he does is waste the money that I earn!\" Crow yelled, infuriating Jack and their argument intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Aki let out, furthering her confusion. Why had Crow just called Yusei by her name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see. So then they seem to think I'm Aki, and I would assume that they think that Aki is me. That would explain why they didn't react to what I am wearing.' he thought. He then glanced at the card in his hand. Ever since the flash of light, he had been holding the \"Life Swap\" card. Somehow, it had switched him and Aki's places. Just like its name said, it had swapped their lives. \"'Yusei.'\" he said to Aki, getting her attention. She was confused at first as to why he had caled her by his name but quickly caught on. \"Lets leave these two to themselves for now. How about you and me head somewhere else. I was wondering if you could help me with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, o-okay.\" Aki replied</span></div></div>",

As they did, Yusei didn't really pay much attention his feet as he walked, so he didn't realize something.

He stepped perfecty in them as if he wore them every day; he walked the exact same way that Aki had when she wore them, one foot in front of the other and his hips swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked outside and started to head away from the garage, though they weren't heading anywhere in particular. \"So what are we going to do, Yusei?\" Aki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure.\" Yusei said. \"But from what I can tell, we've switched places. People think you're me and I'm you, and our clothes have been switched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this whole thing happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure, but I think it has something to do with the card you found.\" Yusei said, holding up the \"Life Swap\" card in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like this is my fault.

They would need to try and find a way to fix this. But they didn't really have any leads on that, only the card that had caused it, and didn't know how to make it work again. They could try to find out more about the card. But without really knowing much about, they wouldn't really know where to start. They could just take it easy for now, but that had its own problems.People thought that they were each other, so they would have to pretend to be one another for now. Meaning he would have to go back to her place and act like he was her in front of her parents while she went back to the garage and pretended to be him with Jack and Crow.

Though first they would have to get changed into their riding suits. Or rather, each other's riding suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the room to get changed, Yusei stripped out of what he was currently wearing, finding that under the clothes, he also had a lacy pink bra that seemed to be made just for his flat chest, and a matching pair of panties. Ignoring them, he noticed on his arm, his mark was different. Instead of the dragon's head mark, he saw the back claw in its place. Else, Aki stood in nothing but a pair of boxers, and saw the dragon's head mark in place of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to ignore it for now, he slipped into the red and black jumpsuit Aki wore when using her Duel Runner, noticing it only seemed to go up part way on his chest and left a portion of it exposed. He then put on her red boots and then slipped on her red gloves. He then packed up the clothing he had taken off into a bag to bring with him. Aki also finished getting into his riding suit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were ready, they got onto each others Duel Runner and rode out of the garage, Jack and Crow still arguing. They headed toawrds the highway, though not really heading anywhere in particular. Aki also noticed that for some reason, she seemed to be driving a lot better than usual, even better than Yusei at the moment as she was currently in the lead of the two. For some reason, it just seemed a lot easier today. Yusei meanwhile was lagging a bit behind her, and noticed that he seemed to be having a bit of trouble driving, like he wasn't used to it, almost as if he didn't really have much experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do, Yusei?\" Aki asked as she slowed down and pulled up alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure.\" Yusei said. \"But from what I can tell, we've switched places.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drving Aki's Duel Runner in the direction of her home, it doesn't take Yusei too long to reach there. Getting off and walking inside, Yusei calls out and says hello, but since no one responds, he assume's that he is here alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that his first order of business would be to get out of the riding suit he currently wore. Heading to a bathroom to change, he took off the gloves and boots and slipped out of it. He then opened the bag he had packed Aki's clothes into earlier, and with what would almost seem like a practised ease, dressed in them. Once dressed, he looked at himself in the mirror; at himself wearing Aki's clothes. This was the first time he was seeing himself after this whole mess had started, and couldn't help but think that this was more than a bit weird. But he knew that for now, there was nothing he could do about this, so with a shrug, he walked out of the bathroom to find something to occupy himself with for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked around the large house, Yusei didn't really pay much attention his feet as he walked, so he didn't realize something. Despite never having worn shoes with heels before, he had no problem walking in the 3\" pumps that were now on his feet. He stepped perfecty in them as if he wore them every day; he walked the exact same way that Aki had when she wore them, one foot in front of the other and his hips swayed with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually found that he had apparently absentmibdedly wandered to a specific room, and opening it up, he found that it was Aki's own. Looking around the room, one thing that caught his eye the most were the photos. He saw a recent one that he recognized, one that the group had taken of them all. In it, just like their current situation, he and Aki had switched places in it; he was wearing her clothes, and his pose and expression in it were the exact ones that Aki had when it was taken, and the opposite was true with Aki in the picture as well. And like that one, in all of the other pictures, he was where Aki should have been.</span></div></div>",
