Things weren't as stable in his life as Jamie would have liked things to be. He used to have a boyfriend and a pet. Now, he had neither. He used to love his job. Now, he was constantly on edge, worrying about his job security, growing increasingly paranoid that his boss was just itching for an excuse to get rid of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the major events, anyways, but those major events meant that all the little things that would normally not faze Jamie were starting to overwhelm him more and more. Over the last week, yesterday had been the only time in which Jamie had not felt the need for his private little haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found himself missing it by lunchtime, and now that it was late afternoon Jamie was heading back. He had been on this route so many times, and was so familiar with the sights and smells of his private haven that upon approach, it was immediately obvious to Jamie that something was different.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A story that will hopefully allow you to get your creative juices flowing! To be frank, I've no idea exactly how this will work out, but experimentation is a good thing, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general premise is that after each chapter of this interactive, the choices that follow are to be single, completely random words, and it is up to the next poster to work out how that can be incorperated into a continuation of the story. For example, say I write a chapter that ends with somebody finding a treasure chest. I use this site - <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://randomwordgenerator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://randomwordgenerator.com/</a> - to retrieve three random words. Any site is okay for doing so, as long as it's random! The three random words that come out of that is -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Colony<br>\r\n- Dress<br>\r\n- Settle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words form the basis of the next chapter. If you decide to choose 'Dress' and use that to say that there is one inside that treasure chest, then there's a lot you can do with it. Maybe the material is something otherworldly, or maybe it belonged to someone you once knew. Maybe you get an overwhelming compulsion to wear it as you hold it in your hands. Maybe you find something else hidden within the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully people can have fun with this! A few more rules;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This interactive will be labelled 13+, for the time being. I don't want to discourage people from doing what they want with an option, but if a story branch goes in such a way that things go to 18+ levels, then that is to be marked at the start of the interactive <br>\r\n- Any troll posts or posts that don't utilise the random word in some form will be deleted. <br>\r\n- The random words are ideally lifted from somewhere like <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://randomwordgenerator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://randomwordgenerator.com/</a> but the source can come from anywhere - even your own mind if you want! I would rather you not choose words based on what you have written though - it would defeat the purpose of this interactive.<br>\r\n- The first chapter will consist of 'blank spaces' to allow for people to write a new story beginning. If the case arises where these all run out, then the last person to write an entry must provide at least one more blank space to allow future writers a chance to start their own branch.<br>\r\n- There is nothing stopping you from continuing a story yourself through several chapters. If the desire grips you then by all means go for it!<br>\r\n- It is recommended to keep your entries as open-ended as possible to allow for an easier time with the random words. <br>\r\n- There is no limit to how long each post can be. There is no lower limit either, but at least a paragraph is recommended.<br>\r\n- Stories can be ended at any point, should you feel you can bring it to a natural conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
