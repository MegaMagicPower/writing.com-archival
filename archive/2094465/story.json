Cursing your light sleep habits, you turn over in your cot and try to curl under your sparse blankets; to hell with early rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Too bad the welcome darkness and silence that brought were shattered by the <i>second</i> thing to wake you up--thunderous, booming rumble: a deep guttural hissing noise, like a freight train in a landslide. The ground and walls shook as the noise came in waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast it, Zafirah was snoring again. <br>\r\nSighing, you throw off your covers and groggily walk through your minimally-furnished quarters, exiting onto your snoring alligator mistress\u2019s bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafirah was a Titan, really--350 feet tall at the least, scales the color of rich coffee with a few yellow spots down her spine and tail with a tan underbelly. She had just a bit of pudge in her belly, cleavage and rear you could see even under her blankets, but her figure was otherwise quite toned. It was a figure she was quite proud of, though she\u2019d gotten it from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at the memory of the matriarch gator who\u2019d given you to her daughter as a birthday gift. Even as gentle as Zafirah was, you were still her <i>pet.</i> Years ago, Earth had been invaded and conquered by a race of aliens who resembled giant anthropomorphic animals. You\u2019d only been a kid when it happened; all the memories were fuzzy and distant. You could barely remember NOT living in a world where towering giants stomped about everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens, simply calling themselves the \u201cAnthro Imperium\u201d had been surprisingly light conquerors. Earth had been ultimately made a sort of client state: humans given rights and protections as Imperial citizens, and mostly left alone as long as they paid taxes to their suzerian overlords.<br>\r\nTaxes and\u2026<i>other</i> tribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anthros were quite predatory, even those resembling \u201cbenign\u201d animals. They still enjoying toying with smaller beings, showing their dominance. Devouring \u201ctinies\u201d alive wasn\u2019t unheard of, either. Thus was born the \u201cPrey Tribute\u201d--every year, Earth would hand over a crop of \u201cundesirables\u201d like criminals and terrorists to the Anthros to become\u2026whatever their captives wanted them to be. Food, pets, toys; it never ended well, but in exchange for the Imperium\u2019s benevolence it had been a good deal. Most of the victims were criminal scum anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.Well, except for you. You\u2019d only been in for some petty theft and vandalism, but the quota had had to be filled that year. You were slotted into the Tribute crop and sent off to your fate. You ended up in the hands of Zafirah\u2019s mother: a black alligator woman who\u2019d fought in the initial invasion, and had swallowed a platoon of tanks whole just because she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could still remember what she\u2019d said to you that day.<br>\r\n<i>Little human, my daughter will simply adore you. Well, for your sake, I hope she does.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again. At least you didn't end up eaten. She HAD sat on you a few times, though.<br>\r\nZafirah\u2019s snoring stops as she begins to rouse from her sleep...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't look fully awake even as she knelt upright, the blood clearly flowing into her head as she blinked away the sleepies in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Zafirah!\" You say loudly, yet formally, bowing to the bedridden gator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Zafirah's head tilts your way, eyes looking a lot more royal and benevolent as she smiles. \"Good morning, pet. Have you slept well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, I have!\" You lie, not wanting to guilt her over your wakeup call. \"You have as well, I suppose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough.\" She grunts, tossing the blankets aside to free up her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nightstand jitters slightly as her feet hit the floor, but as carefully as she can, she opens a hand and lays it down in front of you on the nightstand, inviting you on. Without hesitating, you clamber onto her palm, and she swiftly raises it up to her shoulder, and you climb on by some of her long, flowing hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain there, seated on her scaly shoulder as she goes through her usual morning routine, as you both'd done for almost every day. You're there as she brushes her teeth, combs her hair out, and even gets dressed, and the entire time, the only concern you have is looking down at her body as she takes off her nightgown, keeping your head up and your hands clamped over your eyes as she pulls a red r-shirt down over the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or two of no motion, you let yourself look in the mirror, at you and Zafirah's reflection. Again, unlike anybody whose parents were world-conquering warriors, she was dressed the part of any college kid, wearing only a pair of blue jeans, a shirt for some metal band--a <i>human</i> band from before the war, at that--and a pair of black-framed glasses sitting on the bridge of her maw, the legs are hidden beneath a head of nicely combed black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafirah had her usual smile on as she pulled her neck up through the collar, but her lips soon pursed slightly as she laid eyes on herself, particularly a fluffy roundness that hung around underneath her shirt, letting a sliver of tan see the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm.\" She grumbled. She tugged her shirt down over the seam, but it easily rode back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, Zafirah?\" You ask innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafirah's eyes glance at you, casting that same pout, but it soon disappears as she rolls her eyes with a humored grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...nothing.\" Zafirah insists, tugging her shirt down again. \"Nothing to fret over, at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not fretting if you're not fretting.\" You reply, sitting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafira gently pets the back of your neck with a claw. \"In fact, I think I feel easy enough that I'm having a large breakfast. Wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, madame. Lead the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding with confidence, Zafirah leaves her room and goes down the hall. She goes down steps, passes the stained glass windows along the wide, empty corridors, and goes down some steps again, navigating around the twists and turns of the palace on the route towards the banquet hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more turns on the ground floors, she comes to a set of wide, arching double doors that tower over even somebody of her height, and two armored guards on either side push them open, allowing her to step through. The scent of maple syrup and butter flood the air of the room as she makes herself known, and she walks along the long, long formation of tables along the center of the room, dead set on the very end, where the two of you join...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The walls and floor were spotless, and cast from a gleaming white metal that looked sleek and inviting, and seemed to reflect the sunlight in such a way that every corner of the room seemed to be glowing (that metal didn't exist anywhere on Earth--the Anthros mined it en masse on their homeworld and built their ships from it; only now was it starting to be imported). The long tables, as big as stadiums to you, were also made from a sort of pitch-black marble that looked like solid shadows against the white room. There was even a hologram projector by the table's end--one of the Anthros' science fiction imports--by the counter; a small podium about hip-height for Zafirah, glowing blue but not projecting anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself gulp when you say who was seated at the far end of the table. Two alligators, older and larger than your mistress and covered in black scales; wearing grey uniforms. Her parents, Kara and Tycho: veterans of Earth's conquest and the Anthro Imperium's appointed governors on Earth. They both perk up as Zafirah takes her seat, a fresh plate of pancakes already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gives her daughter a fanged smile from across. Like Zafirah, she had a slim figure with just a bit of pudge in the chest and rear...and an athlete's muscles rippling under her uniform; every bit a warrior. \"Still a hard sleeper, eh my daughter? For a moment I thought we'd have to pull you out of bed before your breakfast got cold.\" Her icy-blue eyes flicked to you and you flinch. \"And be sure to save some scraps for your human; he needs to eat as well...even if his stomach can't hold as much as ours.\" Her forked tongue flicks out and licks at some stray syrup on her muzzle...you briefly imagine a tank and its crew going into her maw, and shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zafirah reaches up a gentle claw to pet you, Tycho gives a low snort from his seat next to her. \"Kara my dear, sometimes I think you enjoy our superior size <i>too</i> much.\" If his wife was built like a warrior, he had the figure of a stone wall: standing a head taller than his daughter, with broad shoulders, barrel-chested, and every muscle bulging even under his clothes. You'd heard he'd once picked up an oil tanker and swung it like a club during the war. \"The humans may be tiny, but they're Imperium citizens now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's <i>already</i> afraid of you...\" Zafirah mumbled, still petting you. \"No need to keep scaring him...thanks, Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gives a musical chuckle, her car-sized fangs showing. \"Oh, dear; am I really <i>that</i> sinister? I guess I could behave better around the humans...alright, Zafirah. I'll try not to scare your human so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mother,\" your mistress says as she lowers you to the table, by her plate. She lowers her head and nuzzles your form. \"Sit tight, little guy. I'll save you some pancakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a filling breakfast, Zafirah and you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grunt and then you look up in surprise because there are acres and acres of jungle in front of you. You hear the sounds of strange birds and then you see what looks like a chameleon sprint past the ground. You were in a jungle, there was no doubt about it. It looked like it was an African jungle or was at least near Africa. \u201cHow did I get her?\u201d you ask. \u201cI don\u2019t remember booking a trip to Africa. Whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028You had to stop yourself as you almost land in a large hole. From the looks of it, the hole was the same size as an elephant. \u201cThat was close.\u201d You say. But then you look closer at the hole and you\u2019re even more confused than you were before because the hole looked like a giant foot with long elongated toes like some kind of weird animal. You step back and then you hear a strange sound and look down and from what you see, you nearly stepped on a strange long-nosed hedgehog-like animal with short quilled yellow and black fur. You look closer as the creature scurries away and then you realize something. You remembered seeing an animal like that in a brochure of the travel bureau that you worked. It was called a tenrec and the only part of the world you knew where tenrecs were indigenous was Madagascar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in Madagascar?!\u201d you yell. \u201cHow did I get all the way out here!\u201d You run out and try to figure out what\u2019s going on and then you grunt as you trip on a piece of metal. You groan and then you see that the piece of metal you tripped on appeared to be a propellor for some sort of plane. You then look up at several trees and see the remains of a plane of some sort. It wasn\u2019t a large airliner and seemed to be a plane that was left over from some kind of war. That was when there\u2019s a rolling sound and you see a glass canister of some kind at your feet and it\u2019s fogged and stained as if there was some odd concoction inside of it. You lift up the glass and stare at it in curiosity before you hear loud rumblings. \u201cOh great. Now I have to deal with earthquakes?!\u201d The earthquakes get closer and closer and you hear the call of some kind of strange and unusual animal. You\u2019re now more afraid than ever. You then look up and approaching your area is a strange creature shadowed out by the night\u2019s sky but with glowing eyes. It was the size and shape of a mountain as it approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream and try to run but the creature reveals that it has rather large rounded ears to go with its large eyes and it stomps forward after you, knocking down several trees in the process. The creature chirps and then leaps over the jungle with surprising grace given its incredible mass and lands with a loud boom that cracks the ground. You bump into something fleshy and fuzzy and then you look up in pure surprise. Standing in front of you was a giant woman, a rather obese giant woman, you\u2019d say 600ft tall. But the most surprising part was that this giant woman was in no way human. She was a giant and obese aye-aye (a type of lemur) with dark pitch black fur and purple markings over her body. She wore nothing but a blue loincloth and tanktop as she looked down on you with an eerie smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d says the aye-aye as she bend over to get a good look at you, her massive body casting a large shadow. \u201cA human. I know exactly what to do with you.\u201d You look up in fear as the aye-aye smiles down on you and decides your fate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a peaceful lazy friday and you decided to go camping in the woods. Along the way, you passed a sign that you couldn't read very clearly due to the moss that was growing all over it. You try to make out the writing but it was in some kind of language that you didn't understand, so you shrugged your shoulders and walked away. All you saw near the sign were what looked like rabbit tracks and then you see some wild carrots. You pick one and then you look in surprise because the carrot looks normal from the outside but underneath the ground, it is striped purple, green and yellow. \"Huh,\" you say. \"It must be some kind of hybrid plant.\" You walk away, not paying any heed to what you had discovered. After that, the entire day goes along peacefully. To your delight, you only see rabbits and they don't even bother giving you a second thought as you pitch your tent and then later set up campfire. It is a rather uneventful camping trip and after the campfire dinner, you decide to turn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the night soon proves itself to be a lot more eventful than the day because things start to get rather weird. You hear a strange jumping sound that awakens you from your tent. You look around and see nothing but the forest around you and some mushrooms that appear to be growing on the ground near your sleeping bag. You look to your watch and see that it's only 2:00 a.m. You then hear a strange whistling sound and gasp as you get up and run out of the tent to see that there is a strange red light coming from the woods. You grumble and then grab your flashlight. \"Why did I decide to go camping this weekend?\" you ask yourself. You walk closer and closer into the woods and see that the light appears to be coming from fluorescent mushrooms in the shape of what appears to be a fairy ring. \"Huh,\" you say. \"Just some mushrooms. Wait. That's a rather big fairy ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk closer to investigate and in the center of the mushrooms there is what looks like a huge hole in the ground. \"What is this?\" you ask. \"It looks like a rabbit hole but it's way too big to be any rabbit I know.\" You bend down to take a closer look and the ground then starts to give in underneath you as you let out a loud scream and drop your flashlight as it shatters. You plummet deep into the ground but then you start to fall slowly and look around to see more of those strange mushrooms glowing in the walls. You then see what look like gears wedged into the walls of the dirt and strange paintings, one of which even depicts what looks like the Mona Lisa but made out of checkers and with what look like rabbit ears. \"Huh?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to fall, you see stairways that seem to lead to nowhere and some stairways seem to even be upside down. You then pass by platforms with chairs and tables that are as big as castles and then you finally land on a checkered floor and look around. From the looks of it, you landed in the middle of a hallway filled with strange horticulture sculptures decorated with flowers in every color of the rainbow. \"Okay,\" you say to yourself. \"This camping trip just got weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about to get weirder because at that moment, there is a loud thunderous earthquake that knocks you on your feet. \"What the?!\" There is then another earthquake and another, each one more enormous and loud than the last. The pattern in which the earthquakes take place makes you for a second believe that the earthquakes were bouncing, but that couldn't be possible could it. Then, you see a large shadow cast over you but before you can say anything about the shadow, something enormous lands in front of you with the biggest quake yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dust clears, you look up and see something that amazes you. It was an enormous white rabbit that stood 800ft tall. This rabbit was very fat and plump, especially in the stomach and in the behind and the rabbit's big and round cotton tail was the same size as a wrecking ball. Then you look closer and see that this is a female white rabbit and the giant bunny has a human-like shape. She has long blonde hair that is worn in a large regal looking bun, a large ruffled collar and a blue vest with checkered lines at the sides with buttons that are shaped like hearts, much like the rubies in the tiara she was wearing. \"That's a big rabbit.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit then twitches her whiskers and then looks down at you with a scowl. \"You're late.\" She says. You gasp. \"She talked?!\" The rabbit puts her hands on her hips and taps one of her large car crushing feet, creating small quakes as she continues to glare down at you. \"Do not change the subject, human. I expected you here an hour ago. One must not keep one's mistress waiting.\" \"Mistress?\" you ask. The rabbit then starts to turn around and you see her enormous tail right in front of you. You begin to wonder why she was wearing a vest but not bothering with pants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be punished for disobedience, one hour under my posterior should suffice.\" You let out a yell and try to run but in a second the bunny giantess sits right down on you and all you can see is her white fur as you grumble and she smirks and makes herself comfortable as she drinks a cup of tea. You could tell this crazy night was only getting started.</span></div></div>",

It hadn\u2019t even rung yet. You let out a sigh. \u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d you say. \u201cThere must be a major wave this morning. She\u2019s always up to catch the tide. You look around the workshop to see several surfboards. Some of which were already finished while some were only painted half-way and there was one that was still being carved. Of course, given how lazy your mistress was at times, you were surprised that she even got any work done. When she wasn\u2019t slacking off, she was busy surfing and she usually dragged you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only consolation was that compared to some other creatures that visited the beach, she was a very decent creature to be owned by. The world you lived in was a distant world where anthropomorphic animals, bigger than the likes of Godzilla or King Kong, were in charge and what little humans there were that lived on this planet-  you suspected that they were descended from astronauts unfortunate enough to land on this planet stuck in the 60s - were subordinate to the giants that ruled the world. You had previously served under a rather nasty titaness who saw you as little more than vermin and actually attempted to stomp on you a few times just to have a good laugh at your expense. You still see that woman in your nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however, she grew bored of torturing you and gave you to her daughter. She had considered eating you but humans didn\u2019t sit well in her stomach for some reason. Said daughter, you\u2019d suspect was in her mid 20s. Her name was Sabrina and she was an 800ft tall okapi with bright white and brown stripes all over her body and long blonde hair with several flowers wrapped into it. She was a rather fat okapi with a chubby face, but most of her weight went into her enormous thighs and backside. In fact, she was so heavy that you knew she was coming a mile away. Sabrina didn\u2019t usually get up this early but when there was a large wave to be caught, she\u2019d be there. Sabrina lived on the beach (specifically, she lived on the end of a jetty) and she made her living building surfboards for other beach going giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a more accurate description of her job was that she did at a maximum 25% of the work. Carving a little and making the design ideas, but you were the one who did the bulk of the action since she put more of her effort into surfing than she did her job and relied on you to do everything within reason. You didn\u2019t like how lazy Sabrina could be, but then again, she was a major improvement over her mom and you knew better than to complain. After all, she was still MUCH bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see Sabrina\u2019s large shadow yawning on the wall. The enormous okapi walks in with her messy hair covering her face and horns, her long neck drooping and her mouth wide open with her long, pierced tongue sticking out. \u201cUgh,\u201d says the giantess before she gives a slight belch. \u201cI hate mornings. Now, where is that human of mine.\u201d You let out a sigh and stand up as Sabrina staggers into the room. \u201cEven when she decides to get up early for her own plans, she\u2019s as lazy as ever. Well, I better let her know I\u2019m here before she sits on me again. Sabrina! Over here! Sabrina!\u201d Sabrina walks in and lets out a yawn, giving you a direct hit of her morning breath that makes you gag and hold your face. This was going to be one of those days. You just knew it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shake your head. Sometimes you wonder why you bother sticking around. Sabrina made it very hard for you to fear her. She scratches her chin as she attempts to hang on. \"Oh man,\" mutters the okapi. \"I need to get more sleep. Ugh. Major wipeout. Something must've happened to me on that last wave last night.\" Sabrina then lets out a hiccup and then her eyes begin to spin. \"Uh,\" she says. \"What were we supposed to be doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a grunt and then you point to the clock. Sabrina sees how early it is and then lets out a moan. \"Oh come on,\" mutters Sabrina. \"It's too early. Why do we have to open shop now.\" \"Sabrina!\" you yell to the ginormous okapi. \"This was all your idea to begin with.\" Sabrina lets out another yawn and then snorts. \"Oh come on,\" mutters Sabrina. \"I get up early so I can surf, not so I can work. Man, what was I thinking when I decided to open up a surfboard shop. Oh well. Better get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina picks you up and then the okapi drags you to her workbench. As she does so, you look at several surfboards all lined up. There was one that was painted to look like a catfish, one that was painted with the colors of a sunset, a surfboard that was split colored green and red and even one that looked like it was decorated with binary code. You have to admit, Sabrina had some good ideas. It's too bad that most of the time, you were the one who actually had to carry them out since she was too lazy to finish them. But then you think to yourself. \"Maybe this time, things will be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Sabrina starts to carve a surfboard and is whistling a tune as she works the knife and you sit on the front of the unfinished board. Surprisingly, the lazy okapi is actually doing a terrific job and is humming to herself as she files the edges. You drop your jaw because from the looks of it, Sabrina had managed to get the general shape of the surfboard in one sitting without slacking off. She was now getting ready to paint it. As Sabrina puts her mind to paint, she decided to paint it bright black. She starts to paint the corner and then she lets out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the giantess does is kick her feet up on the board and then start to snore rather loudly. You give a groan because then Sabrina's eye opens and she looks at you. \"Well?\" she asks. \"What are you waiting for?\" You give a moan. You really should not have expected anything more from somebody whose true calling appears to be being nothing more than a lazy bum who relies on somebody much smaller than her to get things done. \"You know, Sabrina,\" you say. \"You really can't expect me to paint this entire surfboard.\" Sabrina rolls her eyes. \"Would you rather I send you back to my mom?\" You give a gulp and shake our head. Sabrina may be lazy, but her mom was downright cruel and sadistic. Without another complain, you take Sabrina's brush and paint like you've never painted before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, Sabrina is fast asleep and you're exhausted but you've finally finished the surfboard and painted it to look like a black and white checkerboard. But before you can relax yourself, a customer walks right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what kind of creature is the customer?</span></div></div>",

You're wearing nothing but a pair of cargo shorts. \"Huh?\" you ask. \"Where am I? What's going on? Oof!\" As you're walking around in an attempt to get a better understanding of your surroundings, you give a grunt because you bump into some sort of invisible wall. You look and see that the invisible wall isn't so invisible, but it's a faint pink color that's almost too dull to see. You tap on it and it makes a sound of glass being tapped. You step on the floor and you see that the floor is glass as well. Upon further examination, you see that the pink glass wall was circular in shape and was all around you. If you didn't know better, you'd say you were in a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask. \"Where am I? Can anybody hear me?\" You tap the walls again and then you look up to see something in the air that looked like it was a giant cork. You gasp and realize exactly where you are. \"I'm in a bottle?\" you ask. \"Wait! How did I get in a bottle!? Who...?!\" It was there a giant hand landed near your bottle. You have no idea whose hand it was but from what little wasn't shadowed out, you could see that whoever the hand belong to wasn't human. You then look up and see a pair of giant glowing eyes that shined like a pair of giant glowing moons. Then you turn your head and see an entire room of figures that were shadowed out from the poor lighting in the place and they had glowing eyes as well. They all came in several animalistic shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see that what little light in the place was coming from a lamp of some sort and there was a broken light fixture on the ceiling, implying that there were electric problems at work. But before you can say anything about your situation, you see the owner of the hand by you bring down her other hand and use it to slam a giant gavel next to the bottle you're in and caused you to let out a loud scream before she spoke in a loud voice. \"Next item up for bid, is a fine and rare specimen of a human. Yours to do with however you like. Bidding starts at 100 guilders.\" You give a gasp. From the sound of it, you were property in an auction of some kind, an auction for giants from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a woman of indeterminable species get up and yell out \"125 guilders.\" You were now really worried, bidding had already started. \"150 guilders.\" \"200 guilders!\" \"250 guilders!\" \"275 guilders!\" \"300 guilders!\" How did you end up in this mess. The bids echo through your ears like a sound of lightning and you have no idea who will end up buying you.\" The auctioneer rubs her chin and you see that she has a long snout of some kind before she snorts. \"Come on, people,\" says the woman. \"I have a rare specimen here.\" \"400 guilders!\" \"500 guilders!\" \"1000 guilders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room stops and gasps as one woman rises, having spoken the bid in a deep contralto. The auctioneer herself is stunned before coughing. \"We have 1000 guilders for this fine specimen. Going once, going twice. Sold.\" You begin to sweat. Somebody just bought you and the buyer waddled forward into the light and you see exactly who the buyer was as she pays the auctioneer and then holds up your bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was a 700-foot high anthropomorphic hippopotamus with bright black skin and long platinum blonde hair. She wore purple lipstick and a pair of circular glasses along with a blue suit of some sort. As she grinned at you, you see that she was very obese with a belly wider than she was tall and a rump that was even bigger. Her fingernails were painted purple and she smiled down on you as she took you away.</span></div></div>",

She was absolutely enormous in both height and weight. She looks and smiles as she sees you in the bottle. The lights then come on and you see that the auctioneer was another hippopotamus much like your new mistress and she was just as ginormous. The auctioneer in contrast to your buyer had light purple skin, blue hair worn in a bobcat and cloud tattoos all over her body. The auctioneer smiled smugly at your new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" says the auctioneer hippo. \"Andrea. What a surprise. So you finally decided to go ahead and buy a human.\" Your darker-skinned hippopotamus mistress gives a chuckle. \"Well,\" she says. \"I'm not low on guilders at the moment, so I decided, what the heck and went for it. Besides, every lady hippo seems to be doing it.\" The auctioneer gives a smirk and shows off her large and intimidating teeth, scaring you half to death in the process as she lets out a yawn. \"So, Andrea,\" says the auctioneer. \"What are you going to do with him?\" Andrea gives a scoff and tucks your bottle in her left breast pocket. \"I believe that's my business. All I can tell you is that any human that works for me is expected to earn their keep around my house. See you later, Julie.\" With that, Andrea stomps away, her large and fat body shaking with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andrea walks away, you look and see dozens of hippos just like her and Julie the auctioneer. You take a good long look and see several hippopotami and some of them even seem to be carrying humans as well. There was a bright orange-skinned hippopotamus woman who was dressed like a cowgirl with long brownish blonde hair. You see that she has two bottles for earrings, each containing a tiny human desperately trying to break loose. There was also a white-skinned hippopotamus with raven-colored hair and tattoos of roses all over her body. As she gets up, she lets out a yawn and you could swear you see a human applying whitener to her enormous fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a blink as Andrea exits the building and the gargantuan hippopotamus is walking down the street. You see giant hippos of different colors and patterns. As Andrea is busy speaking on a cellphone, you see her passing by a yellow-skinned hippopotamus wearing black and white clothing with a pattern that made her resemble a taxi. She was carrying a human in her purse as she was busy texting. You then look at her cellphone and you see on the screen there is a strange planet that is covered in pink and yellow plants with a large blue ocean and a red ring around it. That told you something. You had ended up on a strange new planet where these giant hippos ruled the roost. You'd even say that you were in some kind of alternate dimension. How were you going to get back to your own world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle and grunt and shake in place to try and knock the bottle out of Andrea's pocket but Andrea feels what you're doing and stops you. \u201cDon\u2019t even try it, human,\u201d she says with a smug grin on her face. \u201cI happen to be much bigger and heavier than you.\u201d That you couldn\u2019t argue with. Even normal-sized hippos were dangerous. You just had to hope for the best and hope that your new mistress was a benevolent one. Up ahead, Andrea leads you to a fancy looking house with marble statues of different animals (all heavy land animals) surrounding it. She unlocks the door and you look in and see mahogany furniture and a very impressive looking interior. You let out a whistle as Andrea walks inside and then  takes you out of your bottle before she sits down in an entire couch and smirks. \u201cAlright, human,\u201d she says. \u201cNow to see if you were worth the price. What to do for your first chore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the behemoth is pondering it over, you begin to sweat. What task does she finally decide to assign you to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A trilling beep suddenly sounds, startling you. Andrea produces a smartphone, and her eyes go wide at whatever is on the screen. \"Dammit, I almost forgot! I got so caught up in the auction!\" She shoved you in her breasts and took a laptop and phone headset from her purse. Within seconds, she had them set up and was jabbing on about bank accounts and huge numbers. She closed a call and plucked you from her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you can handle a little pedicure. Down you go.\" Your stomach lurches as Andrea suddenly lowers you to the floor in front of her bare hippo feet. They looked big enough to crush twenty people in one stomp. You scramble back, falling on your rear. Looking up, you see her rilfing through her purse, producing a bottle of candy-apple red nail polish. \"Ever painted a lady's nails before, little human? No? Well hope you're a fast learner.\" She set the bottle down next to you. It was taller than you were She unscrewed the lid, dipped the brush in the polish and shoved it in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt relief Andrea was a hippo: flat pachyderm feet meant no toes to get stuck between or have to climb over. Too bad her nails were enormous, as big as stained glass windows on a cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea stopped typing to jab a finger at you. \"These are <i>premium</i> hardwood floors, and I don't want <i>one drop</i> of red on them. You get polish on anything but my nails, and your next chore will be seat cushion.\" She gave her couch-filling butt a slap, grinning. \"Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Andrea's ass would have been like a mountain falling on you. You doubted you'd even leave a body, just burst like a grape beneath her rump leaving nothing but a tiny red stain. <br>\r\n\"...Couldn't you just put a towel down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea chuckles. It's the laugh of a mother whose toddler just said something adorably stupid. She pushes her glasses down her snout, leaning towards you. \"Sweetie, I'm the mistress; you're the human. You don't get to question your job, you just do it. Sure, I COULD put a towel down so no polish gets on the floor, but why not make it a bit more...challenging, for you? Hard work builds character, after all! Now chop-chop, get to painting. I'm meeting the girls tonight and want to look my best.\" And like you weren't even there, she went back to jabbering into her headset about rich hippos' money, fingers clacking at her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your face turn red. What a bitch! This hippo was making your job harder just because she could, just to make you fear failing even more than you already did! Being enslaved was bad enough, but you ended up with the most petty bitch possible. That sweet tone she insulted you with made it even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n No way would you just give up and let serving Andrea become your new life. You were gonna escape ASAP: anywhere but here. Even being a pet to a different hippo woman for the rest of your life would be more bearable than Andrea's condescending domination. Outsmarting this bitch couldn't be hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heft the brush, barely getting your arms around the wide lid. It's not heavy, but just keeping your grip was already making your arms ache. You didn't think you could even hold the giant nail brush fo two minutes, let alone long enough to paint Andrea's nails. But, failure meant getting sat on. Better just bear it and hope for the best for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking VERY careful steps, you get within reach of Andrea's left foot--the closest one--and start on the largest nail, moving the brush at a snail's pace (bottom of nail to top, to stay as far from the floor as possible) to keep your grip and make sure nothing dripped onto the floor. The brush <i>should</i> have painted the entire nail in two or three strokes, but with you barely able to hold it, your first brush barely covered a small corner of the nail. The next brush barely increased the coverage, and got a splatter of red on Andrea's foot when you had to stretch your aching arms to reach the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe, nearly dropping the brush. You waited a moment to see if she noticed the mistake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look into the Williams account, right now.\" Andrea was saying. You blink, stunned. Her voice had changed from her taunting earlier: it had steel now, intelligence. You forget your job and watch her above, flicking through financial records on her laptop. \"Last few weeks, there's been a lot of shady transfers from some overseas hedge fund. Hundred grand even, once a day at five on the dot. Traced the fund, and they only do business with a bunch of computer shops, all owned by Williams...and the shops all opened in the last year. The fund doesn't even have a website, either. To me, that spells 'money laundering'. If it is, we need to report it BEFORE  he gets busted for whatever he's doing or we'll be swimming in lawsuits. I sent you everything I found. Got it? Good, glad to help. Call me you find anything I missed.\" She closed the call and queued up another, rattling off what sounded like stock prices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay...you did NOT see that coming. <br>\r\nApparently Andrea was a financial powerhouse, and MUCH smarter than she let on. Maybe escaping her wouldn't be so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off your worries and try to get back to painting her nails. In two more strokes, you finally paint half of her largest nail. Your arms feel like they're on fire, your hands are numb. You pant just trying to keep the brush from falling. Could you even do this? Paint ALL her nails? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if you put the brush down and took a break, you'd get some strength back...but what if that just upset Andrea?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Andrea thinks, she absentmindedly chews on tongue. She let out a grunt of annoyance as she felt the piece of lettuce that had been stuck in her teeth since lunch. After a few seconds of trying to work it out with her tongue, her eyes fell back on you and an idea popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you'll do just nicely for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely didn't like the sound of that, or the mischievous look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do, ma'am?\" you asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" she said as she began rummaging around inside her purse with her free hand. \"I said that you would have to work to earn your place here, and that's exactly what you're going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't even want to be here!\" you whined. \"I want to go home! I don't even know where here is or how I got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea giggled, making you scowl. Apparently she found your confusion and fear amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, let's have none of that, little human,\" she said. \"Our race has been secretly abducting humans from your planet for the past few years now. Having a little human slave is all the rage now! I'm afraid you'll have to get used to the idea that you'll never see your home again. This is your home now, and I am your master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were angered at her complete nonchalance to your enslavement. This was your life, not some kind of game! Before you could tell her off, she let out a triumphant, \"Ah-ha!\" and pulled a roll of dental floss out of her purse. At first you weren't sure what she had planned, but after she snapped off a length of floss, a feeling of dread overcame you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Andrea said. \"I had quite a meal before that auction, and I got a bit of food stuck in my teeth as a result. I've been unable to get it for hours. So, what I need you to do is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it!\" you burst out. \"There's no way I'm going into your mouth to help you floss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea laughed instead of getting mad. \"Poor, little dear, you actually think you have a choice! Come now, dear, you're the size of an insect. If I want you in my mouth, there's not much you can do to stop me, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but... you just bought me! What if I get hurt? What if you eat me?! You'll have wasted your money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pish-posh,\" Andrea said. \"I have more self control than that! Now, once you get in there, it's the top teeth, in the back and to the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough stalling,\" she said, placing the strand of floss next to you on her palm. To you it was the size of a thick rope. \"There's no getting out of going in my mouth, my dear. I won't let you out until all the food in my teeth is gone, so unless you want to stay in there for a long, long time, I advice you work hard to get done quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't enough time to argue more, as Andrea lifted you before her mouth. Her smiling, purple lips parted, and her massive tongue rolled out in front of you like a super-sized red carpet being unfurled. Your hair was blown back as her warm breath wafted over you, carrying the scent of salad and ranch dressing. You knew arguing would be pointless. She was clearly past caring about your arguments, or your safety for that matter. You decided to just get this over with as quickly as possible. You coiled up the floss over your shoulder and took your first nervous steps onto her tongue. You fought an urge to hurl as your bare feet squished on her tongue. You weren't reassured when Andrea let out a sensual moan as she felt your skin on her tongue. Oh great, the thing that could eat you alive evidently loved your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to be both quick and careful as you walked across her tongue. The \"floor\" was slippery beneath your feet and you struggled to keep upright. Your efforts were futile though, as Andrea retracted her tongue back into her mouth, causing you to slip and fall. You face-planted on her tongue and Andrea let out another, \"Mmmmmmmmmmm.\" You stood back up, gagging on her spit as you did so. You and your cargo pants were now drenched. You began walking back to where she said the troublesome food was stuck, the smell of her breath getting worse the closer you got. She may have kept her mouth open but it was still growing darker as you neared her throat. You could just make out the lettuce pieces near the very back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were standing directly under where you'd be working, the obvious problem finally crossed your mind. \"Uh, how do I get up ther--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were once again sent sprawling to the ground from another sudden movement of Andrea's tongue. This time, she was moving her tongue up like an elevator, taking you to the spot you'd be working. Unfortunately, she overshot her mark and you ended up slamming into the roof of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" she said awkwardly, with her mouth full. \"Orry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two words were like cannons going off next your ears. You held your ears and grumbled as she positioned you in front of her teeth. Ready to get this whole thing over with, you forced the floss in between two gigantic teeth and began slowly working it up. It was hard work, and soon your arms were exhausted. The moisture of Andrea's mouth, and the constant work caused you to begin sweating. It felt like an hour before finally the damn lettuce leaf became unwedged. Unfortunately, it was the size and consistency of a wet blanket, and you didn't even have time to move as if felt on top of you. You struggled and pushed the partially digested food off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm finished!\" you said at last, wanting to finally get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O'w t n,\" her voice boomed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Throw it in,' you translated to yourself. You cast a frightened look back at the edge of her throat. Since entering her mouth you'd done your best to avoid looking at it. As far as you were concerned, it was scary enough to be the entrance to hell itself. Damn hippo. You knew what she was doing. She knew you were scared, but she wanted to rub her dominance in over you. Still, you knew you wouldn't be freed until you'd done everything she asked. You walked slowly, dragging the lettuce on the ground behind you. When you finally got a few feet--from your point of view--from the entrance to the bottomless pit, you struggled to pick up the lettuce leaf, and, with a great heave, tossed it down the behemoth's throat. You watched in morbid fascination as it fell, soon vanishing into darkness. You heard her gulp and were terrified by how easily that could've been you, a mere morsel of food to be paid no second thought to. Being so near to something so deadly finally fired your fight or flight response and you decided you need to get out of here. Right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you began backing away from the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm done now! You can let out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the light went out completely. Andrea had closed her mouth, leaving you in total darkness. Your heart pounded in fear as her giggles echoed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

It's warm and slimy and disgusting; you try to wipe the stuff off your face but your already-soaked hands just spread it around even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmmmmm....\"</i> There is was again, thunderous and booming. Andrea wasn't just dominating you, the titanic hippo was <i>enjoying your taste!</i> Fear kicks in and you try to scramble up, but her salivating maw is so slick you keep falling back down. You settle for getting up on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea! I said I'm done! This isn't funny, LET ME OUT!\" You yell, trying to keep your voice from cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat damn giggle echoes around her mouth again...and then her tongue <i>rockets</i> upward, knocking you down again as you're slammed into the roof of Andrea's mouth. The impact knocks the wind out of you and pancakes you between her tongue and the hard surface--you're submerged in saliva within the tight space and for a moment fear you'll drown. Andrea gulps down the saliva around you, moaning again. It must have picked up your apparently delicious flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tounge seems to fall out from under you, and after a brief drop you're back on the fleshy surface. Then the world--or rather, Andrea's head--tilts, and you go tumbling across her mouth; nearly hitting your head on her teeth as you faceplant on the inside of her cheek. Her massive tongue slams into your back, knocking you senseless and drenching you in yet more hippo-spit. By now you're completely soaked. Andrea sighs in bliss as she pummels you--no, TASTES you--over and over again. After a few moments, her head tilts to the other side and the process repeats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time, but she keeps playing with you--you're caught in a tsunami of spit and swished around, pinned under her tongue, and even come close to getting chewed; over and over again. All the while, Andrea moans and giggles. You nearly drown in her salive more times than you can count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, dazed and soaked, you find yourself flat on your back once again; on the hippo woman's (thankfully still) tongue. A hot gust rushes over you as she gives one last, throaty sigh of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vhat...wash...amazhink...\" Andrea slurs, trying to talk with her mouth full. \"Welp, guesh I'm dom whif dat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea's tongue tenses up, and you cringe as you wonder what this pachydermic dominatrix will do next.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright, sunny Summer day above the pacific ocean and you had decided to take the day to go sailing. You rented a sailboat and had gone out to see, looking at fish of all species swimming underneath the water under the light of the sun. \u201cThis is the life,\u201d you say. \u201cOut on the ocean, forgetting about the aches and pains of the big city. Makes me wish that I couldn\u2019t go back. You then let out a sigh. \u201cIf only that were a possibility. I have work in the morning... really early.\u201d That brief mention of your grueling job with obnoxious coworkers and an incompetent boss occuring in your head, for only a minute ruins your relaxing thoughts. But then you get over it and continue to sail out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were sailing, you lose track of time and you look at your waterproof watch before you let out a gasp. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d you yell. \u201cIt\u2019s almost two o\u2019clock! I better get back to shore!\u201d You turn around and start to sail back for the mainland... or at least you try to do so. The problem is that you sailed way too far out into the ocean and you had no clear idea where you were. You wander around aimlessly for an hour before you\u2019re exhausted. \u201cI really should\u2019ve paid more attention to where I was sailing. I\u2019m lost at sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bemoaning your situation when you hear a squawking above like one of those annoying seagulls. Sure enough, you look up and see one of those annoying seagulls. Actually, you see a whole flock of those annoying seagulls. \u201cSeagulls,\u201d you mutter. \u201cJust what I need.\u201d That was when realization hit you. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d you say to yourself. \u201cWhere there are birds, there\u2019s land. If I follow those seagulls, I should be able to head back to the mainland.\u201d You open the sail wide to let the wind take you and follow the seagulls and then you take out a paddle in order to avoid losing the trail. As you follow the seagulls, you see something in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see is an enormous blackish blue island with white and black spots all over it. You give a blink. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather odd looking island. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s anywhere near the mainland. \u201cOh well. Perhaps if I climb the top, I can look out and see where I am.\u201d You anchor the boat near the bottom of the island and then you step foot on the island and grunt. As you feel the ground under your feet, to your surprise, the ground was hard and felt like leather. You tap your foot a few times in confusion and rub your chin and then you climb further up the island. Or at least, you try to climb. The leather-like feel makes it rather difficult for you to position yourself. \u201cWhat kind of island is this? It feels like it isn\u2019t an island at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment the island begun to shake and you gasp. You try to grab the ground but its too thick and you have to grab the edge of the island. \u201cWhat?\u201d you ask. \u201cIslands don\u2019t have edges. Whoa!\u201d The island then starts moving, violently shaking the water and destroying the boat that you rented in the process. \u201cNo!\u201d you yell. \u201cCrap! There goes my damage deposit!\u201d Of course, you have much bigger problems (literally bigger) as the island rises up and reveals that it isn\u2019t an island at all. What you were on, was the shell of a giant, big-bellied, thick-skinned anthropomorphic leatherback sea turtle woman who from the looks of it, had a large Cleopatra-style nose, bright red lips and medium length reddish purple hair. The turtle woman feels you and then plucks you off her neck with her thick fingers as you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turtle giantess brings you up in front of her face and smirks. \u201cAren\u2019t you a cute little human,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep you.\u201d You can only blink as you look at the giant woman with a mix of surprise and fear.</span></div></div>",

I really don't know. Maybe I'll keep you as a pet or maybe I'll keep you as a servant. I really don't know for sure myself. I've never actually had a human before. But I have always wanted one. I'll decide what to do once I take you to my grotto.\" You look back and see nothing but ocean for miles. \"Grotto?\" you ask. \"You mean as in a cave? As in under the sea?\" The sea turtle licks her own cheek and then nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were worried and confused as to how the turtle thought she was supposed to pull something like a trip back to her grotto off. \"Wait a minute,\" you say. \"I can't breathe underwater.\" \"Us sea turtles can't either. We're just really good at holding our breath.\" \"But how are...?\" The sea turtle woman laughs uncontrollably and even gives a snort. \"Oh,\" she says as she pets you like a pet. \"Don't worry about that, my little human. I know a perfect place to keep you for the ride all the way back to my underwater grotto.\" The sea turtle then opened her mouth wide and showed flat teeth you didn't expect a turtle to have. She held out her tongue like a large and fleshy red carpet and you look in more fear than ever. The turtle obviously expected you to ride in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver and look into the turtle woman's eyes and she nods her head a few times before she points to the inside. This reminded you of a video game you played long ago that also involved a giant turtle's mouth. While reluctant to do so, you walk into the mouth just as the turtle shuts it and dives. You hold on tight to the turtle's tongue and hope you don't get swallowed. You stay in for 2 hours and your captor still is swimming through the ocean. You're beginning to wonder if there really is an undersea grotto or she's just planning to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you both manage to get to the grotto?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up to see the impossible. Last night you had fallen asleep in a comfy bed, but when you woke up now, you were lying on the floor of a plastic, hamster cage.  Instead of the pajamas you'd worn to bed, you were dressed in some kind of white jumpsuit. On realizing your situation, a flood of questions entered your mind: Have I been kidnapped? How? Why? What happened last night? Where were you? What the hell was going on?! You approached the clear wall of your prison to get a better look outside. What you saw made your jaw drop, and one question, more important than all the others, sounded off in your head and escaped your mouth, <i>\"Have I been shrunk?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside your cage you could see you were on a giant desk at the forefront of a classroom. From your point of view, the desk was as long as an airplane runway. A shiny, red apple next to the cage was easily three times as big as you were. But as large as a simple piece of fruit was, it was nothing compared to the gargantuan beings sitting in the desks facing you. None of them were human. In fact they all resembled different kinds of animals. In the front row sat a purple-colored rabbit wearing a turtle-neck sweater and round glasses. She had a notebook in front of her and was already writing. On either side of her was a muscled lioness dressed in a pink tracksuit, lazing about in her chair, and an obese elephant dressed as some kind of punk rocker who was nodding her head to the music blaring out of her headphones. There were at least half a dozen other giants seated behind them. There were only two things each of these colossal creatures present had in common. The first was that they all looked like they were college grads. The second was that they were all women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of them made your head spin, and you turned around, hoping that putting them out of your mind would make you feel better. Instead, a gigantic chalkboard filled your vision, and the words written on it caused you to fall to your knees: \"HUMAN OBEDIENCE 101!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell rang signaling the start of class just as the door to the classroom opened and a new figure walked inside, carrying a cardboard box under her arm. Like the others she was a giant animal who walked on two legs. She was a dog with white and silver fur. Her black hair was worn in a prim bun, and she wore rectangular glasses. She was dressed in a pink, low-cut blouse that revealed an impressive amount of cleavage, and a black skirt that barely covered her colossal ass. She was also monstrously obese. Her blue eyes fell on you as she entered. It was only for a moment but it frightened you almost more than waking up the size of an insect among giants had. There had been no warmth in her eyes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, class,\" the dog said in a clipped, frosty voice. She put her box down on the desk next to your cage and turned to face the class, all of whom were watching her attentively. \"I am Ms. Lovelace, and I will be your teacher for the summer. Being here means that each of you are planning on purchasing a human, but before you do, you wish to be educated on the best ways to own them. Now I realize human ownership is the big craze nowadays, but I'm here to warn you that it's not easy. Humans are incredibly expensive and very hard to care for. It's true that when we take them from earth we do subject them to procedures that increase their endurance, but that doesn't mean they're indestructible. If you're going to play with them or punish them, you need to know what counts as too much. Otherwise they break and you've just flushed the thousands needed to buy one straight down the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break?!\" you squeaked in terror. Unfortunately, they either couldn't hear you or couldn't care, since all of the ladies eyes were still on Ms. Lovelace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lovelace?\" the bunny girl asked, raising her hand. \"Isn't it true that there have been cases where some humans do become indestructible from our procedures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace sighed. \"Yes,\" she said in annoyance. \"There have been three cases where side effects from the procedures we subject them to, render the human indestructible. However, these are fluke cases that we've been unable to create on purpose. And there's no known way to find out if a human is impervious to damage short of intentionally trying to kill them and seeing if they survive. Since I doubt any of you girls want to make such a huge gamble with your money, we'll operate under the assumption that you haven't hit the proverbial jackpot with your human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl blushed in embarrassment and buried her face back in her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Ms. Lovelace continued. \"During the next few months, I will instruct you on the proper ways to care for your human, how to train them to follow your commands, how to punish them if they misbehave without killing them, how to condition them to be the perfect slave to you in every way. You'll learn things like how much pressure they can withstand, how long they can go without air, how long they can survive in stomach acids before being digested, and all the rest of the standard disciplinary techniques anthro owners use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the standard techniques?! You felt like you were going to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this human, here,\" she said, acknowledging your presence for the first time. All the rest of the ladies in class now looked at you, and you could see for the first time that there was a kind of hunger in some of their eyes. \"This one we've just got off planet last night. He'll be especially hard to control since he hasn't had time to adjust to his new role in life. Luckily I'm a trained professional, and I know all the best ways on how to shape your human slaves to your will. He'll assist me in showing you the master-servant dynamics of our relationships. You all won't start out with humans of your own. Until you learn enough to practice with my small helper here, you'll be using these life-size human dolls to try out for yourselves.\" As she said this, she reached into the cardboard box and pulled out a flesh-colored doll that resembled a fully-grown human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before we begin with these, I'll give you a brief lesson on basic human care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely listening as Ms. Lovelace began droning on about how often humans needed to eat and sleep. Instead you were trying to formulate a plan to break out of here and get back home. Unfortunately for you, there was absolutely no way out of your cage. The only opening was through the ceiling, and there was nothing in the cage to climb on to, to reach the top. And all the walls were flat. After twenty minutes of futilely trying to think of an escape plan, your fears finally wore you down and you just began trying to climb the clear walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk elephant saw your efforts and laughed. Ms. Lovelace broke off her lecture and turned to see what was so funny. You froze when her eyes fell on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace tut-ted in annoyance. \"I'm used to students disrupting my lectures, but most humans are usually too smart to try something like that. I see you're an exception to the rule,\" she said, triggering a chorus of laughs from her students. She didn't acknowledge them, only keeping her frosty glare on you. \"If you're so keen on making a scene in this class, I'd be more than happy to bring you front and center to everyone's attention. Let's get started with a demonstration on proper obedience training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace opened the cage and reached inside. You tried to scurry from her hand, but it was no good. She plucked you out of your jail easily and raised you to her face. You begged her to have mercy on you, but her face remained stoic as she pondered what kind of punishment she should inflict on you first.</span></div></div>",

She had tanned brown skin and black hair with violet streaks. She wore black lipstick and violet eye shadow. Her black t-shirt was form-fitting and had a human skull on it. Her thick legs were covered in fishnet stockings reaching up to her dark blue, plaid skirt. The end of her trunk was pierced with a silver stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class laughed at her suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in favor?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll hands went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Runt it is. Thank you for your suggestion, Greta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant girl blew you a mocking kiss and you glared at her. The sight of you trying to look intimidating must've been a special kind of pathetic because the class tittered at your display. Ms. Lovelace cleared her throat and the class went silent. Clearly they were much more scared of her than they were of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My personal preference for disciplining humans is just a simple sit,\" she said. \"It's painful, humiliating, and a quick way of reminding them how insignificant they are with minimal effort on your part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she spoke of this so matter-of-factly, you squirmed wildly in her hand, freaking out about what was about to happen. Ms. Lovelace ignored your efforts and wheeled out a stool wide enough to accommodate her monstrous ass to the front of the class. She pinned you on the seat with one finger and secured you to the leather with a strand of scotch tape. No matter how much you fought, the tape made sure you weren't going anywhere. Ms. Lovelace circled around you so that her backside was displayed to the class. To your panicked eyes, it looked like a moon ready to crash into the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch carefully now, because you're going to be performing this on the human test dolls I give you. If you do something that would result in the death of your human, they make a sound letting you know they're dead. Luckily they're easily replaceable, unlike our Runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher grabbed hold of a planetary cheek in each hand through the fabric of her skirt and spread them apart. She positioned herself so that your body would fit snuggly in the crack between them. You begged for mercy as the giant dog woman gently lowered herself on you. These cries became muffled as a mountain of flab spread over you and enveloped your entire body. Despite how gently Ms. Lovelace was seating herself, her butt seemed to want nothing more than to turn you into a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace was right. It was painful. It was humiliating. And you've never felt so insignificant in your life as this dog woman casually smooshed you beneath her butt. You knew the only reasons you were still alive was because whatever procedures they had subjected you to had increased your toughness, and because the teacher was holding back. It would take minimal effort for her to kill you right now. The pressure was unbearable that you couldn't so much as move a finger. Somehow you could still hear her lecturing the class as she used you as her personal cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The trick is to not put all your weight on them. One cheek is enough to turn your human into a red stain. I advise you get them between your cheeks so your weight is evenly distributed and not all directly on your pet. Also, remember to let your human breathe. After our procedures, they don't need as much oxygen, so you can keep them underneath you for as much as five minutes. Now please pay close attention as I display the proper ways to bounce and twist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to protest but your mouth was full of skirt-wrapped cellulite. Slowly, Ms. Lovelace began to bounce up and down, mashing you between her cheeks. Your whole body cried out in pain as the teacher put you through every butt-related punishment in chapter 1 of her class's text books. You were squashed and stretched like an accordion. Her cheeks chewed you up like a piece of gum. Every five minutes or so she'd stand up so you could gasp for air and let out some pathetic cries for help, before you once again disappeared underneath her ass as the class took notes. You were in so much pain and all the while you wondered what you'd ever done to deserve this as your body was ravaged by her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Ms. Lovelace got up and didn't sit back down. The class laughed at the sight of your mangled form. You were in too much pain to even give them the finger in defiance. Ms. Lovelace appraised you with the same cold, analytical expression from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as you can see, our human is still alive and well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well?!\"</i> you screamed in your head since you couldn't out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass around the human dolls now. You girls take ten minutes to practice what I showed you on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost grateful for the ten minute reprieve. At least, you would be, if the she-beast wasn't the one who'd caused you such pain to begin with. She may have claimed to be a professional, but another minute or so and you'd have no doubt you'd end up--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP! You heard a loud sound like a balloon popping. A pig girl had ended up breaking her human doll. She apologized profusely as Ms. Lovelace gave her another doll. You heard more pops as doll after doll broke beneath their owner's weight. By the time the ten minutes had passed only three students dolls were still intact. They belonged to the purple pear-shaped rabbit who'd asked about invincible humans at the beginning of class, the muscular lioness, and that behemoth, Greta, who'd given you the undignified name, \"Runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace congratulated each of them on keeping their dolls \"alive.\" Then she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Called the three girls up to demonstrate their sitting techniques on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Moves on to another disciplinary practice.</span></div></div>",

Me! Me!\" the lioness said and stepped forward before her classmates could object. She was in much better shape than Greta or the rabbit girl, but that didn't mean she looked lighter. She was completely ripped, her arms and legs bulging with muscles. Her fur was orange and her hair was gold. She wore a pink tracksuit, a white tube top underneath and gray yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Diana, you may go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness gave a hoot of joy and approached. \"Like what you see, little guy?

Her ass was so toned, it was like she was like being crushed beneath too boulders. You had no idea how she didn't pop her human doll because it felt like you would burst at any moment. The only bright side was that Ms. Lovelace seemed to notice that you weren't holding out so well. After only a minute she asked Diana to stand. You nearly shed tears of joy when Diana got off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Diana, please take your seat.

Not only was the elephant at least three times her weight, but for some reason she had it out for you. You pitied whichever poor human found himself in her clutches once she graduated this class. Greta approached you with an exaggerated swing in her step. She displayed her massive backside to the class proudly. She looked over her shoulder, met your eye, and ran one hand up a meaty thigh, ending it by giving one ass cheek a meaty smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't try begging again. You knew it wouldn't get you anywhere. That didn't make the fear any smaller when the behemoth backside began lowering down on top of your tiny form. As the flab washed over you, you experienced pain and pressure worse than you had under Ms. Lovelace. Greta was either a fast learner or she'd already been practicing before ever setting foot in class. She did all the same exercises that Ms. Lovelace had shown off for the class. She \"chewed\" you between her ass cheeks, bounced up and down on you, and ground her ass down into the leather upholstery. Ms. Lovelace was so impressed that she didn't ask her to stand until Greta had finished the entire routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive, Greta,\" Ms. Lovelace said. \"I believe you'll be getting extra credit for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there's a first time for everything,\" Greta laughed. \"I'd be more than happy to show off some of my own moves to the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh God, please don't!\"</i> you thought frantically, still underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that won't be necessary. Please stand so Kelly can take her turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta groaned but got up begrudgingly. \"Let's do this again some time,\" she said before going back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kelly, it's your turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly approached you far more nervously than the other two had. She seemed much more terrified of you than you were of her, and considering this was the most terrifying day of your life all around, that was saying something. When she met your eyes she blushed and immediately looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ms. Lovelace... I-I'm n-not sure I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, dear, there's nothing to worry about. He's not going to bite you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he does, trust me, it feels great!\" Greta said, drawing more laughs from the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace silenced Greta with a look then made a motion to Kelly to continue. Kelly stood over you but looked too scared to sit. She tried lowering herself on top of you, each time scaring you as your ravaged form prepared to experience even more pain, but before she could seat herself she would chicken out and stand upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do this <i>today</i>, Kelly,\" Ms. Lovelace said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit forced a determined look on her face. Finally she seemed ready to try. You just wished this whole thing could be over with. Kelly began to lower herself almost tortuously slowly. When she was mere centimeters from coming into contact with you, Greta blew a loud raspberry in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Greta thought Kelly would react, the rabbit handled it differently. Instead of slipping, she was so scared by the sudden noise that she literally jumped into the air. Her powerful rabbit legs sent her almost to the ceiling, before she came plummeting down, ass-first, aimed directly at where you were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass smashed into you with the force of a meteor, flattening you like a pancake. The entire class stared at her aghast at the likely death of the class pet. Even the aloof Ms. Lovelace and Greta herself looked horrified of what'd just happened. Kelly blushed furiously, her entire face turning pink and her ears drooping in shame. She felt your form underneath her and she never felt more mortified in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she mumbled to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you survive?</span></div></div>",

Your first was <i>\"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!\"</i> while your second was <i>\"GET THE FUCK OFF ME!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly got off and you took great pained breaths. She turned around and looked surprised to see that you hadn't become a red stain on the chair. Ms. Lovelace approached, clearly expecting the worst, only to look equally surprised when she saw you still alive on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ms. Lovelace,\" Kelly said nervously. \"Can humans usually survive something that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kelly. Most humans would've been reduced to paste after a squashing like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the rest of the class was standing up in their seats, trying to get a good look at you. At first they'd been shocked at your possible demise, but since learning you survived, you detected a distinctly hungry look in most of their eyes. Maybe it would've been better for you if you had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher peeled you off the seat between two fingers and raised you to her eye. She inspected you with a cold, analytical gaze. It felt like she was disassembling you with her eyes, trying to guess as to your physical makeup that could account for your survival. Whatever \"gentleness\" she treated you with before was gone now. She squeezed her fingers twice and seemed unsurprised when your ribcage didn't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lovelace,\" Greta said. She stepped forward eagerly, looking at you with an almost predatory gleam in her eye. \"Does this mean that Runt is invinc--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a bell ringing, signaling the end of class. Ms. Lovelace chose not to answer her student's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be all for today,\" she said. \"Read chapters 2 and 3 for class tomorrow.\" None of the students moved. They looked like they'd just found a new toy only to be told they couldn't play with it. \"Class dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace said it so sharply no one dared argue with her. One by one the students filed reluctantly out of the class, talking in whispered conversations. Greta and Kelly were the last to leave. You could overhear the elephant girl tell the blushing rabbit, \"See Kel, you shouldn't feel embarrassed. Thanks to your big butt we've just found out our class has the best toy ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was gone, Ms. Lovelace locked the door and pulled down a blind over the window so no one in the hall could see inside. When that was done she took a seat at her desk. She still gripped you in her fingers, staring at you with those cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Statistically, it's so unlikely for a human to become invulnerable from our experiments that it borders on impossible. Yet somehow you survived the equivalent of a mountain falling on you from orbit. It seems, perhaps, you may be invincible after all... Of course, that all could've been a fluke. Most humans would die from that, but it's possible you're just incredibly lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what you'd been through, you'd laugh in her face at being called lucky, but everything hurt too much for you to make even that display of defiance. Besides, there was something in the teacher's eyes that you dreaded seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An indestructible human would come in very handy,\" Ms. Lovelace admitted, \"but I'd need to test you further to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the love of God,\" you croaked in panic. \"What do you want from me? What else could you possibly do that would make you more sure I'm invincible than you are right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Ms. Lovelace smiled and the sight was cold and terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should ask,\" she said. \"There is one surefire thing I could do to you that would give me all the proof I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An ominous growl came from the teacher's stomach, making you grow pale. You hoped it wasn't a sign of things to come, but when Ms. Lovelace met your eyes again, she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the one thing no non-indestructible human has ever survived. At least, none of the humans I've eaten have ever lived through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've actually eaten people before? That's disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace shrugged. \"What can I say? It's not unheard of around these parts. Lots of girls enjoy snacking on tiny humans as a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately you're kind is too expensive for us working class folk to do it regularly. If we don't get you out before you digest than we just end up flushing away a big investment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I'm not invincible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll make up some excuse to explain your absence. I'll tell the class you ended up dying from Kelly after all and needed to be disposed of. We're insured for up to three replacement humans. I doubt your death wouldn't disrupt the curriculum too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puppy must've had solid ice running through her veins. You couldn't believe how casually she was talking about your possible death. She didn't even give you a chance to reply before suspending you above her head. From this angle, the light reflecting off her glasses completely blocked out her eyes, adding to her frosty face and making her look even more sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we'll have to finish this quickly. My lunch break is only fifteen minutes and I'd rather spend my time savoring my food than talking with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado she parted her lips and dropped you. Your tiny form was sent flailing downwards towards the hungry abyss that awaited you. You landed upon Ms. Lovelace's slimy tongue with a splat, and immediately the great pink serpent got to work running itself over every inch of your body. She used it to work you through her mouth, rubbing you against the inside of her cheeks. She sucked on you like a candy, drenching your clothes with dog spit. She ran you across her jagged canines and you were terrified that she'd tried to test you further my chewing you with them. Luckily she seemed to prefer her meal whole and intact, and instead she focused on just getting as much flavor as she could out of you before finishing you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace leaned back in her seat, her massive bulk making the chair creak and threatened to cause it to shatter into splinters. She looked just as emotionless as always. The only sign that she was enjoying her snack at all was her tail involuntarily wagging. If she'd noticed she would've tried to stop it before anyone else could see, but she was too busy slurping away at her treat to realize what she was doing. You were far tastier than the other humans she'd eaten. She found herself hoping you really did survive her insides so she could do this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue kept up the assault on your body for the full fifteen minutes of her lunch break. As soon as it was over she effortlessly maneuvered you to the back of her throat. You tried begging one last time but your plea fell on deaf ears. She swallowed you with a single gulp, sending you plummeting downwards once again. The only difference was that at the end of this free fall you were meant with an ocean of stomach acid instead of a giant pink tongue. You landed in the midst of gastric juices with a pathetic \"plop\". Your arrival in her stomach was heralded by Ms. Lovelace giving off an involuntary belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"UUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the burp was so strong it surprised her, actually bringing a slight blush to her otherwise cool face. She was very much grateful that no one was around to witness that. She smacked her lips, tasting you again in her mouth, then adjusted her glasses and started gathering her papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of your fleshy prison started moving as Ms. Lovelace got up and left the classroom. The contents of her stomach swayed, carrying you along with them on the waves of gastric juices. You truly hadn't thought things could get any worse than when she started her first lesson, but now, the best thing that could possibly happen to you was that you'd digest in this woman's stomach and be free from your torment. If you survived, you'd only be subjected to more torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just so exhausted. Every part of your body hurt from the days experiences. You were drained both physically and emotionally, and you wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep and pray you'd wake up in your own bed, this entire ordeal some surreal nightmare. Minutes past and the swaying of the teacher's movements, combined with the overwhelming heat and foul smells of the stomach worked together with your fatigue to make you pass out. Your consciousness sank into blackness as your body sank beneath the tingling surface of the dog woman's stomach acids. Your last thought before you blacked out was gratitude for the reprieve from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you survive digestion because you're indestructible?</span></div></div>",

Your body was run up and down a giant white block the size of a building. For a second you didn't know where you were or what was happening, then you began choking on the suds and realization dawned on you. You were in a gigantic bathroom, in a sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight shined through the windows and birds were singing. It was morning. All your clothes, save for your boxers, were gone. Ms. Lovelace was scrubbing you clean with a bar of soap, and she was doing it none too gently. She was wearing a different outfit from before, a blue shirt and white pants. She wasn't wearing any makeup. How long had you been out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally awake?\" she asked. \"I was surprised at how long you've been unconscious. I thought for sure you'd be awake when you came back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right. You remembered. You'd been swallowed! This evil bitch had actually gone ahead and eaten you alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait,\"</i> you thought feeling queasy. <i>\"How did I get out--No. Never mind. I'm not going to think about it. She threw me up. That is what happened. That is what I believe.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been twelve hours since I ate you,\" Ms. Lovelace said. \"It looks like our test was a success. You truly are invincible. Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm freaking jumping for joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem in an awful mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I care about being polite?\" you shouted at her. \"You're just going to do what you want with me anyway, and I already know I'll survive it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lovelace narrowed her eyes. \"You'd do well to keep a civil tongue in that mouth. Just because you can survive anything doesn't mean you won't wish you hadn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't argue with that. Your giant captor scrubbed you even harder with the soap than before. She stopped several minutes later and dried you off with a hand towel the size of a circus tent to you. When she was done, she dropped you carelessly onto the bathroom counter, next to a pair of clothes your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we've determined your endurance, it's time to decide what would be the best place for you.\" She began applying mascara, not looking at you as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I have yet to decide if the classroom is really the right fit for you. Once the girls know you're invincible it's unlikely they'll show the necessary restraint in handling you. The entire point of the class is for them to learn how to treat their humans without breaking them. An unbreakable human defeats the purpose, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you can't use me in your teaching... Does that mean you'll let me go?\" you asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, heavens no. Just because you can't be used in my lessons doesn't mean I'll let a perfectly good human go to waste. You'd stay with me, of course. I am certified in the care and handling of humans. There's no one better qualified to look after you than myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you turned out perfectly fine, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't know which prospect was worse. On the one hand, the girls in the class would've ended up killing you anyway if you weren't invincible, on the other hand, you knew for a fact that Ms. Lovelace didn't care at all about your wellbeing. While the students were careless, the teacher was evil! There may also be the possibility that a student might take pity on you. Maybe one would be open to helping you escape from this terrible place. Either way, the choice was out of your hands entirely. Ms. Lovelace was the one who'd ultimately decide what's to be done with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ms. Lovelace return you to school as a human test dummy, or does she keep you for herself?</span></div></div>",

It was his senior year and he was now legally an adult which meant things were about to get expensive. Being that he lived in a small pig farming town most jobs required lots of work and low pay. However recently some sort of disgraced physicist on the edge of his town sent out an ad for a lab assistant that paid well above minimum wage. Luckily he saw this early, applied, and received the job after signing a confidentiality contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been boring, Chip mostly just filmed him giving audible journal logues about scientific nonsense and carried heavy equipment. He wasn't even supposed to work today but his employer was adamant. Chip entered the laboratory and saw that the lights were off and it was empty. There was also what looked like a large 1950s ray gun propped up on a stand. He walked over to it and saw a sticky note that read \"Warning Time Machine, that's right Time Machine! Only prototype. Malfunctioning. Went out for proper tools. Please don't touch!\" Chip couldn't believe what he was reading, his employer actually believes that he built a time machine. He rolled his eyes and flicked the light switch on. The lights came on but so did the ray gun, it glowed a neon green and was pointing at Chip. Before he could react a mechanical voice said \"future\" then shot a green bolt of lightning at him that caused his body to explode into a million little particles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip was disoriented as his vision was emerald static chaos. Then he could see the world again and the particles reassembled his body in the middle of a field. He shook as he was in unfamiliar territory but then noticed something familiar, his town, with one big difference. All of the buildings were a lot bigger, big enough to house something 10 times as big as a human being. He started to wonder if the machine in the lab was a shrink ray not a time machine, that didnt link up though since the plants were the same sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then someone ran into Chip. It was a guy around his age except his clothes were rags and his facial hair is long and unkempt, that was panting like crazy. \"Hey what-!\" Chip tried to say before the man ran away screaming \"Run for your freedom brother!\". He was confused over what he said then looked where he ran from and couldn't believe his eyes. Over the ridge three 10 foot tall obese pig ladies were sprinting in his direction. The jiggling mounds of flesh terrified him beyond belief. Their rumps were massive each cheek as tall as he was, there breasts were so large that their bra size went well beyond the alphabet in size, with a cleavage that he could easily disappear into. He jumped up and ran away toward the forest the other guy ran towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip ran as fast as he could dodging branches and leaping over bushes. Meanwhile behind him the ground shook and the plantlife was steamrolled behind him. He saw the man from before climbing a tree and he thought he should hide as well. Frantically searching, he found a hollowed out log and crawled inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside a small, coastal village in the south, a group of guards marched you to a nearby cliff overlooking the ocean. Your hands were bound behind your back and a gag was placed in your mouth. The guards surrounding you were jittery, looking at you like they expected you to make a mad dash at any moment, and to be perfectly fair, you had done so several times in the hour you'd spent marching only to be pummeled into submission. After the fifth time you couldn't see the point any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump, middle-aged priestess who was in charge of the guards stood nearby as you marched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're not happy about this,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot her a death glare in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, the village really appreciates the sacrifice you're making today. I know it's not ideal, but who knows? Maybe the Ocean Goddess will be a fair mistress? After all, she offered the village her eternal protection in exchange for one soul to claim for herself. That's a remarkably good deal for us! Not so much for you but... um...\" she coughed awkwardly. \"Look, it wasn't easy making a decision! We didn't know what to do! It's not everyday an animal goddess appears out of the blue and offers to make a divine pact! I mean, you saw the size of her. Who would refuse someone that big? Besides, who knows what disasters could be avoided by her protection? And it wasn't like you were doing much in your life, shirking off work, mooching off your parents, I mean, you're twenty years old! It's about time you did something with your life... Or rather, for <i>someone</i> to do something with your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven behind your gag she could make out the string of curses you threw at her. She blushed in shock, and a nearby guard whacked you on the back of your head to get you to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to the priestess like that, boy!\" he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely growled in response. This whole situation was unfair! One day you had just been living your life and the next your entire village, even your own family, had eagerly offered you up to some titanic behemoth! You had seen her only once before, when she had first made her offer to the village. It didn't help that the way she worded it could've meant either slavery or death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your group reached their destination, and you were marched onto a stone slab on the cliff's edge, the ocean simmering far below you. Short of making a suicidal leap, there was no way out of this. You were brought to your knees and tied down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you, the fat priestess intoned, \"Oh noble, ocean goddess who has offered us your everlasting protection, we have come before you today to seal the pact between our village and your divine form. As promised, in exchange we offer you this meager, meager, <i>meager</i> sacrifice to do with as you wish. Whether that be to devour him alive, enslave him eternally in the celestial realm, or subject him to tortures too horrible for us mere mortals to even contemplate--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP GIVING HER SUGGESTIONS!\" you shouted through your gag. Only the fact that this was a divine ceremony protected you from another blow from a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess coughed. \"Yes, well, um... In the words of The Priestess of the Anthro Pantheon, \"He's all yours, boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocean started bubbling, and the ground started to shake. The guards looked at each other nervously but were too frightened to move. The weight of the situation hitting you, you started struggling against your restraints, but to no avail. A blinding circle of white light shined on the sea, and a second later the goddess emerged from the depths of the ocean with a tremendous explosion of water. You gulped as you saw her gigantic form. She was just as massive as you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an obese, whale giantess who stood head and shoulders over the mountain. Her skin was sapphire blue and it shimmered in the light of the sun from the water coating her body. She wore a black toga that could barely contained the massive swell of her chest or her colossal ass, which seemed large enough to crush half of your village. She wore pink eye shadow, and had pink hair that was drawn back into a braid that stretched down past her shoulders. She wore a gold tiara inlaid with pearls over the small fin on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately her sea-green eyes locked onto your miniscule form, and her ruby red lips formed a wicked smirk. Her name... was Pearl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she said in a haughty contralto, \"this one will do quite nicely.\" You shivered as he licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess coughed to gain her goddess's attention. \"So... do we have an agreement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, yes, yes. Eternal protection, blah, blah, blah. Now run along back to your little village, while this little man and I attend to matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess and guards quickly complied, scurrying away and not even sparing you a backwards glance. \"Bastards,\" you thought. Your attention was quickly drawn back to your more immediate problem as you felt Pearl's gaze on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my little sacrifice, don't you just look positively scrumptious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said it, you couldn't tell if she meant this hungrily or lustfully. Either way, you were terrified and tried vainly to escape your bonds again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl raised her pinkie finger and used the tip of a pink nail to slice the ropes holding you. Your freedom lasted less than a millisecond before she plucked you up between two fingers with a speed and careful muscle control that you wouldn't have believed from something her size. She brought you before one giant eye and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look even better up close, handsome. Now, let's say we make our way back to my celestial realm and get working on... what was it your priestess called it? Oh right! \"Tortures too horrible for mortals to even contemplate.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea whether she was serious or not, but you had no intention to find out. You struggled pointlessly in her grip and Pearl giggled at your pathetic display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend holding your breath,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't able to process this quickly enough, but with a dawning terror you realized what she meant as the water surrounding Pearl glowed with a blinding white light. There wasn't even enough time for you to cry out as Pearl descended back into the ocean, dragging you out of the mortal world and into her celestial realm.</span></div></div>",

You were finally able to rip the gag out of your mouth as you gasped for air and coughed up water. You were soaking wet and shivering from the cold, but Pearl was perfectly fine. \"Home sweet home,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's home looked like a two-story penthouse apartment built inside of an aquarium. The walls, floor and ceiling were made out of a light purple coral, and the huge windows outside gave view to the vastness of the ocean. Colorful fish and other forms of aquatic life you never knew existed swam by. The lamps gave off sea-green light. The place was decorated with sea shells and maritime equipment, it even had some clams and anemones. A luxurious hot tub was in her living room, bubbling away before a large, flatscreen tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, eh, my little sacrifice?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It--It's really quite lovely,\" you choked out, not wanting to offend the behemoth who held you between her two fingers. \"You have impeccable taste... ma'am?\" you said, not quite sure how to address a literal goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl smiled at that all the same. She walked over to her hot tub and suspended you over a pink anemone. She dropped you into it, and immediately the wiggling tentacle bits wrapped around you, leaving only your head free. They tingled uncomfortably. Pearl winked at you then disrobed, revealing the black bikini she wore underneath her toga. She lowered herself into the bubbling water. She reached over to a nearby bottle of red wine and poured herself a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sipped at her glass and let out a contented sigh afterwards. \"This is the life,\" she said. \"Did you know this hot tub is heated by an underwater volcano?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" you said. \"Um, listen... ma'am,\" you said, not quite knowing how to address a literal goddess, \"there's been a big misunderstanding. I never agreed to be sacrificed. So if you could just let me go, I'd be really grateful! You can even enslave my old village for lying to you, if you'd like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl chuckled, \"Oh, aren't you precious? No one <i>chooses</i> to be sacrificed, my scrumptious friend. At least, most don't. And I won't lie. If any of the volunteers knew what some of us goddesses did to them, they'd probably withdraw that offer instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Um... Wh--What do you do to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Pearl said. \"Oh nothing yet! I just got promoted to this gig, wasn't authorized to have a sacrifice bequeathed to me before. You're my first. Aren't you the lucky one?\" she said, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, more in fear than amusement. \"YEP!\" you choked out. \"Lucky, lucky! Honestly though, I feel like I'm not... um--worthy! Of the honor! If you'd like to put me back I'd completely understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl rolled her eyes and snapped her fingers. You yelped as the anemone gave you an unpleasant shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please give up thoughts of escape, dear. That will grow tiring quickly, and I'm afraid I'll have to punish you if you annoy me. Don't worry though, in my realm you're unable to die unless I allow it. So you'll be able to survive even the most excruciating of torments.\" She said this last part like it was seriously a great comfort to you. \"Which is lucky, because I have big plans for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you blurted out. \"What plans?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my little sacrifice, it was very important that I retrieved a mortal soul. I need you for a very important purpose. I need you as a...</span></div></div>",

Basically someone to practice and play with between my duties as a goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"WHAT?!?\"</b></i> you bellow, surprising yourself with how loud you were. \"I'm just some <i>toy</i> for you to lord over?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl sighed, setting her wine glass aside. \"More like a cute pet to play with, but...yes, my little sacrifice. That's your lot in life now.\" She reached over and plucked you out of the anemone, holding you close to her face. \"Look, I'm new to this 'goddess' thing; I haven't really adjusted yet. I'm the Goddess of the <i>Oceans</i>; that's half of your mortal planet! That's a big workload!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seventy percent of the planet....\" you mumble. Apparently this so-called \"Goddess\" hadn't looked at a globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl either didn't hear your snark, or ignored it. \"And this is the first time I've really interacted with humans. I mean, my parents gave me some pirates and other bad guys to play with when I was a little kid, but...I just ate or sat on them when I got bored. They deserved it, but that's not the same thing as having to <i>protect</i> a whole village of humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Pearl's rambling, you cringe. She was just so <i>casual</i> when she talked about the poor saps she'd eaten alive or crushed when they weren't amusing any more...and she'd done that as a <i>kid</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I need...practice. A human who's around all the time, so I can finally get the 'lording over mortals' thing down. The voice, how to give orders; all that,\" Pearl concluded. Then she smirked. \"And when the job gets stressful, I'll also need some...stress relief. A nice fin massage; or just chase around.....maybe even sit on you, if I'm in that sort of mood.\" She winked, shaking her hips under the water and making waves. \"But don't worry, that's more of a guilty pleasure now that I've grown up. Mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to sweat. Just what was this giant whale woman going to do to you? It sounded like you'd be her adviser half the time; her helpless toy the other half! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl giggled at your bewilderment and finished off her wine. \"Well, it looks like I'm getting the 'show mortals their place' part of the job down pat.\" She lumbered out of the jacuzzi and set you on the tub's rim as she toweled off. Not bothering to put her toga back on, she snatched you up again. \"Well, my little sacrifice; I think it's time we celebrate my promotion to goddesshood, and your new lease on life!\" She announced cheerfully. \"And I know just the way to do it. I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The couch moaned once again, but it still manged to stay up. \"So\" She turns to face you, \"Tell me about yourself.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you did. For the next hour and half all the two of you did was talk and get to know each other. Your life has been hard, and particularly unkind. Your parents died when you were a kid, leaving you an orphan, which was for some reason looked down upon in the prehistoric village. You was smart, but you never really got the chance to apply my ideas. You told Pearl why your were chosen, because you were a bachelor, and she looked at you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" Pearl asks in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"21 Years.\" you reply causally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl then scowls, \"So this head priestess lady chose you because you weren't married yet? That has to be the stupidest reason to be a sacrifice i ever heard!\" She huffs and crosses her pudgy arms around her bosom. \"Geeze, I thought at least you did something bad to deserve this, but...because you don't have a girlfriend!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl surprised you with how much fuss she was going over about yourself. Your first impression of her was that she was a bored, if not sadistic young adult who just wanted a plaything. But seeing her right now...It made the prospect of being a slave a little more appealing. Relatively, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If I may ask?\" her voice become a bit serious. \"Do you ever want to get married? I mean, not now because your my slave and everything, but you know...later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen up a bit at this question. You really hoped she wouldn't ask something like this. \"I'm....I'm afraid of love.\" You explain, which gets a puzzled face from Pearl. \"Im afraid of falling in live with someone, actually feel about them, get married...and lose interest. I don't want the love to just fade away as the years go by and be stuck in a hollow shell of something that was once beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wow\". Pearl says after a moment of silence, \"That was deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You smile a bit. It was the first time you felt happy today. \"So, what's <i>your</i> story?\" You say, felling a bit more causal around your new mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that her life was exceptionally better then yours. The only complaints she had about it were typical first world problems. You were actually really intrigued in  her backstory. You cringed a bit when she casually mentioned eating a bunch of pirates alive, but other then that she seemed like a fairly nice person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we've got that out of the way,\" Pearl grabs you and lifts you off the couch, but you don't struggle. Not because you were afraid of her, but you genuinely felt safe being around her. She gets up and the couch spring back to life, happy to have the weight taken off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why don't we...?\"</span></div></div>",

Once a year, we goddesses gather together, chose a human champion, and give them a series of challenges to complete. Then, a panel of judges decides which performance was best. The goddess whose champion gets the highest score wins!\" Pearl sighed dreamily. \"Oh it's so wonderful, the winner gets a fame, fortune, and eternal glory as their name is inscribed on the Wall of Champions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd get all that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl laughed in your face. \"No, silly! The winning <i>goddess</i> gets that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms in a huff, \"So what does the winning mortal get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A participation ribbon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! You could at least send me home if I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl sighed, as if pitying you. \"I told you, darling. There's no going home. No mortal ever returns after being taken to the heavens. We can't let them leave, knowing what they know about us. People would lose all respect for us if they knew that even a goddess needs to break wind every now and then. I'll tell you what, I don't want a miserable mortal for a slave. If you compete in the games and really give it your all, I promise that I'll make your servitude here as happy as reasonably possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" you huffed. \"That's all you're offering?! \"Happy\" slavery? What a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl narrowed her eyes. \"I could always make it <i>unhappy slavery</i> if you prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the way she said it, along with a cold glimmer in her eyes hinting at buried cruelty that made you not want to press her on this. You sighed. \"So I just have to fight a bunch of humans? That's not so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl smirked. \"Well there is one correction, darling, you don't actually fight against any <i>humans</i>. They're just the ones whose scores you need to beat. Mortals fight the goddesses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not technically fight. At least not usually. Each challenge is devised by a goddess and rarely is one of us cruel enough to set you up in an actual fight. Instead it's just a series of games where you need to best us in some way. If you do well, you'll be fine! If not, then you'll probably be humiliated, squashed or eaten. But that just gives you all the more incentive to persevere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! No way am I going to do that! You can find yourself another dupe, cause--YOOOOWCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, the anemone shocked you again. It felt ten times as painful as it was before. That immediately shut you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" Pearl said, clearly at the end of her patience. \"All you have to do is compete. You're immortal. You'll survive. Keep mouthing off, and that immortality will go away fast. Ever wonder what happens when you disappear from the heavens? The demonesses in charge of the infernal realm would be more than happy to educate you. This is the first Goddess Games I'm able to compete in and I only just managed to get promoted in time. I'm not going to have my first games ruined by an uppity mortal. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Pearl said. In an instant, the composed, regal goddess who had first collected you reappeared. She reclined in her hot tub, sipping her wine, serenely. \"We'll have a week to train. All I ask is you do your best. No pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed, and it was not a fun experience for you. Pearl tried to cram a year's worth of training into seven days, and it easily became seven days of hell. You'd never been the most coordinated person, sports, hell, even physical labor were a strain for you. Unfortunately, in the practice games Pearl devised based on previous events, this resulted in a lot of you being stomped, sat on, eaten, and, in one memorable occasion, used as a literal hacky-sack. Because of your immortality, you survived each game, but somehow the pain and humiliation of each event never lessened. Being eaten the tenth time was just as bad as being eaten the first. Seeing your lack of progress, Pearl became even more dedicated to working you harder to gain improvement. The games became more brutal. However, by week's end the only thing that had been accomplished is that you ached all over and were only slightly less of an embarrassment than you first started. Pearl's assurances of, \"Do your best. No pressure,\" came as more of a mantra directed to keep her spirits up than to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the week was done, you both departed to the Coliseum where the games were being held. It must've been packed, because you could hear the roar of the crowd from outside. Pearl walked the steps, carrying you delicately. You didn't know which of you was more nervous, you or her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pressure, no pressure, no pressure,\" Pearl murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the entrance, three figures appeared, breaking out of the shadows. They were goddesses, all, and all of them were built like Pearl, obese, large chested and fat-assed. The only difference is that these goddesses were bigger than Pearl! You would never have imagined in your wildest dreams that Pearl would be the runt of the goddess litter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the three figures, the tallest and fattest, a golden-skinned dragoness in a red toga approached Pearl. Not only were her shoulders over Pearl's head, but her long neck made her even taller. Even her jewelry looked bigger and fancier than Pearl's. The dragoness tossed her long, midnight-black hair over her shoulder, narrowed her heavily mascared eyes, and smiled her ruby-red lips in a false sweetness, showing off giant, surprisingly white fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pearl!\" the dragoness said in faked joy. \"You made it! I'm so happy! When I heard you'd been promoted, I couldn't believe my ears. Little guppy Pearl, all grown up and part of the pantheon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello, Dracana,\" Pearl mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized that name. It was the name of the goddess of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy girl,\" Dracana said. \"No need to be nervous, you're among friends here! And is that your human? He's so precious and widdle! I just wanna eat him up! And maybe I'll get my chance. Fingers crossed right?\" she said, and her two friends giggled sycophantically behind her. \"This is, of course, Romulus, he's been the champion of the last three games, as you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even seen the human confidently standing in the palm of Dracana's hand. He was as giant to you, as his mistress was to yours. Only where Dracana's bulk came from fat, Romulus's came from more muscles than you could imagine. He surveyed you imperiously and made a throat-slitting motion afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure your little fella still has a shot. It's not like you're still that that awkward little girl back in school. Sure, some people say you only got promoted to improve relations with hell after your sister became ruler, but we know better don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Dracana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, it was great seeing you again. Good luck in the games, not that you'll need it with such a strapping specimen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana walked off with her friends, all three giggling as they entered the Coliseum. Pearl breathed deeply for a minute. Finally you worked up the courage to ask, \"Pearl? Are you ok--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'RE BEATING THAT SMUG BITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched at her sudden outburst. \"What?! But Pearl, you said no pressure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK IT! LOTS OF PRESSURE! TONS OF PRESSURE! I earned this position! I'm in charge of the ocean! I cover 75% of the planet for crying out loud! I can't help it if my sister conquered hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pearl, calm d--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T TELL ME TO KEP CALM! I swear, if you don't help me put that overgrown crocodile in her place, you're gonna wish I sent you to hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could argue more, trumpets sounded, signaling the start of the games. Pearl cursed and rushed in, carrying you along roughly. This was gonna be awful. Pearl just managed to get to her spot on stage with the rest of the goddesses as the announcer announced the first event. What was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the name of the game was announced, the ring in the center of the Coliseum opened up, and a red, cushioned kline, a type of reclining couch used for eating, rose up on an elevator. This kline was different though, a golden arm was attached to it, and was suspended over where a person's head would be. Next to the couch was a table with a bowl on top, filled with bunches of grapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the earth goddess, Lila, come to the center of the arena please stage please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a bad feeling as one of Dracana's two cronies marched off the stage. The earth goddess was a gigantic, green-skinned sow with blue hair, decorated with flowers. As she marched to the center of the Coliseum, the crowd cheered and giant screens hanging on the walls, zoomed in on her as she waved at the crowd. Her human, a kind from the same stock as Romulus, stood fear-free on her shoulder. You noticed a pair of pink boots on his feet, making an otherwise serious-looking man, look kind of ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer explained the rules of the game as Lila neared the center. \"This game was submitted by Lila. As custom, she and her human will go first. The rules of this game are simple, each mortal will be suspended over Lila's mouth and try to feed her as many grapes as possible while an hour glass counts down. The challenge is over once all the sand, or all the grapes, run out. Or, if the poor, little mortal falls, in which case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer paused and Lila chomped her teeth, causing the crowd to go wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always, goddesses are reminded not to go easy on their mortals, or they will be banned from future games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila rolled her eyes and attached her grapes to the golden hand over the couch. She then plucked her mortal off her shoulder and put him on top of her snack, laying down afterwards and opening her mouth. The camera closed-in on her mortal, but he still seemed remarkably carefree. Presumably they had practiced this themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, two, one...\" the announcer called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG! A gunshot went off and the announcer said, \"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila's tiny human scurried amidst the grapes. You were surprised at the level of skill he showed, climbing down grapes the size of boulders until he reached the bottom. After getting a sturdy hold on the branch, the small man began stomping on a grape, his mistress's mouth, eagerly anticipating a fruity snack. You were amazed that within two solid kicks, the grape disconnected and disappeared down her gullet. How strong was this guy?! Steadily the human went from grape to grape, stomped on it to send it falling to his mistress, then moved on. He was making remarkable time too. You wondered if he would succeed in actually feeding her the entire bunch when he landed on one grape, only for it to snap before he could get a steadily hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan and grape plummeted, but even as he fell the mortal didn't scream at all. You pitied the poor bastard, even if his defeat meant good things for you. Even if being digested was survivable, it wasn't exactly a pain free process. You needn't have bothered worrying about him. As his mistress's mouth loomed beneath him, the man clicked the heels of his pink boots together and he took flight. Lila's teeth chomped beneath him, but the man was out of reach and flying back to the bunch, where he resumed his grape stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the whole thing dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAGIC?! HE CAN DO MAGIC?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid,\" Pearl said. \"Humans can't perform magic... They can use magical artifacts, though. And the rules don't forbid them outright, only limits them to one per human. It gives mortals a fighting chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME ONE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I tried?!\" Pearl snapped. \"I told you I only just got qualified for these games! They were all sold out, so you're just gonna have to do this the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt nauseous as your fellow champion finished the challenge. By the time the game was over, three-quarters of the bunch had vanished into his mistress's gut. The five judges calculated his score, and the screens displayed 38 points. Lila shrugged then got her human out of the grapes and placed him on the table, where he bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, relax,\" you told yourself. \"You'll just watch the other competitors and use them to come up with a strategy. You'll have plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for our next contestant,\" the announcer said. \"A newcomer to the Goddess Games, ladies, please welcome the ocean goddess, Pearl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE!\" you screamed involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the sound system was better than you thought as your voice rang out in the Coliseum. The crowd and fellow contestants laughed, Dracana loudest of all. Pearl blushed, shooting you a furious glare. You flinched at the intensity of her glare. She marched quickly offstage, replaced the half-eaten grapes with a fresh bunch, and placed you inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Guppy,\" Lila said to Pearl. \"He looks delicious!\" she said, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered and Pearl put her face near your insignificant body. \"Don't. Blow this,\" she murmured then went back on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you said to yourself in a panic. \"I can do this! No problem! No problem at all! Worst case scenario, if I fail I'll just be in for an eternity of suffering at the hands of a vengeful goddess... I need to lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could though, the gun went off nearly giving you a heart attack from the sound. You were on a grape at the top of the bunch and for a couple seconds you weren't sure what to do. The crowd jeered you're lack of movement, and beneath you, Lila said, \"Hurry up, shrimp, I'm wasting away down here! Get to feeding me! Unless you just wanna hope in right now?\" Lila opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out obscenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slapped yourself to regain your composure and, with no better plan in place, you began stomping on the grape you were on just as Lila's human had. You figured those boots must have enhanced his strength as well as giving him the ability to fly, because it was much harder for you to dislodge a grape than it was for him. Either that or you really were this much of a weakling. After ten stomps, finally the damn thing gave way. Unfortunately for you, the grape didn't land on Lila's face, it bounced off its fellow and landed on her cheek, then rolled off and fell on the floor. Judging from the boos of the crowd, you figured that meant it wouldn't count. Lila rolled her eyes. Not a strong start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered how Lila's human had started at the top, but began feeding her from the bottom of the bunch. You began crawling down to mimic his pattern. Unlike Lila's champion, however, you had no magic, flying boots, so the fear of falling and being devoured was much more real to you than it had been to him. You made your way cautiously downwards, all while hearing the jeers of the crowd. After what felt like several minutes you reached the bottom. You were already exhausted from the climb and had no idea how much time you had left. Dripping with sweat, you wrapped your arms around the vine for a good hold then began stomping on the grape. The good news was that this grape came away at only two kicks. The bad news was that you weren't prepared for deliberately kicking your \"floor\" out from under you, and began sliding down the vine as the grape fell, your sweat-slick hands and arms giving you poor purchase. You eventually came to a stop, but only at the very edge of the vine, your legs kicking in thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath you, Lila loudly chomped on her grape. A second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sow let loose a mighty belch that stank of grapes. The sound shook you, and the smell made you dizzy. Lila smacked her lips. \"Great appetizer... Now how about a little protein?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the abject humiliation of breaking down crying in front of the entire pantheon stopped you from doing just that. For a wild instant you wondered if you should just let go and get it over with. Who knows, maybe you could make a comeback in the next round? You looked to your side and saw Pearl's face on the arena screen. One look at that was enough to get you to reconsider. Who knows what she'd do if you just gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully slowly, you began climbing back up the vine. The crowd was going impatient as they quickly took up the chant of, \"EAT HIM! EAT HIM! EAT HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate the gods,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you reached up, only for your hand to give way. You start sliding back down and let out a panicked cry as Lila opened wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you stop yourself and survive the challenge?</span></div></div>",

You tried to keep a tight hold of the vine, but you were too slippery, and soon you were holding nothing but air. You screamed as you were in free fall. For the first time since this round started, Lila looked actually excited as her tiny mortal, morsel fell to her awaiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on Lila's tongue with a wet \"thwack.\" You had already been aching from Pearl's training regime, and exhausted from the mere act of trying to dislodge grapes, but now any feeble remnants of strength you had left were exhausted from your rough landing. You knew you should try to escape, if for no other reason than to let Pearl know you were at least trying to do your best, but you were just too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Pearl wouldn't be happy with the situation, you knew for a fact that Lila was. \"Mmmmmmmm,\" her voice rang around you, as she retracted her tongue into her mouth. Her mouth stank of grapes, and you were quickly tossed around inside her mouth as if you were nothing, and to literal gods, you clearly weren't. Lila's tongue smacked you around your mouth and she kept letting out moans of delight. You got the feeling that Lila was playing this up for the crowd. Every once and a while she would open her mouth and stick out her tongue, and in those few moments you could see your disheveled and battered form atop her tongue on the screens around the Coliseum. The other goddesses clearly thought your plight was hilarious. Each time afterwards, Lila would suck her tongue back in and work you around the inside of her mouth again, tasting you all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, you could hear the announcer say, \"While we appreciate the enthusiasm of our participants, we'd like to remind them that we are on a bit of a schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila didn't need any other prodding. With a casual flick of her tongue you went flying down her throat. You couldn't even muster the energy to scream. You landed in her stomach, grapes floating in gastric juices like buoys. Just like in Pearl's stomach, the acids burned but weren't killing you. You worked your way onto a grape, and laid there exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OooARRRRRRPPP!\" you heard Lila burp, signaling your total defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too tired to even care at this point, you just hoped Lila would let you out soon but as the minutes passed you knew that wouldn't be happening. After a while, grapes steadily began joining you in your captor's stomach, each one acting as a new life raft as your previous ones sank into the bubbling juices. It became quickly apparent that Lila wouldn't be releasing you until this challenge was completely over. Unfortunately, the stomach never rested. The grapes fell, threatening to crush you, and sending the ocean of gastric juices roiling like an ocean. You began counting the minutes as you were trapped. An hour eventually passed and not once did another human join you in Lila's stomach. After spending the entire time alternating between soaking in stomach acids and avoiding falling fruits the size of boulders lying on half-eaten pieces of fruit, you heard a last gunshot outside. You felt tremors as the stomach sloshed around you, completely submerging you beneath the waves. Lila was getting up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning you appeared back outside the gigantic sow, gasping and choking for air as you landed on the table. The other contestants were around you. Some looked at you with pity, others with disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's our newest champion, the poor little fella. Maybe he should've waited longer before playing in the big leagues. Better luck next time, champ!\" the announcer said. \"And with that, the first game is over. We'll give our contestants ten minutes before we start the next game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tremors as each goddess walked over to the table and retrieve their champion, some giggled as they did and you knew they were laughing at you. As Lila collected her mortal, she winked at you and blew you a kiss. \"Thanks for the snack, champ! I hope we can do this again some time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and said nothing. Pearl eventually retrieved you and none too gently. As you walked away she hissed, \"What the hell was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect?!\" you said, outraged. \"I've had a week's worth of training and no magical items to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better get your act together!\" she said. \"Do you know what your score was? A TWO! And Romulus got a 50 out of 50! He fed Lila every single grape in his bunch and he didn't even need to use his magic item!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry I can't be as perfect as Romulus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get your head in the game, little man. Otherwise there's going to be dire consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't bother arguing any more. She was clearly past reason. Eventually the goddesses gathered on stage, and the announcer called the next game, which was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Seat Sprint!\" the announcer called out. Once again, in the center of the arena, the ring opened up and the bowl of grapes, table and kline were all lowered back underground. The ring was still open though, and a minute later a huge couch came up instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to groan only to stop abruptly. You knew this game from training with Pearl. Why wouldn't you? Pearl was the one who came up with it. You remembered the rules as the announcer told them for the crowd. It was a simple game really. Champions were placed at one end of the couch, Pearl stood in the middle, and the champion only had a minute to sprint across the couch before Pearl sat down and squashed him. As you thought about it, you actually smirked. This was one of the only challenges that you didn't completely stink at! Granted it hadn't started out that way, the first few times you did this game, Pearl's colossal behind had fallen on top of you like a moon crashing into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your game!\" you'd snapped after the sixth squashing. \"Just change it for a new one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could, I would,\" Pearl said, at the end of her patience, \"but the paperwork's already been filled out and this is the game I came up with! I invented it because I thought it was the simplest challenge for whatever sacrifice I got! All you have to do is make it to the end! Just run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you'd run, each time getting a little bit better. Eventually you managed to reach the other end of the couch with some time to spare. It was the only few times Pearl had ever shown pride in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can do this!' you thought as Pearl carried you over to the couch. Sure you were still sore from the last challenge, but this one wouldn't be so bad. You could beat this one, no problem! You kept that cocky attitude until you both reached the couch. There was one problem. This couch was longer than the one you'd been practicing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pearl,\" you said nervously, \"this couch isn't the same size as the one at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Pearl said. \"I don't understand, I used my couch as a model. It should be the same size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you measure it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I measured it right! I did it three times to be sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing as you did in training. You beat this challenge. Or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as Pearl put you on one side of the couch and nervously stood in the center. You awkwardly knelt, ready to run. You had a clear view of the timer of one minute in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready! On your mark... get set... GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bang and you were off, sprinting as fast as you possibly could across the leather of the couch. Pearl's behind loomed over you like a mountain. You remembered the pressure and pain of feeling Pearl sit on you during training. That threat, along with the threat of everything else Pearl might do to you if you lost this competition, propelled you onward. As you ran you noticed that laughs were coming from the audience. You blushed as you realized this. 'No wonder,' you thought, 'I must look ridiculous! Like an ant trying to crawl as fast as it can!' You tried to push the embarrassment aside and put your full attention into running. Your body was not pleased, as all the battery it'd been subjected to earlier made every step painful. But through it all you just kept running. It seemed to be paying off. Even though the timer was counting down, you were halfway to the end. Maybe you'd finally be able to win a challenge?</span></div></div>",

The muscles in your leg locked up and with a yell you face planted onto the couch. You heard Pearl grown as she watched your performance on the TV. You took a moment to let out a muffled scream of rage and disbelief, before you got back to your feet and began hobbling the rest of the way. It hurt like hell, but you weren't going to just give up. Not with Pearl watching your performance at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh! Poor little guy seems to be having trouble,\" the announcer said, causing titters from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up with the color commentary,\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your dramatically reduced speed, you weren't making good time. You'd barely gotten further than the halfway point and now the clock was down to ten seconds. You tried to double your efforts but it made little difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5... 4... 3... 2... 1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bang signaling the end of the challenge. You stopped and gulped. You knew what was coming next. You had just enough time to look up as Pearl's titanic behind crashed down on top of you. Her dress had ridden up so that you were squashed beneath her bare cheeks. The pain was worse than training. Not only was your body already in immense pain, but the couch you were on wasn't as soft as the one at Pearl's home. You were completely immobile, trapped beneath the pressure of the tons and tons of weight of Pearl's blubber butt. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Pearl subtly began to grind her cheeks on top of you. Even underneath her you could hear her growl, \"Do you like that? Is this what you wanted? This. Is. What. You. Get,\" she said through gritted teeth, punctuating each word with a vicious twist of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the announcer asked for Pearl to stop so the next contestant could go. She got up, revealing that your flattened form was plastered on one of her cheeks. The jumbo screen zoomed in close on you, signaling roars of laughter from the crowd. Pearl didn't understand what they were laughing at, at first. When she turned around to retrieve you to see your miniscule form gone, she realized what happened and blushed in embarrassment. She tried to cover it up by laughing along as she pealed you off her rump. She watched as the sight of you two were replaced by your score on the screen: 25. Maybe the judges admired your effort? Maybe they pitied you? Either way, it was better than a 2. Pearl didn't seem to think so, as she plopped you on the arm rest of the couch with obvious contempt as the next goddess and her champion approached the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid on the armrest panting, unbelieving your lousy luck. The only good news for you was that you now had some time, no matter how short, to recover. Other champions did Pearl's challenge, and you took some comfort in seeing that this time, you weren't the only one who failed. Several other contestants vanished beneath her butt, unfortunately though, Romulus didn't. Neither did Lila's champion. You managed to recover quite a bit by the time the challenge was over, at least to the point you felt like you had a fighting chance on the next challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Even though you had more time to recover for the next challenges, your lack of training and magical items meant you were doomed from the start. Not to mention the first two challenges were the <i>easy</i> ones. The next few hours were a new level of hell as the games became more and more insidious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pearl's game, the next challenge was to run on a treadmill in front of a cheetah goddess. You ended up under her foot within the first minute and spent the rest of the challenge stuck to her paw like a wad of gum, flattened as she walked. The challenge after that had you run forced to walk a tightrope over the open mouth of a hippo goddess. The bad news was, you got two steps before falling. The good news was you avoided being eaten. The worse news was you landed in the goddess's cleavage and she took it as you intentionally being a pervert. She responded by smashing you between her breasts. The next game had you forced to run across the ring to \"home base\" while a blind bat goddess tried to detect your movements. You almost made it to the end of this course when the bat goddess came soaring out of the sky and landed on you, ass first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more games came and went. None of them went well for you. Finally you and Pearl were waiting for the final challenge to begin. She wasn't even looking at you, but you could feel her burning hatred coming off her. No matter how well you did in the final challenge, you were dead and you knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ladies,\" the announcer said, \"the Goddess Games are almost at an end. It's been a fun year and we'd like to thank all the goddesses and their champions for attending. Give them a round of applause folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered and clapped. Pearl gave a half-hearted wave with the rest of the goddesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, it's time to start our final challenge. As tradition, the final game is brought to us by the winner of the previous Goddess Games. In this case, she also won the past three games. Please welcome the goddess of the sky, Dracana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Pearl growl as the dragon goddess stepped forward, basking in the adulation of the crowd. Fantastic. Not only were you going to lose, but you were going to be humiliated by your owner's nemesis too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat game did Dracana come up with?</span></div></div>",

Did the announcer say, \"Bite the Goddess\"?\" you asked, hoping you'd misheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight the Goddess,\" Pearl growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what you were afraid of. The ring in the center of the arena opened again, swapping out the stage from the last game for a familiar sight: a boxing ring. You gulped. The fat dragoness went over the ropes and raised her fists, basking in the cheers of the crowd. She placed her human champion at one corner of the ring before walking off to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game is exactly what it sounds like,\" the announcer said cheerfully. \"Each champion will go one round in a fight with the goddess of the sky. The fight ends after 10 minutes, or when one of the fighter's is knocked out.\" There was a roar of laughter from the crowd at that. Even the announcer said \"knocked out\" jokingly. Clearly no human stood a chance against that behemoth in a fight. Your only consolation was that you weren't going to be the only loser in this challenge. Every goddess and champion looked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each champion will be judged on his performance in the fight. At the sound of the bell, begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your utter amazement, Romulus approached his goddess without fear. You knew the rules, she couldn't take it easy on him otherwise she'd be disqualified. You almost admired how he was going to his doom like a champ, but mostly you just wanted to see the brute turned to a pancake. That was when bolts of lightning came from his fists and thunder boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a magical artifact you idiot,\" Pearl snapped. \"Remember? Each champion is allowed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she said it, you did remember it. During all the time Romulus had been fighting, he hadn't needed his artifact once to win. You just assumed he was that cocky, but now you realized he'd been saving it to make the last challenge a spectacle. The camera shot a close-up of his artifact. He was wearing a pair of glowing, metal boxing gloves. Sparks shot out from the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be... it is! The mythical Maelstrom Gloves! An artifact thought lost to time! Legend has it that with their power, even a human can defeat a god! Where Dracana found them, this announcer has no idea, but now we know why the sky goddess picked this particular challenge! If nothing else we'll get to see if the legends are true about the gloves power! This is proving to be the most memorable Goddess Games in centuries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus broke out in a run. He smashed his gloves together causing sparks. Arcs of lightning shot out as he banged them together, growing larger each time. Dracana spun around and lashed her tail down right where Romulus stood. The stone cracked beneath it, but Romulus wasn't there anymore. He'd moved in the blink of an eye and was now behind her. The dragon turned and stomped at him. Gone again. Only this time he was right in front of her foot. He pulled back his fist and punched her big toe. There was a spark on contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana yelped, grabbed her foot and hopped backwards. It looked like she'd been bitten by a flea. She stumbled but stopped herself from falling. The crowd went silent. They were more figuratively shocked than Dracana was literally. You realized they'd probably never seen goddess hurt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should see it more often,\" you muttered. \"Would do them good to experience pain firsthand. Maybe make them empathize a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus charged his goddess again. Dracana had recovered and spread her massive wings. The wings started flapping, sending huge gusts of wind. The wind should've ripped Romulus off the ground and sent him flying but he brought his fists down into the stone, breaking it and creating handholds for himself. He gritted his teeth and hung on for dear life. His lower half was flapping like a flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana stopped and Romulus fell on his stomach. The dragon didn't hesitate. She opened her mouth and sent a jet of fire right where her champion was. You were astounded. She really wasn't holding back. You were even more astounded when Romulus managed to jump over the flame and towards the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped. The jump could've easily taken him over a mountain. He flew towards Dracana's face with one fist forward, lightning shooting out. You were sure he was going to deck her right in the face, but Dracana's snake-like neck cracked like a whip. Her head was no longer where it had been and Romulus couldn't change direction. Dracana's jaws clamped shut down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was silent. Then they gasped. You'd thought the fight was over but the camera zoomed in on Dracana's mouth. She was trying to keep her jaw clenched and was failing. Gradually her teeth opened and everyone got a view of Romulus inside, prying her teeth apart. His muscles strained as he fought to keep her mouth open. With one hand, Romulus kept her mouth open. With the other, he aimed down her throat, lightning getting ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's gonna do it,\"</i> you thought. <i>\"He's really going to defeat a god in--\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of Dracana's throat glowed orange and a second jet of flame washed over Romulus. The human shot out of her mouth like a cannonball. He soared through the air, trailing smoke, over the ropes, out of the ring, and right down on the ground where he lay still, alive but unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Then the crowd went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DRACANA! DRACANA! DRACANA! DRACANA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky goddess blew kisses to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, ladies!\" the announcer was screaming. \"Simply unbelievable! Romulus lasted three minutes! Three minutes more than this announcer thought possible. Let's give him a big hand folks for that beautiful display!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped as human medics came over to tend to Romulus. One of his gloves was missing but he'd regained consciousness long enough to give a thumbs up before falling unconscious again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you whined. \"Why didn't I get medics after challenges when I got hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl ignored you. Maybe that was for the best with how mad she looked. You kept your mouth closed and decided to watch the rest of the fights. They didn't last long. Aside from Romulus, no champion lasted more than a minute against Dracana. No sooner had the bell rung then one would find themselves stuck under her foot, smacked out of the ring with her tail, or unconscious in a smoking crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were in the ring, the mountain of a dragon in the opposite corner, flashing her pearly-white fangs at you in anticipation. You gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the fight'll be over quick,\" you said under your breath. The pain in the ring would be brief. You were more afraid of the hell Pearl would rain down upon you when you got home. Maybe you spoke too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and Dracana, instead of running over to you or letting out a gout of flame, she just strolled leisurely towards you. You swallowed. She hadn't done that for any other champion. You were shivering like a drowned cat as Dracana knelt down in front of you. Her house-sized head was inches from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I finally get the little guppy's champion all to myself,\" Dracana whispered. \"I've been waiting a long time for this. That fat fish of a mistress of yours has no place in this pantheon. She couldn't cut it when we were kids and she can't do it now. She couldn't even find a halfway decent champion for herself. She's a disgrace and so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... you couldn't argue there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're wondering why I haven't destroyed you yet? Don't worry, I'll answer. It's because I want to make a deal with you. This doesn't have to be painful for you. You've suffered more than enough today, so how does it sound if I don't hurt you at all? Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded very good to you. Not that you trusted her, obviously. \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The \"catch\" is that I want you to tell the audience all about what a loser Pearl is. I want you to renounce her as your goddess and spend the next ten minutes worshipping me instead. You'll grovel and plead and beg to do anything for me. I'll give you orders and you'll do it without hesitation. You'll show everyone here just how a true goddess deserves to be treated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Pearl ever tell you that the winner of the goddess games gets one request from a goddess that can't be refused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. That hadn't been established at all! It was like someone was making up the rules as they went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's usually just a small thing,\" Dracana said. \"A symbolic favor to show good sportsmanship. I haven't asked for much in the past... But this year I believe when I win I might ask a certain ocean goddess to hand over a certain champion of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered with a smile. \"I might ask that... if you don't do as I say. Then the next ten minutes will be absolute agony for you. A prelude for the suffering you'll endure in my care for the rest of eternity. You will experience more pain than you can possibly imagine. Whatever you're afraid Pearl can do to you, I promise I can do worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a nightmare. How did you ever get roped into this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Dracana asked. \"What do you say? I'll give you ten seconds to answer, otherwise I'll start the torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought furiously, trying to make up your mind. Dracana glared at you impatiently. The seconds were ticking away. It wasn't long now before she took your silence as a refusal. A light bulb went off over your head. Wait a minute... Pearl had never told you this rule. What if Dracana was lying? What if she was just manipulating you to embarrass both you and Pearl in front of all the goddesses? For all you knew, the dragoness could've been full of it. On the other hand, you knew for a fact if you just gave up without a fight Pearl would make you suffer for it. The choice was between guaranteed suffering at Pearl's hands or possible suffering at Dracana's. You decided to role the dice and take your chances on the safer better... comparatively safer at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up,\" Dracana said. \"Will you worship me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath. \"NOT ON YOUR LIFE YOU STUPID LIZARD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice echoed through the stands. How, you weren't sure. Maybe there was some hidden, magic microphone. Either way the crowd gasped in shock. Dracana's eyes narrowed and she let out a hiss. Even the announcer sounded surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... give the little guy one thing, he certainly has spirit! But how will Dracana respond--HOLY CRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness moved like lightning. One second and she was on her feet, one foot raised above you casting you in shadow. You whimpered, \"Mother--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! The foot came crashing down, smashing you into the stone and flattening you like a bug. You couldn't move under the crushing weight of it. You'd no sooner registered the unbelievable pain than Dracana lifted her foot off of you. She didn't move it, however, she just kept it hovering over your twitching form. You knew what would happen next and tried to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for mercy, bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! The foot came down a second time, so hard that the stone cracked and formed into a crater the exact size and shape of her foot. Then she raised it again. BAM! Raised. BAM! Raised. BAM! BAM! BAM! With each stomp of her foot the crater grew deeper and deeper. Only the divine magic that made you and all champions invulnerable stopped you from popping like a grape. It didn't stop the pain though. That was excruciating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana lifted the weight off of her ankle and pressed her toes down on you. She grinned as she ground you into the ground like a cigarette bug. Back and forth you were dragged across the ground. Her foot stank of sweat and was covered in dirt, but they weren't of any concern to you. Not with the amount of pain you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, Dracana lifted her foot off you and didn't put it back. You were in too much agony to move. Too much to speak. You wondered if it was still too late to take Dracana up on her offer. Not that you had the strength to voice that offer even if it was possible. Dracana bent down and peeled you off the ground with her claws like a wad of chewed gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pass out on me now, bug. We're just getting started. I've still got eight minutes left to make you suffer. A taste of the eternity of torment that awaits you when I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eternity of torment?\" you thought and shuddered as a sinking feeling spread through your stomach. Did that mean she was telling the truth earlier? That she could take you from Pearl as her prize? It figured. You'd gambled and lost. Just like every other gamble you'd taken in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana dropped you in the middle of the ring, letting your broken form fall from her fingers. You screamed as you fell. It was like being thrown off a mountain. You smashed into the ground and groaned. Your vision was blurry but the ground was shaking. Dracana turned around, her back to you, and got down on her knees. You were confused for a second, but when she lifted up the back of her toga to reveal a massive, scaly ass, you knew exactly what you were in store for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored you, lifted her ass high in the air, then dropped it on top of you. If you thought being under her foot was bad, that was nothing compared to the feeling of the sky goddess's colossal behind landing on top of you. It was like being crushed beneath a planet that needed to go on a diet. Dracana wiggled her behind, driving you further into the ground. A few seconds later she got up, and your pulverized form got up with her, stuck like a pancake to one of her ass cheeks. The camera zoomed in on you and you could hear the goddesses roaring in laughter at the sight of you. Dracana pretended to look for you, turning around to look at the spot where you used to be and then comically shrugging her shoulders when you were nowhere to be found. Then she smacked her forehead as if an obvious idea was coming to her, and she looked over her shoulder to find you on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana proudly wriggled her butt at the camera, taking a few seconds to show you off and bask in the glory of the crowd, before resuming your torture. She jumped into the air, moved her legs out from under her, and fell ass-first back to the ground. BOOM! The earth shook from the impact. You would've cried but even your tear ducts were in pain at this point. You'd no sooner registered the pain than she got up again and--BOOM! Another jump, another crushing weight, more pain beneath her cheeks. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her final jump, Dracana got to her feet, unveiled her wings and flapped high into the air, higher, higher, higher. And then she positioned her ass and let gravity do the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more. No more. No more. If you could talk, you'd gladly offer to worship Dracana until the end of time if it would spare you another second of this agony. Instead, you were stuck to her ass cheek, tiny body broken beneath her booty. With one last wiggle, Dracana got up and peeled you off her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only three minutes left,\" Dracana said. \"So sad our time together is almost up. Luckily, it'll only be over for a few minutes. Then you'll come back to me again and I'll show you this wasn't even a fraction of what I'm capable of. But first, I'm feeling a bit peckish. Winning the Goddess Games sure does work up an appetite. I think I've deserved a <i>small</i> snack.\" Dracana flashed her razor-sharp fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were convinced. This dragon wasn't a goddess. She was a devil. And she was going to take you to hell. Dracana raised you above her head and opened her salivating maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well folks,\" the announcer said, \"it looks like Dracana's getting ready to deliver a KO. It would take a miracle for the little guy to get out of this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pitiful sobbing only made Dracana laugh. She let go and you plummeted down. Past the teeth, over the gums. The dragon's jaw clamped shut behind you, casting you in warm, wet darkness. Her tongue coiled around your miniscule form as soon as you were inside. You were licked and slurped without mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, tashty,\" Dracana mumbled as she sucked on you, savoring her treat. You, meanwhile, were having much less fun. The dragon's saliva soaked you to the bone, and her breath was so foul it made you retch. It smelled like rotten eggs inside. Probably a result of the sulfur from her fire breath. It was also sweltering inside like an oven. Your only hope was that she wouldn't cook you before she swallowed. You may have spoken too soon. A gurgling sound came from the back of her throat and you were convinced you were about to be roasted alive. Instead of fire, however, what washed over you was another wave of foul-smelling air as she burped into her closed mouth. The rancid air burned, stinging your eyes and nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, pardon me,\" Dracana said mockingly. \"Ope oo don min da shmell. Oo'll be headed der shoon enuff,\" she slurped. You wish she'd just swallow and get it over with. But she couldn't pass up the opportunity to make you suffer as much as possible. She continued to suck on you, moving you all around her mouth, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unch time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved you to the back of her throat and you almost felt relief to know your pain would finally be over. For a little while at least. You couldn't believe this dragon would be your new owner for the rest of eternity. Why'd you have to turn down her offer? Hell, why did she have to be so good at these games in the first place? If only there was a way you could beat her. A human taking down a goddess. If that didn't stop her from winning you didn't know what would. But it was pointless to think about that now. There was no way for it to happen. There was no hope for you at all. No--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glint of silver caught your eye and you saw it. One of the Maelstrom Gloves. The one Romulus had lost! It was stuck in-between two of Dracana's fangs and she didn't even know it! It was within reach. You still had a chance! Despite the pain wracking your body, you began fighting furiously against the tongue trying to drag you to your doom. You fought harder than you've ever fought for anything in your life to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer schquirmin's nicesh. Keep it uhp, en my tummeh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Dracana's taunt and struggled on. The tongue was getting looser. The glove was getting closer. Can you break free and grab it? Can you win? Or will you be consigned to the depths of the dragon's stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) You get free, grab the glove and use it to defeat Dracana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You remain stuck, miss the glove and Dracana swallows you</span></div></div>",

Your fingers even tap against the metal surface, but you can't get a good grip. Dracana's slurred laughter echoes around you as she enjoys your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almosht dum, hoomin! Gumma shwallow inna foo shecomds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was it. You'd be devoured alive, then suffer endless torment at the claws of this sadistic; childish she-dragon, just because you lost some stupid game. Why was the universe so cruel--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana suddenly slaps her tongue to the side and slams you against her fangs. The impact knocks you senseless--<br>\r\n<i>And brings the Maelstrom Glove into reach.</i> You let out a laugh and grab the artifact just as the tongue recenters and the world begins to tilt back--Dracana was going to swallow you! The glove slips on your hand, and you look down to see the dragon's throat open to accept you. Lightning begins sparking from the glove as you rear your arm back to punch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell, why not throw out a one-liner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch what you eat, BITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana held up three clawed fingers, beginning her countdown. The audience cheered, awaiting her finisher of the imcompitent human she'd been playing with. \"THREE!\" They chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it seems this match has come to an end,\" the announcer quipped. \"Hopefully the ending won't be a bitter pill to swallow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana lowered one claw. \"TWO!\"<br>\r\nPearl fumed, shaking with rage. Having her slave be so humiliatingly bad was embarrassing enough, but now Dracana had to make such a spectacle out of it? Bitch. The whale goddess made a mental note to \"visit\" that village the dumped him on her for this. It had been too long since she got to eat some humans, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana lowered another claw...then froze, her smug expression falling. She gagged, then winced, then <i>flinched in pain</i>; her hands covering her mouth. The audience stopped cheering, wondering what the twist was.<br>\r\n Then lightning started coming out of her jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana growled, \"What the fuc--\"<br>\r\n And then an EXPLOSION of lightning forced her jaws open, ejecting her would-be snack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Romulus, you go flying like a cannonball, screaming all the way until you hit the floor and go tumbling ass-over-teakettle across the ring; small lighting bolts shooting out of your single glove. You'd punched the tongue multiple times, just flailing randomly until you'd been sent flying. Your head hurt and you were sure you'd sprained something in the impact, but you still looked up to see Dracana choking on lightning; twitching and flailing as she was electrocuted from within. You must have done a number on her mouth, the saliva conducting the lighting throughout her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana gives one final roar of pain...and an explosion of lightning erupts from her mouth, making everyone's hair stand on end. Then, with an earthshaking impact, she collapses to the floor; her eyes spinning in cartoonish circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weakly taps her hand on the ground--a tap-out.<br>\r\nShe'd given up.<br>\r\n<i><b>YOU WON!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd goes wild. Everyone who was cheering your torment is now roaring \"DOWN WITH DRACANA! DOWN WITH DRACANA!\". The other goddesses are stunned, some even clapping for you or jeering at Dracana. Turns out she isn't too popular after all. You stagger to your feet and raise your gloved fist into the air, exultant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAIL TO THE KING, BABY!\" You whoop. Cliche, but who cares? You just kicked a goddess' ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl waddles up and snatches you off the ground, grinning like a loon. She gives you a flurry of smothering kisses and laughs.<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it! You actually did it! I...I take back EVERY threat I made, ALL the nasty things I did; EVERYTHING! Oh, you are getting a YEAR off chores for this! In fact, you don't even have to call me 'Mistress' anymore! Just...'Miss Pearl' will do, and...EEEEEEE!\" She squees and cuddles you against her cheek, elated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she wasn't so bad after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracana begins to stir, coughing smoke and shaking her head. She sees Pearl cuddling you, and looks at your pilfered weapon. <br>\r\n\"Urgh...I wondered where that glove went..didn't see that coming.\" She gets up, then blinks when she notices everyone ISN'T cheering her name. \"Wait...did I just LOSE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl stops her gushing, and you tense up. How would Dracana react to your last-minute victory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was one thing for this enormous whale as big as several mountains took you as a sacrifice but you weren't even for her. You were a present for her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a cough. \"Wait, wife?\" Pearl gave a snort. \"Is that a problem? Life can come in all shapes and sizes. It is as natural as the love among you mortals. You see, my wife is fascinated by humans and has never seen one up close before. She considers them to be the most adorable creatures in existence. Several of her friends have boasted about their humans and she's been depressed at the fact that she doesn't have one of her own.\" Pearl gives a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl was talking as if she was merely buying a pet for her wife as a birthday present, but instead, she had to intimidate a community in order to get you. You don't know how this Diamond treats humans. Wait, didn't Pearl say she had never seen a human before. Oh no. What if she didn't know how to treat humans properly and crushed you. Then you realize something; you had absolutely no idea <i>what</i> Diamond was. You heard that these titans didn't always settle down with creatures of their own race. You even heard of a titan couple consisting of a male fox and female rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you do not want to find out what you're getting yourself into and try to jump out of Pearl's hand but Pearl catches you in her other hand. \"I thought I made it clear that I didn't want you to so much as think about escaping. I'll forgive you since I need you for Diamond's birthday present. But if you misbehave before I have a chance to give you to my wife, I'll have no choice but to swallow you and demand another sacrifice. Your face turns pale white at the thought of literally being swallowed by a whale and you nod your head. \"I'll be good. I'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to, Pearl?\" asks a voice. It was there another giantess stomped in, a blast of cold air in her wake. She appeared to a titanic obese light brown-skinned anthropomorphic manatee with her hair worn in a beehive. She wore a one piece blue bikini with stars printed on it and a golden tiara. Pearl smiled and then turned around. \"Happy birthday, Diamond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond looks down at you and squees, her eyes going wide with glee. \"Oh, Pearl, he's sooooo cute! Thank you!\" The manatee picks you up and gives you a big kiss that's cold to the touch, her frigid lips covering you from head to toe and painting you red with her lipstick. Was she a goddess of winter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a nervous smile as Diamond keeps grinning down at you. \"Well,\" you say. \"She seems friendly enough.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jupiter is the biggest planet in the known solar system and also holds the record as the planet with the most moons at a whopping record of 63 confirmed moons. However, scientists believe that there are still some moons that have yet to be discovered. This might very well be the case, because a new moon was recently discovered orbiting around Jupiter but this moon was unusual looking in that it looked like it actually had plants and life on it. That was where you come in. You were an astronaut dispatched to look into this new and currently unnamed moon. As you sit in the cockpit of your rocket, you see the moon up ahead surrounded by several clouds that almost looked like smoky quartz. \u201cGive me a break,\u201d you say. \u201cThere is absolutely no way there\u2019s life on this moon. Heck, it\u2019s a moon for crying out loud. Moons can\u2019t support life. Those big wigs must\u2019ve just seen the clouds and thought they were trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you get closer and closer to the 64th moon, you see strange trees with multi-colored striped trunks and star shaped leaves as well as pink and yellow covered dirt that almost looked like those on Earth. \u201cWhat!?\u201d you yell. You land your spaceship on the ground and you see that the trees are thousands of feet tall and in the distance there even seems to be a lake. You\u2019re dumbfounded and absentmindedly take off your helmet as you look out. \u201cNo way,\u201d you say. \u201cThis can\u2019t be a moon. More than likely it\u2019s an unknown dwarf planet. Leave it to a witless bureaucracy to deem anything smaller than a planet a moon.\u201d It was there that you realized that you took your helmet off and then you gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d you yell. \u201cOh no!\u201d After coughing a few times however, to your surprise, you don\u2019t feel any different and you simply blink. \u201cThe air\u2019s not toxic?\u201d you ask. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. You inhale and exhale a few times before you go on your merry way through the planet. It looks like some sort of jungle, yet you see no forms of life. \u201cMaybe this is one of those planets that only have plants.\u201d Suddenly you hear a yelling sound and a crashing sound. You hear several curses and then run back and see that your spaceship has been heavily damaged and you gasp. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Upon further inspection, you see that the spaceship was left in an enormous crater that almost looked like the footprint of a large feline. You give a gulp. \u201cOn second thought...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you complete your sentence, you hear a stomping sound and you feel someone or something staring down at you. You then look up to see that looking down on you was a bright reddish brass-furred anthropomorphic lioness with bright blonde hair with red highlights in it and glowing golden eyes. The lion giantess was exactly 800ft tall and was rather obese looking, especially in her belly and rump. She was also wearing a bright greenish bronze spandex leotard along with a crown of some kind and earrings shaped like alien skulls. There was a large sword in her belt and she was holding her foot in pain. You stare in fear as the lioness growls and glares down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d says the lioness in a surprisingly light-sounding voice. \u201cYou are the invader that my people told me about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic and shake your hands. \u201cWait, wait, Ms. Lion, please! I\u2019m not an invader! I was just sent to investigate this moon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness roars angrily. \u201cHow dare you call our planet a moon! I\u2019ll have you know that this is a planet ruled over by amazon lionesses, and <i>I</i> happen to be their queen. We\u2019ve been watching your planet from a distance and we don\u2019t like what we see. Clearly your species are psychotic apes that were looking for a new planet to wreak havoc on.

Hmph; for all you humans\u2019 hubris and ignorance, I never pegged you for cowards. You target our world for invasion, but can\u2019t even keep your dignity when captured? How amusing.\u201d She moves you closer to her mouth, each word giving you a blast of her fruit-scented breath. \u201cFor your sake, I hope you\u2019re a better servant than you are a warrior. We Felines are more civilized than you humans could ever <i>hope</i> to be, but we haven\u2019t left our predatory ways <i>completely</i> behind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her maw to reveal a mouthful of glistening white fangs as big as your whole body. A feline tongue, big as a tank and rough like sandpaper, snakes out to give your face an abrasive lick.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...a bit bland.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response is to scream like a little girl and cringe away, fear shoving aside any thoughts of dignity. \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at your terror, the fat feline monarch stomps through the forest with your tiny form clenched in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m gonna be sick\u2026</i> was your only thought not long into the lion queen\u2019s walk. Between her arms swinging with each step and your vision tumbling and swaying like a ship in a storm, you\u2019d been left dizzy and rattled; on the verge of motion-sickness. Low-hanging plants smacking you in the face all the way didn't help either, the lioness walking near them on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing keeping you from vomiting on the giant lioness\u2019 hand was the fear of what sort of terrible things do to you for getting her hand dirty. All you could do was look at the ground below, trying to get your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Morning, Lina!\u201d a new voice rings out, startling you. The queen, now named Lina, even stops walking. \u201cHow do you find the Royal Gardens, Big Sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Lina smiling at the newcomer. \u201cThey were as beautiful as always, Alicia...though I also captured a scout for an upcoming invasion.\u201d Lina brings her hand up, giving you a fresh bout of nausea, and opens her palm to reveal you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see another giant lioness, gazing down at you curiously. Alicia was covered in pitch black fur with silvery hair and green eyes, wearing what could only be called a metal white bikini top and belt with a red loincloth at her waist; a small pistol holstered at her hip. She was shorter than her queen, and a bit less fat. Still pudgy, but not nearly as bulbous as Lina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An invader...hmm, it seems you were right about the humans, my Queen. Are you planning on eating this one? And shall I summon the generals to prepare for war?\u201d You cringe at that, making both lioness sisters giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet at least. I plan on making him my own personal servant as punishment for his part in the invasion.\u201d Lina smirks evilly at you. \u201cAnd with their scout captured, we can use him as an example to get the humans to back down. We are the more noble race, we must show that we are merciful and do not go to war on a whim....well, to a point. As for eating him, that\u2019s only if he disobeys his new Mistress.\u201d She looms over you and slaps her belly with her free hand, making it jiggle. \u201cOr if I feel like it. Whatever comes first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia smiles, throwing an arm around Lina. The two sisters were obviously close. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get back to the palace so you can enjoy your new little servant. I\u2019ve already sent for the rocket-car to pick you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. <i>Wait\u2026.rocket car?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the forest, now revealed to be Queen Lina\u2019s private retreat, the rocket-car awaited. The thing looked like an old 50s hot-rod mixed with a flying saucer, complete with big domes over the cockpit and passenger seats, and fins on the tail. The handful of guards surrounding the thing--all giant felines, mostly lions with a few leopards and panthers--wore grey spandex bodysuits with what looked like SWAT armor on their chests, elbows and knees. They carried rounded, stubby rifles that looked like scaled-up versions of cheap toy \u201claser guns\u201d, and had small swords sheathed at their waists. There were a few male cats among them, but the officers, identified by their shoulder pads and long, sparkling capes, were all female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked like something right out of a bad movie, or vintage comic book. Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon would be right at home here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leopardess guard saluted as Lina and Alicia approached. <i>\u201dHail the Queen! Glory to her mane!\u201d</i> Her comrades echoed her, one of them popping open a rear dome on the rocket car for his queen and her sister to enter, another climbing into the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina entered first, glancing at you as she began to sit down. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of holding you, human. Something else for the ride back to my palace...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to cry out, but your pleas go unanswered as the giant Space Amazon Lioness casually lands her plump ass on you, squishing you into the seat.

Do you see the folly of your invasion now, human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom under Lina's all-encompassing booty, you hear Alicia giggle as she enters the rocket-car, sitting next to her sister. \u201c<i>Sitting on him?</i> That seems a bit\u2026childish, sister. Perverse, even!\u201d she teases, seeming to enjoy your plight as much as Lina was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina wiggles her rear again. \u201cWell, since a servant\u2019s status <i>is</i> beneath that of a Queen, I thought it would be quite poetic if he learned his place in a\u2026literal sense,\u201d she quipped. \u201cBesides, didn't YOU enjoy doing this to shrunken assassins back when Mother held the throne?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was before one of them splattered all over my favorite dress!

You are beyond afraid and you hastily slide down the table leg and then run into the hallway. \u201cI can\u2019t be late!\u201d you yell to yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s almost night time. Janine specifically told me to wake her up as soon as the night falls. You rush through the hallways as you bite your nails. In a world where humans lived in fear of gigantic beasts that ruled supreme, you had the misfortune of being captured and forced to serve one of these very gigantic beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour supreme ruler was named Janine and she was a 675ft tall vampire bat. You encountered her when she invaded your village in order to quell her monstrous hunger. You only survived because she was too full to eat you and instead took you back to her citadel. You had to beg her not to devour you or drain you dry and the bat giantess allowed you to live only as long as you served her. In all the time you served her, you had realized you had become a vampire\u2019s servant like out of a horror movie. Your jobs involved maintenance of the citadel and finding food for the vampire bat lady. Janine had put on a lot of weight from her insatiable appetite that only got larger as time went on. You were beginning to fear for your life that she\u2019d eat you on the spot just out of sheer hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the end of the hallway and you walk underneath the door that leads to your mistress\u2019s chamber. But as you\u2019re almost in Janine\u2019s room, you realize that the sun hadn\u2019t gone down yet and if you woke Janine up too soon, she\u2019d be furious. Vampire bats were not hurt by the sunlight but they still hated it as much as actual vampires. Last time you woke Janine up too early, she left you in her armpit 5 hours straight. Then again, you remember that Janine also doesn\u2019t like to be woken up too late. The last time you woke her up three minute late, she sat her huge butt on top of you for seven hours straight. The fact was that she a stickler for details, which made it extremely difficult to avoid her wrath. You wait for two minutes and then you realize that you\u2019ve waited enough and then walk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a regal looking chamber with candles and bright red curtains in the walls. You look and see your mistress snoring away as she hung upside-down. Janine was a rather large vampire bat with tan yellowish fur all over her body and long pink haired that looked like it was stained with blood (how it stayed seated when she was upside down, you had no idea). She also had a blue tattoo of a bat\u2019s head under her left eye and blue membranes attached to her wings. She wore a bright red regal looking vest with gold highlight and tight blue spandex pants. She was also enormous, due to her constant feeding frenzies. Janine was in fact, so large that you were surprised that she could still fly. However, your job was not to point out her weight, but to wake her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb the ladder in the wall towards the ceiling and climb your way up towards where your mistress is snoozing away. First you climb down Janine\u2019s large sausage-like toes and then you climb down her large hips, down her big belly that was contained somehow by her massive winged arms and then you climb down her several chins before maneuvering up to one of her ears. You really hope that your timing was good. If you didn\u2019t wake the vampire bat giantess up at exactly the right time, you were in big trouble. You then clear your throat before you make your way up to the bat woman\u2019s ear. \u201cWake up!\u201d you yell. Then your blood freezes because one of Janine\u2019s green eyes just springs open wide and then rolls in your direction, leading you to fear for your own safety.</span></div></div>",

You had come into the woods to do some hunting, but not just any hunting. You were in for some really BIG game. There had been an infestation of wild boars lately and they were doing a lot of damage to the country side. The boar problem became so bad that the king placed a large bounty on wild boars in order to get the population under control. The bigger the boar, the bigger the bounty. However, the king himself stated that he sometimes thought that it was actually the work of one particularly large and destructive boar rather than a whole herd of boars causing chaos. Of course, that didn\u2019t matter to you, because you came to hunt boars and get paid. \u201cThose little piggies,\u201d you say to yourself. \u201cAre in big trouble now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself as you walk into the woods and twirl your rifle. You knew that there were boars to be hunted and you pull out a whistle that makes a pig\u2019s sound, hoping to use it as bait. However, for some reason, the boars don\u2019t come running. This causes you to let out a sigh. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be doing things the hard way.\u201d You walk further into the forest and hold your rifle out in case you see any boars. What you do see is a large bounty of truffles and other crops. The sight of the crops makes you wonder why the boars have to leave the forest to steal food from the village. It seemed like there was enough food here for an army of boars. Speaking of which, you rub your chin and you don\u2019t seem to find any sign of a boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d you say. \u201cPeople said that there was an infestation of wild boars. But I haven\u2019t seen even one.\u201d You walk further into the forest and still see no boars. You were beginning to think that the damage might have actually been done by a bear or by rats. Then again, as far as you knew, there weren\u2019t any boars in the forest to begin with before these strange attacks. As you continue to walk on, you don\u2019t know it, but you pass by a rather strange purple truffle that was as big as a tree stump and from the looks of it, it had a few bites taken out of it. But what you do come across startles you. There is a rather large foot print, as big as a carriage and from the looks of it, it was made by a boar. You give a whistle and then you crack a smile. \u201cThat print must belong to a giant of a boar. I\u2019m going to be rich.\u201d With that, you rush off with your rifle, determined to catch this mysterious boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep on running, you see a shadow of a rather strange creature and realize that you must be on the right track. You see a shadowed out image of a boar\u2019s head and smile. \u201cGotcha.\u201d You hold out your rifle and fire, expecting to fell the boar. However, the bullet just bounces off of the boar and causes it to squeal. \u201cWhat the?\u201d you ask. You then hear snarling and the boar turns around and rises to its full height. iIt was there that you look up in surprise because this was no ordinary boar you had shot. This wild boar was 650ft tall and was actually an anthropomorphic wild boar woman. She had bright purple skin with long white hair and sharp yellow teeth with four large tusks. She wore nothing but a chainmail bikini and a red leather jacket as well as a pair of tinted pink sunglasses as she looks down on you and snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou interrupted my meal, human.\u201d You continue to look up at this enormous boar lady in surprise. \u201cA talking boar?\u201d you ask. \u201cYou must be worth millions.\u201d The boar woman notices your rifle and the fat creature gives a snorting laugh. \u201cFlattery will get you nowhere and that silly toy doesn\u2019t scare me at all.\u201d You give a smirk. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got news for you, piggy. The king is paying a bounty for the wild boar that are ravaging the countryside.\u201d The boar lady scoffs. \u201cWild boar. Singular. I\u2019m the only boar in this entire forest.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d you say. \u201cMore bounty for me.\u201d You fire again, but the bullet bounces harmlessly off the boar lady\u2019s skin. You try to shoot again, but you\u2019re out of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The giant pig lady reaches down and grabs your rifle before tossing it into her mouth and eating it, to your surprise. \u201cWell,\u201d snorted the boar lady. \u201cIt appears the predator has become the prey. But I\u2019m a reasonable porcine. I\u2019ll give you a chance to make up for it. You become my servant and I won\u2019t eat you.\u201d The boar woman gives another laugh as she looks down at you.</span></div></div>",

So what's it going to be, hunter? I'm the predator now. Will you serve me or serve my stomach.\" You're terrified but then you try to apply some bravado in an attempt to intimidate the enormous pig lady. \"Oh yeah! How do I know that you're not bluffing.\" The boar woman smiles and shows you her sharp and yellow teeth and then extends her tongue. You see that her back teeth are littered with what look like broken human skulls. You then look up in fear as the boar woman picks her teeth with her chubby claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" says the boar as her stumble gurgles. \"Listen. You humans don't exactly agree with me and I wouldn't have to munch on so many human hunters if they would leave me alone. Now, if you insist on antagonizing me, I'll repeat myself. Either become my servant or just step into my mouth now.\" The boar giantess extends her tongue and then the giantess breathes her putrid mushroom breath on you and you shiver. Somehow that bounty on wild boars isn't worth the trouble you assumed it would be and you begin to sweat. You really didn't want to become the servant to such an enormous pig. But you also didn't want to end up in a giant pig's stomach and you let out a groan. \"I submit.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar smirks and then reveals a gourd at the side of her bikini bottom and then drops you inside before putting a cork in the gourd and then stomping away. \"You're making a wise decision. That actually benefits the both of us.\" You could not believe it. You came here to collect a bounty on the wild boars that have been terrorizing the countryside and now an abnormally large wild sow had collected you. \"This is humiliating.\" You groan. The boar scoffs. \"It beats being digested.\" \"How did you get so big in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig giantess gave a grunt and then paused to bend over and eat a patch of mushrooms as big as tree stumps. \"You might have noticed that there are some rather unusual mushrooms around these parts. I don't know where they come. Some people think that some wizard or witch put a curse on them, some think that it was some kind of strange potion or pollutant that mixed in with the soil or maybe they're just an undiscovered species. Who knows?\" The boar then walks underneath a waterfall and crouches down as the water comes down and you hold your ears as it rushes. \"Long story short,\" says the big pig lady. \"The mushrooms are toxic to humans but they make animals super huge and able to speak.\" The boar then walks out from under the waterfall and whistles as she goes on her merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours pass and the boar takes the gourd out of her belt and then she shakes it to dump you into her hand.

Alejandra gives a snort. \"What was that, human?\" she asks, sounding almost offended and almost flattered at your choice of words. You give a nervous laugh. \"Nothing, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see that Alejandra's hooves appear to be made of solid gold and as you get to work rubbing her left hoof, Alejandra kicks back and relaxes and takes out what appears to be a barn-sized bar of chocolate and leisurely begins to eat it as you continue to massage her titanic foot. You begin to wonder how you got in the labyrinth in the first place. Why was it so big in here and why was there such an enormous buffalo woman who appears to like turning humans into her loyal servants. You fight the stench of Alejandra's feet and then you begin to think of what the situation reminds you of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ancient Greece there was a monster called the minotaur that was half man and half bull and ate human flesh. It was put under control by being sealed away in a large maze known as the labyrinth. You must've been in an alternate world where Alejandra was the stand in for the mighty minotaur. Although, you had no idea why a minotaur would be as big as Alejandra. Alejandra finishes her chocolate and then opens up what looks to be a scroll of some kind. You're guessing that you were not only trapped in an alternate world, you had somehow gone back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something occurs to you. Every 7 years or so, there was a routine sacrifice of young men and women to the minotaur. Perhaps you were a sacrifice meant specifically for Alejandra, but you have no idea what you would have done to have deserved to be a sacrifice. From the looks of it, Alejandra had no interest of leaving the labyrinth. Perhaps if you could find a way outside of this twisting and turning trap, you could get away from Alejandra and figure out a way to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The story starts in a museum where there are several treasures on display, found in North and South America. One particular artifact that stood out was a bright turquoise statue of a coyote. It was after closing time at the moment and the lights went out. The statue shined even in the darkness and all security cameras in the museum were turned on in the event that a would-be thief would attempt to break in and steal the artifact on display. A lone security guard is ever vigilant, keeping his eyes out as he looks at the screens. However, even the most diligent guards are not perfect and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, the ever vigilant but also ever so tired guard falls asleep on his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment you were looking for as you cut open the window to enter the museum and walk through the hallway. You were what most people would call, a thief and you knew somebody who had a collection of rare and not to mention, stolen antiques that they had hidden away and would pay through the nose to expand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any easier than this,\u201d you say to yourself with a snicker. \u201cThis stinking museum only has one guard. I\u2019ll be in and out and nobody will be the wiser.\u201d\u2028\u2028As you walk in, you take out a black sharpie to draw on the security cameras so as not to be detected in case the guard woke up. You walk in where they keep the turquoise and begin to fill your thief bag with as much treasure as you can carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all this loot on display,\u201d you think to yourself as you go on your greedy way. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be something here my employer will want for their collection. Besides, if they don\u2019t like it, I could always sell it to the black market.\u201d You take great pride in your work and feel like nothing can stop you. It is at that exact moment that you see an even more valuable looking prize; namely the turquoise coyote statue in the center of the room. \u201cOoh,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that thing is the most valuable of them all. They\u2019ll surely like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about to make a move when you suddenly stop and then use an aerosol to reveal the bright red laser lights that were protecting the coyote statue. \u201cHuh,\u201d you scoff. \u201cDon\u2019t they ever learn.\u201d You take out several mirrors and position them specifically to redirect the lights. Once all the lasers were dealt with, you whistle and calmly walk up to the case. You take out your glass cutters again and then you slice your way through the glass case. \u201cCome to Papa.\u201d You say as you reach in and grab the coyote statue. However, some ancient treasures can often come with a curse, usually of the costly variety. The moment you grab the coyote, in a flash, you disappear, leaving your stolen loot behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, you are in some strange painted desert with sands coming in bright shades of red, brown, yellow and blue with a bright purple sky overhead and what looks like a moon that had eyes and blinked as it hovered in the air. You see jagged cactuses that looked like somebody painted them and then blinked. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask. \u201cI had the statue! What\u2019s going?!\u201d As you\u2019re ranting, a large shadow is cast upon you and you turn and look in fright. Standing in front of you was an enormous and chubby-looking anthropomorphic coyote woman with dark turquoise blue fur with red and yellow highlights on both her hips and her neck. She had long silver hair and she smirked down at you with sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good,\u201d says the coyote giantess to you. \u201cYou\u2019re here already. I was expecting you later. Oh well, can\u2019t complain. Now, you can start by pulling cactuses out of my fur.\u201d As you stare at the coyote giantess dumbfounded, she turned around and holds down her tail to show a sea of those strange cacti, no doubt stuck in her fur when she was walking through the desert. You definitely stole from the wrong museum.</span></div></div>",

What happened?\u201d You then look around and see acres and acres of sand up all around. The sand glows in hues of reds, yellows and purples. You see what appears to be a camel spider crawling across the ground and you gasp as you hold your head. \u201cHow did I end up in a desert?\u201d you ask as you feel your head. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank.\u201d You step forward through the sand and you see something glowing up ahead. It shined like gold and you run forward to see what it is. All you could tell was that whatever it was, it was almost completely buried underneath the thick golden red sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re running, you fail to notice that you\u2019re passing by a ridge of some sort that appeared to be shaped like a ribcage and looked like bones painted a dustier color by the raging sandstorms. Up ahead, you see clouds in the distance and what look like two mountains that were completely covered by shadows. \u201cHuh?\u201d you ask. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. I didn\u2019t think there would be mountains in this desert. From the looks of it, this clearly isn\u2019t an American desert.\u201d What was it that made you convinced this was no American desert? The answer was simple. You didn\u2019t see a single cactus in the area and there appeared to be what looked like a cobra\u2019s skin blowing in the wind. Clearly you were in an old world desert of some sort. The only thing to guide you was that glowing sparkle up in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reach the sparkle in the sand, you look down and see that the sparkling light was coming from what looked like a silver tassel. \u201cA tassel?\u201d you ask. You then pull on the tassel and see that it was attached to a carpet that was made up of a red square inside a blue square inside a yellow square inside of a white square inside of a pink square. The carpet was in tatters and had what looked like a giant hole in the center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you remember where you saw this carpet. You were looking for a carpet for your dorm room after your previous carpet was ruined by a leaking tube of purple paint. While in the carpet store, you saw this very carpet being throw into a dumpster. You were wondering who would throw out such a perfectly good carpet and decided to try and take it for yourself. However, as soon as you picked up the carpet, it fluttered violently and from what you could remember, it was some sort of magic carpet. It must\u2019ve brought you to this strange desert in the first place. Unfortunately, from the looks of it, it crash-landed and you couldn\u2019t use it to fly your way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hold up the remains of the carpet, you let out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d you say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll be flying home. I\u2019ve got to get out of this desert.\u201d You begin to walk through the desert looking for any sign of civilization. Unfortunately, after an hour, your search is as fruitless as ever and you pant and gasp as the heat begins to get to you. \u201cForget civilization,\u201d you say to yourself. \u201cWater is what I need.\u201d As you\u2019re panting, you hear buzzing. You see a fly buzzing and you\u2019re about to swat it but then you remember, insects need water to survive too. Following the fly may be more beneficial than killing it. You decide to run after the fly and as you continue to follow it, you see that in the distance there are those two bright reddish purple-covered mountains again and they appear to be shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too thirsty to care at that point and just continue to follow the fly until you reach what looks like a lush green oasis with a large pool of water that looked as big as a river. You gasp and then you start to drink as much water as you can. As you continue to drink the water, you hear some slight earthquakes and then you see the water rippling as an enormous shadow is cast over you. You look up and gasp because those two red violet mountains were not mountains after all. They were the humps of a 695ft tall anthropomorphic camel woman with red-violet fur and long silvery pink hair. Her arms were heavily muscular and she had well-toned abs, albeit with a very large and stout stomach that looked like it belonged on a sumo wrestler. The camel giantess was dressed as a belly dancer with a crystal necklace that looked like it was made of bejeweled eyes. Similar decorations hung on her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re dumbfounded, the camel giantess steps into the water and then looks down at you. She gives a big smile before she winks at you and bends down to pick you up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened long ago when mankind\u2019s careless destruction of a world parallel to Earth became too much for the world itself to take. A catastrophic event unfurled and the animal kingdom was transformed into giant lifeforms with the ability to walk, talk and think like humans. Humanity\u2019s military was no match for these giants and they were quickly overpowered by the very beings that were once threatened by mankind\u2019s misdeeds. The best case scenario was for humans to end up as pets to the titans. As for the worst case scenario, some titans enslaved the conquered humans and treated them cruelly. For the smaller lifeforms, their fate was a gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, fortune was rather kind. You were the pet of a rather large but very benevolent titan. Her name was Elizabeth and she was a 800ft tall anthropomorphic tapir. She had orange-yellow-colored skin with orange-red stripes and spots and long midnight black colored hair. You didn\u2019t know her exact age but you suspected she was somewhere in her mid twenties. She was very large in body shape as well. Elizabeth had an apple figure with a large round behind but the biggest part of her was her enormous belly that entered a room a minute before she did. While Elizabeth was mildly clumsy and somewhat oblivious, she was far from abusive and treated you more like a friend than a servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you were sleeping blissfully when Elizabeth\u2019s alarm clock went off. You spring up and run to turn it off, but have trouble manipulating the switch because of A) how tiny you are B) the fact that the clock was an old model. \u201cYou\u2019d think that Elizabeth would\u2019ve bought a better clock by now.\u201d You say with a grunt. \u201cWhoa!\u201d You finally manage to shut off the clock and let out a sigh. But to your surprise, Elizabeth wasn\u2019t in bed. From the looks of it, she was already getting dressed for work. You take a look at the clock and see that it\u2019s only 2:00 a.m.\u201d You give a blink. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why Elizabeth has to go to work so early. Come to think about it, where does that mistress of mine work?\u201d In all the years Elizabeth has owned you, you had no idea where she worked. All you knew was that it paid reasonably well and that it required her to punch in at a rather unreasonable hour. Then again, tapirs were nocturnal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh and decide to drop the matter and walk back to your bed next to the clock, but you\u2019re so tired that you don\u2019t pay attention to where you\u2019re going and fall down screaming into Elizabeth\u2019s bed as you land with a grunt. \u201cOof!\u201d You let out a sigh. At least it\u2019s soft. You\u2019re so tired that you lay down where you are just as Elizabeth stomps in. Your tapir mistress was already dressed in a tight black tanktop that could only hide a quarter of her belly and her skin-tight blue jeans. She was getting ready to put on her light blue jacket. As she does so, you feel a shadow cast over you. Unfortunately for you, Elizabeth didn\u2019t turn the light on as she was getting dressed and before you can react, she sits down on top of you and you let out a muffled scream as Elizabeth sits on you. Fortunately both her behind and the bed are soft enough that you aren\u2019t crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth is putting her jacket on, she sees your bed and blinks. \u201cNow where did that human of mine go?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cListen, I\u2019m going to work now. I\u2019ll be back later. I left some fruit out for your breakfast. Please behave yourself while I\u2019m gone, wherever you are. Love you.\u201d With that, Elizabeth heads off to work with you unknowingly plastered in the center of her rear, stuck but still alive as you try to shake yourself free. Before you know it, Elizabeth is out the door and you\u2019re both on your way to wherever it is she works.</span></div></div>",

Humans were barely mouse-sized to anthros, and were treated as either slaves, or food.

It\u2019s not long before she stomps into the room, and you can\u2019t help but peek out from behind the chair leg to catch a glimpse of your titanic rhino mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was, you had to admit, a bombshell. She was very plump\u2014nicely round and curvy in all the right places, with a chest and rear to die for. And NOT obese or slobby-looking, just plump. Her light-grey hide even looked great with the bright pink bikini she was wearing...even if her girth made it look like it was painted on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may as well come out, Squirt,\u201d Rita says as she slowly walks into the room, shaking her hips. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll find you eventually. But if you want to hide, that\u2019s fine. I could use some more fun.\u201d She giggles, pretending to look under an old coffee table. She was toying with you, and enjoying every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear under your breath. Rita had been out swimming with her friends today, and you had slipped out of your cage to look for a way to escape her apartment. You\u2019d spent hours looking for a crack in the wall or an open window; expecting Rita to be gone all day\u2026 but unfortunately for you she\u2019d come home early and found your empty cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor shakes beneath you as Rita taps her foot. \u201cI\u2019m waiting, Squirt. If you come out now, I\u2019ll go easy on you.

A lamp, an alarm clock and your open cage were crammed onto the table, and some posters of anthro movies decorated the walls, mostly near the closet. To Rita, it was small; but to you it was big as a warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop struggling and look around, confused. \u201cWhy are we in here? You change your mind and want me to make your bed instead of sitting on me?\u201d Rita\u2019s bed was already made, but you figured you should get a few more wisecracks in before your punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her free hand, Rita picked up a pillow and plopped in down in the center of the bed. \u201cThose tiny ears of yours having trouble, Squirt? Like I said, I\u2019m going easy on you this time. Normally I\u2019d drop you in a chair and sit on you--if you were <i>really</i> bad, one without a cushion--but this time you\u2019ll have a nice soft bed under you when the Pink Doom drops on ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Now I\u2019ll only be flat as a pancake when you\u2019re done, instead of flat as paper like usual. You\u2019re such a fair mistress.\u201d You try and hide your fear despite the snarking. By Rita\u2019s laugh, you failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you over the pillow, dangling you upside down by the leg. Her smile is from ear to ear, and she even shakes her rump in glee. \u201cThanks, Squirt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita lets go and you fall onto the giant pillow, sinking in with hardly a bounce. The thing was surprisingly soft, even comfortable. But that comfort goes out the window when Rita turns around, and you\u2019re treated to the all-too-familiar sight of her titanic, bikini-clad rhinoceros booty hovering over your tiny form. She turns her head and smirks at you, and after a wink, lets her mass--and ass--drop on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world goes dark. Insane pressure slams into your entire body and you feel the pillow flatten as you vanish completely under Rita\u2019s behind, her great weight pressing you down into the mattress that creaked under her mass. Instinct kicks in and you begin flailing about, uselessly trying to push the crushing posterior off you; squirm out from under her...but Rita\u2019s sheer weight, and the pliant fat on her butt kept you pinned. The bikini was even too slick to get a good grip on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Rita sighs in bliss at your struggles. She starts wiggling her behind and grinding down on you, dragging your form back and forth across the pillow. It wasn\u2019t as intense as the other times she\u2019d sat on you, and the softness of the pillow and bed <i>did</i> take the edge of the worst of the pain. Maybe Rita was really going easy on you this time. You still want to scream, but keep your mouth closed: you\u2019d learned the hard way that screaming just got you an open mouth full of rhino flab, and biting Rita\u2019s rear didn\u2019t do anything but tickle her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, cheek. <i>Wait, what?</i> You move your arms as best you can, and just barely feel an edge of Rita\u2019s cheek--and the space between it and the other one. Rita moans and you recoil, but it was true: she\u2019d moved to the side a bit, mostly pinning you under ONE cheek this time, rather than feeling the wrath of both orbs. Another reason her wiggles and grinds were less agonizing than normal: without getting chewed between two cheeks, there was less force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And since you weren\u2019t directly under her crack this time, you wouldn\u2019t be at ground zero of any gas. Rita had farted while sitting on you a few times. One time, you lost your sense of smell for a week. NOT being in the direct path of flatulence was quite the blessing, especially given an anthro who like sitting on humans as much as Rita did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita really WAS going easy on you. But, having a multi-ton rhino giantess sit on you was still quite painful, especially if you put up with it for almost ten whole minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rita gets up, after wiggling down on you one last time, you\u2019re dazed and barely conscious--and pinned to her cheek like a human sticker. She peels you off and holds you up to her smirking face. \u201cWell Squirt, I think you\u2019ve learned your lesson for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a thumbs-down. You\u2019re not quite angry enough to give her the finger, since the punishment was slightly less bad than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, see? You\u2019re even getting more polite! Anyway, now that your punishment is over, I\u2019ve got good news. See, the girls and I were all having fun swimming; but then Lisa--you know, the alligator? She had the idea that we could all meet up at her place and have some fun with our humans together! That\u2019s why I came home so early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then we had our \u2018fun\u2019,\u201d you mumble. Great, now you would have to deal with a whole gang of anthro giantesses; and the humans they\u2019d probably scared into compliance and servitude. \u201cAlright...what\u2019s gonna happen to me?\u201d<br>\r\nRita laughs. \u201cOh, that\u2019s the best part, Squirt...us ladies are gonna have a slumber party, just like when we were kids! And bring our humans to play with--don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll try and make sure Lisa doesn\u2019t eat you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. Just perfect. A <i>whole night</i> surrounded by giantesses. You wished Rita was still sitting on you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rita had spotted your efforts and since she didn't have time to punish you, she just threw you in her purse and snapped it shut, leaving you with nothing but beauty products for company. Even if you couldn't see, Rita kept you up-to-date every step of the way, like some kind of cheerful doomsday clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we're on our way! Isn't this fun, Squirt? You must be so excited! You'll get to see all your friends again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones who've survived until now,\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita shrugged and made a noncommittal noise, neither confirming nor denying anything. Somehow she was able to hear you despite your size and confinement. She may be a rhino but you swore she had the ears of a bat. It was just one of the many reasons you'd never been able to escape from her. You kept up your escape attempts in her purse, but Rita paid no attention, and you realized it was because escape from this purse was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep struggling all you want, Squirt. That just makes me want to play more at the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and stopped struggling. You knew you'd reached the point of no return when Rita stopped and you heard her knocking on a door. Immediately the door was thrown open and a booming voice yelled out, \"PAAAAAAAR-TAAAAAAAAAAAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at the noise. You recognized that voice and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lisa!\" Rita said cheerfully. \"Great idea you had for tonight! We're going to have such fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Lisa said. \"I have so many ideas planned for our tiny toys, tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh... And how many of those ideas involve eating them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa huffed in mock outrage. \"I am shocked. Shocked and offended you would accuse me of inviting my best friends in the whole world over, just so I could use their tinies as free food... Speaking of mouthwatering morsels, did you bring our appetizing, little escape artist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lisa,\" Rita said patiently. \"He's right here. But don't eat him. I'm not like you, I'm not made of money. I can't afford to buy humans in bulk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Lisa said impatiently. \"Let's see him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita sighed and opened her purse. You cowered beneath your mistress's giant hand and tried to avoid her grasp. She plucked you up easily and displayed you in her palm. Rita looked gorgeous tonight--or at least as gorgeous as any non-human could be. She wore a pink tank-top and black yoga pants showing off her shapely assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was the sight of the other anthro that had you quivering in her palm. Unlike Rita, who could be described as pleasantly plump but was still a bombshell, Lisa was obese. Her skin was bright green and she was dressed in a kind of goth, punk-rock style. Her black hair was short and messy with purple highlights. She wore heavy black eye shadow and painted black lips. When she saw you, she salivated, running her massive pink tongue over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator held an opened beer can in her hand and was obviously already drunk. When she spoke the smell of alcohol wafted over you like a gale-force wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he looks positively scrumptious!\" Lisa said, advancing. Rita recognized the hungry look in her eyes and pulled you away from her friend quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! What did I just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Lisa said, blushing. \"Something about his smell in particular... I don't know why, but it drives me crazy like no other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well keep it to yourself for now. I've grown attached to this one, and if you eat him, you'll pay for it out the nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be worth it,\" Lisa murmured, then saw the angry gleam in Rita's eyes and backed off. \"Ok, ok, I'll do my best. Pinkie promise,\" she said, extending her purple-painted pinkie. Rita rolled her eyes but shook her friend's claw. \"Come on,\" Lisa said, \"the rest of the girls are already here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaking from your ordeal with Lisa, Rita carried you into her friend's apartment. Unlike Rita's home, Lisa's apartment was far bigger and more expensive. Sitting on the couch in the living room was Lisa's little sister, Kelly. Other than both being hundred foot tall alligators, the siblings were completely opposite. Where Lisa was fat, Kelly was tall and slender. Where Lisa was slovenly and dressed to party, Kelly was well-groomed and dressed like they were meeting for a book club, with a turtle-neck sweater and small glasses. Lisa was a boisterous party animal, while Kelly was a shy bookworm. She waved meekly at Rita as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd heard from Rita that the alligator sisters came from money. It was why they could afford such a nice apartment, and why Lisa could go threw humans like bags of potato chips and still have money to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two other anthros you recognized reclining in the room. One was a cow with red spots almost as fat as Lisa. She had long, pink hair in bright curls and a dress so bright it was almost blinding. Her name was Sue. She was probably the sweetest and kindest anthro you ever met. She was also one of the deadliest. Sue was a total ditz and a complete klutz who didn't know her own strength. While she babied the humans she kept as pets, her carelessness had caused more than a few... accidents. She almost went through humans as fast as Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the tiny she held in her hand and was cooing baby-talk to. His name was Pickles. It wasn't his real name, no more than your name was Squirt, but it was the only thing Sue let him be called. Somehow he'd survived longer than all her other pets combined. You weren't sure if that was better or worse for him. Right now Sue was using brushing his long hair which she'd grown out and painted pink like a doll's. He looked ready to die of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other anthro you saw was seated back on a recliner, with her paws propped in the air. She was a golden-furred lioness with white hair in a long braid. She was dressed in red-silk pajamas. She had even more of a bombshell figure than Rita, but while you could tell Rita was playful just by looking at her, the lioness's demeanor was haughty and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Clarice. Like the alligator sisters she came from money. Unlike the sisters, she made you know just how superior said money made her. As she reclined in her seat, several tiny humans catered to her every whim. Two massage the paws of her feet, one was painting her fingernails pink, and another was balanced precariously on the edge of her drink, stirring it with a straw and trying his best not to plummet into the drink below. You knew from experience that if he fell, she wouldn't fish him out before her next sip. Humans were expendable to her. In fact, you didn't recognize a single human worshipping her right now. That didn't bode well for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of you to finally join us,\" Clarice said coolly, even though Rita wasn't even a minute late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress scowled. She and the lioness were only \"friends\" by association. Any night they could go without tearing into each other was considered a win in your book, especially since Clarice made it no secret that if she didn't care about Rita's feelings, she certainly didn't give a crap about your welfare. Sometimes you were positive she'd get rid of you just to spite your owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the guests consisted of an anthro who'd made it clear she'd gobble you up in a heartbeat, one who was likely to \"play\" with you to death, and one who viewed you as an insect to be crushed. Kelly seemed alright, but you didn't know her well enough to trust her, especially since she always came across as more of a doormat to her gluttonous sister. Right now, Rita--the one who made a game of smooshing you beneath her massive behind--was the <i>lesser evil</i> you had to concern yourself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was not looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies!\" Lisa slurred. \"Now that everyone's here, the festivities can BEGIN! We got a long night ahead of us and we're not gonna spend a second of it sleeping! Let's start this party off with a bang! How about we play a game of...\"</span></div></div>",

What are we, twelve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita puffed up her cheeks and crossed her arms. Unfortunately, she'd forgotten about you, leaving you pressed tightly against her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight's supposed to be fun, Clarice,\" Rita huffed. \"Why'd you even bother coming over if you didn't want to play games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't expect someone like <i>you</i> to understand, Rita,\" Clarice said. \"When I accepted this invitation, I expected a certain air of sophistication for tonight's gathering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness's point was undercut by Lisa chugging the remainder of her beer, belching loudly, and then crushing the can against her forehead. \"ALRIGHT!\" she said like she hadn't even heard her friends arguing. \"LET'S DO THIS! Everyone sit inna circle, and jus wait while I get my tinys from the pantry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa waddled off into the kitchen unsteadily. She was hammered. Rita sat on the ground, in a circle with everyone else. Clarice rolled her eyes but scooped up her slaves and joined her friends. Kelly pulled a necklace out from inside her shirt, revealing a tiny human man tied to the end of a golden chain. He was red and sweaty from his time spent tucked away between the thin alligator's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized him. Pee-Wee was his name. It was smart of Kelly to keep him on hand at all times. He'd never be safe alone around her sister. Speak of the devil, the heavyset alligator came in a few seconds later, holding two humans in her hand, a crying middle-aged couple. The ground shook when Lisa took her seat between Rita and Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could've sworn I had three of these,\" she slurred to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ATE OUR SON THIS MORNING!\" the tiny woman wailed, falling to her knees in the alligator's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked confused for a second then her eyes lit up and she chuckled. \"Oh yeah, the scrawny one with the yellow hair! He was a tasty one! Oh, don't feel bad,\" Lisa said as the terrified couple cried even harder. \"If it makes you feel any better he gave me awful indigestion afterwards. That makes us even, right?\" This only made the man and woman cry even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwww, poor widdle hoomuns!\" Sue said in sympathetic babytalk. \"Did mean, ol' Lisa-wisa send your lil boy to her big tummy? I'm sowwy. I'd never treat you like that. No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't. Isn't that right, Pickles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me,\" the tiny muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going to play this silly game, can we get on with it?\" Clarice snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Clarice? Got somewhere more important to be?\" Rita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right, a'right, tha's e'nuff,\" Lisa slurred. \"Here's the rules. Dis is Truth or Dare. Rules are simple. One of us asks another a question. If they answer, they gotta tell the truth. If they refuse, the asker gives them a dare instead. However, it's the human that has to do the dare, and they can't refuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot Rita a terrified look. The rhino shared your worry. \"Um,\" Rita said, \"maybe we should make a rule about the kind of dares the humans have to do. You know, just so they don't accidentally--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, Rita,\" Clarice said. \"We all know about your... <i>strained</i> financial situation. I'd be happy to reimburse you for any damage done to your Squirt. We all know he can't cost much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Lisa said, not noticing the hatred between her two friends. \"You break it, you buy it. Perfectly fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's settled then,\" Clarice said smoothly. \"Let me go first, Lisa. I have a burning question I've been meaning to ask Rita.\" Before anyone could object the lioness spoke quickly. \"Rita. Truth or dare. How much do you weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita blushed beet red and you swore. Weight was relative here. At your size Rita could've been rail thin and she still would've flattened you like a cartoon sticker if she applied pressure. Compared to Lisa, Rita was practically a model. She really only a little pudge that made her figure even more attractive than less--but you and her both knew that Clarice didn't see it that way. The lioness just wanted to humiliate your owner by fatshaming. You might've even felt bad for your mistress and this high school, drama crap she was being subjected to, but you knew if she refused to answer the question, you'd be the one to pay the price. Maybe you should've taken your chances and hid from her when she was looking for you this morning. You might be paying the price for that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that if you lie,\" Clarice said, \"we have a scale that we can use to determine the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino chewed her lip as she thought. Does she tell them the truth or refuse and force Squirt to do a dare?</span></div></div>",

To hell with your pride; you knew any one of these harpies could easily kill you. Even Kelly and Sue could be deadly. If Rita let Clarice's taunting get to her, you likely wouldn't survive the night...or even the next ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Rita nods, and you feel like cheering! It looked like your mistress was going to swallow her pride and tell the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometime <i>today</i>, Rita,\" Clarice says haughtily. She flicks a toe, whacking one of the humans massaging her paws in the head and knocking him to the floor. He didn't get up, and the other humans strained to NOT look at his still form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita rolls her eyes. \"Last time I went to the doctor, I weighed in at...212 tons, give or take. Happy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shounds abou' right,\" Lisa slurred. \"She's big, but not, like; <i>really</i> big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue nodded. \"I think she's telling the truth. She can sit on Squirt without squishing him, after all; and I weigh more than her. I've sat on some of my humans by accident, and the poor widdle things always get squished like grapes! Like the five yesterday....and one the day before....and some this morning....and I kinda ate some of Lisa's when I first got here. Er, sorry about that.\" As she spoke, you saw Pickles wince at every mention of Sue's accidental victims. Poor guy must have witnessed them all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No biggie,\" Lisa assured her. \"What's a few tinies gone? Oh, and you don't have to pay me back for those. Freebies and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly clutched Pee-Wee to her chest protectively at her sister's words. Then she cleared her throat. \"I, uh; say she's being truthful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Clarice. The lioness looked ready to challenge Rita's claim, but snorted when it was clear she was outnumbered. \"...Fine. But just to be safe, let's check the scale, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroans rose up from the giants, but Sue stood up. \"I'll get it. Game's called '<i>Truth</i> or Dare', after all.\" She waddled off down the hall, her tail knocking some guys who were polishing a coffe table onto the floor. Lisa snatched one up immediately and tossed him into her mouth, swallowing the screaming man whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody, not even Kelly or Rita, batted an eye at her eating a human alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Sue returned, carrying the scale. She didn't notice the humans she'd knocked onto the floor...who were all gathered where the cow giantess had been sitting. Naturally, her wide bovine rump crashed down the lot of them; the man vanishing beneath her ass instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa burst out laughing and Sue blushed bright red. \"Uh-oh...I felt a crunch. Did I just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Yer big butt just claimed some more victims!\" The fat alligator guffawed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls' reactions were mixed. Clarice looked haughty, seeming to enjoy Sue's embarrasment. Kelly looked sympathetic, even wincing at the crunching sounds; but still couldn't surpress a giggle. <br>\r\nRita gave you a look that said, <i>See how lucky you are?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue shook off her embarrassment and set the scale down in the middle of the circle. \"Anyway...Rita, let's fact-check you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita set you on her shoulder and stood, stepping onto the scale--being careful to avoid stomping any humans on the floor--and held her breath as the device weighed her. The digital readout flickered for a moment, and then gave its answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>214.5 TONS.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rita both wince. Two and a half tons over her claim. A lot by your standards, but to anthros it was a small difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice chuckled, making Rita wince. \"Hmm...not QUITE what you claimed, Rita. Not a big difference, but still.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would the lioness do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Otherwise there might be... um... another incident,\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what incident Kelly was talking about. It involved another party--not one at the alligator sisters house--but another friend's. You don't remember exactly what set it off--Rita had concealed you in the back of her thong as punishment for another escape attempt--all you knew was that everything went crazy when a fight broke out between Rita and Clarice. It involved a lot of hair-pulling and a lot of tiny human slaves crushed underfoot as two titans brawled. You'd nearly been killed as Rita's cheeks mashed you together. Clarice knocked Rita right on her ass, but your captor had pulled the lion down with her. How you'd survived the pressure of not one but two giants crushing down on you was a miracle you could not explain, but remained eternally grateful for. Not that it hadn't hurt like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably a good idea,\" Sue said. \"We wouldn't want to accidentally hurt any of our little guys and gals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rita both face-palmed at the oblivious hypocrisy of that statement but the other girls were nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good suggestion, Kel!\" Lisa said, making her little sister blush. \"Ok, Rita. Ask your question to someone other than Clarice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita frowned and Kelly shrugged apologetically. The rhino sat thinking for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be asking your question sometime this century, Ms. 214.5?\" Clarice asked snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita blushed furiously but then broke out in a smile. You recognized that smile. It was the smile of someone who's about to take great joy in the pain they're about to cause. Once again, you unfortunately knew that from personal experience. The last time Rita smiled like it was just when she caught you trying to climb out the window after she'd just finished eating two cans of beans. The memory of that night made you shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sue,\" Rita said. \"Truth or dare. Who was the first boy you ever dated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice looked confused but Sue looked horrified. The cow's eyes glanced towards the lioness and Clarice narrowed her eyes in suspicion. It didn't take a genius to figure out whomever Rita was talking about had a connection to Clarice, one that Sue really didn't want her friend to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well... When you say date...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date. As in more than once. As in our senior prom,\" Rita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sounds like a juicy story,</i> you thought. <i>Hope I get to hear it, cause if not... Well, I really hope Sue tells the truth for Pickles' sake.</i></span></div></div>",

The giant heifer gave a hopeful look to Rita, but your mistress just smirked like...well, like she did when she thought up some new way to play with you. You had to admit, the schadenfreude from seeing that look aimed at someone besides you was exquisite. Sue looked to Clarice, but the lioness's glare made it clear she wouldn't get out of this one easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPickles rolled his eyes and mimed looking at a watch. <br>\r\nLisa saw it and gave a drunken chuckle, even flashing a thumb(claw)-up at the tiny man's silent sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'll say truth,\" Sue finally answered, her voice shaky. \"On our senior prom, my date was...Trevor. As in, Clarice's cousin.\" She winced, then made motions to back away from the lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice was an ocean of calm. Even her smug demeanor had dropped off. \"He didn't tell me? Ahem...how did it go, Sue?\" She purred quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lisa started to look nervous, moving her glass beer bottle out of either girl's reach. Kelly held her human closer to her chest, and Rita even gave you a worried look. You both look toward the door, wondering if it was about to hit the fan and she'd have to leave for your own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was sweating bullets now, and you even feel sorry for her. \"Um, we--*gulp*--danced a lot, and drank a lot of punch. He was kinda shy and nervous, but really sweet. I made sure NOT to mention his last girlfriend after what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered Rita mentioning that. Trevor had been rather coldly dumped by an elephant girl, and left depressed and sulky afterwards. Clarice had even started acting more antagonistic to Rita than usual after her cousin's heart was broken--a grudge against pachyderms the lioness still hadn't quite shaken off. It had left the smug rich cat oddly protective of her cousin, and suspicious of any girl who dated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...?\" Clarice prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we...kissed.\" Sue finished. \"He, uh; really liked it. I did too, heh. But, when we got to talking, I figured we wouldn't be a good match. He...thinks humans are only for eating, that they're bugs. And I couldn't let him near Pickles, so...a few days after prom, I told him he was a great guy, but that it may not work out between us. I didn't mention humans, but I tried to let him down gently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. None of the giantesses say anything, nor the tiny humans scampering about. All eyes are on Clarice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And how did Trevor take this revalation, that you wouldn't stay with him after a good night?\" She looked ready to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue swallows, and licks her lips before answering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lioness's hair stood up on end, her teeth and claws were bared, and if looks could kill Sue would've been buried in the backyard already. \"The entire summer Trevor was a wreck! I thought it was that elephant hussy who broke his heart, but now I find out one of my best friends stomped all over it and broke it twice over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice sprang to her feet and Sue began nervously scooting away on her big behind. She clutched Pickles tight to her chest in terror, her grip so hard the little guy struggled to breathe. He smacked her fingers to get her attention but Sue was too busy retreating from her enraged friend to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey now, Clarice! B-be r-reasonable! It was a long time ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what Trevor was like that summer?!\" the lioness roared. \"He was inconsolable! He spent three months crying and binge eating! He never lost the weight, he's still the size of a barn! The therapy bills were so high we had to cancel our family vacation! No lounging at the beach with cabana boys for this girl, that summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that from one date?\" Sue asked, genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice ignored her. \"Trevor started a blog and posted poetry that summer, Sue! <i>POETRY!</i> Do you have any idea how much emotional garbage he made me read because of you?! I had to like a post where he said, \"My heart is your paper cup/ Drink your fill then throw it away.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita snorted. You would've found it funny too if the atmosphere wasn't so murderous. You were just grateful Sue and Clarice were too distracted to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've been grateful my cousin spared you the time of day, you fat cow! Instead you destroyed him! Now, I'm gonna repay the favor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice pounced before Sue could get up. Rita, Kelly and Lisa backed away as the two titans wrestled and rolled across the floor, clawing at each other's hair and cursing. Sue kept Pickles clutched close to protect him from Clarice. The little guy was almost purple from lack of hair. Clarice tore off one of Sue's sleeves. Sue ripped at Clarice's collar, tearing the silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me or is this kind of hot?\" Lisa asked. Rita and Kelly shot her a look. Even Sue and Clarice paused in their fight to scowl at her. Lisa blushed. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue and Clarice resumed their fight without further interruption, the two titans thrashing and screaming obscenities at each other. Rita watched with barely concealed enjoyment. While the sight of two human-killers was enjoyable, you felt more and more uncomfortable as the fight went on. If not for the anthros' sakes then for Pickles. You weren't exactly best friends, but he was the only human that lasted long enough for you to get to know in your current circumstances. At the least you'd hope he'd do something to help you if your roles were reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rita,\" you said. The rhino's eyes flickered down to you. \"Don't you think this has gone on long enough? I know you're mad at Clarice, but Sue's your friend, isn't she? And at the rate they're going they're going to tear apart the Gator Sisters apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mistress sighed. \"You take all the fun out of revenge, Squirt. Alright, alright, ladies. Break it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you said as she approached the fighting titans. \"Don't bring me with you!\" Rita ignored your request and stuffed you into her cleavage again for safekeeping. Not that you felt safe, of course. Nor should you have. No sooner had Rita tried to push the two apart then she was pulled into the fray. With all the chaos it might as well have been a cartoon fight cloud consisting of swinging fists and kicking feet. You were jostled, battered and squeezed between Rita's breasts as the three fought. Seeing the fight not ending with Rita's interference, Lisa and Kelly butted in to help. Clarice hissed and spat as Lisa pulled her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute but at last the fight came to an end. Sue's hair was a disheveled mess. Clarice's silk pajamas were in tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now,\" Lisa slurred, patting Clarice on the back. \"Got it all out of your system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice snarled at Rita and Sue on the other side of the room. The lioness's paws were clenched. The battle was over, but was the war?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No. Clarice had managed to snatch both you and Pickles away during the fighting and now clenched you in her paws. She'll hurt you two somehow to punish Sue and Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Yes. Clarice left the fight empty-handed and the game awkwardly continues.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The breath was being crushed out of your lungs as you tried to lift one of Rita's massive mammarys off you. The chaos of the fight had sent you deep into the abyss of Rita's sweaty cleavage. You supposed you were just lucky you weren't thrown free in the tussle. You didn't want to think what might've happened to you if you were amidst the rolling bodies. Hell, if Clarice got her paws on you, she'd probably skin you alive just to spite Rita. Apparently Rita had a similar thought, because as soon as she got up and dusted herself off, she hastily checked her \"storage\" space to make sure you were alright.  When she saw you were fine, if slightly flattened, she let out a sigh of relief. Sue might not have been so lucky however, as she was scanning the ground for her human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pickles? Pickles?! Where are you Pickles?!\" she called, close to tears. \"Don't tell me that mean cat killed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled drunkenly. \"He's on yer assh, Shue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the vast expanse of the cow's ass and saw Lisa was right. Pickles was embedded in Sue's crack, slightly flattened but still alive. Even though you pitied the condition of your pseudo-friend, the sight of Sue trying to crane her neck so she could see her plastered pet on her posterior was amusing. She ended up spinning in place, looking like a dog chasing its tail. Mercifully, Kelly took pity on her friend and helped free Pickles from her rump. Peeling him off ended up making a sound like a sticker being yanked off clothes. No sooner had Pickles gotten free and was able to take deep breaths of relief, than Sue grabbed him and began giving him big slobbery kisses out of relief for his safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor bastard,\" you murmured, before remembering you were still wedged in the cleavage of a rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooooooo,\" Lisa slured. \"Now that that's done wiff. Why don' we go back to dah game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?!\" Sue yelled, clutching Pickles tightly to her breast. \"I'm not playing with <i>her</i>,\" she said looking at Clarice. \"She tried to kill me and nearly killed my poor, Pickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She broke my cousin's heart and ruined my silk pajamas!\" Clarice hissed. \"Do you have any idea how much these cost?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" Sue huffed. \"I'm leaving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I am!\" the lioness snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?!\" Lisa said. \"Ya can' go! Dis par-tay wash jes getting schtarted! Kel, talk sum scense into dem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm not so sure, Lisa,\" Kelly said, in her shy, soft-spoken voice. She was looking at the ruin of their apartment, probably calculating how much it was going to cost to fix. \"Maybe we should call it a night--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Ya can' leave! Kel sez so,\" Lisa said, blissfully living in an alternate, inhebriated reality where her sister had agreed wholeheartedly with her. \"Jush wai one sec. Ah gotta idea on how to kick dis par-tay up a notsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could argue, Lisa ran into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear,\" Clarice muttered. \"If her idea to save this sleepover is to have another human binge-eating contest, I'm going to turn her into a suitcase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TA-DA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa emerged back into the room, holding something over her head. To everyone's surprise, it wasn't a case of tiny humans. Unfortunately, it could be something far more deadly: tequila and shot glasses. You gulped. Anthro Titans were scary enough. <i>Drunken</i> Anthro Titans was a new level of fear entirely. You coughed nervously and tried to get Rita's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe we should get home? Don't want to burn the midnight oil, do we--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Lisa! You've been holding out on us, girl! I didn't know you had the good stuff!\" Rita said, apparently indifferent to your protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa chuckled and poured two shot glasses. \"On'y ta be used in case of emergenenseas,\" she said, then offered a class to Sue and Clarice both. \"Trushe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness and the cow stared at each other for a long time but finally took the glasses. \"Truce,\" they both said, and drank at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOHOO! LET DA PAR-TAY COMMENSH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half an hour passed and the game of Truth or Dare continued, only this time whoever was playing had to take a shot before choosing Truth or Dare. The atmosphere became more relaxed amongst the anthros, but more perilous for the human servants that were still alive. As inhibitions loosened, dare was picked more and more often, and now the humans were in serious trouble. So far the dares had been tame enough so that no human had died yet, but you knew it was only a matter of time before things went too far. You kept a particularly close eye on Rita. She was a lightweight when it came to drinking and by her second shot, she was becoming more and more absent-minded and uninhibited. Now, instead of freeing yourself from her bosom, you tried to bury yourself in deeper to hide yourself. Unfortunately, this ended up having the opposite effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey! Wazza madda wiff you?\" Rita slurred and hiccupped, digging you out of her breasts. \"Yer actin' awful frisky t'night. Don'--<i>HIC!</i>--write a check ya can't cash,\" she said, wiggling her eyebrows. You shuddered in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose Rita,\" Clarice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" Rita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness smiled. \"It's your turn. Truth or dare?\" She had had five shots already and didn't show a single sign of drunkenness. Figured she'd be the only one not to be affected by the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tsaydaredon'tsaydaredon'tsaydare!\" you whispered frantically to Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whazzat? Dare?\" she asked mishearing you. \"Yer aw'fly brave, Squirt. I waz gunna say troof, but if ya insist. Dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smacked your forehead. Of course this would happen. Clarice smiled victoriously and you gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you... to take another shot... <i>but with your human in the glass!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psycho cat!\" you hissed under your breath. She must've been waiting for this moment. The moment where Rita was drunk enough that the lioness could get her revenge for arranging that earlier fight. You'd be impressed at how diabolical she was if you weren't too busy sweating bullets. You looked at Rita and pleaded. \"Rita! You wouldn't do that, right? It's me! Your Squirt! Remember all the good times we had? That time you sat on me. That time you forced me to give you a foot massage... That time you... sat on me again... and farted--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita barked out a laugh at the memory. You cringed and tried to keep arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well, anyway--I'm the only human you have! Remember how much money it cost to buy me? If I die you can't afford to get another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita looked at you, smirking. You could smell the alcohol on her breath from here. Hopefully she wasn't so drunk that she'd completely disregard your safety... Was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She's too drunk to be concerned about you and does the dare without reservation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) She's not drunk enough to risk your safety and refuses the dare. What are the consequences of refusal?</span></div></div>",

A daresh'--<i>*hic!*</i>--a dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers grasped at you again, and you fall away...and with a yelp, you find yourself slipping out from between the entrapping boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He fell outta yer hooters!\" You hear Lisa comment. <br>\r\nBouncing off Rita's rough grey hide you tumble downward, slipping out from under her tank top, and go rolling down her huge body. You roll down her chest, your head smacking against ribs--that to you were as big as speed bumps--making you see stars. Reaching her plump belly, you go bouncing around the flabby surface; Rita giggles at each impact as you tickle her tummy. Finally, you bounce one last time and go flying, flailing through the air before landing with an \"OOF!\" on the floor: right in front of where Rita is sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was broken...somehow. You'd just fell from hundreds of feet, and yet you HADN'T popped like a grape. Physics seemed to take the day off when Anthros were involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita leans over you, followed by Sue and Lisa. \"Oh dear, is he alright?\" Sue asked, geniunely worried. The cow leans down and examnes you. \"He took quite a fall there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, the li'l twerp'll be okay,\" Lisa puts in, chuckling. \"If he can survive Rita's big booty squishing him all the time, he can take a little tumble.

And getting sat on looked a HELL of a lot better than joining Rita's next shot of alcohol in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bone-crushing ass of hers could be your salvation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive cheeks drop, and you open your arms to accept them...</span></div></div>",

You had just enough time to think, \"Evil, bitch,\" before you were buried beneath an avalanche of rhino glutes. Any satisfaction you could get from being spared a dip in Rita's alcohol-filled stomach was immediately cut off by the ensuing wave of agony. You'd long since given up wondering how you avoided being squashed like a bug every time Rita slammed her ginormous ass on top of you, but just because you survived didn't mean it didn't hurt like hell. Unfortunately, whatever quirk of nature helped you survive also seemed to keep you conscious to endure every second of the torment. You were plastered beneath countless tons of weight, unable to move, barely able to breathe, the pressure grinding you into the floor. Outside you could hear Rita and her friends laughing at your humiliation. All of them found it hilarious. All of them except Clarice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, very funny,\" Clarice said. \"But that wasn't the dare, was it? Now, Rita, move your big butt and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness cut off as a loud groan came from Rita's stomach. The sound set a tingle down your spine and you whimpered helplessly. You'd heard that noise enough times to know what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita let loose an earth-shattering fart, point-blank on your microscopic body. All dignity and common sense forgotten, you tried to struggle your way free, even though your tormentor's weight made it literally impossible to move. The best your body could do was shake feebly in protest. You couldn't even close your mouth, forcing the foul stank into your body. Your insides were burning! You'd need to wash and scrub your guts to ever feel normal again! No, forget washing, you'd need an exorcist to get this reeking presence out of you! From the sounds of it, none of Rita's friends appreciated her display any more than you did. None of them except Lisa, who was laughing her ass off even as she was coughing on the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo! Bravo! Magnifico!\" she cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, five?\" Clarice hissed. \"That's disgusting! I need a shower to get this smell out of my fur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...shorry,\" Rita slurred, but you could hear her chuckling. \"I forgot how bad my beer farts are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo had you when you'd prayed to be crushed beneath her butt rather than sent to her stomach. Though how you could've ever forgotten a smell this bad when you'd been subjected to it before was another of the great mysteries of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPFFFFFFRRRRRRRTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother burst of gas sent you sobbing for mercy, your eyes stinging with tears. You could hear a chorus of groans agreeing with your assessment outside. \"What are you all complaining about?!\" you thought. \"I'm the one dealing with this at point-blank range you animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaaaaaat?\" Rita said, laughing. \"Ish *<i>hic</i>* ish natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing natural about this! Such a smell had to be the work of a gypsy's curse! Screw fear of being eaten! You'd happily take a swan dive down Rita's throat if it meant no longer enduring a single second of this torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Clarice snapped. \"I'm going to bed. Kelly, I'm sleeping in your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the meek reptile squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lisa said. \"Ish pretty late. We shud all gedda bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Rita prepare to get up and you thanked merciful god in heaven that your nightmare was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Clarice said. \"You're staying right here, Rita. I'm not going to stay up all night choking on your stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to agree,\" Kelly said, \"but I don't want our bedroom to smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurse you merciful god in heaven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Rita said, yawning. Her eyelids were already feeling heavy and she grabbed a pillow from off the couch without moving. She laid down on the floor, without her butt scooching an inch off of you. \"I'll schleep here and see you gils in da... in da mornin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NoNoNO! WHAT ABOUT ME?!\" You tried to scream the words but they came out as a wheeze. Unfortunately, it seemed your presence was entirely forgotten as the girls all got up and headed to the bedroom. All of them except Rita, who stayed right where she was, her butt planted firmly on your helpless form. You tried to wiggle and scream to get her attention but it was just as useless now as it had been every other time you'd been trapped underneath her. In less than a minute you heard Rita's snores. Almost immediately afterwards there came another groan from her stomach. You sobbed helplessly as you were subjected to yet another whirlwind of funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPFFFFFRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita sighed contentedly in her sleep and you let out a silent scream. And so the hours passed, your mistress sleeping peacefully as she frequently blasted you with flatulence. Sleep never came, you were forced to endure every second of it in conscious agony. Would freedom ever come before the night was over? </span></div></div>",

Your rhino mistress was out like a light, blissfully ignorant of your attempts to free yourself as she blissfully snored away. She didn't even giggle from the tickling you must have been giving her butt, like she normally did when she sat on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was, to use the technical term, \"Knocked Dafuq Out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OFF, YOU STUPID PACHYDERM BITCH! GET YOUR FAT BONE-CRUSHING ASS OFF ME!\" You try to scream it, but even to your own ears your voice is muffled by the mountain of rhino crushing down on you. Talking also gets you an open mouth full of rhino-rump, choking out any furhter rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Whazzat? Whoshtalkin'...?\"</i> Rita's voice slurs. You try to pinch her cheek to get her attention, but her yoga pants and thick hide block it. Not to mention Rita being drunk off her ass. <i>\"Waaateva...gon' sleep...\"</i> She burps and slumps back to sleep, wiggling her cheeks down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream in pain, wondering what god you angered to deserve this. Why can't you just die already?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother small <i>pfft</i> renews the stench, and the night drags on. Rita grinds on you on and off over the hours, and you keep squirming and struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, Rita stopped farting after the first few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=====Next Morning====</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a few minutes wondering if you're dead. The first sign you HAVEN'T suffocated to death was that you could still feel pain. Rita's ominipresent ass still enveloped you, but you were still alive enough to <i>feel</i> the hundreds of tons crushing down on your tiny form. You could still struggle, so no bones had been broken: another sign of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated it, you weren't dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping footsteps shake the floor, before a familiar voice calls out, \"Good morning, ladies! How was the PAR-TAY?! You up for the day?!\" Even muffled by the mountain of rhino ass flattening you, it's obvious it was Lisa--sounding slightly less drunk than last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut. UP, Lisa.\" Rita moans. \"Ugh...why won't the light shut up?!\"  The weight that had been crushing down on you shoots up as Rita sits up, her ass pressing down on you as she wiggles down drunkenly. \"Huh, the stink is gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not for me, you disgusting slob!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sprayed some air freshener durin' the night. Cleaned your fart-fest right outta the air!\" Lisa answers. \"By the way, Squirt's been under your ass all night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Rita yelps. She sounds genuinely concerned--she'd never sat on you for that long before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've probably been farting on him all night, too.\" You couldn't see the fat gator, but you heard the smile on her voice. \"Hope he didn't suffocate down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita yelps again and lifts her cheek...and you with it. You'd been plastered to her ass like a sticker. \"Oh no--please be okay, Squirt! Please be okay...!\" Slowly, gently, Rita peels off her all-encompassing cheek and cradles you in her hands. \"C'mon, say something! Insult me; call my ass fat; let me know you're okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light hurt your eyes after so long in the dark; your entire body ached like hell from being flattened; you could barely think straight after so much pain...but you still heard the concern in Rita's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was genuinely worried she'd hurt you. Maybe the rhino-woman wasn't COMPLETELY horrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to croak out, \"You EVER do that again...I'll give you colon cancer.\" You meant it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita's eyes sparkle at your threat. \"EEEEE! HE'S OKAY!\" Her face lunges at you--\" <i>*whap!*</i>--and she cuddles you against her cheek, cooing giddily. \"That was too close...thank frick you're okay, Squirt. I couldn't lose a little escape artist like you! Oh, I'm not sitting on you for a YEAR after that! Maybe longer--you won't have to fear my booty for a LONG time! I'm so sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile despite yourself. Rita genuinely meant that! Maybe things would get better for you. At least you wouldn't have to worry about her sitting on you for a while...<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rita sniffs you...and cringes away gagging. \"Ugh, you need a shower. Hey Lisa, can I borrow your sink for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne scrub-down in the sink later, you'd gotten the stink of rhino-fart off you and were wedged between Rita's ample breasts. All the girls save Lisa were at the dining table, nursing their hangovers. Even Clarice looked under the weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what a hairball feels like?\" the lioness growls, rubbing her temples. \"I knew I overdid the shots in Truth-or-Dare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitch got what she deserved. Rita could have easily eaten you in a drunken stupor last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the kitched slammed open, making everyone jump. Lisa came strolling in, wearing nothing but a pink bathrobe and carrying a plastic container. \"Mornin', ladies! I brought you all something to clear your heads after our WILD night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, sis?\" Kelly asked, sounding even meeker than usual. The younger gator looked horrible--she obviously didn't have the same alcohol tolerance as her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My paton--pattycakes---<i>pat-en-ted</i> hangover cure: humans! Eat a few and you'll be yourselves again in no time!\" Lisa explained, talking over the wails and pleading coming from the plastic box. \"Trust me, works every time. Already chomped a few before you all got up, and I'm already slurrin' less.\" You go pale and instinctively hide deeper in Rita's cleavage. You knew anthros ate humans, and Lisa's appetite went without saying, but seeing her be so <i>casual</i> about it was horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice meows in pain, rubbing her temple. \"Not so loud...and I don't buy it--that reptile liver of yours is like a jet engine, Lisa. You pounded away more booze than any of us; you shouldn't even be walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That..doesn't make sense,\" Kelly mumbled, trying to right her glasses. \"How would eating humans purge the alcohol from our systems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita snorts. \"Is this some weird trick to get us to owe you money? Didn't we set a rule any humans we eat or squish we have to pay for?\" She yelps, covering her eyes. \"Ugh, turn off the sun; it's too bright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I wouldn't do that to ya.These are free--from a friend, ta get the alcohol outta your systems. And hey, even if it doesn't work, ya get some humans fer breakfast! I know that's a treat fer some of ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClairice didn't bother asking. She simply snatched two humans from the box and tossed them in her mouth, swishing a bit before swallowing them whole. She let out a satisfied murr, tracing their path down her throat. \"Ahhh...you always pick the most delicious humans, Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think I can do this in front of Pickles,\" Sue mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take him back to my room, leave him with Pee-Wee for a bit. Would do them good too chat with another human,\" Kelly offered helpfully. \"Besides, you do need to eat some humans sometime Sue; even herbivore anthros eat them to stay healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" the cow mumbles, handing her human over. As Kelly leaves, the heifer gently grabs a human from the box and holds her before her face. \"Sorry, missy. I'll make it quick, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE, NO! DON'T EAT ME! I'LL DO ANYTH--\" the woman's pleading was cut off by Sue gingerly placing her on her bovine tongue and slurping her into her maw. She mooed in delight at the human's flavor before tilting her head back and swallowing. Looking guilty, she patted her plump belly. \"Sorry, little human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was too busy grabbing handfuls of humans to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly came back, eyeing the few humans left in Lisa's box. \"Lisa, you hogged so many of them...Rita, are you going to eat any? Looks like the other girls are already getting over their hangovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the other anthros. It was...true. The women did seem to be coming around after eating a few humans. Rita's quiet \"huh\" showed she noticed it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita hesitated for a long moment, before giving her answer...</span></div></div>",

Humans keep a girl's digestive system healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humor that insect far too much, Rita,\" Clarice said. \"I'd never let a human talk back to me that way. He's just a slave. You give one an inch and they'll walk all over you. It's why my slaves are the most obedient around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita ignored her and turned to her friend. \"Kelly, you mind putting him with Pee-Wee and Pickles while we finish breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL TAKE HIM!\" Lisa volunteered, already barging forward to snatch you. You yelped at the eagerness in her voice and hunger in her eyes. You fell flat on your ass as Rita pulled you backwards, even scooching back her chair to put more distance between her slave and her friend. Luckily for you, Rita had the same reservations that you did about leaving you and Lisa alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that's alright, Lisa. Kelly can take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large alligator looked crestfallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk-tsk-tsk,\" Clarice said, smiling cruelly. \"Now is that any way to treat a friend, Rita? Here Lisa is, nice enough to let you spend the night at her place, taking you to the beach yesterday on her dime, and even offering you a delicacy you rarely get to have, and you can't even trust her with your human? She's your friend. Do you really think she has so little self-control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Rita,\" Lisa said, looking hurt, \"don't you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she doesn't trust you!\" you cried out. \"You have zero self-control! If there are five humans alone in a room with you, you'll eat <i>seventeen of them!</i> Rita, you can't leave me alone with her--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, Squirt,\" Rita snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized your outburst had only made things worse. Lisa looked even sadder, Rita seemed ashamed, and the rest of her friends looked uncomfortable, all except for Clarice, who smiled smugly. You'd played right into her paws. You hated that cat so much. She was pure evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Lisa's puppy dog eyes were just as effective on Rita as yours had been. The rhino sighed. \"Of course I trust you, Lisa,\" she said in a strained voice. \"Please put Squirt with the others. I know you won't eat h--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANKS RITA!\" Lisa said, not bothering to listen to the end of her sentence. You barely got out a plea before the obese alligator had snatched you out of your owner's hands. \"Come on, Squirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RITA! RITA HELP ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour owner only looked sadly at you, torn between wanting to protect you and not wanting to embarrass her friend. She stayed seated and gave you an apologetic shrug as Lisa happily skipped out of the kitchen and into the hall. You prayed Lisa was telling the truth and she'd just put you with the other slaves like she said she would. But just when she was about to go inside Kelly's bedroom, she paused outside the door and uncapped her hand. Her massive face filled your view of vision. You gulped and gave an awkward wave. \"Um... hi? YIPE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were yanked off your feet by a vortex of air as Lisa lowered her snout and sniffed deeply. The only thing that stopped you from flying up and disappearing into one of her nostrils was a lucky grab that let you latch on to one of her fingers. Lisa didn't even notice your plight as she closed her eyes and let out a dreamy sigh at your scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it about your scent, Squirt?\" Lisa asked. She licked her black-painted lips and you noticed the excess of drool in her mouth. A mouth, you noticed, that was inching closer and closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa? LISA!\" you yelled, hoping to get through to her. \"You promised Rita you wouldn't eat me! Remember, she's your friend! She trusts you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hesitated, as if breaking out of a trance. \"Right,\" she murmured. \"I promised... But you're just... so...\" She licked her lips, her eyelids lowered and her mouth came closer again, \"So... <i>irresistible!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISA, STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Yes. Lisa keeps her promise and leaves you with your fellow human slaves. You're safe. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) No. Lisa breaks her promise. She can't resist the opportunity to finally eat you.</span></div></div>",

So much for thinking Rita wasn't <i>all</i> bad. Not a half hour after promising to spare you the future indignity of being plastered under her ass, here she was, willing to scarf down humans right in front of you. Unlike Lisa, you knew humans weren't a mainstay of Rita's diet. However, the only reason for that was because she was too poor to afford humans regularly as food. Whenever there was a special occasion, or her friends were treating, Rita would happily indulge in some human cuisine. Sure she'd threatened to eat you in the past during your many escape attempts, but she'd never actually tried it on purpose. The closest she got was accidentally knocking you into her ramen noodles once. She'd been listening to music and hadn't heard your screams over the blare of her headphones. It'd taken all your strength to pull yourself free of the bowl before you found yourself joining the noodles in her stomach. The thing that had horrified you most of all though was Rita's obvious satisfaction as she ate, savoring the unique taste of the ramen as she devoured it. Once you were out, however, she was disappointed, saying that it'd lost its flavor. After that close call, you'd wisely decided never to mention the experience to her, worried what she'd do if she found out you were the source of that delicious taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was too hungover to even give you an apologetic look as she reached into Lisa's human bin and rummaged around. You watched in horror as her thick gray fingers chased whatever human was in reach, finally landing on a young man around your age who tripped and found himself plucked from his enclosure. Rita raised him in front of her mouth and ran her tongue over her lips. You felt sick as you realized how much she was looking forward to this. She seemed oblivious to her tiny victim's pleas for mercy, or your disgusted look. She stuck out her tongue and plopped the little man on it. He had just enough time to let out one last audible scream for help before she slurped him into her drooling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MmmmMMMHHHHMMMM!\" Rita squealed pleasantly. She didn't swallow him right away. She took the time to close her eyes and savor the tiny man's taste, sucking on him like a piece of candy. She only became self-conscious of her behavior after a small dribble of drool escaped the corner of her mouth. She opened her eyes to make sure no one had seen when she realized all eyes were on her. Kelly and Sue looked shocked. Lisa was fighting to hold back her laughter, while Clarice was looking at her with clear contempt and mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please,\" the lioness said. \"Continue making love to that human in your mouth. It's not at all disgusting and inappropriate to do in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita blushed as she wiped the drool off her chin and--her enjoyment prematurely ended--gulped her human snack down guiltily. It was only now she seemed to remember you'd been watching her the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked. You stared at her in open disgust. \"What?\" she repeated defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that!\" Rita said. \"Anthros have been eating humans for as long as the two races have coexisted. It's the law of nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing natural about what you were doing,\" Clarice said. \"I know humans are a delicacy you can scarcely afford, Rita, but that's no reason to act like an animal when you finally get the chance to indulge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Hairball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, it's alright, Rita,\" Lisa said sympathetically. \"I know when I find a human who's tastier than I expected, I make sure to get every ounce of flavor out of them before gulping them down. Some humans just have a certain taste that drives me wild. Even the scent of them makes me slobber.\" As she said this, you noticed her eyes were pointedly fixed on your miniscule body. This morning was just a terrible reminder--no matter how kindly Rita treated you--you were still in the most vulnerable position on the food chain. Rita noticed where her friend's gaze was locked on too and gave a pointed cough to catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, so anyway,\" Lisa said, \"what do you gals want to do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go swimming again,\" Rita said. \"I always enjoy a day at the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Ooh!\" Sue said, perking up. \"I saw them setting up a carnival yesterday! Why don't we go? There will be games and rides--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And fried food,\" Lisa said, drooling. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much as I dislike agreeing with Rita,\" Clarice said, \"I'd much rather work on my tan than surround myself with carnies.\" Nobody voiced the obvious question of how someone covered in fur could even work on their tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's two against two,\" Lisa said. \"Sis, you're the tie-breaker. Where do you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly thought for a second before answering. Which did she pick?</span></div></div>",

And that WAS the dare, right Rita?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue blinks, sharing a worried look with Kelly. \"Eat..?\" they chorus. It looked like they were finally catching onto what Clairice was doing...but they were too drunk, or to scared of her bullying, to try and stop her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita looks up and blinks, her memory coming back. \"Oh, right!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Far and away in the heart of the Evian Empire, was a monolithic structure made of marble. It had great towers and halls and gardens of the most exotic sort of flowers. The city was encamped in a forest of great towering pines, flanked from both sides by the great mountains of Draconder. A glistening all encompassing sea on it\u2019s west and mountains that rumored to imprison the titans to the east. This pure ivory monument surrounded by nature\u2019s bounty was Wilksbourogh. The Capital City of the dragons of the Evian Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an eccentric society of draconians. Not for the taking of hominids, particularly humans, as thralls. But rather the large and gluttonous dragons that resided there. There were slender drakes and dragonesses sure, but the majority of them and the whole of the royal family were comprised of hyper fat, hyper voluptuous, macro like dragons, so large they should be immobile, but always manage to carry their weight with not only finesses, but lack of effort, as if they were completely unhindered by their own massive bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese dragons were lead by Queen Karthio, a dragonness both of great stature and great girth. The mighty Queen's ruby red scales glimmered in the light due to constant buffing and polishing by her many servants, her head endowed with silver horns that were almost reflective, a natural crown for the Queen. There was plenty to be polished, as her tremendous gut heavily rested against the floor, flanks expanding beyond the reach of her silver claws, even while standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this particular evening she was lounging in the Queen's gazebo. An elaborate shelter in the upper garden, made of marble and dressed with grand tapestries.<br>\r\nBeside her lounged two of her daughters and the Captain of the Guard. At her left was Roal,the youngest of her expansive royal family. The dumpling shaped dragon was hands down nothing more than a royal brat. She was also the smallest of the three, only being able to reach his Mother's shoulders at the very top of her horns. This, combined with her pastel blue scales and pink belly and wings, made Roal the least respected by the rest of his family. This lack of respect angered the young dragon, and was the reason for her current physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Marian the Girthy to her west. Many would mistake her with her green scales as a rolling green hillside if she lounged about in the middle of a field, easily the largest dragon in the kingdom; her torso was wider than the Queen's wingspan! The Queen\u2019s massive daughter constantly sloshed and shook with the smallest of movements. It\u2019s been years since her log like tail has ever left the ground without any assistance. The soft wings that were folded against her bulging arching back were no more than another limb to store fat. Not that Marian cared at all, her body was a clear sign that the only thing on her mind was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entertained themselves by eating and jibbering to one another at length about things that were only important to those who were wealthy and powerful enough to make such frivolous shallow topics such a priority. These topics were mostly constructed from rumors, gloating, and over inflated stories of grandeur that resulted in jowls jiggling in laughter. The Queen\u2019s guests drank from ancient goblets of gold filled to the brim with the finest wine and ate thick chunks of marbled ham from platters of pure silver; their thralls made great efforts to make sure their patrons never got a chance to see the bottom of either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, there came a pause in the conversation where in the Queen tapped her shiny claws against the cool floor to get everyone's attention. Except Marian, who continuously stuffed her swollen face with food, moaning out \u201cMmoooaarrrhh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends, Family, I have an important announcement.\" The Queen said as she scratched her plump cheeks. \"As you all know, my darling daughters, the pride and joys of my life, are having there birthdays in the following month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen Karthio paused to allow the guests to clap for her daughters, which was customary. Roal greatly inhaled the applause, while Marian simply blushed and smiled thinly before going back to eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such,\" The Queen continued. \"Because I am just so terrible at waiting to give presents, I have arranged for my daughters Roal and Marian to both receive their first human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests applauded again, louder this time. A dragon getting their first human slave was one of the important marks of growing up in this dragon high society. Roal's jaw was gape, while Marian actually stopped eating to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mother!\" Roal squealed with delight. :This has got to be the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However.\" Queen Karthio silenced her daughter. \"There are some conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of conditions?\" The whole table of guests looked over to see Marian talk more then just the word \"More\" which was actually very rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, Marian. Although this is your present, this is also a test. A test in parenting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parenting?\" The two daughters asked at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see, when I depart from this Earth, I want to make sure that my legacy will live on in you, my children, and your legacy to live on in your children. Yet the two of you have showed no maternal instincts towards anyone, which concerns me. So, although I am granting you a human slave, the slave you will get will be a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispered snickers bubbled out from the guests in response to this ludicrous game the Queen was playing on her children. \"What!?\" Roal roared, her jowls jiggling in fury. \"But mom--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No 'buts' young lady!\" Karthio snapped. \"Before you can ever get married, have a life with another dragon, and raise kids of your own, you must test yourself weather or not your ready for it yet. The two of you will each receive a child human. They will care for you, and you will care for them. Feed them, nurture them, help them. For the next month the two of you are temporary mothers. If i see that you raised the human well, you may have a fully grown slave. If not, you will wait untill you are older. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" Roal and Marian said at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Sure, being a pet was a cloud short of silver linings, but at least you knew had to read; even at an early age, you had the means to know the dragons\u2019 government enough to parry your way by the time you were of legal age. Any other adult would\u2019ve likely been subjected to living a reptilian\u2019s foot so often that they\u2019d accept it in life and move on, but you? You had resources. Intel to at least have a chance to reason your way into some semblance of a normal life, or as much as a life living at the heels of fire-breathing titans could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of which you wouldn\u2019t even be able to use till you were thirty, likely by some moron getting their gum stuck in a filing machines, and even bigger ones who knew your age only from a typing error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your head cradled in your knees, the clerk grunting in satisfaction as your pesky ranting was finished your only hope...no, don\u2019t say that anymore. Wacky miracle was to be bought on the cheap, that the next potential buyer would see you for your strong build and smarts for what they were, and realize they could have a decent enough pet at the fraction of a price for half the actual cost. Every tinkle of the bell you\u2019d hear from the door, you\u2019d seize up, tense at the thought of whether the next customer\u2019s footfalls would be the lumbering of a massive adult\u2019s or the pitter-patter of some lazy parent\u2019s snot-nosed kids searching for a new playmate to dress-up, or force you to live in a dollhouse, probably even flush you down the toilet for fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[i]Ting-a-ling![/i]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor timing to picture that last thought, the air calcifying in your lungs, but it escapes in relief as the entire human store rattles at who, so immense that it\u2019s almost a [i}what[/i], enters. A few humans go silent, hiding in their cages to keep from being seen, but a select few clamor for attention, some desperate to see the world outside their cages, or legitimately excited to have a host to attend to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe mother doesn\u2019t trust us for the adults we are.\u201d One of them argues. \u201cI\u2019ve had classmates back in school with adult humans, and she forces us to get a child!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing their banter, you\u2019re up and amongst the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, I\u2019M LEGALLY A CHILD!!!\u201d You holler, throwing an arm out and waving frantically towards the massive overabundance of green that rolls into store and, with the gods finally settling in their laughter and giving you some slack for once, enters the children\u2019s section. \u201cI\u2019M AN ADULT FOR CHEAP!!! I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the sound of a claw full of cheese-puffs rips through the child\u2019s section, and any of the minority begging for attention is halved again. Coming down the aisle, coming down to <i>you,</i> is the all-known gluttony and enormity of the royal daughter herself, Marian, likely accompanied by her pompous fatty of a sister by the sound of the other voice, as the prior\u2019s mouth is too occupied glutting her impossibly fat frame to even more monstrous proportions. The aisle, as sparsely placed as it is to accommodate the decadent populace of its customers, is compromised by the great plateau that is Marian\u2019s behind as her bulging flanks are snugly wedged by the deceptively wide passage, her stomach bouncing atop her legs in a pronounced cascade of scale-armored rolls and blubber, rubbing against the floor with no cover to protect it from the dirty linoleum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere presence of the quasi-mountain of a dragon girl extinguishes every voice screaming to be taken, and as Marian\u2019s vaguely lucid eyes narrow in on the partitions near where yours is, you hastily take off your shoes and kneel down into their soles, putting on a mediocre impression of a child, or at best, a dwarfish man. Marian\u2019s quaking movements continue, the cage rattling louder as you sit in sweaty hope that the moving landmass of green just passes you without a second thought, but when her scales swipe their way into your visibility, it\u2019s the tip of her snout, her eyes observing you with mere bristles of intelligence that sparks occasionally, a burning lightbulb that only twitches on and off with dying light, but with scrutiny that\u2019s drilling through the bones of your skull, studying your person by outward impressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...\u201d She speaks. Even her voice sounds sluggish, to heavy for her to get out. \u201cThis kid here looks like a grown up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOOOOO!!!\u201d You squeal in your best child voice, but with such little practice, you just screech in a high register. \u201cME A <i>CHILD!</i>ME MAKE POOPIES IN MY PANTS, MOMMY!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA grown up?\u201d Roal climbs onto her sister\u2019s shoulder to see for herself, pushing her sister\u2019s head aside. \u201cHey, you\u2019re right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\u201d You wail even louder. \u201cME A WITTLE <i><b>BABY!!!</b></i> ME NOT A VICTIM OF BEAUWACWACY, ME A WITTLE BITTY BABY!!! <i><b>WAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!</b></i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

At first, her expression, along with her sister Roal's, unreadable, and you made the mistake of allowing the smallest glimmers of hope reach into your soul. Perhaps, as bad as it was, confirmed by the rather offended glances you were getting from the other human children in the store, they bought the act. Then the smaller of the royal daughters fell off from her perch on her sister's shoulder flab onto the floor, making the whole section shake and quake, laughing uncontrollably on the linoleum and a few tears welling from her eyes. Even Marian smiled and laughed, slow and low like a baritone orchestra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I like this one.\" The mass of scaled lard began to bend down for her puffy appendages to grasp onto your cage, the tiny bit of unfulfilled hope mercilessly evacuating your spirit. You were lifted up into the air high enough for your body to be level with Marian's eyes. She dumped the last bits of cheese flavored corn meal into her drooling maw so that she could focus attention on solely you, something so rare from a creature who almost always had nothing on her mind but her next meal. \"He makes me laugh.\" With that said, she then began the effort to readjust her blobular body around so that she may exit the children's section with you in tow to the cash register, something difficult due to how tight she was packed into the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself in a desperate mess, bones shaking and teeth chattering in fear. This was it. This was really happening. Still, you were not ready to give up just yet. With the intelligence you had been granted, you moved on from deception towards sycophancy. You turn yourself to Roal, still laughing hard but slowly getting up from the floor to avoid being smothered by her sister's bubber. You fall to your knees so quickly they scrape themselves on the floor of your cage, stammering out an apology as you bowed your head. \u201cP-please forgive me, my princess, I was just-\u201d That was all you could get out before your soon to be co-master spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, no, don't you dare apologize! That was the best laugh I had in a long, LONG time. It's a damn good thing that we found you, too, else we would have been stuck with some munchkin.\" She glanced over to some of the pint-sized tykes on each side of her, almost all of them silent. \"They're cute...but I think I would do well with them. Better to have an adult, much more sturdy from what my mom always boasts about.\" You were about to change your tactics again, still stubbornly clinging to the idea that you could get out of this mess before you the ear-piercing sound of metal warping erupted from behind you. You turned to address the cacophony to see Marian's pudgy hand clench the gate of your cage like paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crumpled up bit of stainless steel was ripped from the frame of the cage and thrown aside to some far off section of the store, reaching its destination amongst the tops of other cages in the teenager's section. Marian then shoved the rest of her arm into your sanctuary, her blubbery digits wrapping around your fear stricken body as she violently kidnapped you from your 'home'. Once you departed the metal box, it too was discarded like trash, and you found yourself sitting on her open palm just below her snout. \"What's your name?\" She addressed you, opening up a package of snack cookies that seemed to materialize from thin air with her free hand. \"You humans do have names, right? I don't have to give you one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed a wad of saliva that was building up at the back of your mouth nervously before answering her. \"U-Uh...HQ-82, ma'am...\" Marian continued to stare down at you expectantly, to which you then realized that she meant your given name, not your slave identification. You almost forgot that you even had one. \"It's D-D-Donat, m-my princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Doughnut.\" She smiled before inhaling her carton of cookies past her teeth and into her awaiting throat. She had the common decency to try and stifle the wet belch that cake soon after, but you were still knocked back by the sickly sweet wind. \u201cHere, let me put you someplace more comfy.\u201d Her fat fingers soon wrapped themselves around your diminutive form yet again, and when you were released you found yourself deposited...</span></div></div>",

She was short for an anthro, only 7-feet-tall. She had red eyes and her fur was completely white, except for her dyed-orange hair, the color of which, combined with its spiky style that stood straight in the air (thanks to several industrial-size cans of hairspray) made it look like her head was on fire. She wore a black, leather jacket with holes cut in the back for her massive wings to stick out, and long fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood Queen, or BQ to her friends, or if you were going by her real-name--which, after a few choice death threats, you never did--Bonnie, was your mistress. Well, more accurately she was one of your mistresses. She and her mates in her amateur death metal band, the Killer Sirens, had pooled their funds together to buy a human slave to act as their roadie, and, unfortunately for you, you were the only one they chose. Blood Queen was the leader singer of the band, though with her high, screechy voice, you were sure you'd go deaf from her singing one day, not that you'd ever tell her that. As a mistress, she was a total tyrant, thinking your status as a slave meant you shouldn't have a moment of free time, and she would fill that time whether that meant you waiting on her on hand-and-foot or degrading yourself for her amusement. Giving her particularly rank feet a massage stood out in your mind. No task was too hard or too humiliating for you to perform in her mind. Refusal was met with harsh punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled to load everything into the bus from their old house, one of your other mistresses looked up from the poetry book she was reading on the porch. Her name was Melancholy (real name: Melody), a full-figured, 10-foot-tall black cat anthro with sapphire-colored eyes. She wasn't exactly thin, but she wasn't exactly what you'd consider fat either. Voluptuous would probably be the appropriate term. She wore a purple, gothic dress and had long white hair. She was the organ player and provided back-up vocals. In fact, her voice was so much better than BQ's, you wondered why she wasn't the lead singer. But then again, death metal had never been your genre, especially not the quasi-goth/punk kind they did... That probably wasn't the actual name of the genre, you weren't up on the lingo, again, it had never been your preference and it's not like they'd give you time to look it up with your new mistresses working you ragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelancholy seemed to be the nicest of your new mistresses, or, at least, the only one who didn't see the point in working you to death or treating you like garbage after paying good money for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you help him, BQ?\" Melancholy asked her band mate in her soothing voice. \"He looks like he's going to die carrying all that wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were grateful for the attempt at help, but BQ laughed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing the work yourself defeats the purpose of having a roadie, Mel! I'm not gonna waste my time with that, not when we're finally gonna make the big time playing gigs in the Dark Lands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at the name. The Dark Lands were said to be home to the creepiest, most depraved and evil anthros imaginable. While there were at least a couple laws that provided certain rights and protection to human slaves locally, in the Dark Lands there were no rules. And you, poor, doomed soul that you were, were going to be accompanying them to that terrible place as they took their act on the road. When you found out where you were heading you'd tried to make a break for it, only for Blood Queen to fly out, find you, and take you back to their house for some punishment. Melancholy had sat the punishment out and BQ said she was too tired from searching for you to do it herself, so she left the punishment to her two other band mates--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike! Ob!\" BQ called out, seeing her friends approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the names, whirled around, and nearly dropped the speaker you were carrying in fear. At 13-feet-tall, the two anthro ladies were literal behemoths. Spike was a dragoness with crimson scales, two black horns protruded on both sides of her head, and her black hair was in a Mohawk. She was positively shredded, her muscles were displayed by a black shirt that was several sizes too small and with its sleeves ripped off, exposing her muscled arms and impressive six-pack. Her jeans were purposefully ripped at the knees. Spike was the guitarist of the group. She staggered as she walked, obviously drunk already. You gulped. Spike treated you like trash when she was drunk... she also did it while she was sober, but for some reason she was less creative in tortures then. Nearly every day since your purchase, she tormented or humiliated you in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still not done, Roadie?\" Spike slurred. \"I wanted to be ready to hit the road by the time we got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" BQ said. \"He's such a slacker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike flashed a row of razor-sharp fangs. \"Maybe I can light a fire under his ass?\" She belched up a fireball that missed your feet by inches and set you working even harder. \"There we go, that's what we're looking for. Ain't that right, Ob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOb (short for Oubliette) only nodded, staring at you with her bulging yellow eyes, not helped by the excessive eye shadow she wore. Out of all of them, she scared you the most. She was a fox anthro who'd dyed all her fur a shade of neon green except for her white underbelly, and her black hair with streaks of violet. She wore a black top with a skull and crossbones on it, but it was stretched so tight across her chest, you were amazed it didn't snap under the pressure of her ample bosom. It also exposed an ample amount of cleavage. She wore a plaid, red and black skirt with fishnet stockings. While BQ was fairly chunky, Ob was completely obese. Her broad stomach was almost a perfect sphere, and it was so expansive it could easily fit three of you in there. She was the drummer of the group, and every time you saw her, she was always stuffing food past her black-painted lips, seemingly pulled from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what terrified you most about her: her appetite. Sure she would participate in the humiliations BQ and Spike dished out on you, but it was the constant growling of her stomach whenever you were near that scared you beyond reason. She'd never spoken a word to you, but she always seemed to pop up behind you without a sound, looking at you as if you were the last slice of pizza she wanted to snatch up before someone else did. That look was still there when she saw you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Blood Queen's tyrannical orders, Spike's cruel pranks, and Oubliette's insatiable hunger, you dreaded the prospect of accompanying them to the Dark Lands, where your fate would be in their hands. Maybe Melancholy would be enough of a calming influence... but some you doubted it. You looked wistfully down the road, imagining making another break for it, but you knew it would be pointless. Soon the bus was loaded up and your mistresses were ready to go. Head hung low, you boarded the bus that would most likely spell your doom.</span></div></div>",

Behind the driver's seat was a kitchen area and a bedroom area with a bathroom in-between. Sliding partitions could provide some privacy for the band members... for a given value of privacy. Thin black walls didn't exactly block out much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't afford a professional chauffer so BQ sat in the driver's seat. Given her small size relative to her friends, she worked the pedals with two long stilts. The vampire bat drove like a psycho and every time you boarded the bus you feared for your life even more than usual. You gladly would've volunteered to act as their driver, for no other reason than to avoid spending time in the back with Spike and Ob, but BQ didn't trust you with her \"precious baby.\" As you walked past her, she was cursing at her \"precious baby\" under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on you stupid hunk of junk,\" BQ muttered as she turned the key in the ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour bus was notoriously temperamental. Unsurprising considering the old rust bucket looked like it'd been built several centuries ago and it spent most of its time hauling several tons worth of musical instruments and musicians from gig to gig. Secretly you prayed for the engine to never start. The tour bus finally breaking down might be your only way to avoid going to the Dark Lands. Unfortunately, like most of your prayers lately, it went ignored. The engine gave a jolt and roared to life. The bus lurched forward and you were sent tumbling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly was sitting in a chair by the window reading a doorstopper of a book. The seat opposite her was occupied by her suitcase. Spike and Ob were seated on the other side of the bus from her in a semi-circle booth in the kitchen area. Both of them were so massive that they each took up a side to themselves, leaving only a little sliver of leather available. The dragoness was already chugging a fresh beer and the vixen was stuffing fistfuls of potato chips into her mouth from a bag the size of a sack. You felt her bulging yellow eyes on you and shivered. Spike noticed your fear and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down and take a load off, Roadie! There's a seat right here!\" Spike patted the thin space between her and Ob and you immediately turned around to face Melly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Melancholy, may I <i>please</i> sit in that chair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently puppy dog eyes can even work on a cat, since, after a long silence, she sighed and said, \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so relieved that you didn't even mind nearly breaking your back lifting her suitcase off the chair and planting it on the floor. You heaved a sigh of relief as you sat down. A few minutes of pleasant boredom passed as you watched the scenery pass by. You caught a good look at the book in Melly's hands: a dusty tome as big as a phonebook that looked like it belonged in either a museum or a haunted house. Then the pleasant boredom just became regular boredom. Melly was obviously engrossed in her book. Your curiosity got the better of you and it was then you asked the seemingly innocuous words that would change your life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spell book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others heard her and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Melly,\" Blood Queen called from the driver's seat, \"I like the occult as much as anyone, but don't tell me you actually <i>believe</i> in magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" Melly said boredly. \"After all, I've done some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said it so casually that everyone laughed even louder and harder. Even you couldn't help but giggle, though you quickly shut up when Melly glared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Mel, I always thought you were the straight man in this group,\" BQ said. She swerved to avoid something on the road--another car, from the blaring horn--and screeched like the bat she was. \"RIGHT-OF-WAY, ASSHOLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. I've done magic in the past. Nothing major, but enough to see if it's for real. I want to incorporate it into our shows to save us money on practical effects during our shows. I've already levitated some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" BQ asked. \"Prove it. Do some magic. Levitate something right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is unpredictable,\" Melly said, sounding uncertain for the first time. \"I don't want to make a mistake and destroy something valuable--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then test it out on the roadie!\" Spike chipped in. \"He's the least valuable thing here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood Queen snickered. \"Sure, why not? Try out your non-existent levitation spell on him. I'm game. How about you Ob?\" The vixen looked at you and shrugged. \"See? It's decided!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you sputtered. \"You're, uh--you're joking right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so scared, roadie?\" Melly asked coldly. \"You don't believe in magic either, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really regretting asking her about her book now. You were regretting laughing at her claims of magic even more. Apparently she took it personally. You didn't get time to argue against her though, as she pointed a claw at you and started reading from the book. You tried to tell yourself that nothing would happen, that there was no such thing as magic, and the weird tingling spreading over your body was just your imagination. You kept telling yourself that as Melancholy's voice raised in volume, growing louder and louder until she finished in an echoing crescendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Melancholy's magic is a success and you levitate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The spell goes horribly wrong and you end up shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The spell goes horribly wrong in some other entertaining and implausible way!</span></div></div>",

Fast. <br>\r\nSpike yelps.<br>\r\nOb splutters something you don\u2019t hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear and vertigo clamp down and everything goes black, but you hear one thing loud and clear before you go under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Melly\u2019s voice, and one word. <br>\r\n\u201cOops\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is pounding, everything hurts, and you feel like you got hit by a truck. Whatever Melly\u2019s spell did\u2014it sure as hell didn\u2019t levitate you\u2014it did a number on you. Sitting up with a groan, you rub your temples until the pain dulls to something bearable and the spots clear from behind your eyelids. You open your eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAAAAAAHHHHH!\u201d</i> <br>\r\nYou flatten against the floor, babbling in terror and cringe away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour huge, terrifying <i>somethings</i> loomed over you like shadows of death itself. Inescapable, all-encompassing; unholy. This had to be Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things spoke. In Spike\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Roadie\u2019s alive at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble back and hit your head on\u2026a glass wall? You look back to behold a <i>giant soda bottle</i>. You look around, horror dawning. There was a pile of magazines, an ashtray, and the bag of chips Spike had been eating\u2014you look at the \u201cfloor\u201d and find it\u2019s the table in the bus\u2019 kitchen--suddenly gigantic. Just like your four mistresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t hell. It was WORSE: the tour bus, and you were bug-sized.<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!\u201d You wail, embarrassed at how squeaky your voice sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelly shrank you, duh,\u201d BQ answered, rolling her eyes. The bat gave her bandmate a look. \u201cTurns out magic is real after all\u2026but easy to screw up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelancholy hissed. \u201cIs \u2018I was wrong\u2019 so hard to say, Miss Skeptic?\u201d She looks at you and purrs. \u201cYour proof is right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it DIDN\u2019T WORK,\u201d Ob countered. \u201cHe was supposed to float, and he shrank. Either magic doesn\u2019t work, or you can\u2019t read that creepy book of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly bared her fangs. \u201cIt just takes practice. You want to join Roadie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can take me, kitty-cat?\u201d Ob growls, taking a boxing stance. The two titans look ready to throw down--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBQ's hand slammed down on the table, very close to you. The sound is like a cannon shot, the impact bone-shaking. \u201cGirls! Simmer down, we\u2019re adults. We have something more important to worry about: how to deal with Roadie. Because of that spell, he\u2019s of no use, unless we perform for an anthill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe paid good money for our human; we can\u2019t just let him go to waste,\u201d Ob pointed out. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t just get rid of him. Protecting investments and whatnot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s even more useless now than before!\u201d BQ objected.. \u201cLook at him, he\u2019s the size of a grain of rice! It\u2019s best we just eat him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered and tried to babble out a plea for mercy, but the quartet ignored you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeen a while since I ate a human,\u201d Spike muses, fanged tongue licking her scaly lips. \u201cLast time was when I was a kid\u2026and hey, dragons gotta have some fresh meat now and again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOb\u2019s hands slapped her hips. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of the really big anthros\u2014like, hundred feet or so--like to sit on humans. Always wanted to try that\u2026sound nice, Roadie? You wanna be under a big foxy booty? Wonder if he\u2019ll just go splat, or survive a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly meowed, leaning closer. Her giant feline face is inches from yours, filling your view. \u201cGirls\u2026he\u2019s kind of cute at this size, I\u2026I wanna cuddle him! Besides, maybe I can undo the spell and get him back to normal. Unless we decide to keep him like this for good, of course. I can look after him, since he\u2019s no use for road work like this. You wanna be Melly\u2019s pet, sweetie?\u201d She added, giving you a sweet smile totally at odds with her stage name and usual demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026you say you can change him back?\u201d BQ asked, stroking her chin and eyeing you like a broken clock she was on the fence about fixing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Depends on what went wrong with the spell. Once I figure that out, then I\u2019ll know if the shrinkage is permanent or not. If it is, then one of you can have him. But until then\u2026I say let me keep him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wait, though?\u201d Spike asked, looking at you hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is whimper. What would these sadistic women do to you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew going into the Dark Lands was a death sentence but you didn't expect it to kill you so fast! In the space of several seconds after shrinking two of your owners expressed a desire to eat you, one of them to sit on you, and only one wanted to spare your life merely to keep you as a pet. How you longed for a few hours ago when you didn't think your situation could get any worse. Back before you were the size of a potato chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" BQ said, raising her voice above her fellow band mates. \"I'm the leader and I've come to a decision!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Spike growled. \"We all pitched in for him, we should all get a vote--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think anyone other than you is going to vote in favor of you eating him?\" BQ asked. The dragoness crossed her arms and huffed, literally letting off some steam from her nostrils. \"That's what I thought,\" the vampire bat said smugly. \"Look, girls, I get it. Roadie's shrinking accident has opened up a world of possibilities now that he's even more worthless than usual. If I'm being honest, I wouldn't mind a small snack myself.\" Her eyes fell onto your miniscule form and her stomach audibly growled. It took visible effort for her to get back on track. \"But even a puny runt like this was a significant investment, and eating him, or crushing him, or torturing him in any way--while fucking hilarious--would also mean we blew our money on a one-time-play-session, and I'm not in the habit of wasting money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dared yourself to hope. BQ's cheapskate tendencies have caused you more than a little turmoil over the course of your servitude but now it looked like it might actually save your life. Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we need a slave more than we need a snack or a toy, so until Melly says he's stuck like this, she'll be the one to keep an eye on him. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike and Ob muttered, \"Fine,\" like a pair of sullen teenagers who weren't getting a new phone and BQ handed you over to Melancholy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Mel. Work your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelancholy couldn't stop herself from letting out a purr of happiness. A smile lit up her face and you were genuinely surprised to see it there. She always seemed so cold and aloof. Apparently pathetic things were cute in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Bonnie! You won't regret this!\" You gasped as she raised you to her face and began rubbing you against her cheek affectionately, cuddling you aggressively. \"Oh, he's so widdle and cuuuuuuuute! I just wanna pway wif him fowevah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of Pete,\" BQ growled. \"Don't grow getting attached to him now! He's a slave, not a pet. I bought him so a human would take care of me, not the other way around. The second you say you can't turn him back, his ass is grass. Heck, if I even catch you playing with him instead of working on a cure, I'll eat him myself! You hear me, Pussy Cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly hissed and spat at the hated nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes. Now, enough distractions. Thanks to that little shrimp, we're behind schedule and I'm gonna have to drive all night to make up the time! So if one of you screws something up, keep it to yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we ever make her leader?\" Spike muttered as she watched her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOb shrugged. \"Cause she owns the bus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the dragoness said, scratching her shredded stomach. She looked at you regretfully. \"Oh well. Looks like human isn't back on the menu... at the moment,\" she said, flashing her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Melly confided in you as she walked to the rooms in the back, her suitcase in her other hand. \"I won't let any of those big brutes harm a widdle hair on your pwecious, widdle head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Melancholy!\" you said loudly, hoping to talk some sense into her. \"You need to change me back! They'll kill me otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they won't, my little Roadie. Cause they'd have to get through me first.\" Her declaration did not inspire as much confidence in her as she thought. \"Now, let's get you out of those clothes and into something more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=== Five Minutes Later ===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so degrading,\" you muttered as you inspected yourself in the mirror. Apparently Melly hadn't just packed clothes for the trip. Inside the very suitcase you'd be forced to move to sit across from her was a huge dollhouse designed like a gothic manor, complete with fully dressed, eerie-faced dolls that looked like they could star in a horror movie. She'd removed the black, stuffy, Victorian-esque suit off of one of them and hastily put it onto you. You looked like a microscopic butler. Despite your reduced size, they were still small and tight on you, coming up past your knees and wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As if I don't have enough to worry about,</i> you thought bitterly, <i>now I need to be afraid these dolls will come to life when I sleep and murder me for taking their friends clothes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fits perfect!\" Melly squealed, seeing you dressed up for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face-palmed. \"Ms. Melancholy,\" you said, trying to be patient, \"you need to focus. You need to turn me back so I can get back to work.\" Man, you never thought that'd be a sentence you'd willingly utter in your life. \"Can we please start looking for a cure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need to start looking through that dusty spellbook right away, do we?\" Melancholy said playfully. \"Surely we have plenty of time for one or two games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a side to Melly you'd never seen before. Sure, she seemed \"nicer\" than your other mistresses--not that she'd ever had to try particularly hard there--but she definitely never gave off a \"warm hugs and kisses\" kind of vibe. She always seemed so dark and serious, and now, the one time you needed her to be stoic and in control, she wanted to play with you like you were her pet. You needed to convince her otherwise. Blood Queen's warning was still fresh in your mind. If she caught Melly playing with you instead of working on a cure, she'd eat you without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you convince Melancholy to start researching a cure or will she play some \"games\" with you?</span></div></div>",

Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug and play around with your uniform a few more times in the mirror, keeping your eyes exercised for any gaps of skin that could be noticeable on a dark summer night, and grin in satisfaction. It\u2019d be a good night, you could feel. Yes, Iris would be pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning over your mental checklist one last time, double checking that your uniform, mind, and body were all up to the test, you give a triumphant nod and run over to the balcony of your manor\u2019s bedroom; indeed, probably a human from the ancient times would\u2019ve envied a man to possess enough expensive jewelry, housing, and furniture to be bored of, and especially any of the rare, <i>rare</i> humans living near extinction today would have slaughtered to sleep in a bed as big as yours was; to think it was all due to the generosity of an anthro, of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you needed them, really, just the fact that they were all marks of approval. Blessings from a goddess, one of the few anthros alive who deserved to call themselves such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nighttime\u2019s darkness bleeds into the canopy of Iris\u2019s tent, the living space illuminated by candles periodically hung from the supporting poles. The fruit bat woman\u2019s home had flair to match hers onstage; plenty of colorful, flowing blankets that curtained her bed, bottles of doctor good everywhere that hung on poles, and <i>tons</i> of mirrors, giving her every possible chance she\u2019d desire to mirth over her own beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and speaking of, your goddess was busy abusing her most favorite one. That is, her <i>only</i> one, as of now, and likely due to succumb the fate of many others that\u2019d been abandoned before in the dirt, tangled amongst articles of clothing that couldn\u2019t match the rate of her nightly feasting. It\u2019s not to say Iris was ever a thin woman before you and her met; heck, had she been as large as you were, she would\u2019ve clocked in a good three hundred pounds, maybe <i>six</i> hundred several months after when the profits of her shows allowed her to double in on her gluttony, but after her appetite finally pulled the bottom brick, when the obtusely round fruit-bat lady you knew today really began to take form, she blew up at a rate that no scale or medical book could compare her weight to, any skeleton or definition beneath her globular physique \u201creduced\u201d to but a forever inflating balloon with but four obscenely obese limbs to give her any remaining form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbnormally wide, stretching shoulders and arms accommodated her towering stature, dwarving even most of the fattest anthros that you\u2019d seen in her audiences, but her vertical build never drew the scale of hips that outmatched what her hands could reach, bloated buttocks so large that they were always visible in her form, regardless of where she was facing, but were always curtained in front by a stomach so immense that it always mashed generously on wherever her feet stood, too heavy to lift from its expansive perch on the ground without several strongmen to keep it carried, yet structured underneath by enough muscle (or food, in many cases) that it surged off of her in a pronounced ball as opposed to sag around in a shapeless mass, thick, meaty rolls sitting on her hips while her ever-abundant bosom rested comfortably on its massive perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a burgundy shawl wrapped to keep her breasts contained, a toga-like fashion of blankets that clothed what little of her legs she could reach, and a silken cap which a river of wavy brown hair drooped from its rear, black pointed ears poking through slits cut into the fabric, all Iris had left to do was stretch and work our her mouth, her maw vaguely akin to a wolf\u2019s that was shrouded by pitch black fur. At the joint of your door squeaking slightly, one of her ears swiveled your way, and she went still before craning her head towards your little enclosure. Wringing out her flabby arms, her leathery wings flaring out briefly, she lumbered over to your corner, her feet landing in large, thunderous quakes that tested the nails and walls keeping your house together. A fearful premonition to some, but you welcomed it now, having attributed it to the fact that she was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling that smile that\u2019d emptied out so many others\u2019 wallets before, Iris observed you with eyes so shiny and green that even you were convinced that she truly had the power to stare into your and see your thoughts, soul, and whatever lay between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and an evening to you, my little human.\u201d She doted, her rich, yet serene voice as well-paying as being given a swimming pool by the hour. \u201cI trust you\u2019re ready for tonight\u2019s show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod so vigorously that your neck hurts, and she snickers before offering a hand close to the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Be wary, our dinners rely on your judgement tonight.\u201d She warns, but not in an intimidating tone; she teasingly licks her sharp fangs, fully aware of how much you adored seeing her extra-fattened figure every morning. You obediently leap onto her palm and allow her to carry you to the window of her tent, a cord tied to the rung that leads outside, into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTa-Ta, my little dear!\u201d She bids with a polite wave of her fingers, and as she rotates to presume her work, you flail your arm about to wave back, then wrap your legs around the cord and climb, the warm autumn air spawning a little sweat under your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yes. It\u2019s going to be fun tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the tip of a tree branch, you closely observe the line of anthros spiraling through the forest and to the entrance of Iris\u2019s tent. Through the light of the torches, you can see dozens of faces chattering to one another, some apathetic, some excited, but none looking too dirty or poor to plop down some hefty payment. It\u2019s almost overwhelming, but you remember not to get distracted by all the choices. You needed the perfect mark, one with too much more cash than brain cells to talk their way into keeping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eenie...meenie...Minie...</i> You count off, observing their clothing, makeup, or whatever could clue you in on their lifestyle at home, how expensively they lived. <i>Moe!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect. Absolutely perfect! With her face lit up by the glow of a cell phone, her awareness of her surroundings completely depleted, a wolf girl stands crammed by the guest before and behind her, asscheeks overflowing beyond the width of the pathway. It\u2019s impressive, really; blasphemous as it may be, she probably has the height to meet Iris in the eye. Even her weight is on par, sporting nice, meaty breasts and a round, ample belly beneath an orange tank top, but both merely sit atop an thundering, bottom-heavy build, any movement from her impossible without setting a rain of thunderous jiggling amongst the two mammoth orbs of flesh that desperately try to pour through her shorts, and by the dimly lit look in her eyes you have a sense that she wasn\u2019t alien to getting her way through life with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven better is the excess of pocket size, her enormous (but no less cramped) shorts fitted with large back pockets stuffed to their bursting point with plenty of candy wrappers and potato chip bags long forgotten, and as she pries herself from her phone\u2019s screen to pay, she stuffs in into her pocket to grapple with her purse. Watching your angles closely, feeling the wind and its direction, you time your jump and leap from the branch, dangling by a length of thread tied around your waist. It\u2019s not to say that you\u2019re totally invisible, but on a night far from the city\u2019s light\u2019s, you\u2019re no more visible than a spider spinning its web in a dark basement, the raccoon-girl behind her giving no acknowledgement tot he speck that lands straight on her fellow line-waiter\u2019s pants, burrowing into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various wrappers crunching loudly against your digging, you manage to reach her phone, the slab of black plastic and metal twice as large as you are. Hitting the home button lights up the screen, but no further than the password menu. No big deal of course, as you examine four particularly cheese puff-stained marks over some of the numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two, five, four, and eight...</i> you recite in your head. <i>Maybe 4-5-8-2?</i> You ponder, testing the code. Nothing. <i>8-4-5-2?</i> Again, no dice. <i>5-2-8-4?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfyingly, her phone is now open, but not as a whopping thirty texts left unread. She\u2019s a girl with connections, you\u2019re certain, and you open them without haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hunch is proven right; rich parents that sent her to a rich school, all communicated to through texts that can\u2019t contain more than half the alphabet, mostly substituted for emojis and words abbreviated beyond recognition. Best of all, her dad\u2019s a recent landowner, hoping to strike it rich on the oil business. Most of her other texts go to random friends on campus, some even related to a few celebrities out there, but considering what you\u2019ve discovered, they\u2019re but an after thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen whatever space her pocket possessed constricts even further, wood flexing loudly beneath her rear as she takes her seat; your cue to leave. Climbing out of her pocket, you gladly take a breath of empty air and look around for your next mark. As luck would have it, the skunk lady behind her has set her purse down before her feet, and is facing away to talk with the anthro next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in your leaping abilities, you pull your legs free and leap with an expert dive, landing right into her purse to scrounge for more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You land with a classic \"superhero landing\" in the skunk giantess's purse and immediately begin looting around, nearly tripping over a blue pen as thick as your own body. You see her phone--and older model than Wolf-Girl's--shoved in a pocket above you, but decide to ignore it. It would take a climb to get there, and it looked like a flip phone: no way to use THAT thing silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, detective work was more fun anyway. Besides, it gave you more time to hear your goddess ply her trade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sending Signals like lit flares!\u201d Iris' voice purrs, giggling. Her customer gasps, buying the act hook line and sinker. \u201cI\u2019m getting a sense that someone close to you came into wealth, perhaps recently? And you\u2019re\u2026a bit of a social butterfly, hmm? Always making connections?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026all true. That\u2019s amazing, I didn\u2019t even say anything! Daddy just scored big selling some apartment blocks, and we're loaded!\u201d Wolf-Girl answers, wonder thick on her voice. \u201cWhat other...Signals; am I sending?\u201d She leaned in, clearly enraptured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well, you're giving me a sense of hunger, and not just for those cheese puffs. You want more of everything, and now you can afford it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is soooo trippy! Yes, you've got it! Oh God, this is lit. Totes goosebumps right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside a tube of lipstick (inexpensive brand, but good quality: the skunk liked to look her best, but was a smart shopper, unlike the big spender wolfess), you chuckle: what a bunch of rubes! Iris was simply reading the obvious: the wolf\u2019s designer clothes looked brand new, likely bought on a shopping spree just yesterday. She\u2019d been chattering on her phone while in line, and her phone was pristine aside from the cheese dust\u2014 brand new, but she didn\u2019t care about getting her new toy dirty; she\u2019d just buy a new one. All the junk food meant poor impulse control; she barely thought before buying something. And she spent BIG, which meant she was rich. Safe guesses to build off of, if you knew what to look for in a person. The \"Signals\" Iris talked about were just what she read off people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody bought psychics talking to ghosts or reading palms anymore, but the right tricks slipped past the skeptics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little practice and luck, she could seem like Sherlock while actually not knowing much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris told you it was called a \u201ccold reading\u201d: read someone\u2019s body language, clothes, behavior and whatnot well enough, and you could string someone along with educated guesses. Pose them as questions and leave them open-ended, and the sucker would trick themselves for you. Hell, Wolf-Girl had just revealed Daddy held her wallet. A neat trick\u2014Iris had even given you some lessons\u2014but it needed that extra oomph. That was where you came in. While Iris put on a show, you pilfered pockets, purses and bags to find all the personal bits you could. It was surprising how much you could learn about someone from what they carried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris had taught you all you knew: being stealthy, what to look for, how to guess about people from random junk; even how to escape if you got trapped in a purse. She even had plenty of distractions planned in case you got caught. Your favorite was when she grabbed you and sat on you for \"interrupting\" her. You even learned to make a 'crunch' sound so anthros would think you'd been crushed when you were alive and well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, being under Iris' soft, massive rump for a while was quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes...\" you hear Iris mumble. In your mind's eye, you see her put on some silly pose: fingers steepled before her face, eyes closed and nose twitching. It always seemed to fool people that she was \"channeling\" some weird force. To you, it always looked like she was about to sneeze. <br>\r\n\"Hmm...I'd bet your dad is trying something new? Maybe another sale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA happy yip from Wolf-Girl. \"Yes!\" She bounces giddily, the chair groaning under her ample cheeks. \"Tell me, Miss Iris! I'm so worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Worried you'll have less of Daddy's money to spend,</i> you think, shuffling through some crumpled coupons. It looked like they were for a back-to-school sale somewhere. Looks like Miss Skunk might have kids. Interesting; Iris would love THAT little detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris' low batty purr echoes through the tent. Even having heard it countless times and muffled by the giant purse, it still made your hair stand on end. \"This is...a faint Signal. Please be quiet, I have to focus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your cue: time to let Iris know about the dirt you'd dug up and clinch the reading. Still, couldn't hurt to poke around a bit more...the skunk woman's purse was downright spartan. It was spic-and-span clean, with no trash. There was barely anything helpful here aside from a small diamond ring. (Old, but in good shape and free of tarnish. It looked like a wedding ring, but it was too loved to say she was divorced or cheating. Maybe she was just getting it resized?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You clamber up the purse's pocket, and take one last look around. You spot a notepad, and squinting you see a list names in blue ink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mike</i> <br>\r\n<i>Sally</i><br>\r\n^ Space camp? Or Water Park? (NO Arcades unless Straight A's!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo! The skunk DID have kids! And was pretty strict, too. Probably grooming them to be geniuses, get into college. THAT was good material! Filing that away, you slither up to the lip of the purse and risk a look up at the skunk-woman. She's still chatting with the alligator woman behind her, unaware of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntirely unlike Iris and Wolf-Girl, the skunk lady is slender and fit, just big enough in the right places. (Her hips are respectably wide but small compared to Iris, and she has a little bit of a belly, but is on the thin side. You guessed she was in her younger forties.) She dressed professionally, a pressed navy blue business-dress, black hair tied in a bun, glasses on her face and polished grey heels on her feet. Probably worked for a bank...which made sense, given her no-nonsense attitude with her kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that went through your mind in two seconds. Heck, you were already rappelling back up to the tree branch by the time you'd finished your profile on Banker Skunk Lady. Now it was time to help Iris. Squaring your legs, you take a breath and leap off again, this time swinging in under the tent's entrance. You let go from the line and free fall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir rushes past you as you fall toward the giantess bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost...<br>\r\nJust a little adjustment...<br>\r\nTHERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plop, you land right on Iris' head, between her ears. Patting yourself on the back, you tap one of her ears and give the scoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Daddy's breaking into the oil business. Buying some wells and investing in refineries...maybe say something vague about 'digging deep for wealth'? Rich school, she's gonna be worried about losing status. Soothe her on that. And she's celebrity crazy. Something to hit there...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris purrs, and you take a moment to relax. <br>\r\nThe line outside was long, full of anthros and their secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, tonight would be FUN.</span></div></div>",

Kids are specifically named Mike and Sally, at least one of them going to space camp. Estimate that she works in a bank, or anywhere that deals with money. Mention \u2018cash flow\u2019, and ease into discussing her children\u2019s future.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris prods the Wolf-girl on further, she brushes a lock of hair from her eyes, disguising the act of playfully ruffling up your hair with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sense something...buried.\u201d She \u2018reads\u2019 from Wolf-girl, emulating that same silly psychic pose. You hear it all as you navigate past Iris\u2019 cap and slide down her hair, using her gown as a rappel line to reach the ground. \u201cSomething buried. Something within you? No, not that, but definitely a desire within you. Something dark, <i>black,</i> even, and yet fertile. Prosperous.\u201d Her eyes shoot open. \u201cOil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Effing. Way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour family is searching for nature\u2019s currency, are they not?\u201d Iris milks. You\u2019re striding across the tent floor by then. \u201cYour father, isn\u2019t he? Just now, I assume he\u2019s taken to drilling somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! Yes, yes, yes, he is!\u201d She giddily bounces back. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna find some, isn\u2019t he? I know he is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose wrinkling at the question, Iris tilts her head back, squinting with her fingers tracing circles around her temples, but her eyelids furrow in pain before she takes in a few needed breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She exhales weakly. \u201cMy mind, I wish it were up to the task, but I feel such distance to scale, and too little...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout question, Wolf-girl smacks down ten one-hundred dollar bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the cash \u2018inspires\u2019 Iris to try again, taking on that cute stance again, and this time her eyes light up. \u201cGoodness!\u201d She explains. \u201cThree hundred, no...<i>Five</i> hundred million dollars buried beneath the very Earth, soon to be yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf-girl emits a squeal to high for anybody but dogs to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fun as the show is to watch, though, it doesn\u2019t make the line any shorter, and you\u2019re still left with so many more suckers to rake in, and Alligator woman? Without opening her mouth, she\u2019s got a story and a half to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike skunk-woman ahead of her, she\u2019s got the rippling muscles of three gator women crammed into the same skin; fat calf muscles in her legs fit to run eight marathons every morning, swollen biceps along broad, meaty shoulders that\u2019d rip out of her tank top\u2019s sleeves with too cocky of a flexing session in the mirror, and yet in place of a six-pack is a moderately rounded tummy and a definite set of breasts; not the starved pectorals of a true female body builder. Attested to makeup on her face that\u2019s smeared on the same way an enraged painter would lash all their blacks and reds on a canvas to vent their inner aggression, straight black hair that\u2019s dyed with streaks of red, likely a middle finger to the world, fate, and just dumb luck that\u2019s tossed her a few harsh hands, and some grunge clothing that\u2019s worn with all the frays and tears of a true metal fan, she\u2019s got a statement to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost incriminating of all, as she protectingly covers her right hand over her left, she\u2019s got a white band around her ring finger. She\u2019s hopped on the break-up bus recently, likely downing her sorrows in doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fantastic target, but only a perfect one with a name. Much like Skunk girl, she plants her purse down on the ground, almost inviting any pickpockets to look inside and search through her belongings. How kind of her, you mentally answer as you climb up the arm loop and sneak inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing is her wallet; a romance to break up this badly couldn\u2019t have been settled without her still carrying photos of her old flame, and part of that hunch is right. Amongst numerous photos of her working in a garage, coated in oil whilst working on cars, motorcycles and the like, she\u2019s still got a picture of him, her arms wrapped around a much more short, lanky gator that she looms over at a pier near a beach someplace, his head nestled happily beneath the crux of her scaly bosom, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething\u2019s not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face is scratched out, likely with a coin or a knife. Yes, it matches with your theory, and yet the little bristles of color and ink are still fresh along the scratches. This was done <i>recently,</i> likely before she could leave for home to have her fortune told, or even when she was standing in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can this be? You observe her through the purse\u2019s open zipper, reobserving her clothing. The tears are too old for this breakup to be recent, and the bitter looks she\u2019s casting every which way are more subdued and dry, the result of anger that\u2019s been held deep for a long, long time, so if her anger at him was so prevalent to deface him, why wait only until now, right before her fortune was to be told?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s a skeptic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit...that\u2019s why she\u2019s such a giveaway. She\u2019s clothing herself in red herrings, likely eager for pickpockets to sniff through her belongings. To give her the satisfaction of laughing in Iris\u2019 face when she \u2018predicts\u2019 that she\u2019s a mechanic in the midst of a bad breakup, likely leaping out to announce her discoveries to the guests in line, to expose us in front of all our profits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit, again. Damnit, damnit, <i>damnit!</i> Not now! The last skeptic to slip past Iris\u2019 defense was at least near the end of the line, when there were enough guest that her charisma could settle the remaining crowd, but this is only the third person into the night. You can\u2019t cancel now! What are you going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a hurry, you climb up the purse and draw a mirror from your pocket, shining it off a nearby oil lamp near the tent\u2019s entrance. It\u2019s Skunk-woman\u2019s turn now, Iris churning up a show as always, but catching three glints of light from you clues her in on an emergency. Her face doesn\u2019t change, but her ear flicks three times, prepared to really milk her next session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much more time to work, you dive back into Alligator-girl\u2019s purse for clues. This time, <i>real</i> clues. Another of Iris\u2019 teaching is that no matter how far one tries to keep themselves a secret, however much they may try and conceal their true nature from Iris, there is always a crumb of truth to exploit. You lay flat as low as you can in the purse and pry at the very seams of the bottom. There\u2019s some crumbs, a few long strands of her hair, and...something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug out a few pieces of a green, leafy substance. Still damp and wet, and after brushing them along your upper lip, you determine their edible. <i>Specifically</i> edible, by the strong taste you encounter upon biting into them. Is there a certain origin to them, perhaps? Maybe she works in a flower shop? No. It\u2019s not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you\u2019re given even less time to piece anything together when the opening of the bag rustles slightly, and you duck behind her wallet for cover. Her large, scaly claw comes in to grab a tin of breath mints, but seeing her hand, the one unmarked by the ring band, you\u2019re granted a second clue; a few scars along her thumb and fingers, specifically, a few short, horizontal cuts along their upper digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re getting somewhere, but the truth is still far from sight, and there\u2019s only one direction left to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out from her purse and land feet-first outside, running over to her pant legs. She\u2019s still casting a few glances around for any spies, disguising them as miffed looks, but she\u2019s thankfully still ruled out the idea of a human snooping around. Due to the broad, bulky legs packed into her jeans, she\u2019s got too little slack in her pants to climb without being noticed, but with what little give they possess, you go up. On the way up, you strain your eyes in the darkness for any other hints, ascending to her very knee, likely the last amount of distance you can reach without her noticing something alive is latched onto her. You look left, and right, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo! A faint stain on her pants, washed and dried to the point that it\u2019d pass to the naked eye, but up close, with your eye pressed against the denim, it\u2019s definitely not your imagination. Sadly, there\u2019s nothing to smell off of it. Another dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Iris is getting to a point where she\u2019s about to start talking in circles. Your heart\u2019s heavy at giving her nothing but telling her to lose out on a customer so early in the night...but then Alligator-lady\u2019s arm drops to her side, scratching behind her left knee. Seeing her get close, you flinch and pull your legs up to avoid contact...</span></div></div>",

Not Iris, though. Trust was the key to your success. A lot of partnerships had tanked because one party couldn't trust the other. Iris, however, reacted without question. She assumed the phony psychic position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear,\" Iris said, scrunching up her face like she had a really killer migraine. \"I sense a great cloud of darkness hanging over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miss Iris, you have no idea how right you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator-woman sniffled, her eyes swelled with tears. You watched her through your hiding place, and though you hated to admit it, you needed to give credit where it was due. Lady was a damn fine actress. Though she'd let her guard slip in line, now that she was face-to-face with your mistress, the skeptic's acting was impeccable.

I'm sorry?\" the alligator-woman looked confused, but she kept up her despondent charade. She adapted quickly though. \"Is it Bradley?\" she asked. \"Does he plan on hurting me? The breakup wasn't my idea--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know there was no breakup,\" Iris said ignoring the panicked gleam in her skeptic's eyes. \"I don't blame you for doubting my powers, dear. Some days I had hardly believe them myself. Why me? Why was I the one chosen to receive such insight? Why am I, alone, the person granted knowledge others don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Because you're the lucky one who found me before I could end up like the rest of humanity underfoot or in someone's belly,\"</i> you thought. <i>\"Or maybe I'm the lucky one who ended up in the care of an actual goddess?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of your skepticism, I believe fate brought you here for a reason. You may not believe in psychics, you may have wanted to proclaim me a fraud in front of my true-believers, but you are here tonight so I can offer a dire warning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fake?\" the alligator said. \"I can't believe you! I wanted you to tell me that everything was alright, that I'd find someone who appreciated me!\" You were impressed at her dedication. She sounded sincerely hurt and offended. It was enough to make you even doubt yourself. Could your powers of deduction be off? Was this a real client that you'd somehow mistook for a fraud? Your goddess was merciful, but, nice as she was, even she had limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to you for help!\" the alligator-woman said and you felt a sinking feeling in your chest as you watched her begin to cry, her makeup running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And you shall have it! Just not in the way you expect!\"</i> Iris boomed melodramatically. \"Hear me, my dear, your restaurant is in grave danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama's restaurant?\" the alligator-woman said. You heard the fear in her voice and let out a sigh of relief. It was sincere. The skeptic hastily resumed her act but the damage was done. She'd let the mask slip and now Iris and you saw her for who she really was. You'd have nominated her for an award for best supporting actress if you could, but all three of you knew who the real star was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fire,\" Iris intoned. \"I see a terrible fire, one that burns your mother's restaurant to the ground! A careless slip of the claw and you send it up in flames! You must be careful, my dear! Never let your mind wonder for an instant at work or all your mother's hard work will go up in smoke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as predictions go, it was pretty broad. Of course making a mistake in the kitchen could cause a fire. Still, the alligator-woman was unnerved enough that she didn't seem to know what to do. Her plan was ruined before it began and now she had a prophecy of doom hanging over her head. Iris capitalized on her confusion before the alligator-woman could react and escorted her to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is worrying, my dear, but it is imperative you heed my warning. No, no, don't try to pay me,\" Iris said, even though the skeptic made no move to give her money from her purse. \"Just the knowledge that you'll be safe is payment enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Iris had this all under control. You prepared to launch yourself back out into the line on to your next mark--you'd have to work double-time thanks to this skeptic--but just before you could, the alligator-woman turned and planted her feet, preventing Iris from shooing her away. Her persona may have been fake but her muscles were real, and she wouldn't budge if she didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The alligator-woman believes Iris and just wanted to thank her properly before leaving, letting you move on to your next target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The alligator-woman calls bullcrap on all of it and may prove a problem.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past week, you'd learned that baking could be good exercise, at least when Lily had her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to bake some cookies, Slick!\" the 200-foot snow leopard woman says, giving a fanged smile and carrying you in her palm. She walks through her kitchen, stopping near the oven and giving you a determined look. \"Remember, you want to <i>own</i> this! You ARE speed, you blink and then those cookies are baked! Cheetahs look at you and hang their heads in shame! SHAME, I say!\" Lily had given you an inspirational speech before each \"Cookie Run\" this week, to help prepare for her sister Lisa's visit this Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa would be bringing her three daughters when she came. According to Lily, her little nieces were a handful and a half--<i>not</i>bad kids, not at all. The little cubs were angels...angels who were NOT good at sitting still. And more importantly, they had a sweet tooth like nothing else. They'd wipe out sweets like locusts: best to make a large srockpile before they arrived, to save having to bake new batches for the kids when they were already clamoring for them in your ear. Hence the \"Cookie Run\": a tiny human sprinting around the kitchen gathering ingredients for giant anthro chefs. You'd gotten more exercise in the past week than you normally got in a month, sprinting around the kitchen and hauling giant measuring spoons of flour and sugar. You were in better shape than you'd been in a while, and you'd even gotten faster...and you'd been <i>plenty</i> quick on your feet even before this all started. Now it was time to show off that speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell yeah, you wanted to own this! You crack your knuckles and give Lily a double thumbs-up. \"Now that's what I'm talking about! We're gonna rock this!\" You exult. Beaming with pride like a coach who'd seen an underdog boxer win the title fight, she made a fist with her free hand and brought it close for a fist-bump. You had no idea how she felt a tiny human fist under her thick, black-spotted white fur, but somehow she felt you return the bump and knew to withdraw her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, the air of a veteran coach is gone. Smiling, Lily looks to the side, turning so you can see who she's talking to. \"Alright Marsha, inspiring speech over. See? I kept it under two minutes this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second owner, also a snow-leopard giantess, stood by the fridge holding a large yellow bowl in her arm. Marsha was shaking her head and laughing. \"I still say this is silly. I can bake fast enough on my own, Lily; no need to have poor Slick running around getting caught under my hands...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that when my nieces first smell the cookies and start vacuuming them up like crazy,\" Lily says. \"You'll be thankful we stockpiled ahead of time...and hey, it was have Slick help bake them, or use pre-made dough from the store. And the last time you caught us trying THAT, Slick slept on the couch for three nights, and you sat on me while you read the paper.\" She blinked, her head tilting. \"Or did you sit on <i> Slick</i>, and make {i)me sleep on the couch...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden flashback of Marsha's ample motherly backside filling the sky comes to mind. \"The second one, Mistress Lily,\" you answer with a wince. \"She definitely sat on me...\" You were plastered under her blue jeans-clad rear for a good thirty minutes before she got up, and Marsha was (to put it mildly) quite heavy. A bit harsh punishment, but Marsha was a firm believer in making things from scratch. The store-bought cookie dough HAD been your idea, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's how it went! Thanks Slick...wish I could have taken your place, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha's objection breaks with her belly laugh. \"Oh, for--I love you, you corny soccer hooligan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, you old oven jockey.\" Lily leans in and kisses Marsha's lips, the older leopard's eyes closing in bliss. They held the kiss for a few heartbeats before separating. \"Go on, I've set everything up. Stand over there with the mixing bowl, and watch Slick do his thing.\" They smile and bump noses, and as Masha passes by you take a moment to reflect how lucky you were to belong to these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha was Lily's wife and the elder leopard giantess, well into her fifties. Age had faded her black spots to a middling grey, blending in with her slate-tinted reading glasses. She had some pudge in the belly, her slight muffin top visibly poking over her blue jeans even under her pink apron, but she wasn't what anyone would call obese or slobbish. Plump in a maternal way, more like. Fitting, since she ran a bakery. Lily liked to say Marsha's hips and backside were \"nicely rounded and good for breaking in those jeans\"--it always made Marsha blush when she said that. She loved cuddling and nuzzling you, and always liked to pamper her human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was the younger leopardess, somewhere in her forties. Her own spots weren't faded, but her fur was starting to show bits of grey. She used to play minor league soccer in her teens, and now worked as a private soccer coach for rich anthros. The athleticism showed: where Marsha was plump and maternal, Lily was lithe and athletic. Her figure was slender and graceful with especially toned legs. She wore tight black soccer shorts that showed off her toned hips and a blue jogging jacket. While Marsha loved to pamper you, Lily had you help out with things around the house, usually carrying things to her. It WASN'T slave labor like most other anthros treated their human pets, just something to give you some exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair had taken you in five years ago: orphaned and desperate on a winter night, you'd snuck into their house to scavenge food--and promptly gotten spotted. The ensuing chase (where your speed kept you always ahead of the pair), utterly wrecking the kitchen by the time they'd finally cornered you. They'd been ready to eat you alive for the trouble you'd caused...until they found you begging and crying. Struck by their conscience, they spared you and took you in as a guest/helper/pet. (They even named you \"Slick\" after a moment in the chase where you'd gotten covered in cooking oil and slipped out of Lily's hands when she tried to grab you.) Ever since then you'd been living comfortably with the leopard ladies--you could barely even remember the harsh, terror-filled life of a \"wild\" human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But that was the past; the bad old days. <br>\r\nNow, you had cookies to bake!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Marsha, standing down the counter, must have agreed with your thought from the annoyed look she briefly gave Lily).  But you couldn't worry about aesthetics now. Now, there was baking to do. The urge to run is making your head spin, but you force yourself to wait for the signal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily took out a stopwatch. \"Okay Slick, just like we practiced. Three...Two...One... <i>Cookie Time is Go!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt across the granite counter towards Marsha, the scenery flying past in a blur. Granite suddenly becomes white metal as you cross the top of the oven, trying to avoid any heat coming from inside. Each step was perfect--no way would you screw this up with a stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dry Ingredients and Mixing bowl?!\" Lily called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flour; baking soda; Sugars; Salt! Milk and butter in bowl!\" Marsha reported, barely keeping the laugh from her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the oven, you make a beeline for the ingredients Marsha had rattled off: a line of boxes against the wall, each with a measuring cup waiting before it, bridged atop by some poker cards. You scramble up a human-scaled ladder set against the flour bag, taking a roped grappling hook. With one heave you yank it back, ripping the top off and letting the flour pour into the measuring cup. The other boxes quickly follow, you calling out each ingredient.<br>\r\n\"Flour, 11 ounces! White sugar, 1/2 cups! Brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups! Baking Soda, one teaspoon!\" Marsha snatches the measuring cups away and adds their contentsmto her mixing bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last measuring cup is taken away, You leap down from the baking soda box, and find your legs feel like rubber. Your lungs burn from the constant panting. Everything you see is stars from sheer exhaustion...but you still manage to say it loud and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"TIME!\"</i> Then, you fall to your knees, panting and soaked in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 seconds! A new record!\" Lily cheers, pumping a fist in the air. She gives Marsha a smug grin. \"Told you having Slick help with the dry ingredients would be faster. <i>20 seconds</i> to get them all measured and mixed in, against your two minutes? That's five times faster! He'll save your wide behind when Lisa and my nieces visit, count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That IS fast,\" Marsha admits, \"But I still say it's silly--I can mix and measure the dry ingredients just fine by myself without this 'cookie run' of yours.\" You roll your head to the side and see her put the dough in a nearby stand mixer, pouring in a bag of chocolate chips. She reaches out and gently picks you up, caressing your head with a giant finger. \"And besides, it's so hard on poor Slick...\" she coos, petting you with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily leans in, \"Ah, he's a trooper. Besides, it helps him stay in shape. But you're right: I'm pushing him too hard. Slick, you're getting a three-day vacation. Just keep doing your cardio and we'll lay off the practice runs; you've got this down pat anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally catch your breath. \"Thanks...I did my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha brought you to her face and gave you a kiss, purring like a jet engine. \"You're amazing, Slick.\" Her rough feline tougue, like a giant sheet of wet sandpaper, tickled your face for a second as she licked you. \"Even a giant like me couldn't have done it that fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think he'd be a help at work?\" Lily asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Marsha's eyes were wide and she held you close to her chest. \"He's already been through enough today. And the bakery is adventure enough for Slick when he's riding in my apron's pouch--a busy kitchen, with orders coming in one after the other? The last place he needs to be is on the counter. Besides, Helen already doesn't like it when I bring Slick to work, unless we're just doing paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, Miss Stripes is just uptight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was Marsha's business partner at the bakery she ran. She was a zebra and a bit of a neat-freak. (An odd quirk for someone who worked in a kitchen) She didn't like the tiny footprints you left on the kitchen equipment, but tolerated you for Marsha's sake. You'd also given her a hoof massage once, when she came to the book club meetings Marsha also attended.The zebra giantess had loved it and had even been a little more courteous toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha rolled her eyes and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>GLRRRRGLE...</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrid groan fills the air and all three of you flinch. It's still echoing off the walls when you recover. <br>\r\nMarsha's stomach had growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's breakfast time,\" Lily announces. \"You get started, I'll get Slick freshened up. Little guy worked up a helluva sweat, and he needs to get clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha drops you into Lily's hand, and the latter makes her way out of the kitchen. You're soaked in sweat, but did it smell THAT bad...? You give yourself a sniff...and immediately regret it, gagging and retching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily giggles. \"Yikes, we might need to use some extra soap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a shower in the bathroom sink some fresh clothes, the three of you sit down for breakfast. Marsha made pancakes and eggs--the flapjacks were thin and crispy around the edges, just the way you liked. She'd even put peanut butter and jelly on them: your favorite toppings. You hug her plump belly when she sits down and thank her before digging in (you ate your food off a tiny plate Lily found at a pet store).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what're we doing today?\" Lily asks conversationally, pouring ketchup on her scrambled eggs. Satisfied with her topping, she digs in. \"Slick outdid himself today, and I think he earned an extra day out this week.\" She leans down and bumps noses with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beam. \"Yes! Thank you, Mistresses!\" A few times a week Marsha or Lily would take you with them when they left the house--to work, to buy groceries, or to something special: Just last night they saw a fox comedian at a club uptown. His jokes had been full of swearing, were incredibly crude, and clearly offended a few audience members enough to make them storm out...and you had loved every minute of it. You laughed yourself hoarse and nearly fell out of Lily's pocket. The fox's bit about a seagull taxi driver smuggling drugs in his beak was the highlight of the night--you knew it would have you falling asleep laughing for weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha consults a little black book, thumbing through its calendar. \"Hmm... The bakery has some cake orders to work on today. As for you, Lily, you've got a game to coach today. Guess he'd just be going to work with one of us. Speaking of the game, who's hired you this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red Wing Academy--that all-girls' private school downtown.\" Lily supplies, slicing into her pancakes. \"They're playing some prep school upstate. Parents are mostly gonna ignore the game and brag about how rich they are.\" Lily snorted. \"A shame, these girls are talented: the cow, Monique, has magic hooves: she can kick the ball so it CURVES into the goal clear past the goalie. She's gonna go pro, count on it. Sound like fun, Slick? You love watching soccer on TV, why not see a real game?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha titters and looks worried. \"Are you sure that's safe? Kids these days are rough with humans. One of those girls might eat him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to keep him hidden, honey, Lily says, putting her hand on Marsha's. \"He'll be safe in my purse, just like every time I take him out: the girls can't just pick him up. Anyway--\" Lily takes a big bite of pancakes, wiping syrup off her mouth, \"--the school banned eating humans during games. Apparently they give you leg cramps if you eat them before doing something athletic.\" She coughs and looks at you awkwardly. \"Er, no offense, Slick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, Mistress.\" You meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I wouldn't know that,\" Lily adds quickly. \"But it's what the experts say: no 'special snacks' before a game.\" She hesitated on \"before\", and you winced at the implications of what the teams would eat AFTER the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarsha had already sworn off humans when you first met five years ago...but only for health reasons. She'd been honest and told you she'd had quite the appetite for humans in her younger days. Lily for her part still ate the occasional human as a treat, but NEVER at home, and you knew she wouldn't even THINK of eating <i>you</i>. She avoided mentioning eating humans whenever possible, but it still came up now and again. Thankfully you'd all learned to keep it out of mind. You take a bite of jelly-covered pancakes to distract yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there is the bakery,\" Marsha adds primly: you and Lily both give her grateful smiles for changing the subject. \"No rich teenage girls there to whine about not getting a second car...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"'But Daddy, convertibles are in this year!'\"~</i> Lily chimes in, her voice shrill and whiny. <i>'\"If I don't have a convertible, I'll be...so BASIC!'\"</i> She laughs, her fangs showing. \"I swear I've heard that from them,\" she says in her normal voice. \"And that's not half as bad as when they have to take a bus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--but he'd still have to be careful in the kitchen.\" Marsha finishes, rolling her eyes and laughing. \"Still, I suppose both beat being stuck alone in the house all day, even with the risks. So what will it be, Slick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. Both their jobs had dangers for a human, but your mistresses always kept you safe when they went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeenage anthros, let alone all of them being girls, had their own perils. But you loved watching soccer with Lily, and it was a chance to get out of the house. It had been days since you'd gone outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Marsha's bakery business was more laid-back, with less chance of getting You'd even be mostly unseen by the customers since you were in the kitchen, and Helen could be trusted not to eat you...but, a frantic kitchen with lots of ovens and machinery was a hazard zone for a careless or distracted <i>anthro</i>, let alone a tiny human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopards leaned in expectantly, waiting on you.</span></div></div>",

That's there because an interactive with this title was orignally published by Ponymon. He took it down to make room for a new story, but gave me permission to \"revive\" it, saying he loved the adds I and others made to it. So, <b>props to ponymon for the original version of this story!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow onto the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No overly gruesome death scenes. A bit of realism is fine, but piling on the gore just makes it look dumb/disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Keep the giant anthros to a (somewhat) reasonable size. The human(s) should be able to INTERACT in some meaningful way with their giant mistress. (Basically, none of that miles-high or planet-sized stuff, okay?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) ABSOLUTELY no super-hardcore sexual stuff. Period. That includes futa/rape/scat/etc. Any attempt to include this will have the offending chapter removed without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Avoid creating Long strings of one-sentence chapters (She's gonna step on you! &gt; Left or right foot? &gt; Barefoot or shoe?). I'll go easy on it for picking the anthro's species, but once a storyline kicks off...then you should <i>actually tell a story.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) As the title says, the protagonist's giant anthro owner MUST be female*. Male giant anthros can still show up, but as secondary characters. <br>\r\n* And that means GENUINELY female. No \"shemales\" here, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.) Child characters (human and anthro) are allowed, but <i><b>UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES</b></i> are they to be killed off or involved in adult content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.) Try not to totally derail/shut down a branch/storyline. If one choice already leads straight to you getting killed, don't make ALL the others deathtraps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I reserve the right to edit or delete chapters on certain reasons...like breaking the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all.
