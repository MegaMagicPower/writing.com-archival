You proceed to checkout, and arrange your move out to the farm. As a young guy, straight out of collage, this was the best opportunity you could have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 weeks later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Sandra, or San for short, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nathan, but you can just call me Nate.\" You say to the agent showing you the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Nathan, now I'm on a tight schedule, so I'll give you a quick run down. The house was built in the late 70s, 4bed. 3bath. 1 kitchen. The barn has a few cows and other animals, the stable has a few horses, and you have 2 farm dogs taking care of things, if you need anything, my number is on the kitchen table. Oh and don't let the animals surprise you.\" She says hopping into the helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you say as the heli is about to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I can't hear you! My meetings at 9, I gotta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Sandra left you at your new farm, with little to go with. Maybe this was going to be more than you expected it to be. Oh well, it's part of a life experience. What should you do now?</span></div></div>",

Of course you doubt there's that many here. You look over to the stall left of you and see a horses rear end sticking out. You start walking over to the horse, and you say. \"Hey girl, i guess I'm the new farmer now.\" Letting it know your here. Then suddenly the horse stands up! Just like a human! You are completely shocked by this! How is this possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse just laughs and says. \"Ha, by the look of shock on your face, I imagine they didn't tell you about what type of animals live here. Anyways, I'm Jessica. It's nice to meet you!\" She says reaching out her hand for a handshake. You slowly reach out your shaky hand for the handshake. \"B-but how?\" You say very puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans against the wall and tells you what happened \"Well back in the 50s the government started experimenting on engendering super solders. They started putting animal DNA in humans to give them the animals abilities. It didn't work out too well, the budget was cut back to just this farm. And here they decided to put human DNA into animals to make them better workers. Then they were quit surprised when the first puppy came out looking quite human like. So after razing the pup into a kid, then an healthy adult, with no medical issues. They realized this was worth looking into, so they renovated this farm, and started breeding more humanoid animals, or as you might call us \"furries\" and seeing if we would end up being normal for a new race in society. It didn't turn out that way. Due to a lack of faith in the program, so now were just living our best out on this farm, it's a pretty sweet life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never would have imagined the government would experiment with this stuff\" you say puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, but they've done weirder things before. Anyways any questions? Or do you want me to introduce you to some of us?\"</span></div></div>",
