The Dr's all agreed that it was for the best that his body recovered from the damage that done in the surgery room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier this morning was the first time that Jack was able to walk around without gause on.  Looking at himself in the mirror he found that he was a very attractive 16 year old girl.  His normally short Auburn hair was changed to thick, long curly hair that reached down to his now skinny, feminine waist.  He noticed that his normal height of 5' 10\" was reduced to 5' 6\", but knew it was a part of playing the part so he wasn't to worried.  His new found breasts were a C-cup and his hips had widened substantially and he felt like a ballon in that area.  The lack of a penis betwen his legs felt odd to him at first but over the past couple of days he had grown used to having a vagina and urinary track inbetween his legs.  He touched that area once already during the day and found it quite pleasing but it wasn't the time or place to explore.  His facial features looked similar to what he looked like as a male but was obviously a very feminine looking version of himself.  One thing that Jack actually found nice was not having to shave every morning and the lack of any type of hair, except on his head, was an added plus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his watch Jack noticed it was nearly 2 pm and looked up at who was at the door. It was his boss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok. Lets get this over with,\" said Jack in his new feminine voice, getting up from the hospital bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  You will be meeting up with Jill Hickman for your training over at our main offices,\" said your boss.  \"Lets get you over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's boss and Jack, in his new found body, got into the car and headed to the main office.... </span></div></div>",

This is the last one. The big one. You complete this and you retire a hero. Double benefits and pension for life.\u201d The captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new mission was something out of a novel or movie for Jack. He wanted nothing to do with this weird sci-if crap, but it seemed it like he had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mission was to go undercover as a teenager. Not just a teenager either but a girl, and a cheerleader to boot. His mission was to get close to the daughter of Mafia Boss, Ivan Drasko. A Russian mobster with an absolute monstrous reputation. His enemies had been known to been found hacked up into pieces...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan came to America as a teenager and started a family here. On the outside he was a typical family man. He owned a local car dealership and paid his taxes and looked like anyone else. However beneath all that was a sadistic and cruel gangster with a string of murders and disappearances tied to him that ran into the dozens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed his only real weakness was his family. His wife Laura and his daughter Natalie. Laura was a typical housewife. She drank wine like most people drink water. She had multiple plastic surgeries to make herself look younger and sexier including fake boobs, butt implants, liposuction, etc. She was a dumb as it gets and anything she might or might not know about her husbands true business would be useless in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Daughter however was a different story. She was Daddy\u2019s little princess. Spoiled rotten and given anything she wanted. She was now the cheer captain of her high school. She was one of ruling class of high school seniors at her school. She was a \u201cmean girl\u201d a heartbreaker and kind of a slut by her reputation. She dated older guys, went to parties, drank, smoked, drugs, anything she wanted. For her 18th birthday she got a boob job as a present because she always wanted D cups. However where her mom was a dumb housewife, Nat seemed to inherit her daddy\u2019s smarts when it came to running her own little school empire. She even had teachers under her thumb so she never had to do homework yet still got good grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s mission was to be sent in as a \u201cdistributor\u201d His female body was to be designed in every way to get under Natalie\u2019s skin. She would be hotter, sexier, more flexible and athletic. A natural rival for Natalie. This combined with Natalie\u2019s incredible ego and competitive attitude should allow Jack to get close to her and hopefully get her to expose her true nature.

Furthermore not a single trace of body hair remained. <i>Those surgery geeks really know their stuff.</i> Jack thought to himself as he moved his hand back and forth to confirm that the reflection was truly his. His eyes drifted south to his vagina, not even a sign a pubic hair. Jack lamented briefly for his lost genitalia and turned to see his back. He saw a chubby butt reflected in the mirror and couldn't keep himself from laughing out loud. \"Haha! Cute butt, kid.\" Jack said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis handler would be coming  along soon to collect him for training, Jack stopped laughing and reminded himself of the importance of his mission.

This wan't some magical transformation that could be undone once the mission was over, this had been surgical, it had hurt. Due to the nature of the surgery he wouldn't even grow out of this.

Jack put the dress on himself being careful not damage it any way. Jack then very carefully dressed Faith in his old outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One last touch.</i> Jack thought as he removed the butterfly shaped barrette that had been a gift from her father on her eighth birthday quickly did his own hair up in the same style that Faith had been wearing and exited the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded to the two agents and quickly ran towards Faith's classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long, Miss Waid.\" Jack said standing at the doorway of the classroom before slowly making his way to Faith's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith, what took you so long?

Salvatore Lombardi is a wealthy businessman and, the FBI strongly believes, the head of a major criminal organization. In order to gather information, the bureau plans to kidnap a member of his family and replace them with an agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and his boss now have carefully to decide who Jack will become. This is one of the most dangerous missions he will be part of, but also one of the most important missions for the FBI, since they are hunting Lombardi for many years now and never were so close to get him. But using this new technology and a perfect way to send some of their best agents undercover was one of the main but also critical part of the whole mission. There was not much room for mistakes and this will start with the selection of the right undercover person for Jack\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am happy that you agreed going deep cover as a member of Lombardi's family\". He addressed Jack-.<br>\r\nTo be honest Jack has been waiting for a long time to be part of one of the big missions. He had been part in some undercover mission and other but this one, the Lombardi one was certainly the biggest he will ever be participating! He only knows two other agents, who have made such large busts. Their careers took off after that.

Even if you don\u2019t mind my openness I think there has to be another way. I mean does he have a son, or brother I can replace\", Jack knows that Smith always is open for a discussion, but at the end he is the boss!<br>\r\nSmith as a professional is prepared for this question and shakes his head and says, \"He has no sons and he doesn't trust the other male members of his family. Emma is his daughter for his first marriage. His wife got custody and he hasn't seen her since she was 12. She's been traveling Europe after graduating college and recently overdosed in Amsterdam and is in a coma. The Bureau has her in a secure hospital\". <br>\r\nJack understands and had a another closer look at the folder again considering the gravity of the situation. <br>\r\nThere is a silence and Smith breaks it by getting up from his chair saying, \"Listen Jack, this is a tough mission for any agent. Maybe you're not up to it. Maybe Edwards will take it\". <br>\r\nThis is not acceptable for Jack: Edwards and Jack have been competing for every position since the academy, so Jack\u2019s answer comes out with a strong and determined voice. \"No, no, I'll take it. I'll do it\"<br>\r\nSmith smiles and says, \"Great, You'll get started right away.

There has to be a better way to advance my career\"<br>\r\nBut Jack takes it like a man, he still is, but is thinking about the drastic change in his appearance. But the mission is clear: He needs to infiltrate the Lombardi clan and family, even this means changing that much!<br>\r\nOnce arrived in the lab, he saw the experts already waiting. It was late in the evening and they most properly want to start the procedure and go home afterwards\u2026.<br>\r\nJack asked the responsible agent of the lab team: \"So having me turn into a woman is save?<br>\r\nI will be able to turn back male later, hope I will not be stuck as a woman for the rest of my life\"<br>\r\nThe agent in a lab coat says, \"Don\u2019t worry. The machine is storing your body pattern for later restore!\u201d<br>\r\nThe answer was short and plain. Jack had no other choice then trusting in the words he just heard because the transformation machine was warmed up and ready to go.<br>\r\n\u201cNow hurry up and strip down\" was the instruction and Jack wondered:. \"I have to get naked\",<br>\r\nThe 2nd agents steering the machine just smiles and says, \"You can keep your clothes on if you want them fused to your skin\". Of course this is not what Jack wanted and so he quickly start stripping down and is guided to the machine. He has to step into the booth and right before the doors close he asked, \"How bad is this going to hurt\"? The tech laughs and replies, \"It won\u2019t hurt at all, but it may feel a little weird\". Of course it will be feeling weird, because turning into a woman is weird!<br>\r\nThe door shuts and the machine starts is work. Jack\u2019s hair stand on end as strange energy fills the booth. There is a bright flash. The next thing Jack feels is more or less nothing: Is everything ok, because the machine is salient. \"Was there a problem\", Jack tried to talk to the technician, as he hears his own voice, which was no longer his own and also he catches his reflection in the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cyberkatz.com/wp-content/uploads/...\" target=\"_blank\">http://cyberkatz.com/wp-content/uploads/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\", Jack exclaims and then looked down at his massive boobs! Actually the might be a normal size for a woman, but for Jack they a gigantic and all he can see when looking down as they're blocking everything else. The door opens and the tech is standing there. Feeling exposed Jack tries to cover himself.<br>\r\nThe agent hands Jack a robe to wear and Jack quickly puts it on. He then leads you over to another room......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he is walking you to another room Jack comments, \"That was a lot faster than I thought it would take\". But the agent replied with a serious tone: \u201cActually it was twelve hours. The process freezes brain activity while the changes take place, which is good. I don't think you would enjoy the process. The change back later we will do in an hour.\u201d That gives a small comfort to Jack, who now more and more started to realize that he is no longer a he!<br>\r\nNothing else is said and female Jack arrives in another room, where he, now she faced the next step of the mission: \"Time for your makeover\", a dark-haired very attractive woman says as Jack is seated in a chair. From out of nowhere a couple of other ladies show up and they start working on you. Occasionally they reference pictures of the original. Jack gets her ears pierced, hair styled, fingernail painted, and even the toenails are painted. Jack wondered if this is really needed or someone will have fun here? The girls obviously seem to have fun, because they are smiling all the time to Jack\u2026Are they fliting with me? Was Jack thinking, but his massive bust and lack of male equipment brought her back to the situation in just a few seconds\u2026<br>\r\n\"We're all done with you, dear\", one of the ladies says after what seems like hours. \"Thank God\", Jack murmurs Just then another woman appears and says, \"Time for your tattoo\". \"What? She doesn't have a tattoo in any of the pictures\", Jack said. The lady with the tattoo needed only laughs and says, \"It's in a place that most people don't take pictures of\". \"Crap\", Jack murmurs again as she is lead of to get the tattoo.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't wear this stuff. It barely covers anything\". Carl, the gay fashion consultant waves his hand and says, \"Sweetie, that is how the real Emma dresses. If I had a body like yours I'd show even more\". <br>\r\nNot having another option right now Jack needs to accept and slowly started to take off the robe and start looking through the clothes. Jack picks out some bra and of course was struggling to get it on. \"Honey, do you need some help in there\", Carl asks through the door. \"No\", Jack shouts back! Finally she could make it to get dressed in underwear and some dress she found. At least this was the best option to be found among other dresses skirts and skimpy stuff. Taking a deep breath she walk out of cubicle to present her new self. Carl looks up and down then says, \"Not too bad, but you need shoes\". He sorts through a box and pulls out a pair of stiletto and tosses them out to Jack. Jacks mood does not become better as she puts them on and attempt to stand up. Not used to stand or even walk with such shoes she falls over with the first and second attempt, but make it on the third. Finally Jack was able keeping her new balance when Carl says, \"Now let me see you walk\". \"What! I can barely stand\", Jack stammers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what needs to be done needs to be done and indeed after a few more tries she got used to those high heels and is also able to walk.<br>\r\n\"Fine\" said Carl and told that his part of the job was done and Jack should show up in the office of Deputy Director Smith to get some last instructions for your undercover mission...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs told Jack heads up to the office of Smith as she find her new self very impressing. Now gotten the whole walking in high heels thing Jack feels much better, even she is not sure down. If she can do stairs and even dance. But this will come! Emma's body seems well toned and in shape. \"Fucking Edwards would not have been able to do this\", Jack thinks to herself, but she realize just how much working knowledge of being a woman she still is lacking.<br>\r\nIt's more than makeup and walking in high heels. While being in the elevator and using the full size mirror there Jack had mastered mannerisms of a young hot lady, she is now!<br>\r\nTarget is that nobody may suspect something! One thing might be a hindering factor, Jack may have a woman's body and brain now, but still the mind and experiences of a man. We will see how this works out and Jack lets out a sigh as she opens the door to the director\u2019s office.<br>\r\nThe director seeing the hot woman almost dropped his mouth. Jack fears that looking like this, will be a typical reaction of men, when they see her now. Damn it, but no regrets, Jack war and still is willing to fulfill the mission\u2026.<br>\r\nNow the director shares some last instructions:<br>\r\nJack needs to fly to Amsterdam, since Emma has an apartment there. She will have to spend another day there just to get familiar with Emma\u2019s life and surroundings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were very sketchy on the details of your transformation. You assume it's going to be some sort of advanced plastic surgery, but really have no idea. You figure that's why they selected you. Aside from your training and vast experience you're not that big of a guy. You're below average for a man, but that's always made you work harder, made you stronger as far as you're concerned. Your Mom was also a dance instructor. You'd help her out with her classes. You smile to yourself as you remember that one of the classes she taught was adult dancing and pole dancing. It was every teenage boy's dream. What really has you confused is that they said physically you'd be ready to begin your assignment tomorrow. You never heard of any surgery you could recover that quickly from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You pull up to the building where the lab is located and your concerns increase. The security there is tight. You recognize the swagger of the guards from your time in the service. You'd bet a weeks pay they're special forces, or at least were. The weapons they're carrying are high end and fully auto. You're waved through and make it to the building where you're escorted in. After passing through several other checkpoints you make it to the lab. from what you can see it's not equipped for surgery. Doctor Jacks, the doctor you spoke to at police headquarters walks up as you're looking around. \"Is there something wrong detective\", he asks? You look directly at the doctor and say, \"Yes, this doesn't look like any surgery room I ever seen. Everything else I've seen so far screams government project and by the security a very classified government project. That begs another question. Why contact a local police agency offering to use this classified tech to help them bring down a local mob boss\"? Doctor Jacks smiles and says, \"I can see why you were selected. That was a very good observation and mostly true. Why would we want to help you take down a local mob boss\"? You raise an eyebrow. You're good at word games, but are usually the one playing them. \"My guess is that he's not that local and threatens either this project, or the country somehow. You want him taken out in a way that there won't be a connection to the feds though\", you offer. Doctor Jacks replies with, \"Very good. Also if you're found out the government will disavow any knowledge and you'll be stuck as a woman\". You feel your chest tighten some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Doctor walks you into the lab. You finally work up the nerve to ask the question. \"I take it that this is a little more than just advanced plastic surgery\", you say. The Doctor turns and says, \"I guess I can brief you now. What we have perfected is................</span></div></div>",

This catches you off guard. \"What the hell do mean\", you blurt out? Doctor Jacks pulls out a file and not just any file, but your military file. \"You took part in a experimental trial for a new anti-nerve agent during the Gulf War. It wasn't an anti nerve agent. It was the first field trial for the nano-meds. They were designed to repair battlefield injuries by augmenting the subjects own healing abilities\", he says. You rub your arm remembering that. The doctor then continues, \"It wasn't exactly successful. Several subjects developed what came to be known as Gulf War syndrome. A few, very few it worked. have you ever wondered how you survived so many close calls. Those close calls were closer than you realized. Part of the nano-meds programming includes suppressing traumatic memories. This also caused some issues. You are one of the few that adjusted well. That is the reason you're the one that must go on this mission. What we're going to do is reprogram your nano-meds with a new template. They will transform you completely. Not even a DNA test will indicate you've ever been anything but a woman. It will be painful, but the nano-meds will block all memories of the transformation\". You don't know what to say. You've been carrying around tiny robots for 14 years without your knowledge. You feel a little pissed about the deception. Not to mention your brothers that didn't survive they're little experiment.

The room you're in is a bit large and you can tell there are people on the other side of the mirror looking. It's not that you're bashful, but damn this is a little embarrassing stripping down naked and being transformed into a woman in front of a bunch of people. \"Come on now\", the doctor states. \"To late to turn back now\", you think to yourself. You strip down and step into the circle. The doctor nods his head and a plexiglass cylinder quickly raises from the floor trapping you. \"What the fuck\", you shout! Another part comes down from the ceiling and lowers a mask. The doctor indicates for you to put the mask on. It's a full face self adjusting style mask with a built in communication device. You put it on and the doctor speaks to you. \"This process can be messy and the nanites will require additional material to complete the process\", the doctor states. The tube you're in starts filling with a strange liquid. \"Don't panic\", you tell yourself as the liquid covers your head. Just when you think the worse is over you whole body erupts in burning pain. You scream, but your voice is muffled by the mask and liquid. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck, what have I gotten myself into\", you think while your body is in agony.

The last thing you remember is the cylinder filling up. You strain to look down at yourself. You're covered with a sheet to your neck blocking the view of your body, but there are a pair of unfamiliar lumps holding the sheet up where your chest should be. \"Oh shit\", you try to say, but your voice comes out sounding all wrong. It's squeaky and high pitched. A nurse in a military uniform comes in. \"Keep calm, the procedure went well. I'll let the doctor know you're awake\", she says adjusting your bed so you're sitting up. She disappears through a door. You move you eyes around the room. It's still difficult to move much more. You notice a mirror on the wall to your side just on the edge of your vision. You can just see the bed and can tell it's a woman in the bed in the mirror, but no detail.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack walked down to the crime laboratory like a condemned man. It was a place where no officer on duty liked to go, because this wasn't like a typical lab. Two years ago the government started a new program to equip law enforcement with modern-age technology, using bizarre and sometimes unethical research methods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGovernment-employed scientists scurried around the laboratory like insects, their coke-bottle lenses staring blankly back at whatever officers found their way down there. The whole room glowed a sickly green colour. It smelled like sulphur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name and identification, please...\" Grunted a balding, middle-aged scientist. His back curved slightly forward and his arms and hands were stubby things jutting out from his white lab coat, giving him a beetle-like appearance. Jack couldn't see his eyes behind his thick glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack O'Rourke, number 014726.\" He presented his badge, and the scientist scanned a laser beam over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" He sniffed. \"Follow me, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack followed the scientist through several security checkpoints separating each chamber within the laboratory. At each checkpoint, he gave his name and ID, and one scientist handed him over to the next. This was done, he was told, so that no one scientist would know where the machine was located within the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine in question was top secret. Even the police chief of the whole precinct didn't know anything about it. It was delivered in a wooden crate the night before by government workers. All the police chief knew, and what he relayed down the chain of command to Jack's boss, was that this machine would allow Jack to infiltrate the Russo crime syndicate. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack entered a chamber with no other doors. In contrast to the others, this room was well lit. Two reclining chairs lay in the centre, positioned for two people to lie back like at a dentist's office. A large supercomputer hummed and clicked in the background. Several thick cables and wires ran out from the supercomputer into a pair of helmets, which lay at rest on a table next to the two chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room was not empty when Jack entered with the scientist. Inside was another insect-like scientist. Along with a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea here? Who is this guy?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was equally confused; the young woman looked like she had no business inside a police station or crime laboratory. She looked like she was in her mid-twenties. She was thin, with strawberry blonde hair cascading down a pair of narrow shoulders that were dwarfed by the huge, bolted-on tits resting on her chest. Clearly fake, they had to have been at least H-cups (not even Jack's wife had boobs these big, and his wife was much larger than this girl. He guessed she couldn't have been more than 100 pounds soaking wet).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples jutted out from the fuzzy pink tube top she was wearing, which also had golden tassels dangling from the sides. Her midriff was showing, and her black microskirt barely covered her ass cheeks. Her skin was pale but free of tattoos as far as Jack could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" Jack muttered. \"What are you doing here, lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'd like to know!\" She struck a pose, placing her hands on her hips. \"These guys won't tell me anything. Do you know where we are at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gazed at the bug-like scientists, who were busy calibrating the machine, buzzing about it like flies. He answered, \"Yeah. We're somewhere deep inside the crime laboratory of the Metrovale police station, precinct number 43.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stalked over to Jack, looking him up and down. \"So can you, like, get us out of here then? This place is <i>way</i> creepy, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried the door, but it was locked. He was about to pull aside one of the scientists to start explaining themselves, when the police chief entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Sorry I'm late. Had a ten-fifteen to process, O'Rourke.\" The police chief shook his hand. Then, turning to the young woman, he bowed. \"Sorry for keeping you waiting, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, can you just tell me what happened?\" She repeated annoyed. \"The last thing I remember I was dancing for a regular over at Score's... then I find myself here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jack had suspected it, she had confirmed it. The woman was an 'exotic dancer' at the seedy strip club in the bad part of town. Jack was a faithful husband and didn't frequent Score's, but he was plenty familiar with the place due to the number of arrests he made around there. It was not a safe place to be at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your questions will be answered momentarily.\" Said the police chief. \"Including yours, O'Rourke. I'm sorry I can't explain right now. What I need is for each of you to lie down in one of these chairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" She backed away, hitting her backside against the table. \"What the fuck is this shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police chief snapped his fingers. The two scientists who were buzzing about the machine converged on the poor woman. They dragged her, kicking and screaming, onto one of the chairs. They fastened her wrists and ankles into metal clasps welded into the sides. Then they tied a gag around her mouth. Her screams came out as muffled chokes until one scientist injected her with a liquid causing her to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this upset Jack greatly. The police chief sighed, \"I'm sorry you had to see that, O'Rourke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm going to let those bozos do that to me, chief...\" Growled Jack, steeling himself against the two drone-like scientists standing idly beside the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Violence won't be necessary.\" The police chief held up a hand. \"I figure I owe you an explanation for what you're about to go through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be very helpful, chief.\" Jack said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief guided Jack around and behind the big machine, showing him how it works and what the scientists will be instructed to do. \"This machine was originally designed to help develop psychokinesis in its subjects. The ability to move objects around with one's mind.\" He explained to Jack. \"However, for reasons we don't understand, the opposite happened. The machine perfected a way to move <i>minds</i> around between <i>objects</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't believe his ears. \"So you're telling me this some kind of... body swapping machine?\" He thought such technology was impossible outside of the realm of science fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that, yes.\" Nodded the chief. \"You place a helmet on each subject, throw on the switch, and each subject will receive the mind of the other. In theory, there's no reason that its effects should be limited to humans... or living matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the penny drops. Jack glances over at the strawberry blonde's sleeping form reclined in the chair. \"You \u2014 You can't seriously expect me to \u2014 \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The chief leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To \u2014 To <i>switch bodies</i> with that woman, do you?\" Jack sputtered. \"What the hell would that accomplish, chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief pulled Jack in close by the shoulder, confiding in him like a brother. \"Listen to me, O'Rourke. You're the finest god damn officer in our precinct. Your mental and emotional acuity is higher than any other officer I've seen in ten years. Now I want you to use your problem-solving skills, will ya? Where did she say she worked before coming here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At Score's,\" Answered Jack. \"Everyone knows about it. It's a titty bar in the bad part of town. Known to harbor criminals, smugglers, and gangsters. A lot of bad shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Were you informed as to why you're here?\" The chief asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told this would be an undercover operation.\" Jack said, and then it all made sense. \"So you want me to infiltrate the titty bar as that blonde broad over there?\" He thumbed over to her skeptically. \"She can't even defend herself against these two scientist goons here, chief. She has no strength, no endurance training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, O'Rourke, it is a risk.\" The chief nodded. \"But there's a lot at stake here. We have another informant in Score's who tells us that the Russo crime syndicate is preparing to expand outward. We can't allow that to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the informant?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will make themselves known to you, when you get to work there.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack frowned. \"I can't dance around and shake that girl's ass out there for strangers, chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can, and you will, O'Rourke.\" Ordered the police chief. \"You're in too deep to back out now. If it's any consolation, we have upgraded the machine to allow subjects to retain portions of their old skill sets. So you'll receive this woman's muscle memory and knowledge of how to please a crowd, while keeping your police training. And this woman will receive memories of your friends and family, so she can act like you when she is off duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had forgotten about the other half of the swap. That this stripper would take over his body and life. \"You can't let her impersonate me! What about my family? Don't they have a right to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, O'Rourke. The fewer people who know about this technology, the better.\" The chief said flatly. \"Rest assured \u2014 we will give her enough to live your life without too much disruption when you complete your mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long is this mission supposed to last?\" Jack asked, as the two scientists began escorting him onto the reclining chair. They fastened a helmet over his hair, screwing it on his head tight. Finally, they restrained his wrists and ankles in metal clasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as necessary. Good luck, O'Rourke.\" The chief said, before giving the signal to throw the switch. That was all Jack remembered before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack awakened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being a chauvinistic ladies man, Jack wasn't keen on the gender swap part of the mission, but the thrill of being the first to use this technology would earn him some departmental fame. \"Mind transfer\", Jack thinks amazed how far things have come. The fame was not a big deal. Jack was only a few months from retirement after 27 years of service and was looking forward to it. He'd already fixed up his Mom's old house in Florida. There was a boat out back and a convertible in the garage beside his Harley. This last mission and he was done. Jack had never set down roots, never married, and no kids to best of his knowledge, though the possibility was there. For his age he was in pretty good shape. Jack was snuck in through the back door of the clinic. He took one last look at the profile picture of the woman he was going to become. She was rather attractive Asian young woman of 21. Nothing spectacular in the body department. \"Nice ass, no tits\", Jack thinks as he looks at the picture. Soon Jack is laying on a table and then goes to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He checks his hands, or rather her hands. The doctor comes up along with Stan, his boss. \"The procedure went well. Your mind has been downloaded\", the doctor states. \"What the hell is wrong with my chest\", Jack exclaims? Stan shakes his head and answers with, \"You never read all the way through the mission briefs. We used her getting a boob job as cover to get her in here for the transfer. You're a proud owner of a pair of double Ds', maybe bigger by the looks of it. Hard to tell until the swelling goes down.\" \"Fuck, this is going to complicate things\", Jack mumbles. \"Her body guard is waiting in the lobby for you. The target isn't getting out of his vehicle out front. We need to get you moving and on mission. We're taking your old body out the back, sedated since her mind is in there. We're take good care of it, Jack, or rather Mia\", Stan states. Stan and the doctor leave and a nurse comes in with a wheelchair shortly after. \"This mission is going to suck\", Jack thinks as she's helped into the wheelchair. Her boobs are hurting like nothing Jack has ever felt and Jack has been shot before. \"How am I going to complete the mission recovering from this shit\", Jack wonders. Jack is wheeled out to the lobby where a hulk of a man is waiting for her.

Before Jack can get another thought the black SUV just outside explodes. Jack is fortunate her body guard was standing between her and the front window. His body catches the brunt of the blast. Even so, Jack is forced out of her wheelchair and across the floor by the concussion. The power of it takes Jacks breath and the sound is deafening. Jack struggles to maintain consciousness, but loses. Everything goes black. Jack awakes to Stan's grim face. \"What the fuck\", Jack murmurs. Jack checks herself and discovers she still a she. She then realizes she in a moving ambulance. \"Stan, what happened\", Jack asks? Stan sighs and says, \"Our target was also someone else's target. From the best we can gather they flew a drone packed with high explosives into his SUV.\" Jack strangely feels relieved, the mission is over. \"Are we heading to another location to get me back into my body\", Jack asks?

You're stuck in that body, Jack. Most likely for the rest of your life\", Stan states bluntly. Jack nearly passes out again. \"Fuck me\", Jack mumbles, her head falling back onto the pillow.

Jack heads into the bathroom, stands at the toilet, and then realizes standing to pee isn't for her anymore. \"This is so humiliating\", she mumbles annoyed at her situation. \"Work, work, focus on work\", she tells herself. It's strange to be falling back on that. Just a week ago Jack was making final plans for retirement. Now Jack is a woman and again focusing on work to get through the day. Jack wonders for a second if retirement was a good idea. It's not the first time this thought has crossed Jack's mind. He could have retired a few years ago, he had the time. Considering the events of the past 24hours it probably would have been the better course of action. Jack finishes up, washes her hands, and the catches her reflection in the mirror. \"Oh fuck\", Jack states as she's once again reminded this is her, there is no going back.

What Stan said about her original male body being vaporized comes into her mind ruining the illusion she is attempting to build. She quickly forces it away. \"It's just missing if they can't find it. Not, necessarily vaporized\", Jack says to herself. She tells herself there is a chance that Mia escaped and is running loose in the city wondering why she's an old man. Jack throws on a loose fitting t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants. She has to tighten the waist and roll up the legs of the sweatpants. \"How short am I\", she thinks even though she knows from the mission file that Mia was 5'4\" tall. Jack walks back out to Mark once she's dressed. Mark stands up and the size change really hits Jack. Jack used to have an inch on Mark, but now Mark towers over her. Height isn't the only thing. Jack realizes also how small a frame he has now. The only large thing on Jack now is her bandage wrapped chest. \"Let's go\", Mark states.

She is, or rather was an assassin working for another member of the Yakuza. The whole boob job was something she came up with to get her darling husband to come out of his fortress of a mansion. Our guess is she was working with someone who piloted the drones. The suspects are one of three of the younger up and coming Yakuza members.

On mission she can get into the role and forget for a bit. There is also the agent part of her that wants to complete the mission.

Jack gave away nearly everything in her old apartment and has made the move to Florida. She's assumed her new identity of Mia Nagamuchi. \"Crazy name, not even Japanese\", Jack thought as she first read it. It's clear they were rushed to build her new identity. Mia has made the move to Florida and into her mother's old house. She left it to Jack when she passed and thinks to some paperwork magic by the agency Jack has left it to Mia. It's been a rough adjustment. What born women learn as they naturally mature Mia has had to learn bit by bit. Everything from feminine hygiene to fashion Mia has had to research. At the same time she has had to mentally and emotionally adapt to her new gender and recover from her breast augmentation. Jack loved big breasts, but Mia has come find them a real pain. They get in the way of everything. It seems to Mia that they are a totally useless feature of her new body. Women's bodies seem poorly designed as far as Mia is concerned. Mia still wakes up in the middle of the night expecting to be back inside her Jack body, have muscles and a penis again. Not saying that this body isn't fit and all, but it's not the same. Mia has kept it in shape by going to a local gym. At first she dressed pretty conservative not wanting to draw attention, didn't work, guys hit on her anyway. She then noticed something. Women that dressed up and showed it off got hit on less. It then dawned on Mia why. Really hot chicks intimidate guys. Mia started dressing to show it off. Fewer guys hit on her, but more stared. The guys that did work up the nerve to hit on her were easily deflected. Mia has just made it back from the gym again and taken a shower. She stares at her naked body in the mirror and says, \"You can do this.\" This is a common ritual for Mia.  </span></div></div>",

She starts by imagining having her cock again to fuck the woman she has become and by the end of the routine imagines having a cock in her. An orgasm follows shortly after and then feelings of embarrassment for climaxing at the thought of being fucked with a huge cock. Emotional roller coasters is another aspect of being female Mia has come to despise. As Jack she felt she was more stable, or at least better at keeping it buried. After a few drinks Mia has often just told herself she should just get it out of her system. Just grab one of those hunks at the gym and fuck him silly. She decided to quit drinking because of those thoughts. Due to the fact one night she almost did it. She knows it wouldn't be gay, she's a chick now, but that damn male identity still lingers somewhere in the back of her mind. This was even after the trip to the gyno. Mia shivers remembering that experience. That alone has convinced her that women's bodies are fucked up.

Last week she had her period and is running short on tampons now. \"Do not want to get caught without those\", Mia thinks with a shiver. The universe cursed her with her first period just days after arriving in Florida. She was not prepared and it wasn't pretty. It's not an experience she wishes to repeat. Had she been born a woman she would have noticed the signs. That was the event that prompted the trip to the gynecologist. As an agent Mia learned that preparation is the key to every mission. She learned more than ever wanted to know about women during that trip. Mia shivers and murmurs, \"Time to shop.\" Mia was nervous her first time out as a woman. She dressed in bulky baggy clothes trying to hide the fact she was a she. This turned out to be a bad idea. For one no amount of clothing was going to conceal her tits and two, it's Florida and she almost had a heat stroke from wearing a sweater in the middle of August. After that she figured if she was going to be noticed anyway she might as well be comfortable. So, here she is walking around Walmart in shorts and a halter top. Guys do look at her, but then notice the big box of tampons in her cart. That serves as a good deterrent for unwanted advances. She glances around at the other girls in the store. \"Shit, other girls\", Mia muses as she now looks at them as other girls. She a member of the species now. The difference is they are walking around with makeup and their hair done while Mia is all natural. Mia has considered giving it a go, but it seems very complicated. She's overheard women in the makeup isle talking about coordinating colors and styles. It all seems like some sort of weird science that eludes her. There is a salon not far from her house that she has considered. Lacking the knowledge herself consulting professionals is a reasonable course of action. She goes back and forth on making the move wondering what would be the point. \"It's not me\", she has said often to herself. She then looks in the mirror and says, \"It's me now.\"</span></div></div>",

What have you been using on your skin and your hair?\" Mia suddenly feels very self conscience about her appearance. \"Ah, just soap and shampoo\", Mia answers. Mia had been using something she found in the store cheap. Like everything else there seemed to be an overabundance in things to choose from. \"We do have an opening. I suggest you go with The Works\", the woman states. \"Okay\", Mia replies unsure as to what The Works is. Women seem to speak their own code. The woman notices Mia expression explains, \"We'll start with a massage, pedicure, manicure, full body wax if needed, facial, herbal shampoo, and conditioner. Other appointments may switch up the order some.\" Mia is not certain what all that entails, but figures hell, lets go with the full girl pamper experience. </span></div></div>",

It's included in the package and you can take it home\", the lady says. \"Robe\", Mia questions raising an eyebrow. She was just planning to get her hair done when she decided to come in, but the massage sounded to good. As Jack she'd gotten massages before and knew the protocol about disrobing, but at the time it didn't cross her mind for some reason. The clerk sees her hesitation and says, \"Your therapist will be Clair today. She really good. You can take off as much, or as little as you want, but it's best to be nude for this.\" \"Yes, of course. It's just been a while\", Mia states heading for the dressing room. \"At least it's a woman doing my massage\", Mia sighs while she disrobes. When she steps back out she finds a mudslide in a large glass waiting for her. She sits down in the chair and begins sipping it. It's been a while since she's relaxed. Even before the change as Jack she was always high strung. Mia feels her body and mind relax as the drink goes down. \"Why am I fighting this whole being a woman thing? This is ok\", Mia muses as her mind begins feeling the effect of the drink. The people running the spa must have everything timed just right because as Mia takes the last sip of her drink Clair walks in. \"Hello Mia, I'm Clair and I'll be taking care of you today. Before we start do you have any injuries or recent surgeries\", she says? Mia is about to bring up her bad knee, but remembers that was her old body. She first shakes her head and then remembers something. \"I had a breast augmentation a few months ago. I don't no if that matters\", Mia answers. Clair smiles and answers with, \"Not unless your back is hurting. If I may say you went all out.\" Mia blushes and replies with, \"It was my late husband's doing.\" Clair gets a shocked look and says, \"I'm so sorry.\" Mia laughs and states, \"Don't be. He was a controlling asshole who was trying to turn me into his personal sex doll. He died in a car accident shortly after forcing me to get these. I guess it's karma that he never got to enjoy them.\" Clair laughs in response and says, \"Maybe the next guy will be more deserving of you and you can let him enjoy them.\" Mia frowns at the thought of the next guy. \"Lets get started\", Clair states motioning Mia to the massage table. Mia disrobes and gets on to the table. Clair's eyes go wide upon seeing Mia's enormous breasts in all their naked glory. \"Men, poor girl\", she thinks to herself.</span></div></div>",

She may be buzzed, but not crazy enough to blow cover. \"Cover\", Mia thinks to herself! for the past couple of months she has still thought of this as being an undercover operation. \"This is my life now\", she realizes. She has known this, but for some reason it just wasn't sinking in until just now. She mentally collects herself and says, \"Not much to tell. He was rich, older than me, and at first it seemed like a good thing. In the beginning he was very charming.\" Clair laughs and remarks with, \"They're always charming at first. I've found that you look for the ones that are slightly awkward at first if you're looking for something long term. So, you say he was rich? I guess everything worked out well. You got away from him and got his money without having to go through a divorce.\" Mia muses on that and responds, \"I guess, though I do feel kind of lost now. My life was pretty laid out for me, planned. Now I don't know what to do and often wonder who I am.\" It's a mix of back story and how Mia is really feeling. She has no idea where her life is going anymore. Between getting those feelings out, the massage, and the drink Mia is getting very relaxed. She figures she should keep her mouth shut before she lets to much out. \"This feels so good. I needed this\", Mia moans. Her tension melts away and she closes her eyes. </span></div></div>",

She never realized the amount of pampering was available to women. Lunch was followed up with a facial, which was heaven. Mia hasn't ever felt so relaxed, even when she was Jack. Back then every thing was always one mission after another, cases, paperwork, and such. Jack never had much time for anything else being completely dedicated to the job. After retirement he planned on taking some time off and then maybe starting up a consulting or detective business. The accident changed all those plans. For Mia those goals seemed an ill fit for her new identity. Mia was just existing one day to the next stressed about what to do about the future. This spa day has given her the peace of mind to contemplate her future. She dwelled on these thoughts during the facial. \"I'm a woman now and maybe that's not a bad thing\", Mia thinks to herself/ A few weeks ago, or even this morning this thought would have caused her mind to lock up, but now it's just a matter of fact. The facts are she is a woman and there is no going back. Jack never believed in that transgendered crap. You were what you were and that was it. Now as Mia that hadn't changed. The difference is things had changed. Jack's mind, maybe his soul was placed in the body of a woman. Mia doesn't even ponder what makes one male or female. It's a biological thing. Now when it comes to society expectations of behavior that is where things get tougher to define. Society states certain behaviors and psychological traits are feminine while others are male. Mia had always believed this is where people get so confused. They wanted the freedom to feel and behave a certain way that society stated wasn't appropriate for there gender. That in turn caused some gender dysphoria. \"Wow, heavy thoughts\", Mia muses. None of that crap mattered to Mia anymore. Truth be told society had become very accepting and tolerant of just about everything, which at times frustrated Jack. Mia figures she could continue to enjoy football, fishing, and riding her Harley if she wanted. Well, her Harley was a bit big for her now. She could also explore what it means to be female. This was taboo to Jack. He never even allowed himself to think about it and it has taken this day for Mia to finally break down that wall.   </span></div></div>",

Mie feels a little weird about this, but figures it must be part of it. \"Yes, yes I can help you\", he states. He then gently grabs Mia by the arm and leads her to a dressing room. While doing so he start shouting out things to the other clerks in the store. Mia understands the sizes part, but most of the rest is an alien language. \"Sara will measure you for a bra, because honey you can't just let those things bounce around free. Real or fake they have to be killing your back. Jill is getting you some outfits to try on and we'll get started. George said you'll probably be looking for a complete wardrobe change, is that right\", Robert states. Mia nods her head. Robert steps out and Sara steps in and says, \"Take off your top and let's get you measured. Mia is a hesitant, but follows instructions. Sara wraps the measure tape around her. The tape touches her nipples and causes them to tingle. It's the first time someone else has touched her breasts. Sara is professional and doesn't say anything about Mia's now hard nipples. \"Oh my, you went all out didn't you\", Sara states. Mia goes over the back story again. \"Men and boobs. They all want big ones. I bet they would change their minds if they were the ones that had to lug them around\", Sara exclaims. Mia laughs and retorts with, \"I can guarantee that they would.\" Sara steps out briefly and returns with several frilly colorful bras. \"You're lucky that boob jobs are popular in this town. We have a large selection in your size and not all are the industrial looking grandma type\", Sara states. Mia's eyes go wide as she looks over what Sara has brought. \"Those are way to big. Those cups are bigger than my head\", Mia thinks to herself. She figures Sara must have sized her wrong, but figures she'll go with it and try them on. \"Holy fuck\", Mia exclaims as she discovers the first one fits perfectly! \"Am I really that big\", Mia thinks to herself? The answer is of course, yes. Soon Jill arrives with a cart full of clothe, shoes, and purses. Jill begins helping Mia try on outfits. Robert stays outside making comments as Jill walks her out after each change. Another girl runs outfits back and forth. Jill quickly trashes Mia's panties after referring to them as granny panties. Mia is a little put out by this as they were comfortable. Jill replies with something along the lines that fashion isn't always about being comfortable. Mia must admit that she is getting used to the thong Jill handed her as time passes. Mia keeps finding herself thinking, \"Damn, I'm fucking sexy as hell!\" It feels good to think this. It's the fist time Mia has felt proud and confident about her appearance since the accident that let her as a woman.</span></div></div>",

Mia doesn't have a shortage of money, but more shopping trips like this she may. \"Shouldn't have to do this again anytime soon\", Mia says to herself. Robert insisted on burning the clothes she came in with stating they were tragic. Mia put on a nice summer dress the highlights her abundant cleavage. Not that she needed any help in that department. Mia heads home thinking about having to unload her car. Robert and the girls helped her at the store, but she has no one at home. It's also getting late. She shakes her head as she realizes she's spent nearly the entire day shopping and at the spa. \"Damn, I really am a woman\", Mia laughs. Acceptance of her new life feels good. Letting go of the past and who she was is what she has been needing to do. After today she feels she really can do this. Mia pulls up to her house and starts to unload.</span></div></div>",

He looks her up and down. His expression changes as he realizes who she is. \"Jack? Holy shit, you're\", Mark exclaims! He was about to say hot, but then remembered that this is Jack. \"Mia smirks and retorts with, \"In spirit anyway.

I realize exactly what I look like in the mirror now. Can't blame you for noticing.\" Mark relaxes and helps Mia bring the rest of her bags into the house. It take a few trips. \"Shit, you bought a lot of stuff. You're not one of those high maintenance girls are you\", Mark quips? Mia cocks her head to one side and retorts with, \"I got tired trying to wear my old clothes. Today was my first official day out where I embraced my feminine side.\" Mark raises an eyebrow and says, \"Embrace your feminine side?\" Mia walks into the kitchen while replying with, \"Let's face it. This is who and what I am now. I can either cry about it, deny it, and all that, or just accept it.\" Mar decides to change the subject with, \"You got anything to drink.

That connection was with a man, his partner, his friend. There was never a physical attraction there. Mark has never even been curious that way. It's very confusing to feel physical attraction to someone he knows was a man just a few months ago. \"What the fuck is wrong with me\", Mark wonders to himself? Mark knows of course what is wrong, or rather what is right. Mia represents his ideal relationship. She a beautiful woman that he has been friends with and knows.

Something Mia noticed some time ago is that as her arousal grows so does her sensitivity. She can feel the fabric of her dress against her smooth hairless legs. One of the perks of this body she discovered early on was that the previous occupant had laser hair removal. Mia will never have to shave. Her nipples are erect to the point of almost being painful. \"Get control of yourself\", Mia tells herself. She tells herself she's only getting aroused because this is the closest she's been to a man since the change. She's a young woman and this body has desires she has denied it from satisfying for months. Well, aside from self pleasuring which Mia admits was not that satisfying. Mia glances over at Mark and recalls those times after workouts and sparring matches that she saw him in the shower. Mark is well hung. Jack never really took much noticed of this, or appreciated this fact. Mia recalls this and thinks, \"How would that feel inside me? Would it even fit?

Mia laughs and retorts with, \"I told you not to get into relationships with co-workers. I never said you shouldn't sleep with them. Gawd knows I slept with my fair share of young females around the office.\" Mark frowns at this comment. \"What's with that\", Mia asks noticing? \"It's just weird hearing you say something like that looking the way you are now. I just pictured you and that background researcher you were with just before the incident, but the way you are now\", Mark answers. Mia smiles, takes a sip of her wine, and says, \"Ah, Carrie, that was her name and I wasn't seeing her. We were just using each other for physical satisfaction. Sounds like you have some lesbian fantasies going there. You want me to pick up one of the girls over there at the bar and give you a show.\" Mark's expression goes to shock. \"Have you been doing that\", he blurts out? Mia laughs and answers, \"No, to be honest I haven't even thought about it. As weird as it sounds I don't feel, it's hard to explain. I haven't been with anyone since this.\" \"Holy shit, Jack couldn't go a week without calling up some pretty thing for a night romp\", Mark laughs. Mia sighs and replies with, \"Let's chop off your dick, give you a huge pair of tits, and see if you're in the mood to take a girl to bed.\" Mark stops laughing and says, \"I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to, you know.\" Mia shrugs and states, \"This is me now. I chose the mission knowing there might be risks. I've accepted that I'm a woman now and for the rest of my life. It's not all bad though. Having been a man for nearly 50 years and now a woman has given me some insights. I may write a book about it.\" Mark gets a thoughtful look on his face and says, \"This is like the ultimate undercover mission then. Diving deep into the mind of a woman to discover all the secrets that have eluded mankind for millennia. So, give me some previews. What can you tell me about the mind of a woman?\" Mia bursts out laughing and then replies with, \"I'm still working on it, but I'm starting to believe that women don't even understand women.\" </span></div></div>",

Damn, I'd have to contort myself just to see down there past these ridiculous breasts.\" \"You could have the implants removed\", Mark suggests. \"I thought about it once or twice. I even spoke with a doctor about it. She said it was best if I could wait until after I completely healed from the first surgery and even then it would be complicated because I have such a large augmentation. I any case I just spent a small fortune today for a new wardrobe. I'd have to that all over again if I got rid of these. You have no idea how complicated shopping for women's clothes is.\" Mark shrugs and says, \"Looks like you got it down. You look gorgeous.\"  Mia blushes and then wonders why she's excited about Mark thinking she's gorgeous. \"Damn these nipples\", Mia thinks to herself. \"Fuck, I just told Jack, Mia that she's gorgeous.

Shit, he even caught himself aiming for the pot holes. He catches himself more than once imagining reaching over and touching her exposed thigh. The dress Mia is wearing shows just enough to tease without being slutty. \"Why am I doing this to myself? This is Jack, his mind anyway\", Mark tells himself. All during dinner he caught himself having thoughts he shouldn't. Mark is good looking and a great guy, but has never really hit it off perfect with any woman. No here is Mia, which in all respects is his dream girl. Mark has always had a bit of an Asian fetish. He's also a boob man, though Mia has the ass to. Not a combination you find to often in Asian women. Yet here she is. They're friends and have known each other for years. She knows him probably better than anyone else. The rub is she was a nearly 50 year old man just a few months ago. \"This is the universe fucking with me\", Mark thinks to himself. By the time he pulls into Mia's driveway his cock is throbbing and he's wondering how he's going to hide it from Mia. \"Shit, she'll be horrified I'm thinking of her like that. The crap she had to go through these past months\", Mark thinks to himself. He formulates a plan. He parks the car but doesn't get out. \"Ok, here we are safe and sound. I'll see you tomorrow\", Mark states. Mia gives him a weird look. \"You're not staying here like usual\", Mia asks? \"Fuck, I usually do stay here when I visit. If I don't stay she'll know something's up, but if I do, fuck\", Mark says in his head.

The answer is a simple one, but Mia doesn't want to accept it. So much has changed. Mark adjusts himself while Mia looks away thinking. She's afraid he might see the look on her face. He's afraid she'll see the lump in his pants. She walks into the house with her back to him. \"Thank gawd.

A quick check in the mirror reveals that it leaves little to the imagination. Mia can practically see her areolas through the thin material. \"When Mark sees me in this there will be only one thing he'll be thinking about\", Mia says to herself. It excites her thinking this. She knows she probably shouldn't be feeling this way, thinking this way. She was a man just a few months ago, a very straight man. Jack would have never even thought about doing what Mia is imagining now. \"I'm not Jack anymore\", Mia says to herself. She steps back out into the living room. Despite her new outlook she still feels very nervous about this. She remembers her mom used to keep wine in the garage refrigerator. The wine from the restaurant is starting to wear off some and she feels she needs a little more help if she's going to go through with this. Mark doesn't even look back as she walk past. \"The game will be on in a few minutes. They're getting ready to sing the anthem\", he says out loud. Mia retrieves the wine from the refrigerator and discovers some beer there to. She grabs one of those for Mark and pours herself a glass of wine. Since becoming Mia she's lost her taste for beer. She heads back to the living room and sits beside Mark. \"I found some beer in the garage refrigerator I forgot about\", she states handing it to him. \"Thinks\" Mark says and then looks over at her. His jaw drops and he stutters, \"Damn!\" Mia smiles and says, \"I got this today. Does it look good on me?\" \"You, you look really good\", Mark states suddenly feeling cock throbbing. Mia takes a long sip of her wine and with a smile asks, \"Do I look like a woman?\" Mark gulps his beer and nods his head. \"What the fuck is going on here? I must be dreaming\", he thinks to himself. Mia can't stand it anymore. She sets her wine down and straddles Mark's lap. She can eel his erection pressing against her. This drives her arousal through the roof. She can feel herself practically dripping. \"Why don't you take a closer look\", Mia whispers in his ear. </span></div></div>",

He wants this woman that is so eager to give herself to him, but the rational part of him is screaming that this is Jack. In the end that rational voice loses out. Mark grabs Mia in his arms and pulls the straps of her nighty down exposing those breasts that have been teasing him all day. \"I want you\", Mark blurts out surprising himself with this admission. This is mostly because in his heart he really does. They kiss while Mia unbuttons his shirt, her hands shaking with anticipation. She's excited and scared at the same time. This is a huge step, but a good ending to this day. Today was the day she finally accepted her new life and given up on her former identity as a man. It seemed like fate that Mark chose this day to visit. Like what is happening right now was meant to be. \"I am so wet for you right now\", Mia moans as her hands move to his pants. She intends to free his monster that she has felt throbbing against her womanhood. She gets off his lap and jerk his pants down. Mark's cock springs erect and at first catches Mia off guard with its size. When she was Jack she saw him in the shower after their workout and it never appeared this huge. Of course back then Mark didn't have an erection. \"Oh my gawd\", she stammers wondering how in the world this is going to fit inside her. She starts to have second thoughts about this endeavor. Things have gone to far to stop now as Mark takes over. He lifts Mia off the floor in his strong arms. She instinctively wraps her legs around him. She can feel his cock pressing against her clit just throbbing for her. His desire for her feeds hers. He carries her to the bedroom and lays her on her back on the bed. \"Oh shit, here it comes. He's going to split me in half\", Mia thinks to herself.</span></div></div>",

Back when she was still Jack, Mark would often boast about his talented tongue. \"Holy shit\", Mia screams as she discovers Mark was not exaggerating. \"This is better than any blow job. How can this feel so good\", Mia wonders? Mark sucks her clit and then starts to finger her pussy. \"Oh shit\", Mia screams as she climaxes! \"That was easy\", Mark thinks to himself. Mia's orgasm is just starting to subside when she feels something pressing against her. She quickly realizes what it is. \"Oh no\", she gasps! \"I'll be gentle\", Mark says. Mark presses just the tip in, but it feels like a train to Mia. It hurts and feels good at the same time. \"I'm going in a little more. You are so tight. Just relax\", Mark states. \"It's never going to fit\", Mia thinks. Mia tries to relax and Mark pushes further in. It still hurts, but Mia feels the pleasure building. Mark pulls out some and them pushes back in. The pains quickly fades and there is only pleasure. Mia thinks back about how women Jack had been with complained when he raced to bury his cock in them. Mia now understands why. \"Oh yes, fuck me\", Mia screams! Mia is overwhelmed with sensations and emotions. Here she is underneath a man with his cock pumping her pussy. She can feel it inside her throbbing. Her tits are bouncing with every thrust. She is completely female. Mia grabs her tits and pinches her nipples. Mia wants more. She wants to feel it all. She feels herself getting close again. \"I'm about to cum\", she moans and Mark quickens his thrusts. \"Oh yes\", she gasps as she climaxes for a second time. At the same time Mark grunts and buries himself deep inside her. Mia feels something hot explode and spread out inside her. \"He just came inside me\", Mia realizes. Mark holds his cock there and Mia can feel his pulse syncing with hers. It's an amazing feeling. Mark starts to pull out and Mia for a second begins to feel empty. Mark then thrusts back inside her, still hard. \"Oh yes\", Mia moans. </span></div></div>",

Mia smiles and thinks, \"Mmm, morning wood.\" She gently grinds her ass against Mark's erection. He sleeps on, worn out from last night. Mia also catches a whiff of herself. Another thing she has noticed since becoming a woman is a greater sense of smells. Kind of explains a mystery that eluded Jack for decades. Why women feel the need to sniff everything? Also explains why women are offended by men's farts when they never seemed that bad to Jack. \"Oh, I need a shower before anything else\", Mia mutters. She unwraps herself from Mark and heads for the bathroom. She starts the shower and just makes it to the toilet as her bladder gives up resisting. As a man she could hold it for hours on a stakeout. Mia doubts she could make it 20minutes before wetting herself. \"Ah, the perks of being a woman\", Mia thinks to herself. Her thoughts then drift back to last night and how often Mark brought her orgasm. \"Completely worth it\", she giggles. Mia feels complete in a weird sort of way. Until yesterday she was foolishly kept thinking of herself as a man trapped in a woman's body. Now everything seems so much clearer. Mia gets into the shower and starts thinking about the things her future may hold now she's accepted her fate, her womanhood. \"Maybe I'll really write a book\", Mia thinks. She was joking when she told Mark that yesterday, but now. Mia muses over titles for a book about the inner workings of the female mind written from the prospective that a man could understand. \"My Life Undercover as a Woman\", Mia says out loud.</span></div></div>",

The smooth coolness of the robe over her nipples causes them to grow hard. \"Feels good to be a woman\", Mia moans as she can't help but touch them. They're only a little sore from Mark sucking on them last night. The coffee maker beeps alerting her the coffee is ready. This jars her back to the present. She fixes a cup and starts thinking about today. Her thoughts drift back to Mark. She then wonders, \"I've been so caught up in how I'm feeling I haven't considered how Mark may feel about this.

He's not ready to speak to Mia yet until he sorts out his feelings, if he even can. Just thinking of her naked in the shower has gotten him aroused. Then she goes and sits on the bed bedside him. For what seems like forever she's quiet. Mark wonders for a second if she left and then she goes and pulls the sheet off him exposing his erection. \"Good grief, there it is. She knows\", Mark thinks. Mark cracks his eyelid and notices she seems fixated on his cock. \"What is she doing\", Mark wonders? For a second she seems as if she's going to go down on him. She then suddenly leaps up and heads out of the bedroom. Mark lets out a sigh. A short wile later he smells coffee brewing. \"Can't stay here all day\", he tells himself. Mark gats up, uses the bathroom, and rinses off in the shower. He can't stop thinking about Mia and last night. He feels an ache inside, an ache for her. He knows what it means. He's falling for this woman, for Jack. Despite all logic he knows he'll go for it. \"I must be crazy, but I have to know. I have to try\", he says to his reflection. Mark walks out into the kitchen and sees Mia with her back turned to him. Her silky robe clings to her body teasing him. His heart begins to race. Mia turns around unsure how this morning after what happened is going to go. She notices the weird way Mark is looking at her and fears the worse. \"I moved to fast last night and ruined it\", she thinks. She looks at Mark and says, \"Mark, about last night. I'm sorry if I made things weird for you. I'll understand.\" Mark cuts her off with a hug and a kiss. \"Last night was incredible. I can honestly say I've never felt this way for any woman before\", Mark admits. Mia's heart flutters at Mark's admission. It's everything she was hoping for, but now she's afraid. This is unchartered territory. Jack always avoided emotional attachments. Now as Mia she's running into one with Mark. She then realizes something Jack buried. She was already emotionally attached to Mark. Jack never thought about sleeping with Mark. Jack was straight, but now. \"Fuck, don't overthink this\", Mia tells herself and jumps on Mark wrapping her legs around him. </span></div></div>",

Then accepting the mission which by any measurement was unusual. Then there was the double bombing and the revelation the previous occupant of the body was a Yakuza assassin. Add in there Stan not telling Jack that the cover for the procedure was a boob job. Jack had prepared himself for the fact he was becoming a woman for the mission, but the boobs was a factor he hadn't prepared for.

He knows full well he didn't. Jack and him had come down to the house several times together on vacation to go fishing. He recognizes this woman as the same he briefly met several weeks ago. \"Yeah, but it's Mia now. Weren't you briefed\", Mia scoffs. She feels a little embarrassed having Jack's rookie partner see her now. A few weeks ago was worse. She has found it best to separate her life from before the incident from her life now, in mind anyway. \"Come in, I'm guessing you're here because Stan has asked you to change my mind about retirement\", Mia states as Mark walks in.

Love for this guy, her friend? Guilt because he's in pain and she's the cause? Maybe regret because seeing her instead of Jack can't be making him feel better? Perhaps it's all those things. Mia stands there unsure of what to do for several minutes. If Jack had died completely Mark may have gotten over it, but knowing that everything that made Jack, Jack now resides in the body of a woman named Mia, well it's different. \"I'm sorry for all of this\", Mia says sitting down beside Mark. She throws her arm over his shoulder as Jack used to. For neither one of does it feel like it did before. Mark glances over only to find himself checking out Mia's tits as she's wearing a low cut top. He immediately curses himself for checking out Jack's tits. He also wonders if Jack did this on purpose to screw with him, but dismisses this thought as crazy. Her touch and the sight of her tits causes a stiring in his cock. He curses himself again. Mia notices her friend seems even more distressed after she put her arm around his shoulder. Feels wierd now that her arm is now slender and feminine. She then realizes what's reason and glances down to see a growing budge in Mark's pants. \"Oh shit, I'm turning him on\", Mia thinks to herself. Thoughts of riding some man's cock that she's been banishing from her mind return, but this time the man has a face. She pulls her arm away rom Mark quickly. Her nipples tingle and she knows that they're growing hard. \"Shit, he'll see them\", she thinks and gets up turning away from him. She quietly curses her body for making her think and feel these things. Trying to distracterself and Mark she says, \"I was just about to head to Gino's for lunch. Come with me a we'll have a few drinks and catch up. You can tell me about my funeral. Hope you said something nice about me.\" Mark is thankful for the out. If Jack, well Mia had seen his chubby it would have been awkward. \"Sounds good\", Mark replies and readjusts himself now that Mia has her back turned. \"Gawd, what an ass! Shit, what is wrong with me, it's Jack? Man, I should have gotten laid before coming down here. Who knew I would be turned on by Jack\", Mark thinks' to himself. He's feeling so conflicted right now and regretting his decession to come down here. \"Lunch, check into a hotel, and head back home tommorow\", he say to himself feeling out of sorts about what just happened.</span></div></div>",

Jack would have retired to Florida at 49years old and spent the rest of his years fishing and riding his Harley, alone. Mia is a youthful 22years old with her life ahead of her. This feeling of a fresh start fills her with excitement. Mia rolls over on top of Mark, pinning him down. \"Do you want to spend the rest of the day like this, or go out and do something\", Mia asks? The feel of Mark's chest hairs tickle her nipples and she starts feeling her arousal start to come to life. \"This body is amazing. As Jack I wouldn't have been interested after fucking for two hours. Then again, maybe it's this amazing man under me\", Mia thinks.

Nicki really knows a lot about being a woman and working it. \"Mia\", Nicki says placing her face in front of Mia.

You must have felt something for him if you jumped him like that. Something you may not have even admitted to yourself. A few drinks isn't going to suddenly turn you from friends to lovers. There had to be something already there. I say go for it and see where it goes.\" Mia shakes her head and retorts with, \"I don't think you have the whole picture. Back when we worked together I was somebody else. That person would have never done what I did.\" Nicki shrugs and replies with, \"Well, you just said you're not that person anymore. Maybe this new Mia wants more out of this guy than the old Mia. It seems he may want more to. Go with your heart, girl. Regret is worse than a broken heart.\" Mia falls quiet thinking about what Nicki has said. \"Jack would have never done that, but I'm Jack\", Mia thinks as she goes over Nicki's advice.</span></div></div>",

Best friend he's known for years who just happens to now have the body of Mark's ideal woman. \"What's done is done. I wonder where Mia went?

Mia counts the rounds and awaits the pause. \"You're out, bitch\", Mia mutters and springs up with her pistol. Nicki has worked her way up the walkway and made it almost to the door. She's already dropped the empty magazine and is about to slam in a new one. \"Nicki, drop the weapon, or I'll drop you\", Mia shouts! Nicki shouts something else in Japanese and finishes inserting the magazine. \"Don't\", Mia shouts to the woman that she had thought of as a friend.

She curses herself for freezing. Stan runs up and says, \"Mark, get her to safe house 127 and I'll clean this up with the locals.\" Mark and Mia run inside and grab her bugout bag.

He doesn't respond to Mia's comment and the ride is quiet for a while. Mia sits over in the passenger seat wondering just what the hell is wrong with her. This whole situation has forced her to explore who she really is. As Jack she thought she had a pretty good idea. Jack was settled into a routine where he had to do very little self exploration. \"I'm not Jack anymore\", Mia tells herself for the millionth time sine the change.

She knows what it is now. \"Shit, I'm in love with him\", she thinks to herself. Even as she fantasizes about a life with him she also wonders how such a thing could ever work. \"Would he ever see me as a real woman, or just a man trapped in a woman's body pretending to be one\", Mia wonders? At the same time she wonders if she's pretending to be a woman anymore. Sleeping with Mark wasn't pretending. She wanted to be with him, wanted him inside her. Mia feels a shudder of fear build inside her as she wonders if there is anything male left in her persona. Another part wonders why should even hang on to that identity.

Mark has Mia wakes in the car while he checks in. Mia feels he's being a little to protective, but also understands it's his job. It was Mia's job at one time when she was still Jack. Once in the room Mia sorts through her purse and starts disposing of anything identifying her as Mia. She left her cell phone back at her place. \"Guess I'll need another new identity.

Back on stakeouts when he did this it always bothered Jack, but now as Mia it causes other emotions to stir. She can see Mark getting the rest of the way undressed.

To go with it could make things even stranger. Mia can see he needs a little more convincing. She then does something Jack would never have done. She drops to her knees and takes Mark's cock into her mouth. She thought she would have been revolted by such an act and as Jack she would have been.

It's more physical, spiritual, and emotional than anything I ever experienced as a man. Physically, as a man everything was more or less focused on my cock.

She knew this would be part of the mission, but knowing and experiencing are two different things. There is a possibility she'll have to sleep with this disgusting piece of filth before killing him. This nearly makes her puke. Maria nearly throws up thinking this. \"Oh my dear, Phillip, help Maria to her room\", the husband shouts. A man Maria can only guess is Phillip shows up and takes her arm. Maria feels the butt of his gun press against her as he helps her to her room. He doesn't say a word and is very professional. Maria considers for a second of just ending this mission now by taking Phillip's gun and putting two rounds into her new husbands head. That would probably be frowned upon though. Once in her room, Maria looks around. By all the feminine things around Maria guesses they do not share a room. This was also suspected in the profile she read. Maria is strictly a trophy of a sorts. She was the daughter of a friend and partner that died rather quickly. It was suspected that her new husband has something to do with it. The separate bedrooms may not be a good sign. It indicates he doesn't entirely trust his bride. Maria/Jack starts searching around the room to find information that will fill in the gaps left out by the profile. She finds Maria's phone and laptop and garners some more information, but not much more. Maria doesn't seem to have any friends. \"Very sad life\", she mutters. \"Fuck, these boobs\", Maria moans. The pain killers are starting to wear off and she is starting to feel the pain from the breast augmentation. She digs around her purse and finds the pain pills. Chances are they will knock her out, but it's worth it. \"Why do women do this to themselves\", Maria wonders? The answer in her case is because her mob boss husband wanted it done. Maria/Jack shakes her head and downs two of the pills. A few minutes later they start kicking. Maria starts becoming drowsy soon after. \"Need a nap before getting started\", Maria says to herself.

Phillip grabs Maria's arm and starts moving towards the back of the house. Everything is happening very fast and Maria cannot see much as Phillip keeps jerking her around. \"Fuck\", he shouts as he stumbles back and fires his weapon three times. He then falls to the floor dead. Maria hears more gunfire at the front of the house. She peaks around the corner at the rear door and sees two men. One is down and the other is checking on him. Maria/Jack's training kicks in. He grabs Phillip's gun and keys. She rounds the corner and catches the men off guard. She putts two rounds in the head of the uninjured man and one into the injured one before making her way out the back door. She scans the area quickly. Phillip must have had an escape planned if he was heading this way, but what it was he didn't tell her.

It'll only be a matter of minutes before they find her. That means only enough time to try one and it better be the right one.

Maria is also handicapped by bandages wrapped around her chest from the surgery. Also her hips seem oddly wide causing her entire pelvis to gyrate while running. Maria can only imagine what her ass looks like, but from the jiggling flesh she's certain she would have appreciated the sight when she was a man. Maria makes it to the SUV and checks behind her.

She then goes to carefully open the door only to set off the alarm. \"Fuck, fuck\", she thinks. She quickly jumps into the SUV and starts it. She doesn't even bother to see if the men are coming because she knows they are. She slams it into drive and floors it just as she hears rounds hitting metal. She's nearly a half mile away before she looks in the rearview mirror. There's no one there yet, but she knows there will be. Her best bet is to get out of town. After things settle down she'll contact HQ and if they don't already know tell them the mission is a bust. With the Torres family taking out Mario there will be all sorts of bad people on the streets trying to collect the pieces. Maria will be one of those pieces being the wife of the dead boss. \"Fuck me\", Maria mutters realizing the situation she's in. She races a ew more miles down the road and with no signs of pursuit pulls over into a mall parking lot to blend in with the other cars. She then begins taking an inventory of what she has. In the car she finds more guns, ammunition, some drugs, and several rolls of cash stashed in several spots. Thankfully, Phillip liked to be prepared. Maria grabs a bag she finds and stuffs with more ammunition and the cash she found. Concealing the rifles and several guns seem pointless and drugs she doesn't need. Ditching the SUV as the Torres men saw it is the next step. This is easy as mall parking lots this time of the year attract thieves. Maria scans the parking lot using her police training and sees a couple of young men casing the parking lot. To the trained eye it's obvious what they're doing. She quickly makes the remaining guns in the SUV unusable, pulls over next to them, and parks. As she walks away from the SUV she absently drops her keys. She hears the SUV speeding of before she even makes it to the doors of the mall. \"Now for a change of wardrobe\", Maria says walking into the mall. </span></div></div>",

Maria exits the mall and looks around. It'' gotten dark in the time she was in the mall. Even though she's confident that her change in appearance is drastic enough to not get her noticed by the wrong people she scans the parking lot. It's starting to get dark and she's been in one area to long as it is. \"I need to go somewhere to lay low\", she says to herself. Catching a cab could be risky as crime families run the cab companies, but is the best way to get out of the area. She flags down a cab and gets in. \"Take me to the Marriot on 26th street\", she tells the driver. It's two blocks from HQ in case things aren't as bad as she fears. Luckily, the driver doesn't attempt any small talk, but just stares at her tits. \"Fuck, I wish I took more pain killers. These boobs are killing me\", Maria mumbles to herself. She ditched the bandages that were holding them tight to get the new look she was going after. The surgery only left a small incision under each breast, but that is just where the bra is sitting. Not mention the stretching they must have done to get the implants in. The pain is really starting to get to her. The cab pulls up to the Hotel, she pays the driver, and heads in. After a sob story about getting mugged at the airport the girl at the hotel 's front desk lets her get a room without any ID and pay in cash. Once settled in the room Maria quickly sets up the cell phone she bought. Immediately afterwards she calls HQ. She tells the call taker she's Jack Turner's sister to get through to the boss. He's one of the few that knew about the mission and one of the few Jack trusts. He picks up and says, \"Jack doesn't have a sister, so who the fuck is this?\" Maria calms herself and replies, \"It's Jack, Stan, what the hell is going on? I just barely got away from Mario's and then I see on TV that I'm dead, well Jack Turner is dead. I'm I being burned, is that it?\" There is a pause before Stan comes back and says, \"Fuck, we thought you died in the attack, Jack. As for the other thing, no, you're not being burned. You'd better come in. There was a complication. That's all I can tell you over the phone. Come through the front tomorrow morning and ask for me. I'll walk you in.\" Maria/Jack hangs up not feeling completely comforted by the call. She strips off the bra right after feeling much better.

Also, what happened to the real Maria and Jack's male body. Were they planning on putting her, well him into witness protection, or something thinking that Jack in Maria's body was dead? That would make sense. What are they going to do now that she isn't dead? A public retraction that Jack Turner was thought dead, but got better isn't plausible. \"Oh gawd, what about Carrie and the kids\", Maria thinks as she turns in her sleep? It makes her sick thinking that they told her wife and kids that she was dead. \"Shit, Carrie is probably loosing her mind\", Maria thinks nearly crying. Before she knows it the alarm is going off to get up. She feels like shit as she heads for the bathroom. A shower does little to change her mood. She just wants this nightmare to end. Best case scenario is a trip to HQ, switch back, and think of someway to explain this to Carrie. She can't see how the mission can be salvaged after the colossal way things just went to shit.

It's the morgue, or rather stiff storage for the agency's medical examiner. \"What's going on\", Maria/Jack asks again getting concerned. Stan walks over to a storage door, opens it, and slides out a tray with a body on it. Maria/Jack gasps because it's not just any body, it's Jack's body. Maria chokes up and stops breathing for a minute. When she finally remembers to breath again she shouts, \"What the fuck is this! I'm dead! Oh fuck, worse I'm stuck like this aren't I?\" Maria nearly backs away from her former body and nearly falls over. \"Jack, I'm sorry\", Stan says. \"How, how the hell did this happen\", Maria asks with tears starting to form. She feels as if she's died. In a way the man she used to be Jack, has died. Her previous life as Jack flashes before her eyes along with all the things she's going to miss now. Jack will never kiss his wife again, throw a ball to his son, or walk his little girl down the isle someday. \"Oh fuck\", Maria mutters trembling. Stan catches Maria and says, \"It happened during the transfer. We didn't tell you then because you would have freaked out and the mission would have been jeopardized.\"  Maria shakes her head in disbelief. The crap she just went through for the past 24hours was a waste. She's now trapped in the body of a mobster's barely legal age trophy wife for what it appears for the rest of her life. The life she knew is gone and all Stan can say is, sorry. \"Sorry, what the fuck happen to me now, my life, my family, and my fucking career. Don't even start with you knew this career was dangerous shit. I knew I could get killed, but at least if I was dead I wouldn't be around to see, see all , fuck me\", Maria screams. She finally stops fighting it and let the tears flow. The Jack part of her says it's not very manly to cry, especially in front on Stan, but then again she's not a man anymore and looks like she never will be. Stan is at a loss. Like most men he has no idea how to handle an emotional woman. He lets Maria cry for a bit and then says, \"Until we get this figured out I'll set you up in a safe house. I'll assign two agents that don't know about this mission for a protection detail.

She brings this up to the doctor, but he informs her she'll have to wait due to the swelling from the surgery. Maria finds some comfort knowing that they're not going to stay this big that some of it is swelling. Then it's over to the scientist that performed the transfer. \"I'm sorry about this, Jack, Maria. This was the first field deployment of this tech. We performed hundreds of trials before using this and did not have any problems. The best we can determine is that in those trials the participants were screened and prepared. The original Maria was not. My guess is that her mind rejected the transfer and just shut down. Looking over her profile it seems she was also suffering from depression. This may have been a contributing factor\", the scientist explains. It all sounds like, \"Bla, bla, bla\", to Maria. None of t matters at this point. The nitty gritty of it is that she's stuck like this. Jack's life is gone, his family gone, and his career he's worked on for nearly to decades is gone. Jack understood the dangers of his chosen profession. He understood that he could be killed, but never did he imagine he would have to witness it. See the aftermath of it and have to continue to live on after he died. Yet, here she is stuck as a busty young woman that was born at the same time Jack was going into the academy. \"Get me out of here, Stan\", Maria finally says cutting off the scientist.

He had clear ideas about the roles of women and men. Unlike some guys out there Jack never fantasized about being a woman. He was very happy being a man. He enjoyed having a dick and had used it extensively before getting married and only less so after getting married. He had gotten married much later than many of his peers as he enjoyed the single life. Love them and leave them had been his motto. Women exist mainly to bring men enjoyment. He only got married because it would help his career and he found Carrie. She was the perfect little submissive housewife. Just the kind of girl Jack liked, controllable. \"Oh fuck\", Jack mutters looking at her reflection. Her mind does summersaults trying to rationalize and figure out her new role in life. Female Jack still possesses many of the chauvinistic beliefs male Jack had, but now has to apply to herself. Her mind reels back and forth. Things seem very different now that she is subject to Jack's rules of female behavior. \"Fucking shit\", Jack shouts! She flings the bottle at the mirror shattering it. The Scotch had already started affecting her. \"Few shots and I'm already buzzed. I'm going to be great fun at parties\", Jack mumbles. Jack envisions herself as the drunk slut at the party everyone is trying to bang. \"That's me now, nothing but a piece of fuck meat, a fucking cum dump\", Jack states slurring her words. </span></div></div>",

She rummages through the kitchen and finds a partial bottle of Bourbon. There's not much left, but she figures since she's already buzzed from the little bit of Scotch she drank it should be enough. It's one of the few plusses of this body she's been able to find. As she heads back to the bedroom she finds both of he agents watching TV. \"Great job keeping an eye on me rookies\", she thinks to herself. She then overhears the male agent say, \"I can't believe we lost an agent.\" Jack looks over at the TV and sees his picture again along with coverage of the gang violence currently going on in the city. \"Good riddance, he was a total ass and not nearly as good as he thought he was\", the female agent responds. \"I never had an issue with him\", the male responds. \"That is because you have a dick. If you were a woman Jack only had one use for you aside from getting him coffee. He's the reason Jackson left. She made a complaint about his behavior and the director took Jack's side.

When he found out it was a female he would riding in he started to chicken out. Sure, Jack could have ordered him, but he had to be the tough guy. He had to be the agent that wasn't scared of any mission, or so he told himself. Jack take another swig from the bottle and looks in the mirror. She feels a rush seeing herself like this. \"Could I have wanted this somehow\", Jack thinks for a second before trying to force the thought away? Jack takes another swig from the bottle and reflects on her life. She could have retired a few years ago, but kept going. He was already referred by the other agents as, \"Old Man\". Jack had respect though and he used that to lure young female agents. For the first time Jack starts feeling some guilt over that. \"Fuck, whatever\", Jack mumbles and takes another drink. She stumbles back and falls on the bed. She barely keeps from spilling the bourbon. The wards the young female agent said in the living room come back to haunt her.

Just a couple of days ago she'd been staring at a penis, now all she sees is a pussy, a cunt. Jack's drunken looks at it somewhat bemused. She's seen plenty of pussies in her day, but this is the first time she's had one of her own. \"How many cocks have been in you sweetheart\", Jack asks slurring her words? Jack takes another swig and says, \"Well, I hoped you enjoyed it because Jack is not letting any cocks near him, well her.\" Jack gives her pussy a little pat and nearly gasps from the sensation. \"Fuck, that felt good\", Jack mumbles amazed at how patting her clit felt. Curious, Jack reaches her hand down again, spreads her lips, and gives her clit a gentle rub. \"Oh fuckkkkk\", Jack moans! Jack wonders why girls always seem hard to get if it feels this good just from a gentle brush. Jack reaches down again much more deliberately. Part of her is appalled, but another part of her says, \"It's my pussy, I can touch it if I want to. It's no different than jerking off.\" Jack soon discovers that it feels way better than jerking off as she continues to rub and then finger herself. While she pleasures herself with one hand she takes another swig using the other hand. As she does she notices the long neck of the Bourbon bottle and gets an idea. It's something she always wanted to try, but Carrie was never willing to try. Jack looks at the bottle and then at her pussy. It seems like a good idea.</span></div></div>",

She then remembers why it tastes like shit. \"Fuck\", Jack shouts and goes to run for the bathroom. Before she can empty her bladder Jack empties her stomach. \"I can't believe I did that last night and enjoyed it\", Jack thinks to herself. Jack's world view is shaken. He always believed men had it better than women in every regard. While she still believes this is probably true in many respects she's starting to believe when it comes to sex women may have it better. Last night was insane. \"I must have cum like six times\", Jack thinks recalling. As a man Jack never would have been able to do that. Even in Jack's prime the record was three. A thought crosses Jack's mind, \"What would a real cock feel like?\" The thought horrifies her as soon as she has it. \"Damn it, Jack get a hold of yourself. You're not some sissy cock craving bitch. Might be stuck in a woman's body, but don't need to be doing that. You are, well were a man. It's got to be the Bourbon still talking\", Jack says to herself.

Just imagine the things I could do. With all this feminism girl power shit everybody has bought into I could really go further than I ever did as a man.

I'm guessing you never told Carrie that you got it after your mom passed. If you did let me know and I'll make other arrangements. We obtained Maria's clothes from the crime scene so you'll have something to wear until you can buy your own. I've cleared Mark to drive you down to Florida.

You know, taking over from the master as the last real man among a bunch of PC pussies.\" Mark shakes his head and answers, \"No, I learned my lesson with Natalie.\" Jack scrunches her forehead and says, \"I thought you were getting along with her pretty well.

No sooner has Mark left a man comes up. \"Hey babe, now that your man is gone, how about a dance\", he states. Jack frowns and answers, \"No, and he's not my man.\" Jack goes to turn back around. The man grabs her by her shoulder and turns her back around. \" A pretty girl like you needs a man.

Before he can move Mark grabs his arm and throws the man to the floor. \"Stay down, or you're going to have a world of hurt\", Mark states. Mark then grabs Jack by the hand and heads back to the room. The incident rattles Jack. She's never felt this helpless before, this weak. If it hadn't been for Mark. Jack shudders thinking about what would have happened. This is a serious blow to Jack's ego. They make it safely back to the room. Jack's legs go wobbly as the adrenaline wears off. Mark catches her before she can fall. \"Easy there, Jack\", he says. Jack looks up at Mark with a different feeling now. He's gone from a friend to a hero. \"Thank you, for that back there\", Jack says. Mark smiles and replies with, \"Anything for my best friend.\" Something about this whole situation causes Jack body to warm and her nipples go hard. Jack understand right away what's happening. \"Oh fuck, I'm horny for Mark\", she thinks to herself. Jack pushes away and says, \"I'm going to hit the sack. See you in the morning.\" Jack heads for the bed. \"Yeah, see you in the morning, Jack\", Mark says. Jack hears Mark get into his bed. Jack lays there horny and confused. She can hear Mark breathing and it only serves to cause her to have strange unmanly thoughts. She wonders if Mark would feel better than the bottle. The drinks along with the adrenaline hangover only serves to make thinking straight worse. Jack remember seeing Jack in the shower after a workout, but now that memory has a different affect on her. Jack imagines what it would be like riding that thick cock of his. \"Fuck, stop this\", Jack thinks to herself. Try as she might she can't get the thought out of her head. \"I need to relieve some tension\", she thinks. She gets up and tiptoes to the bathroom. She sorts through the suitcases of Maria's clothes finding a some sexy lingerie and puts it on. \"Oh fuck, I'm one sexy bitch\", Jack moans softly. Jack keeps thinking about Mark and her fingers just don't seem to be getting what she needs. \"I could just go in there and fuck his brains out\", Jack thinks. Part of her is repulsed by the thought, but a larger part needs this. \"It's just sex and I'm a woman now\", she thinks. Even as she thinks it she doubts it. What she feels for Mark is more.  </span></div></div>",

She tosses around as the thought digs at her. \"Just rub one out and get it over with. Yeah, with Mark sleeping right over on the chair\", Jack thinks. The thought that he may wake up and catch her excites her a little. \"Maybe he would help me out\", she thinks not even trying stop the thoughts coming anymore. \"Stupid\", she mumbles.  </span></div></div>",

As soon as she starts falling asleep the dreams come again and she awakes again. The last thing she wants to have happen is Mark hearing her moaning like some slut in her sleep, or is it. That thought knags at her, the thought Jack is now turned on by men, or rather cocks. \"I should have never gotten drunk and fucked myself with that bottle\", Jack thinks cursing herself. She now knows it would feel good to get fucked by a big thick cock. Jack keeps telling herself that it's wrong to have these sissy ass thoughts. \"I'm not a fucking fag\", Jack says to herself. Her new body tells her differently. She's no sissy, or a fag. She's now a woman with needs. It doesn't matter if those needs conflict with her previous life as a man. They're still very much real. She resigns herself to the very real reality that she will eventually give in, or go mad. She looks over at Mark sleeping and thinks, \"Not with Mark. That would be to humiliating. Let him remember me as the old Jack.\" Jack returns to her fervent sleep.</span></div></div>",

She can still smell whatever perfume that she bought from the mall still on her. She then remembers that she keeps putting on the same clothes. \"I'll have to find something else to wear today. Can't keep wearing that outfit\", Jack thinks while lathering up. Just feeling her hands running over her body is enough to turn her on. Her nipples go hard at just a touch. \"Fine\", Jack grumbles to tired to fight it anymore. She fingers her slit thinking of the dream she had about Mark fucking her. \"Oh shit, yes\", Jack quietly moans cumin hard within seconds! Jack feels ashamed, what remains of the male Jack anyway. Jack's evolving female self image feels nothing but some relief and the warm afterglow. Even still Jack craves to be pressed up against somebody else, a male somebody with them thrusting inside her. Jack fingers herself frantically trying to drive these thoughts back down. She again orgasms. \"What have I become\", Jack thinks already knowing the answer? She get out of the shower and dries off before she is tempted to try for a third.

You're one nice piece of ass, Jack\" Jack snorts, \"Hope you enjoyed that, dick\" This is what Jack says, but she is actually a little flattered by Mark's comment and also by the bulge in his pants. Mark attempts to hide it as he gets up to head for the bathroom. Jack can't resist taking a dig at Mark. \"Glad to see ole Jack could give you a hardon.\" Mark turns red and retorts with, \"Don't flatter yourself.

It would be the logical thing to do. Jack settles on a skimpy dress made of some stretchy material. It clings to her body and really showcases her breast's new size. \"At least I won't be popping any buttons off\", Jack grumbles. Jack checks herself in the mirror and sighs. Again there is this beautiful young woman staring back at her. Her reflection is still unfamiliar. \"This is me for the rest of my life\", Jack thinks. This thought hits Jack like a train. She has been subconsciously pushing this thought out of her mind. \"Oh fuck\", Jack mumbles as she feels her knees get weak. Thoughts race through her head. \"This is permanent. This is not a one week, or a couple of weeks until the mission is over, but permanent. They're going to have my funeral tomorrow and put my body in the ground\", Jack thinks. Jack goes over her life up till now, her life as a man. \"It's all gone\", Jack stammers. Jack attempts to tamper back down these thoughts, but it's no use. This is far beyond her coping skills. For the first time in her life Jack does not know the path in front of her, no real plans and no idea how to be what she has become. Jack is emotionally overwhelmed. Tears start to form in her eyes. Jack gets the urge to run, but what she wants to get away from cannot be gotten away from, her new reality as a woman.</span></div></div>",

Just imagine what you can do now\" \"Like what, win a swimsuit competition\", Jack retorts? Mark laughs and answers, \"No, but you could with that body. I was talking about being young again. Shit, people dream about having a second chance. The whole being a woman is probably not the best trade off, but in your case. You know every trick women use to manipulate men to get what they want. You also know every trick there is to get in a woman's panties. You have nearly 48 years of life experience in a hot young 20 something body. Just imagine the shit you could get into.\" Jack never thought of that. The gender change dominated her thinking. This is a fresh start and Jack was a top tier womanizer. He could read them like a book from across the room. Jack, the man, always knew what he was looking for in a woman. He did know every trick women played on men to get what they wanted. \"With this body and what I know I could have anything I want\", Jack thinks for a second before realizing where that path would take her. Jack knows men and know that she'd eventually have to put out. Men will only give over so much before wanting something in return. Even with what Jack knows she'd only be able to push things so far. \"Why would I even have to do that? I've got the settlement from the agency and the wad of cash I got from the body guards SUV. The house is paid for and there is Mom's BMW convertible in the garage. That will eventually run out. The agency is paying for my reeducation though. Crap, do I want to do college again at my age? My age, fuck, I'm like 20 now. I guess it come down to working my ass off, or wiggling my ass to get what I need\", Jack thinks staring out the window. Jack sighs as she thinks about the paths available to her now. She could repeat her old life of working and dedication to the job, or follow the path that Maria was taking as a kept woman. She could also choose another path and become a gold digger, using rich guys for their money. Jack laughs out loud at that thought. She gets a look from Mark. \"I've got time to decide\", Jack figures.</span></div></div>",

Her body keeps telling, no screaming at her mind she needs this, she needs Mark's beg throbbing cock that is now in her hand in her pussy. Jack shoves Mark back onto the bed and mounts him like a jockey. \"Fuck me\", she growls as she guides Mark's rod into her already dripping pussy. \"Oh fuck\", she screams as she feels Mark fill her. The sensation catches her off guard despite her earlier explorations. Having the real thing is very different. \"Yes, yes\", Jack moans as she grinds into Mark. She climaxes within seconds, but is far from done. Her body screams for more. Mark takes control and rolls on top. He quickly slides his cock back into her and slams it deep. \"Fuck yes\", Jack screams! It hurts and at the same time feels really good. She feels as if she's being split in two. \"Oh fuck me\", Jack begs even though it is unnecessary. Mark has been needing this. It's been a while for Mark. She's unlike any woman Mark has been with before. They share a connection. He knows that this is really Jack, the man who mentored him and helped him over the years, but she's so beautiful. Jack is also a good friend as well as a mentor. The whole situation combines in Mark's mind and excites him for some reason he can't explain. He feels so close to this woman beneath him. \"Yes\". Mark moans as he explodes deep inside Jack. Jack feels Mark cumin inside her. Jack never thought much about if women could feel it. Then again as a man Jack never really cared what women felt at all. Jack climaxes again as Mark releases inside her. This goes on for a few hours until they both pass out from exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

Jack originally did it for research, but started developing a friendship with her. If she's going to pass herself off as a woman she has to act like one. Ashley, which is the girl's name is about same age as Jack is now and Jack figured she'd be good one to emulate. Jack also finally opened up the envelop containing her new identification. Jack's new name is Karen Hart. Jack is sure Stan had a part in picking that name. Stan often accused Jack, or rather Karen now of having no heart and no cares. Karen is supposed to be meeting Ashley at the gym for yoga, but got up early this morning feeling sick to her stomach and is running late. Karen makes it to the gym 30minutes late. It's ok as the instructor was also running late due to an accident. Karen finds Ashley and they start their warmup. \"You feeling ok\", Ashley asks? \"Just woke up feeling sick this morning. I'm probably coming down with something, or ate something bad last night\", Karen replies. Ashley laughs and retorts with, \"As long as it's not morning sickness.\" Jack doesn't understand the reference. Ashley notices it as women as Karen has found pay attention to that sort of thing. \"You're not pregnant, are you\", Ashley asks? \"No, that's\", Karen begins to say and then thinks back to what she did a couple of months ago. \"We didn't use any protection and I'm not on the pill\", Karen thinks to herself. \"Oh no, no\", Karen blurts out! Karen runs for the bathroom feeling suddenly sick again. Ashley follows her. \"Oh fuck, how could I have been so stupid\", Karen states after emptying the contents of her stomach into the toilet? Ashley rubs her back and says, \"Maybe it is a bug. You should go to the doctor and find out for sure.\" Karen knows it's not a bug. Something tells her that she is pregnant and she knows only one man could be the father, Mark. \"I don't have a doctor in this town yet\", Karen states as she feels tears starting to form. \"I've really fucked up\", Karen thinks to herself. \"I can take you to see my doctor, I'll call her right now and see if I can get you in.

Ashley is about to say something, but Karen cuts her off with, \"I need some time alone, time to think this out.\" Ashley gives her one last hug before she goes and says, \"You have my number if you need something.\" Karen doesn't respond she just sits there staring at the wall. \"This isn't happening. It's all some really fucked up dream\", she mumbles to herself. After a few minutes Karen decides she needs to fix this. Call it the residual of her former male need to fix things, or whatever. Like most people of her current age she turns to her computer and starts web searching. Her first instinct is search for abortion clinics. It makes logical sense. She's a single young woman who until a few months ago was a middle age man, ok maybe advanced middle age. In any case not the best equipped right now to becoming a single mom. As usual searching for abortion clinic results in a few videos of the procedure. \"Holy fuck\", Karen exclaims as she watches a few minutes of one. Karen begins having second thoughts about that course of action. Curious, she searches pregnancy, full term. All she remembers of her wife, or rather Jacks wife is that she got really fat. She never lost the ass and her tits got saggy. One of the main reasons Jack cheated on her, aside from being a dick. Jack wasn't even there for the delivery for either child. He was deliberately out of town on assignment. The videos for going full term and delivering are equally disturbing to having an abortion except on has a cute crying baby at the end and the former just has a mass of dying tissue in a bowl. Karen sits there at a loss to what to do. Abortion is the logical choice, but something inside her finds this course of action revolting. Call it an urge, or emotion, but whatever it is it's strong. Karen suddenly has an idea of what it might be and it sends a shiver up her spine. \"Maternal instinct\", she blurts out! Karen has become acutely aware of how her new female hormones can affect her thoughts in the past couple of months. Now pregnant those hormones kick into high gear. \"Fuck me\", Karen says out loud!  </span></div></div>",

Jack had become a walking sex dream. Based on intel gathered from informants his body had been sculpted to be everything that the head of the syndicate wanted. He had an outrageous hourglass figure with breasts that bounced and wobbled with every step, straining any normal piece of clothing with their size. His hips and rear were basically a carbon copy of a famed reality TV star, and extended far enough that Jack could use it as shelf if he stood still. His ankles had been modified so that he could only feel comfortable if he was wearing high heels. Advanced bioprinting techniques had given him fully functional female genitalia, which had purposely been shaped to give him a camel toe, since the main target had a thing for that. His skin had been darkened to give him a perpetual tan and several explicit tattoos had been applied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face of all things was the must unsettling change of all. Going in Jack had known that he would be heavily changed by the surgeries, but he had thought that if any piece of him would make it through it would be his face. This was not the case however. His face had been rearranged to give him pornstar looks, with luscious lips that never seemed to quite close and always seemed to invite a phallic object in. His eyes were large and sultry and his nose was delicate and pierced by a small rhinestone. Even his blue eyes had been changed to hazel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of training in all facets of womanhood, including lessons in his new undercover job, he had been cleared to start the operation. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime Jack was out of the center where everything had taken place and he was dressed so there was no doubt that he was part of the world\u2019s oldest profession. Fishnet stockings, micro-miniskirt, skyhigh leather boots, a midriff-bearing and skintight, pink top and the tacky jewelry expected of those plying Jack\u2019s new trade. In his tiny clutch purse was an ID that claimed his name was Kristy O\u2019Neill, but his working name was Candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up and down one of the streets in his target\u2019s territory, waiting to get picked up by someone in the organization.

As she about to turn off the bed side lamp, Ken took the remote control and muted the TV. He shifted closer to his wife's body while his hand snaked into her oversized T-shirt, palming her right breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Ken...,\" she was surprised by her husband's sudden advance. However, her voice was soon muffled as Ken wrapped her lips with a passionate kiss which lingered for several seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go the kiss with a loud smooch and looked at Naomi's blue, almond shaped eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is beautiful. Ken thought. Even without make-up. Her face, framed with angular jaw and upturned, sharp nose gave an unique, regal look. Her cheeks were a bit chubby. Ken remembered that those cheeks were once display high cheekbones. Her chubby cheeks came slightly plump frame. But even after two adolescent kids, at 43 years old, Naomi still looked sexy in her own mature and maternal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrowed her brow and squinted. Apparently, being stared so intensely made her self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Ken whispered as he continued to knead her breast. \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nU...uh,\" she shook her head playfully. Her brunette bangs drooped over her forehead. \"I can't...it's already midnight, darling and I am tired.\" He didn't say anything but carried on to kiss her neck. Naomi let out a deep sigh, half-heartedly enjoying the treat. The touch of his palm on her breasts made her shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids...,\" she said under her breath.\"They're still awake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be quiet,\" Ken replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to take off her shirt, she took a glimpse of the muted TV which was displaying ordinary news broadcast. However, something in the small running text underneath the images caught her attention. It said: <i>Recent studies have generally found no connection between coffee and obesity.</i>.  That news followed by another running text: <i>A pack of cheetahs fights one Lion fought over dead elephant in Serengeti.</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken, honey...stop.\"But he kept kissing and kneading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi took a deep breath. She struggled to get out from Ken's embrace as she whispered to his ears: <i>K stand for Kenneth. A raven and eagle soar on the night sky. Seven-twentynine-comma-eight. Go to sleep, Ken.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his body stiffened. His tight grasp on her ample breast loosened as he slumped over his wife's body.  Two seconds later, Naomi heard him snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted his body to the bed side. He slept like a baby. The command had triggered the hypnosis planted in his mind that would make him obey his master's - in this case, Naomi's - command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi killed the switch and the room became dark. The only light came from the television which still displaying the running text. She walked toward the window and took a peek outside at the street . The view looked tranquil and sedated. There was nobody as everyone in the suburban were already sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved back to the bed and took the remote control. She pressed a series of button and the TV displayed an interior of bedroom which belonged to the oldest daughter, Miley Benson. The room was typical girly, full of posters of actors and musicians. On the bed, the sixteen year old was sleeping soundly. She was clad in a pink tank top and white boy shorts. Her long mane of blonde tresses was all over her pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi pressed another buttons and the display changed to another girl's bedroom. Charlotte was still awake, reading a novel. She's fourteen years old with short brown hair and a little bit nerdy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi pressed another button to activate the sleeping gas intake into Charlotte's room. She smiled as she saw her daughter yawned several times. In less than one minute, she dozed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to make sure, Naomi also activated the same procedure to Miley's room. The suburban mom had to be in the safe side before she proceed to the next step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling her handler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the dressing table and took out a small cellphone from a secret drawer. As she dialed a number, she caught her image on the mirror. Under the oversized T-shirt and pink lounge pants lied her curvy, luscious body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while,\" she said. There was a sad tone in her melodic voice. It was like she wasn't ready to face the person she's calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a click. And a deep voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me. Naomi Benson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Passcode please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four-four-zero-six-ring-of-fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirmed. Have you neutralized your company?\" he said, referring to Naomi's husband and daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They're all sleeping. The perimeter is checked and safe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jack. You can drop the camouflage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while,\" Naomi repeated the line she said before with a masculine voice. The words sounded odd sliding from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed. You've been conducting your current assignment in a flawless manner, posing as a the suburban mom while protecting the witnesses. Your achievement means that this deep-cover program can be continued and up-scaled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't do it without the bodysuit. It helps the me playing the role perfectly. And don't forget the hypnosis. Who ever designs is genius,\" 'Naomi' said as she peeled her visage. Her facial skin become distorted followed by Velcro rip echoing in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's face appeared underneath the suburban mom's mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the emergency? I saw the coded message in the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is an assignment for you, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When was the last time? <br>\r\nYou recall that it was several months ago when you were posing as  cheerleading coach in a high school to bust a narcotics circle. At that time, you spent a semester impersonating almost one hundred people, ranging from janitors, principals , teachers and students. When the case was closed, it seemed that you impersonated almost everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cool experience, which let you hone your disguise skills. <br>\r\nAt that time you learned so much about how to create and roleplay in your persona. <br>\r\nYou also obtained the skills to mimic the emotion of young girls. Something that would be useful in this mission. As you decided to be a young girl to approach the male supervisor, your next target. You have a couple of identities to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall you be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since he is having African roots and his parents still live in some small state in Central Africa, this seems nothing illegal or strange, but we detected that they use this shop and its supply channels to smuggle some illegal items to our nice country, starting with drugs, illegal animal parts and the last suspicions are that they are also smuggling weapons and also women to here, who have to work as prostitutes in town. But we need evidence.<br>\r\nAnd here comes Jack\u2019s part: We need to make his neighbor to think that Jack has moved out and some woman moves in. Using this disguise she could try to get closer to him and find out more about his business and if there are any of those mayor crimes done by him!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
