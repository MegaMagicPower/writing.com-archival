The blinds are pulled down, the door shut, and even in the shadows her pink wallpaper nearly blinds you. Posters of Olympic gymnasts, boy bands, and cartoons block out some of the brightness, enough you can focus your eyes and try to lift yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour limbs refuse and tighten up, not because you're sore, tense or tired; not because of any immediately familiar reason. You try to feel the edge of her bed with your toes, yet it seems a few feet too far. It didn't take much stretching to cover the length of your bed... why should Jessica's mattress be longer? Besides her pillow resting under your neck, you feel a soft broom head too, its bristles sprawled around your head, climbing up your scalp, across your vision, red strands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red broom...? But that's not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you feel empty in a certain place, somewhere dark, under the covers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glance from the room to the <i>Cinderella</i> pajamas, fuzzy and sky-blue, sticking to a svelte body two feet shorter than what you're used to. One wayward turn of your head and the broom unfurls into an impenetrable wall of red. You blow it away and it returns, never flying too far; this broom head is a part of you. And that means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later you're bolting down the stairs, trying not to trip in these unfamiliar, daintier feet, aware the world stretches up and away, just out of reach. You cry in a cotton candy voice, so sweet you barely hear your own anger: \"Mom! Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom walks out the kitchen with a sponge in hand. \"What's the matter, dear?\" she asks innocently. \"Are you okay, Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Jessica!\" you yell. Mom tries to pick you up but you jump back. \"You put me in that machine with Jessica and then we... we switched bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the li'l squirt whining about?\" Your old body strolls out from behind Mom, dressed in the same clothes you'd put on that morning, munching a bagel with a lazy, glazed look in his eye. You try to spot a hint--small, big, anything--telling you this is really Jessica, but if it is she's putting a good front. \"You say the stupidest things sometimes, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Austin,\" Mom cooed, \"let's not be mean to Jessica. It's wonderful she has such an active imagination.\" A migraine builds up behind your forehead. You clench your fists and restrain the urge to scream, but you're not sure how long you can hold...</span></div></div>",

Cut it out!\" you say, failing not to sound like Jessica whining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Jessica.\" Mom says dismissively. \"Before we play any games, you need to go get dressed and clean up your room, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting in annoyance, you turn your head away from her - catching sight of your body in the living room. He/she/it is laying on the couch in a slobbish pose, eating that bagel and spilling crumbs everywhere. Seeing yourself from the outside like this is... jarring. You remind yourself you've never cared how other people see you, but actually <i>being</i> another person makes that difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica...\" Mom says in an annoyed tone. Still ignoring her, you look down at yourself. You study the details of Jessica's body and look back up at your own to try and compare. For a second, you're almost finding this interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica! I said get dressed and clean your room!\" Mom snaps. Suddenly intimidated, you hastily start to comply, only to regain your senses and slow down as you approach the stairs. You look back (and up) at your mom's face. The stern expression is completely unlike her. She has to be messing with you - probably an \"experiment\" to see how you'll act in this situation. Mom's experiments tend to clearly be more for her own amusement than for any scientific reason. And she wonders why no-one takes her seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, feeling small, weak and emasculated, you can't bring yourself to object any more, so you slowly start climbing the stairs. You find it difficult with your little legs, and having to raise them draws your attention to the emptiness in between. By the time you reach the top, you feel even more weak and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take deep breaths - which don't really help, as they draw more attention to the unfamiliar body - and try to compose yourself.</span></div></div>",

After you clean \u2018your\u2019 room your mom comes in. \u201cHey Jessica good job cleaning your room now hurry up and get dressed we\u2019re going to the mall.\u201d She says as she nearly leaves \u2018your\u2019 room but pauses. \u201cOh, I almost forgot I picked out an outfit on your bed for you Sweetie.\u201d And with that she leaves the room. Curious you go over to the bed and investigate. Laying on the bed was a very girly outfit you had no intention of wearing. On the bed was a bright pink long sleeved dress with a ruffle skirt, white tights and white panties with pink horizontal stripes, a pair of frilly socks, and black riding boots with bows on the cuffs. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019m wearing that.\u201d You say as look around for something else. After looking around you couldn\u2019t really find anything else that was better and fearing being yelled at by your mom again you decide to give in and put on the clothes. First you take off your pajamas and panties and notice right away that you really are a girl albeit a premature one although, you had to admit it does feel a little better to move around without your old privates. Not wanting to harp on your new stuff especially when it\u2019s your younger sister\u2019s you quickly put on the pink panties and the tights which felt tighter than your underwear in the crotch area but still felt oddly comfortable. You then put on the dress which you really did not want to do but seeing as you have no choice you did it anyway. Finally you put on the socks then you slip your feet into the boots. Right after you get dressed your mom comes in. \u201cOhhh you look so cute Jessica, now it\u2019s time to go.\u201d She says as she leads you to the car. \u201cHere let me help you.\u201d She says as she picks you up and puts you in a booster seat then buckles you up. You swear she\u2019s trying to get a reaction out you. She then buckles up and you both drive off.</span></div></div>",

Rather, your vision pops out of nowhere and remains fixated on a point ahead of you, which is the chair you had been sitting in seconds before. You stare at it underneath the arm of the other chair, hovering above you like a doorway, and so assume you're now sitting in the second chair. Mom had placed an object there, though you can't remember what. An attempt to speak aloud (you think of saying, \"Jesus! The hell?\" and some other expletives) hits a dead-end when you discover you're missing all orifices and organs necessary for speech. Shortly after, you notice there's no limbs to move either; your body winds upon itself: joining in the back, weaving over in two strips, then wrapping up from beneath in a comforting curve. If you feel any sensation, lacking nerves and skin, it's looseness and intimidation. The world intimidates you now; it's so massive, even when limited to your stuffy living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you can't seem to get the song \"Under the Sea\" out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant!\" A hand scoops you up from behind; you expect a rush of vertigo and vomit but you only feel weightless. Your \"body\" whips against the momentum. Someone dangles you four feet above the carpet, which looks dangerous from your height, with your stature. \"The transfer was a success. The soul of a human can be placed in something as lifeless as... a piece of fabric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before you're flipped around to face her large, laughing face, you recognize your mom's voice and assume only the worst. She'd wanted to win a Nobel Peace Prize since high school, even while her wacky inventions made her look less like Edison or Tesla and more like a drunk, incompetent Rube Goldberg. She kept trying throughout the years, testing some devices on you (one changed your hair green for a whole month) but the habit died down and you prayed she'd abandoned her wayward dreams for good. Now you know: Never assume your crazy mom's stopped being crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel the nylon brimming with vitality!\" She giggles like a child. \"I wonder if I can make your thoughts audible... Or what'll happen once you're hugging Jessica's body! Ooh, the possibilities!\"</span></div></div>",

You feel almost like you have limbs again, but you're still immobile and even smaller than before. The living room is positively cavernous.

You can't move either half; you see through the torso-section but you don't have any eyes; you hear but can't feel ears; you try to grumble, gurgle, articulate, but no vocal chords accomodate you, so you only think, <i>What the fuck?</i> over and over until a shadow falls over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have a moment to think, <i>That's mom,</i> before she picks up both halves and piles them in her arms, \"legs\" on top of \"torso.\" Her breasts stare back at you while she walks the length of the living room, her footsteps booming like cannon-fire. You're no bigger than a kitten, if it was anorexic and chopped in half. You hear something ring in the distance: the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on schedule...\" Mom mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did you do to me, Mom?</i> you think, more irritated than scared now that you know who to blame. She opens the door and another shadow falls across you; you're caught between your mom and the unseen woman's bodies, staring at your mother's breasts, aware you're the same size as them. <i>Does this have to do with your stupid Nobel Peace Prize? I thought you quit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from the doorway interrupts your thought. It speaks with the density of distant stars: \"Hey Mrs. Williams,\" it says, addressing my mom. \"You wanted me to come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize that voice anywhere: it's your girlfriend Sydney, the sweetest soul anyone could ever meet but naive like all hell. You want to scream out her name, but your new form denies you this satisfaction while Mom answers, \"Yes, Sydney. You left your bikini in Austin's room last week, when you came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams. I don't... I don't remember bringing it here, or swimming any time recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah,</i> you think. <i>Neither do I...</i> And then, with startling abruptness, <i>Wait! Am I the bikini?</i></span></div></div>",

I thought I'd save it until we had some more time to observe, but you should probably know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sydney asks. Whatever she wanted to say next catches in her throat. Instead, she says, \"Is this one of your experiments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Sydney ended up discovering your mom's mad little secret, both because you needed someone to confide in that wouldn't rat you out to Mom, and Sydney had ended up as an occasional test subject herself, not to the same extent as you've been, but \"minor\" alterations, like making her bald for a day or turning her into her own mother. These were trifles compared to what you often got, including this new incident...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, it is,\" Mom continues. \"I took this bikini from you, I don't know when, it was a long time ago, and I've successfully created a machine that can transfer human souls between vessels, whether human or object. Inside your bikini right now is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney's eyes bulge. She snatches the bikini top from your mom, turning you over, trying to stare through the nylon, stretching you out. The space between your eyes, the string that functions basically as your nose, extends in both direction. You feel like you're about to snap in half, horizontally AND vertically! This knowledge does not fill you with the dread it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... You've put Austin inside my bikini?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mom says proudly. \"He can't talk, can't interact with you, but I promise you, his mind is in there, thinking and observing the world from his tiny cloth vantage point.\" </span></div></div>",

This is taking all three previous Items and rolling them into one!  Also present will be updated statistics (it's been about 3 years since I've added anything anywhere on this site), some new characters, and some old characters, as well as some of my favorite chapters from the originals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin (you):  18, male, 5'4\", slightly overweight; doesn't care about looks, hygeine (for the most part), self-image, or what anyone else thinks about him; protective of his family and possessions; stubborn as f***, but puts up with Mom's experiments (albeit begrudgingly)<br>\r\nMom:  42, 5'2\", slightly overweight; inventor of the BSM (Body-Swapping Machine); runs experiments on Austin whether he likes it or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica:  5, 3'5\", gymnast's build; Austin's little sister; bratty when around Austin, but like a little angel around anyone else; definitely not a tomboy<br>\r\nKari:  22, 5'3\", overweight due to past pregnancy; Austin's older sister; a bit of a slut, she moves from boy to boy constantly; likes many things Austin likes<br>\r\nWilliam:  5, 3'8\", slim; Austin's nephew and Kari's son; hyper-active, much like any normal 5-year-old boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlayna:  16, 5'3\", slim; Austin's cousin; darker skin due to Hawaiian ancestry on paternal side; avid dancer and cheerleader, almost never gets in trouble; speaks with an ever-so-slight lisp (no explanation)<br>\r\nSydney:  18, 5'0\", normal build; Austin's girlfriend; pure-minded, slightly girly, never gets in trouble; only child of a bank-owning family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill add more characters as they come; also, feel free to add your own characters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1.  No intricately-detailed sex scenes; a little is fine, but be cautious - I reserve the right to delete or edit chapters as necessary.<br>\r\n2.  Stay true to all characters' descriptions:  In the originals, people would often change characters to their liking - a majority of the above characters are real people (hence no last names).<br>\r\n3.  Try to write with as good grammar as possible - no text language!  (Although 'Engrish' would be awesome!\"<br>\r\n4.  Be realistic (other than the fact that you've switched bodies with someone/thing!).<br>\r\n5.  No \"Makeover Machine\" stuff - that was irritating in the originals, and I won't put up with it now.<br>\r\n6.  Have fun!</td>",
