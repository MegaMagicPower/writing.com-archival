They had been doing some diving for exercise while they rested in the harbour, and he had found it at the bottom. It had been some time since the crew had reunited, as well as gained three companions: the snake princess Boa Hancock, who had followed Luffy all the way from Amazon Lily; Fire Fist Ace, Luffy's adoptive brother; and Vivi Nefertari, the princess of Alabasta and longtime friend of the Strawhats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Luffy, as ran over to chest; it was bigger than he was. \"It's so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up, Luffy.\" chuckled Sanji as he walked over. \"Knowing Marimo it's probably full of junk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro growled and shot the cook a death glare. He was too tired after his swim to bother arguing, though, so he just flipped his middle finger at him and went back to wringing out his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what're we waiting for!?\" announced Nami, Belli signs already in her eyes. \"Open it, open it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Nami...\" muttered Usopp as he picked the chest's lock. \"You've gotta be careful with these things. They could be boobytrapped or anythi...\" he was cut off by a loud click. \"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsopp and Luffy pushed the humongous lid back, revealing a huge variety of gold, jewels, antiques and pretty much everything else of value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Chopper, his eyes widening in wonder. \"So pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so shiny...\" gasped Brook. \"Why, I think it's starting to hurt my eyes! ....except I don't have eyes! Yohohohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really outdone yourself, swordsman-san.\" stated Robin with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, swordsman!\" laughed Franky with a thumbs-up. \"You did a SUPER job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is impressive, but I'm sure given the chance, Luffy would have done much better.\" Hancock remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you must not know Luffy very well.\" chuckled Ace as he reclined against the ship's railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Portgas, you shouldn't talk about your brother like that.\" scolded Vivi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy drooled as he stared at their newfound treasure. However, something quickly caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What's this?\" he asked, as he plucked out some sort of gold amulet from the pile. It was round with a blue jewel in the middle; it didn't seem any different from the piles and piles of jewelry already in the chest. And yet, there was something about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy didn't have time to ponder this any further. The amulet immediately reacted to his touch as the jewel glowed, before releasing a blinding light from it that engulfed the entire crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" shouted Luffy as he attempted to shield his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy!\" screamed Zoro. \"What did you do!?\"</span></div></div>",

I`m still the princess of Alabasta on license, ohhh, what will Pell say if he sees me like this?\" - worried the new prince of Alabasta in egyptian tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I just hope now I can get some attention from Luffy-samaaaaa'' - chanted the 6'4'' masc and elegant man with a Boa in his shoulders and dressed to impress. But before he could reach for the still laughting brunette, a torrent of fire shoots in front of him and from it forms a rather voluptuous and heavily freckled brunnete formed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello there'' - she said, mostly out of fun then flirting, Ace with her outstanding confidence was only powered by this new form - ''you come around here often?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as much as Hancock would loved to just petrify anyone who`d dare to hit on him at the moment`s notice, he just couldn`t-wouldn`t do it to Luffy-sama`s brother, now sister, he had to remember himself, with luck, they`d find the amulet again and reverse this, what would happen if the Amazon Queen became a man forever??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

His shorts, meanwhile, where completely gone and replaced by a very revealing red skirt adorned with the pattern of the Kuja. His usual comfy sandals were now red pumps with an impressive four inch heel, and every time he moved his head the jangling of snake-shaped earrings filled his ears. Finally, a white Marine jacket was draped across his shoulders like a cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I dressed like Hammock!?\" shouted a shocked Luffy as he attempted to stand up, quickly grabbing onto a nearby railing as he wobbled in the unfamiliar shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this!?\" he heard the familiar deep voice of his swordsman roar.

His muscular legs were almost completely bare, the usual black trousers replaced by an embarrassingly short orange skirt, one of Nami's favourites. Adorning the side of the skirt were metallic rings which jingled with the green-haired swordsman's every movement. Finally, his new footwear was a pair of orange high-heeled sandals. Not quite as high as the pumps Luffy currently sported, but still higher than the macho-man Zoro would be happy to be seen in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What the hell happened!?\" scream Zoro as he looked himself over in horror, his face rapidly reddening with rage. As Luffy looked on, he noticed something about Zoro's legs; they were completely smooth. Since his rubber body meant he didn't grow much hair, Luffy didn't notice it on himself, but Zoro's legs were devoid not only of hair, but of the scars around his ankles from the events on Little Garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were snapped out of their trains of thought by a familiar, feminine laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' good there, Zoro!\" laughed Nami, as she stepped forward to reveal herself wearing...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Chopper started changing into another animal... a cow, possibly? Franky shrank into a feminine cyborg before swelling. The men seemed to be changing faster then the women: Each suddenly sprouting boobs, hair, eyelashes, and nails elongating, voices changing to a higher pitch, meanwhile their penises, unfortunately, shrank into oblivion and transformed into the womanly counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that the women weren't changing. Nami's breasts slowly growing, ass growing, mind changing. Vivi, Robin, and Hancock are the same, each ending up with massive boobs, a large ass, a few inches of height, and longer hair. And a constant theme became snapping: Bras, belts, panties, boxers, underwear; anything the crew had been wearing snapped off to fit the new proportions: The entire crew had become bare naked as they continued to swell in curves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets now look at what the men had become: Tough Zoro was now Zora, a tom boy. Sanji had turned into Sanjelique, a hardcore lesbian. Franky was still Franky, but now was a much more womanly cyborg. Chopper had become Chopara, and was now a cow/human mix with the largest pair of breasts the crew had ever seen. Brooke's name was still Brooke, but he had become a slenderer, more womanly skeleton, and his afro had become shoulder length hair. Usopp had become Usoppa, a shy woman that was scared by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the transformations, this is how the crew looked: Luffy, normal as always, Nami with a ridiculously large pair of JJ breasts and a pretty chunky ass, Vivi with EE breasts and a MASSIVE ass, each cheek the size of a beach ball, Hancock maintaining an hourglass figure with GG boobs and watermelon sized ass. The rest of the crew fell into each of these categories: Nami, Franky, and Chopara had become top heavy while Vivi, Zora, and Franky had become the crew's bottom heavy members, and finally, Hancock, Sanjelique had become the hourglasses. Brooke, only a skeleton, had gained no curves, unfortunately.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Nami walked to Luffy and shouted, ' You fool, you don't just touch things without me inspecting it first! ' . She slapped luffy so hard that it could be heard a 100 miles away. ' Why did you have to slap me?! ' , luffy said. Nami wanted to pull her hand away, but to her surprise her hand was stuck to his face. ' My hand is stuck! ', she shouted trying to pull away. Everyone rushed closer to try and pull Nami and Luffy apart. It was no use , on closer inspection they saw that her hand and Luffy's cheek had become one. Suddenly Luffy and Nami both began to glow. Nami's hand began to move deeper into Luffy's face . Nami and Luffy began to move closer and closer. The closer they moved to each other the brighter their glow became. The glow eventually became blinding. Their bodies slowly merged together and was accompanied by their screams. Until suddenly Nami and Luffy stopped screaming and the light slowly faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of two figures there was now one figure left behind by the light. There stood a female figure which actually looked more like Nami , but had a few alterations that belonged to Luffy. She had orange her with brown eyes , and a more curvy ripped body than Nami. There was a scar with two stitches underneath her left eye and a large X shaped scar on her chest and a blue tattoo on her left shoulder . She had on a straw hat,  green and white bikini halter top, tight low-rider blue shorts , a yellow sash tied around his waist and orange high-heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at this new figure . The figure began checking herself out and said, ' I can get use to this . ' . ' Who are you ? ' , Usopp asked a bit nervous. The figure looked at Usopp and said, ' It's me ,Nami. ' . ' It's clear what happened here, Nami's conscious overpowered Luffy's, because she is more ... let's say intelligent . ' , Robin said. ' So what do we call you ? ' , Zoro asked. ' Lumi... Naffy... ' , Usopp began guessing. ' Just call me Nami . ' , she said smiling.  </span></div></div>",
