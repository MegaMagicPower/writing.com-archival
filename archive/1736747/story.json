Though, there is something that has been bothering you about him. You've recently noticed that he carries the dreaded Nine-Tailed Fox spirit within him. It was the main reason why he was so hated by everyone in the village. Well, everyone except you, Shikamaru, Choji and even your parents. Unlike most adults, your parents never really hated the boy because they know that it wasn't his fault for the deaths of many lives in the leaf village. You overheard your parents one night saying that they wished to help Naruto. You were shocked by why he's being hated by everyone. At first, it made you angry to know that the villagers were punishing a boy who had nothing to do with the attack, but you know that taking it out on them will probably make things worse. You've been a good friend to him because you know that he deserves one. You go to him to say hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Naruto.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ren. What's going on?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just gonna go meet my team. What about you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just thinking about how I should get Sakura's attention.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still onto her? Naruto, I'm not gonna be a jerk here, but I think she only has her attention set on Sasuke.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just needs to know that I'm not who she thinks I am. That way, she'll recognize me for sure.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just making sure that you won't feel hurt later on.\" You said in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ren, but I'll be fine. Believe it.\" Naruto said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Tell you what? Once your done with training and some missions, we'll talk about some plans. Okay?\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me! Well, I better get going. See you later, Ren.\" Naruto said before leaving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Naruto!\" You said while waving for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful, Man. You're already suffering inside as it is.\" You thought with concern before leaving to meat your team.</span></div></div>",

Asuka is a kunoichi with long dark blue hair and light blue eyes. She wears a blue shirt with a dark red skirt with shorts coming from underneath it and wears her headband on normally.

How's it going over here?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a Taijutsu match-up and right now Naruto has the upper hand against Sasuke. If he wins, it'll be a shocker to me.\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't win because Sasuke will easily take him down.\" Sakura said still siding with Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" Kai sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously.\" Asuka said while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guys turned to see Naruto still having the advantage over Sasuke. Sasuke tries to kick him back, but Naruto dodged and punched him in the jaw. Sasuke was still on his feet and manages to hit him back, causing him to fall on his back. Once he got back on his feet, Naruto sees Sasuke coming at him at full speed and manages to dodge another attack before knocking him down with his fist near his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be. Good job, Naruto.\" Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kakashi-Sensei!\" Naruto said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ends training for today.

I'll be right back.\" Naruto said before going to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto goes up to her, he failed to realize that Sakura doesn't look very happy. You can guess that things is not gonna end well for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sakura. I can go with you if you want.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want an annoying, worthless and pathetic excuse of a ninja to be anywhere near me?\" Sakura asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what?\" Naruto asked in shock of her behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be anywhere near you at all. All you do is make me feel miserable in front of Sasuke.\" Sakura said with venom in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do. In fact, you keep asking me out is really annoying too. When will you realize that I will never go out with you and no girl will ever go out with a demon like you!\" Sakura yelled coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends were shocked by her words at Naruto as he feels his heart being broken like glass at her yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura.\" Naruto said still shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't want you to be anywhere near me again! So, do me a favor and go die in a ditch!\" Sakura yelled before turning her back on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto feels his emotions going out of control as tears starts going down his cheek. With that said, Naruto runs away while crying. You and your friends came out of the shock before turning towards Sakura with not so good looks on your faces. Sakura turns to see the angry looks on all of your faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see what you did now?\" You asked not so pleased with her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He deserves it.\" Sakura said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean he deserves it? He didn't do anything to you!\" Kai said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hurt Sasuke!\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a match! It was supposed to be that way!\" Asuka yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! Now, that demon won't be in the way of me and Sasuke.\" Sakura said with coldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! Always about him, huh? I've got news for you, he feels the same way towards you as you do to Sasuke! Now, you just ripped out his heart and throw it away without a sense of regret! If anyone's worthless and pathetic, it's you!\" Kai said with much anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sakura asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was trying to be nice to you and all you did was making him feel like a broken man because you want to be with Sasuke. Guess what? This isn't a fairytale, this is the ninja world and you're not fit to be one. If you want to be with him, then do all of us a favor and just quit! Because, as far as I'm concerned, you're nothing more than a heartless, sick, disgusting pink bitch!\" Asuka yelled before leaving to find Naruto with Kai following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're proud of yourself, Sakura. Try to think about what you've done.\" You said before leaving too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura just stand there with a bewildered look on her face. She them felt like she's been slapped in the face back to reality. Has she really been this cold towards Naruto? She doesn't know anymore as she starts crying.</span></div></div>",

You okay, pal?\" You asked with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys want?\" Naruto asked in a bitter tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just here to see if you're okay.\" Asuka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to do that. Just leave me alone.\" Naruto said with a little anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto. Your hands are bleeding and it's covered with splinters. Come on. Let's get you fixed up.\" Kai suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm fine! Now, go away!\" Naruto yelled a little <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just trying to help, buddy.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy? That's a laugh.\" Naruto said with venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends gasped in shock to hear him say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-what do you mean by that?\" You wondered as you believed that his broken heart maybe driving him over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did you guys ever considered of being my friends? You're just like everyone else in this village. Always treating me like an animal and putting me down. I've been through all of that everyday of my life. I became a ninja and help these people, but what do I get in return? Criticism and more physical abuse. After what Sakura said, I finally realized that I was doing all of this for nothing. To them, I'll always be nothing more but a demon because of the real one inside me.\" Naruto said with a lot of anger and venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\" Asuka said with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take this anymore. I want this pain to stop. Why does it have to be me? Why? WHY?!\" Naruto cried to the heavens as red chakra starts coming out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Naruto, stop!\" Kai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the red chakra comes out, you felt something in you that made you go to your knees. You clutched your heart and your eyes begin to glow purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren? What's wrong?\" Asuka asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nine-Tails. I can actually feel his wrath and for him trying to escape. The power in me is reacting to it's chakra.\" You said as you now glowing dark purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Kami! What do we do?\" Asuka asked in fear of her friend's lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it.\" Kai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Naruto looks at you guys with red cat-like eyes, bigger whisker marks and with claws and fangs. You get up and you looked back at him with glowing purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!\" Naruto cried with red chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!\" You cried too with some dark purple energy surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that</span></div></div>",

She walked into an alley thinking it was a good idea and that it was a shortcut to her house. Lee sneaked up behind her and grabbed her from behind. He covered her mouth with hand and the other hand wrapped around her waist. Kurenai was too tired to react. Lee's body slowly turned into a liquid and began slipping through her skin until she was left standing alone in the alley.

To make things worse it was two of the most dangerous members of the Akatsuki : Itachi Uchiha the murderer of his clan and Kisame Hosikage the tailess terror and the scurge of the mist.

Asuma was stuck, he looked at Kurenai and said \" Are you just going to stand there ?! \".  Kurenai was filled with fear, she stood there motionless. Lee immediately knew that this was his chance to act. Lee's cells that was floating around in Kurenai's body became active and began attaching itself to her body, combining his chakra with hers and taking control of her body. Suddenly Kurenai's body began making hand signs, she lost control and couldn't regain control of her body. ' I can't control my body! ', she shouted out to Asuma. Before Asuma could respond flames shot from Kurenai's hands . Lee pointed her hands towards Asuma, the flames engulfed his body and caused a huge explosion. Kisame leaped back dodging the explosion,  but Asuma was not so lucky . He took the full force of the flames. Asuma stood there badly burnt, but alive . He collapsed on the flow . Kurenai burst into tears, but she was unable to help him. No matter how hard she tried to move, her body just wouldn't badge. Itachi activated his sharingan, he could clearly see the presence of Lee inside Kurenai. ' Who are you?', Itachi called out to Lee. Suddenly Kurenai's head slowly began to sink into her body. She panicked , but she couldn't do anything. Her head had completely sunk into her body , leaving behind her headless body. Then after a few seconds a new head began rising from out of her body.

Dreams to be a ruler, first step take over the Hong Dynastie. She's a master actress and most of the times she can play with peoples minds to mess them up of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory:<br>\r\nGraduated as class best of the academy at the age of 5, solved first b rank mission with 7, qualified to take up the chunin exams, failed at first was disqualified for unneseccary cruelty in the forest of death. The defeated genin from the hidden sand was lying on the ground and Sierra broke his legs and took his scroll, and than ordered him to crawl towards her and admit his defeat against a 7 year old girl. The in pain crying 13 year old boy screamed for help, this just raised Sierra Lust for more torture \"if you don't crawl here immediately we'll I saw a huge hungry snake back there I might feel generous and feed her a loser just now.\" hearing this he immediately crawled towards her even through all the pain he managed to get there \"please stop I surrender\" the boy cried \"I don't care if you surrender you lost anyway, but you weren't obedient as a loser should be, I had to threaten you to do so, oh I know suck on my foot to fully except your defeat, oh oh and tell ne you love the taste and feeling, hihi yes tell me that while you're sucking my little cute toes, or I might burn you crispy before the snake got a snack!\" the boy red shades in emberassment didn't hesitate and started to suck Sierra Sandale feet licking her toes his body visibly fought against this \" mmphg I mpohh llmnnlovr lovennkhnmthrmhhthe ftrastr taste afdfvfsandigdwsghwanttohgfffzfbehddtfyourslavev.\" \"HAHAHAHA good one, God your such a loser sucking on the feet of a girl 6 years younger than you hahaha ha!, well now let's go\" the boy unsure of what happens asked \"where are you dragging me?\" Sierra laughed again \"well to the snake of course your so silly!\" the boy was shocked \"what but but I sucked your toes and and you said you wouldn't if I do that\" Sierra smiled at him \"no I said I could feed you to the snakes JUST NOW, if you don't crawl over and do as I say, I never clarified if I would feed you to them later!\" the boy now totally In fear \"please no no don't feed me to snake ill do everything please don't do that!!!.\" Suddenly Sierra stopped \"everything?\" the boy nodded eagerly. \"alright suck your own cock and I leave you alone.\" the boy was disgusted at the very thought but even if he would he couldn't \"I can't reach my cock with my mouth.\" Sierra gave him a cocky smile \"not my fault you have a tiny one, but here this will help.\" she gave him a kunai \"how would this help to reach my.....\" suddenly he knew what she was getting at and he paled. Sierra only turned him on his back and helped him to sit against a tree \"you can't be serious!\" Sierra just jumped up and down and singed \"suck your cock no matter how suck your cock no matter how, or I will fedd the snake oh yeah suck your....\" the boy crying waterfalls didn't wish to die and removed his pants from his broken legs showing of his dick, Sierra immediately looked closer \"what are you.. ?\" Sierra put a hand on his mouth \"shut up that's my first time seeing that thing so let me watch a little now.\" she was looking at the sof dick of this boy and touched the top of it \"woah why is it getting bigger all of the sudden?\" She removed her hand from his mouth expecting an answer \"uhh well uhm it's because of... Well excitement?\" \"HAHAHAHA HAHA if your so excited about cutting your dick of I won't stop you any further go on do it castrate yourself, or are you excited about to be eaten alive?\" <br>\r\nThe boy wanted to argue but knew it was for nothing he cried out a loud scream everyone in the forest and outside heard. Now he had his bloody cock in his hand \"suck it come on suck it!\" the boy was almost unable to move blood spouted out of his body \"I.... Will dir due blood loss.\" Sierra looked with a sad face at him \"oh.. Uhh I didn't wanted that ohh I'm so silly ok see now suck your dick quick and I make sure you won't die because of your blood loss!\" the boy nodded not having a choice  he opened his mouth and slowly put his cock in The second his dick entered his mouth Sierra pulled his broken legs towards her, that way he was again laying on his back the sudden movement and pain made him let lose of the dick which is now stuffing his mouth, before he could react Sierra steped on him and pushed his dick further in his mouth with her feet until even the balls where almost in his throat. \"HAHAHAHA to die this way castrating yourself and and... Aha hahaha what why are you crying yet again and your face turning red, oh now purple what, I'm just true to my word your not being feeded to the snake and you won't die because of blood loss, yes I'm really generous.\" after to minutes he tried to vomit and his body was sheking as suddenly \"SIERRA HONG STOPP THAT RIGHT NOW!\" the instructor Jonin found them \"why I'm just having some fun.\" the instructor grappled Sierra and lifted her up... \"see even now my feet isn't there he still refuses to take out his cock so he likes it!\" The instructor was in shock \"his what? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!\" he lifted him up and pumped his belly and back until the now in saliva and vomit covered cock came out of his throat, but the boy didn't made a sound he was already dead at this time. At the age of seven Sierra play the innocent naiv card not knowing what happened, without her disqualification the village hidden in the sand refused to charge the Hong Dynastie or the hidden leave, out of fear of a war against them. At the age of 8 became a chunin (everyone rather gave up than to fight her) at the age of 12 Jonin at the age of 13 anbu black ops <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for her banishment :<br>\r\nExecuted 52 Hidden cloud Ninjas after peace was made between the villages<br>\r\n3 attempts to assassinate Gregorius Hong the last one 5 years ago she burned down the estate and killed her aunt Pia Hong 35years old the day she died she was a kind and gentle soul always making everyone smile, at the moment of her death she was pregnant in month 7, she couldn't escape the fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter banishment crimes<br>\r\nSelling hidden leaf secrets, stealing, harrasing the small folk and nobles alike, 75 assassinations, enslaving people, <br>\r\nIs considered to work with Akatsuki and Orochimaru although this isn't certain.<br>\r\nThe bounty is 310052431239,30 Ryou (287965479Us dollar)<br>\r\nFurthermore if you get her Alive Gregarious Hong allows you to Marry into his Dynastie, if you wish so.

Of couse you couldn't fight the fox or the guy with the mask but you made a secret back up plan before Kushinas childbirth. You made a ritual that takes 3 months to summon one of the great animals the salamander Animal an equal to gamabunta. The salamander wasn't amused but couldn't break the seal put on the ground beneath him. \"you who forcefully summoned me A CHILD NO LESS, whatever your reasons are I will kill you for this nonsense!\" you only gave him a cocky smile \"yeah yeah whatever your dreams are at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only person who knew about this was Minato himself as this time he teleported Kushina directly to this very Cave. \"I hope your plan works Sylvain.\" Minato placed her gently on the ground the baby in her arms she whimpered \"what plan... Are you.... Talking about?\" Minato smiled at her \"don't worry to much, your brother will save you and protect our baby in this cave I will be back soon.\" Minato gave kushina a quick kiss on the cheek and than teleported away. \"well than let's get started I guess.\" as soon as you touched naruto he started to scream, Kushina strengthens her grip to hold him close. You only sighed \"im sorry but I need your whole body to make this work, give me the baby Kushina.\"<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she gave him to you. \"finally we have no time to loose.\" and with that you used the opened seal the nine tails left behind as a door to push the salamander inside. Due to the already given seal on Kushinas body this was easy for you, after the salamander was in Kushina only needed to renew the 5 tentagram seal. You than placed Naruto back in her still weak arms and carried her to the bed in the back of the cave. She quietly whispered \"Naruto... I... I'm here your save...... Minato he... Sylvain... Help Minato.\" </span></div></div>",

What is it we are training in,\u201d Naruto asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be teaching you my unique brand of ninjutsu today. The thing is that you need a target for the techniques like the Yamanaka do for their mind techniques. So I want you to see if you can get a female classmate to come and help with your training,\u201d he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was ecstatic he had heard that his uncle used a one of a highly unique ninjutsu style. His uncle was one of the top Jounin in the village so whatever type of ninjutsu he used must have been cool and powerful. He then noticed what his uncle said and asked, \u201cwhy a girl. Wouldn\u2019t any one work?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could but with what I plan on teaching you with it a female would be better,\u201d his uncle answered. In all honesty if Naruto came to the training ground with a guy he is changing his mind on what he was teaching Naruto. While he respected people\u2019s right to choose their partners he did not want to watch the more sexual arts of his style used by two dudes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Naruto answered. He then looked at the clock and started to freak out. \u201cOH no I am going to be late.\u201d He then grabbed his bag and ran as fast as he could out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think at this point he would stop falling for the clock being set ahead by half an hour,\u201d his uncle said. He had been doing this for years when he realized his nephew like his mother did not care for school and would lose track of time easily to avoid this he started to set the clocks ahead to get Naruto to class on time. \u201cI wonder who he will bring. Hopefully not that banshee.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Naruto ask to help him train?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then turned around and started to talk to some other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from where he was punched Naruto just sulked for a moment before he went to his spot and got his books in order. He wasn\u2019t aware of it but in the upper corner of the class he was being watched by his stalker Hinata. \u2018What does he see in her? Why can\u2019t he see me,\u2019 were some of the thoughts that were bouncing around in her head. She was trying to work up the courage to volunteer to train with Naruto but was worried that he would reject her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Iruka came into the class room and class started like normal. Naruto was only half listening while he tried to figure out who he could ask to help him train. By lunch time he still had no idea who he was going to ask. He was walking to the roof to eat lunch when he ran into someone. \u201cOw sorry about that I wasn\u2019t watching were I was going,\u201d he said as he looked at the person he had ran into and noticed that he had ruined their lunch. \u201cUH oh I ruined your lunch her you can have some of mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did he run into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They then walked to the roof where they sat down with Naruto\u2019s food between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Come on Hinata this is your chance,\u2019 Hinata said in her mind. \u201cSo Naruto what was that about training that you asked Sakura about earlier,\u201d she asked with a stutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my uncle told me he was going to train me in his personal ninjutsu style today but he wanted me to bring a classmate with since the style needs a target. When I saw Sakura I thought she would like to hang out and train together,\u201d Naruto answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d she said. The whole time they were talking she was trying to convince herself to volunteer for the training but could not work up the courage. She was too afraid that he would see her as a failure like her father does. The two talk for a few more minutes till lunch was almost over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly popped in Naruto\u2019s head. \u201cHey Hinata do you want to train with me after school,\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata just froze on the spot. She could not believe he had just asked her to train with him. What if she did a bad job? What if he saw how pathetic she was? Were some of the first thoughts to jump in her head as well as this being her chance to prove herself to Naruto? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of her not moving Naruto waved his hand in front of her face and said, \u201cHinata are you okay?\u201d he placed a hand on her forehead to see if she was having a fever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Say something you idiot,\u2019 she yelled at herself. \u201cYes I would love to,\u201d she suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat I will meet you after class and we can head to the training ground together,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said. When he had gone down the stairs leaving Hinata by herself she quickly fainted over the idea of being with Naruto. The rest of the day acted as normal and Naruto met with Hinata after class and the two of them took off towards the training ground that Naruto and his uncle use. When they got there they saw Naruto\u2019s uncle waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he alone?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken Uzumaki stared at his nephew and his guest as he stood alone in the training ground. \u201cGood you are here. I\u2019m surprised to see Hinata though I would have guessed that you would have asked Sakura,\u201d he said. While inside his head he is dancing around in joy thinking his nephew finally got over that stupid crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did ask her but she told me no. I than ran into Hinata during lunch causing her to spill her food so I offered her some of mine. We talked for a bit and I asked her if she wanted to train with us today,\u201d Naruto explained to his uncle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then I guess we should start with what my ninjutsu style is. It is called the bondage style. The bondage style focuses on capture and interrogation. It uses the supplies you have to capture your opponent and has moves that can be used to get them to talk to you. This can be done through the methods of pain or pleasure of the target. It works best if the target is of opposite gender but can be used on the same gender as well,\u201d he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said, \u201cNow Hinata could you turn around so your back is facing Naruto I am going to show him how to perform the first jutsu of this style.\u201d She does as ordered and turns around. \u201cOkay Naruto hold onto this rope and perform these hand signs,\u201d he says as he does a pair of hand signs. \u201cThen say wrist binding jutsu.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nods his head and says, \u201cOkay.\u201d He then holds the rope and does the hand signs. \u201cWrist binding jutsu,\u201d he says. The rope moves to wrap around her wrist but barley reaches her wrist before it fall to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try Naruto but this time I want you to put some more chakra in the rope and imagine the way you want the binding to look. Remember that book about shibari that I gave you for your birthday last year,\u201d he said. This causes Naruto to blush a little because he remembered the book and how his uncle used it as a starting point to talk about the birds and the bees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He nodded his head and tried the jutsu again. This time the rope went to her sides and wrapped around both of her wrist before it forced them together in a strict knot that gave little wiggle room. Hinata was surprised by this at first and let out a surprised yelp. She then tried to free her hands but found that the knot was to strong. She also tried to use her chakra but found herself unable to. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I focus my chakra around my hands is this part of the jutsu,\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that is because we are using the rope that I use for my techniques and I have seals written all over the ropes that prevent others from using there chakra on the ropes. The seals are designed so only the castor will be able to remove the ropes. If something happened to the castor it would take 72 hours before the seals would deactivate. The seals would also prevent cutting of the ropes as well,\u201d Ken explained. \u201cThat was a good job Naruto. Nice and tight with no way for her to slip out of it. Looks like you are a natural at this. Now let\u2019s try its sibling jutsu. Here is another piece of rope and now use these hand signs as you say ankle bind jutsu,\u201d he said as he handed Naruto another piece of rope and showed him the hand signs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust watch uncle ken I\u2019ll get this one on the first try,\u201d he said. He used about the same amount of chakra he had used on the wrist jutsu and imagined a similar knot as well. \u201cAnkle bind jutsu,\u201d he yelled. The rope than shot towards Hinata\u2019s ankles and wrapped them into a strong knot as well. The sudden knot caused Hinata to lose her balance and fall to the ground. Naruto quickly moved to catch her. When he did he helped her lay on the ground since it would be difficult for her to stand with her ankles tied together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed that you pulled that off on your first try,\u201d ken said. \u201cMaybe you are just a natural at this. Now Hinata I am going to take Naruto to the side to talk about some other techniques. I want you to try to get free of the ropes okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. Ken nodded his head and turned to Naruto and walked to the edge of the training ground with Naruto to discuss a few things with him. Hinata meanwhile tried to get her wrist or ankles free but found that the knots were too tight and could not find an opening in the seals that would allow her to loosen the ropes. Hinata was also trying to avoid the fact that being helpless at the hands of Naruto was causing her vagina to get wet with anticipation. She tried to shake some of the ideas of Naruto taking advantage of her in these situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later ken came back with Naruto and said,\u201d thanks for being the test dummy today. Would it be possible for you to return tomorrow so I can show Naruto some of the interrogation techniques that go with my style? I will ask a friend of mine to be here as well so I can use her as the example while Naruto does the same with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grows a blush on her face thinking about some of those interrogation techniques could be before she said, \u201csure I would love to.\u201d He looked at her and had to hide the smile on his face. \u2018I guess Hinata is the submissive type,\u2019 he says in his head.  He then calls Naruto back over. \u201cOkay Naruto I am going to have you release her and then we will work on both of your conditionings and taijutsu till supper time. After that we will help Hinata home and head home ourselves. When we get home tonight I\u2019ll teach you the seals that are placed on the rope. Here is the binding release jutsu. Which can also be used if you find yourself tied up with non-chakra suppressant rope,\u201d he said as he showed both of them the hand signs for the jutsu thinking it will come in handy for the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto used the technique and freed Hinata Ken had them run laps around the training ground and spar for a bit as he gave advice to both of them while trying to give Hinata encouragement and boost her confidence.  When they were done he offered Hinata supper at Ichiraku\u2019s but she refused saying she had to head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow Hinata-Chan,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Hinata quickly said with red cheeks as she ran away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Naruto and ken had a few bowls of ramen at Ichiraku\u2019s before they went home where he had Naruto finish his homework before he taught him the seals that are placed on the rope and other equipment used in his style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anything happen during the day or do we time jump to training the next day? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Naruto and Hinata walked into the training ground and saw Ken standing there with a woman wearing a brown trench coat and purple hair. Seeing her caused Naruto to pause at the sight of his uncles \u2018special friend\u2019 that he sometimes sees come out of his uncle\u2019s room late at night or in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello kids. Hinata this is my friend Anko who agreed to help with today\u2019s training. Now Naruto I want you to use the same jutsu as yesterday. While I put Anko in a similar tie,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Ken that you will owe me dango after this,\u201d Anko said as she felt the rope go around her wrist and ankles. While this happened the same thing was being done to Hinata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both of their ankles and wrist were bound ken told Naruto to place Hinata next to Anko. When they were done he said, \u201cNow there are several ways you could try to get information out of your target. Since you are still young let\u2019s start with something simple like tickling them into submission.\u201d  He then wrote a word on a piece of paper and shown it to Hinata and Anko. \u201cThis is what you two are trying to keep secret from us. When you have had enough you just have to say this word and we will be done. This will show that you have given up the vital information.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickling them,\u201d Naruto asked in doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be surprised how well that works. You see when they laugh hard enough than they will have a hard time breathing and controlling their bowl movements. People will be more likely to talk if they don\u2019t want to crap or wet their pants,\u201d Ken explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then looked at the girls before he said, \u201cbefore we begin let me show you one other jutsu that may be needed because of that thick jacket Hinata wears.\u201d He made a few hand seals at a slow pace to show Naruto before he placed it on Anko\u2019s shoulder. \u201cArticle removal jutsu\u201d he then found Anko\u2019s trench coat in his hand and her not wearing it any more. \u201cThis jutsu allows you to remove a piece of clothing or all of the targets clothing. Now you try to just remove Hinata\u2019s coat use the same amount of chakra as you would with a replacement jutsu.\u201d Naruto nods his head and focus his chakra as he uses the jutsu and successfully removes Hinata\u2019s coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn guess the Hyuga is an early bloomer,\u201d said Anko looking at Hinata\u2019s larger than average size chest for her age. This cause Hinata to blush and look away from the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that might have been the reason for the coat but I was not sure,\u201d ken had muttered to himself. \u201cNow that the girls are ready let\u2019s begin. Now remember Naruto everyone has that one spot that when tickled they will break down into uncontrollable laughter. The best way to find this spot is to start at the feet so remove her shoes and start to tickle her as you make your way up to find the sweet spot till she tells you the key information.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow will I know she has said the information? You only showed it to Anko and Hinata not me,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will just have to keep going till you are sure she has given you the correct information and not false Intel,\u201d his uncle answered. \u201cIn the field you won\u2019t have someone who can tell you if the information is accurate or just a false lead. You will have to rely on your instincts for that.\u201d He then removed Anko\u2019s shoes and started to tickle her feet. She bit her lip to keep herself from laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this told Naruto to begin as well. He removed Hinata\u2019s sandals and started to tickle her feet. She tried to resist laughing by following Anko and biting her lip. When he saw that she was resistant he moved his way up her legs and found very little reaction from the girl showing that area as useless. As he made is way up he found a few good area\u2019s to tickle on her belly button and armpits. This caused her to break out in laughter and Naruto could not keep the smile off of his face. \u2018She has a nice laugh,\u2019 Naruto thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked over at his nephew and smiled at the progress he is showing so far. He then looked at the laughing Anko already knowing her weak spot is behind her ears and armpits. She has been laughing hard for a few minutes know and was having a hard time breathing. He smiled at this, but he knew that there was no way Anko would give up the Intel from this alone and it looked like Hinata was doing her best not to give it up as well so she can look stronger in front of her crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Naruto that is enough looks like these two are strong enough to resist this method,\u201d he said. He saw Naruto get up and look at his uncle while Hinata just laid down on the ground catching her breath. She was thankful he ended it when he did because she didn\u2019t think she could have lasted much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hyuga,\u201d she heard Anko say next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Miss Anko,\u201d she replied. The two boys had walked to the side so ken could explain the next exercise without the girls hearing it so they could prepare for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things. One don\u2019t call me miss it makes me seem old. The second is that we are supposed to play the part of prisoners so make sure you trash talk our captors it will cause them to get frustrated and make an opening,\u201d she said. \u201cHey losers you better give up we won\u2019t tell you anything.\u201d She then looked at Hinata and told her to join her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Hinata then said, \u201cShe\u2019s right there is no way a pair like the two of you can make us talk.\u201d When she finished she could not believe that she managed to say that to Naruto of all people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this ken then said, \u201cYou two better shut up before we make you shut up.\u201d He gave both of them a look that told them he wasn\u2019t joking. This scared Hinata but Anko just laughed at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m so afraid of the little man who probably can\u2019t even get it up,\u201d she said. She then leaned towards Hinata to get her to say something. When she heard it she blushed bright red and shook her head. \u201cC\u2019mon girl don\u2019t you want to help the blond brat. The best way to do that is to make this training as realistic as possible so say the lines I promise you it will help you get him in the end.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose turned out to be the magic words because Hinata then said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two just go back to playing with each other and let us go.\u201d She immediately turned a dark red after saying that and looked in the opposite direction as the two guys were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell looks like we are going to have to silence you two,\u201d ken said after a moment to get over the fact Anko convinced Hinata to say that. He pulled out a scroll and unsealed from it two ball gags. He handed one to Naruto and made a few hand signs in front of him before he said, \u201cgag jutsu.\u201d The gag then wrapped itself around Anko\u2019s head and secured itself behind her head. He then signaled Naruto to do the same thing. With the gag in his hand he copied his uncles hand signs and did the same to Hinata. she tried to keep her mouth shut but the jutsu caused the gag to shrink so it can fit in her mouth before it returned to its original size an strapped its self to the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm uncle if they are gagged how are we going to get the Intel,\u201d Naruto asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple we perform the technique on them for a set time period and remove the gag. If they are willing to talk at that point we take the Intel if they continue to insult us then we continue with interrogation,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then created two clones and motioned for Naruto to do the same. He then had a clone on each side of Anko and had the third one around her feet. All three of them pulled out some brushes and started to use them to tickle Anko. She immediately broke out into a fit of laughter. \u201cthe brushes have a special seal on them that makes it so it agitates the skin better when brushed against it causing a bigger reaction.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Hinata\u2019s eyes to widen when she heard that. She barely lasted to the end last time and this time she won\u2019t be able to stop it early since she is gagged. She tries to stop Naruto but sees that he has clones in the same spots each holding two brushes. The moment they start she explodes in laughter and even starts to cry from the amount that she is laughing. She tries to free her hand to stop the laughter but she can\u2019t get free. She starts to have a hard time breathing because the gag is restricting her air flow. She is so focused on her breathing she did not realize that she was losing control of her bladder and started to wet herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto noticed this him and his clones stopped tickling her for a moment and removed the gag. \u201cSo are you willing to talk yet,\u201d he asked. To focused on catching her breath Hinata did not answer right away. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to talk you have already wet yourself do you want to risk continuing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she hears this she looks down and sees that she had indeed wet her pants. Seeing this Hinata could not help but cry. How could she embarrass herself in front of Naruto in such a humiliating way? Amongst her tears she whispers the phrase that was on the piece of paper. \u201cRamen is the food of the gods,\u201d she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looks at her confused for a moment till he realizes that it was the code. He goes to his uncle and tells him the code and his uncle stops the tickling of Anko to go check on Hinata. He could see that she was sad about what happened. He put a hand on her shoulder and said, \u201cIt is okay. This sometimes happens with the exercise we were doing even Anko once peed her pants when she first started this training. In all honesty I kept going till she crapped her pants it was hilarious.\u201d He could hear Anko\u2019s screams at him through her gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words managed to get through to her and she stopped crying. \u201cNaruto the girl came to help you. So get over here and help her,\u201d he yelled. Naruto hearing these orders came forward and puts a hand on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Hinata accident happen all the time when training you just need to learn from it to grow,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right and Naruto you should have been paying attention to how she was acting. That is something you will have to learn as we do this is how to tell a person\u2019s body language and know when to call it quits especially when you are training with a friend. Let\u2019s free the girls and get started with the regular training for the rest of the day.\u201d They quickly freed the girls and they did some normal training till Anko decided that it was too boring so she decided to make it more fun. She made the kids run from giant snakes and avoid her kunai that she would throw at them. All ken did was lay on the ground laughing his ass off the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it got late both kids were ready to collapse from exhaustion. Ken took Naruto home while a clone of his took Hinata home. He did not trust Anko to do it. The two quickly did their homework before they passed out on their bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will the two learn tomorrow? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well yesterday\u2019s incident why don\u2019t we work on some capture techniques,\u201d Ken said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d the two said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect know for this technique you will want a piece of rope on your person. You will then wait for them to attack you. When they get in close you do these hand signs and say net trap jutsu,\u201d he said with Anko attacking him. He performed the jutsu and the rope formed into a net and ensnared her. When she was grabbed in the net it restricted around her keeping her trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen then handed a rope to naruto and motioned for him to do the same. Hinata then took a gentle fist stance and charged at Naruto he then went through the same hand seals and said, \u201cNet trap jutsu.\u201d the rope formed a net and it entrapped Hinata in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job,\u201d ken said. \u201cAfter they are trapped in the net you can leave them in the net or use the binding jutus to bind there limbs. You could also grab another rope and use the next level of the jutsu. He grabbed another coil of the rope and did two simple hand signs before saying \u201cCocoon jutsu.\u201d The rope forming the net adjusted and the other rope added in forming a strict cocoon of rope covering Anko from her ankles to over her mouth effectively gagging her. The woman wiggled for a moment trying to get free but found herself unable to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto saw this and got excited he then grabbed one of the ropes and weaved the hand signs and said, \u201cCocoon jutsu.\u201d Just like with his uncle the rope net moved around and the other rope added with to form a cocoon. Hinata tried to struggle free for a few minutes but found the ropes too tight for her to get free. The weird part she found was how comfortable she found herself being bound in the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Naruto. Now why don\u2019t we just let these two go and we can do some other training okay,\u201d Ken said. Naruto nodded his head and the two did the release jutsu freeing them. Ken and Anko then split the two up with ken taking Naruto while Anko took Hinata for some one on one training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally he is extremely protective of his friends  and the last thing you want to do is piss him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre-timeskip: 4' 7\", jet black medium length hair, pale skinned, lightly toned with gunmetal blue eyes. On his back is a \"tattoo\" resembleing a karge pair of tribal wings framing a central kanji for \"shadow\" made of exposed shin surrounded by a solid black circle. Close inspection reveals small sealing signs flowing throughout the black surrounding the kanji. Usually wears a mesh armor shirt under a sleeveless black zip-up hoodie, standard ninja sandels, dark grey shorts with his weapon sachel strapped to the back favoring the left. Finally, his left hand and forearm is wrapped in a black bandage leaving his fingers exposed and he keeps a face mack wrapped around his neck. when pulled up and over his nose it shows a wicked depiction of fangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPost-timeskip: 6' 5\", hair is now shoulder length with white strips all throughout, much more defined muscles and eyes have a white pupil. \"tattoo\" remains the same with the expectation of the kanji in the center is now black and the solid black circle surrounding it has disappeared. He wears a long hooded white trench coat (think 4th hokage's but with a hood) with black along all seams and edges, kept the mesh armor shirt, long black ninja pants, satchel in the same place, black bandage on left arms now extends up the entire arm, right forearm has a senbon holder for quick accessibility. Finally, has kept the face mask as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElemental Affinities: Fire, Lightning, and Shadow (Blood line)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsual equipment: Senbon needles (pre less then post), kunai knives (pre only), Katana and others to be revealed later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJutsu: Fire ball jutsu, lightning needles, Dragon Fire Bomb, Shadow Cloak, and others to be revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood Line: Shadow Chakra. The kage clan was blessed from the beginning with two things by the Sage of Six Paths; 1. the ability to use and mold the shadows to thier whim, but only when the achieved peace with themselves. From birth, a childs shadow chakra is sealed, as such the kanji on thier back with surrounded by a simple black circle. every kage with the blood line is born with the kanji, a physical manifestation of thier chakra. when it is unsealed at age 10 the chakra forms into unique designs and forms, like Ryu's wings. Finally, 2. The last gift given to the Kage clan was the heart of Juubi, having taken the form of, arguibly, the most powerful Biju having gone unknown to his siblings and the rest of the shinobi world, the same Biju now sealed with in Ryu, the final legacy of his lost clan.</span></div></div>",

As deep as the darkest abyss and radiating hopelessness. He gulped and spun around, trying to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the smothing lonelyness reared it's head and he RAN. He ran as far and as fast as he could, trying in vain to escape the mounting despair. He must have run for hours, days, months, but the void swallowed all sense of time. The ache was starting to set, along with the fatigue. He panted as he fell to his knees and then fully to the ground when the weight of the despair, the hate, and the loneliness slammed down on him. Then, in a last ditch effort, he called for help. He screamed, as loud as he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his call fell upon willing ears<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breath hitched as he watched the void shift and contort into an all too familiar form. He felt like crying in joy as the massive figure approached on 4 strong legs. the figure's eyes opened to reveal a pair of irises as white as snow and sporting slit pupils. The creature lowered it's head to his level and looked him in the eye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Ryu, it's time to wake up.</i></b> it said, like a voice coming from the void itself and dripping with power, but underlined with care. Like a rush of air, Ryu was blown out of the abyss and into the waking world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~(Kage compound, Main house)~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the first rays of sunlight was alighting on the sweat covered body of a black haired boy did he shoot up straight in his futon panting as if having run a marathon not a moment ago. He looked around, taking in the familiar surroundings before sighing in releif and falling back on his futon, hands plastered against his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How many times did that one make...?' He asked seemingly to himself, only to get the answer from his mental \"roommate\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>5, within just a few weeks. The fequency of these nightmares you have had the past year is starting to worry even me. </i></b> said the now distinctly male voice from the depths of his mind. Ryu groaned as he sat up in his futon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't have to tell me twice. I fucking hate these nightmares. I'm very tempted to spend my sleeping hours with you, Kai.' Ryu thought as he stood and headed to his wardrobe, pulling out his clothes and gear. A chuckle came from his roommate while he did so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>While the offer is tempting and could be very interesting, i think you get enough of me during the day. Either way, i'll start keeping a closer eye on your mental state while your asleep so you don't have to call for me next time.</i></b> Kai said in a serious tone tinged with amusement. <b><i>Now go get ready, you have to see the hokage about entering the academy</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'alright alright, calm down <i>mom</i>, i'm going.' Ryu thought sarcastically while heading toward the shower. After a quick wash he got dressed and left the main house. Ryu stopped and looked around the rest of the compound, only to bet met with the sight of the destruction that happened years ago. With sigh dripping with sadness Ryu started weaving the hand-signs for his favorite jutsu. \"<b>KAGE STYLE: SHADOW CLOAK JUTSU.</b>\" He said as his form started to sink into the ground, right into the shadow beneath his feet. All that was left behind was a large round shadow on the ground that blasted off into the distance at blinding speed. </span></div></div>",

Ninja spun in hopes of finding the source while villagers simply took it as their mind playing tricks on them. Ryu sped through the streets and alleys towards the Hokage Tower until something caught his eye in the direction of the Hokage Monument. He stopped and went up to the top of a building, slowly lifting out of his shadow to his waist, leaving the rest \"submerged\". Ryu then took in the spectacle that was the cliff faces, not brightly colors while a certain blond worked on the 4th hokage's head via a pully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'is that who i think it is?' he thought, physically and mentally deadpanning as he watched. He then hears a short laugh from his guest when he looked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i><b>Ha, yeah. Looks like Naruto is up to his old games again. I wonder how long it will take for the shinobi to...</b></i> At that moment a brown haired flash whipped by in the form of a certain Chunin teacher going to reprimand Naruto. '<b><i>Nevermind, there goes Iruka. I wonder how long it takes him to catch Naruto this time.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'huh, odd how he didn't notice me though.' Ryu then shrugged and sunk back down into his jutsu, blasting the rest of the way to the Hokage's Office. He slipped into the lobby and up the shadowed stairs and under the door in the blink of an eye. A slip second later he was blending in seemlessly with a shadow in the corner of the room. Only the Hokage noticed the intrusion, if the quick flickering of the eye in his direction was any indication. The ANBU and civilian councillor ranting at the head of the village, on the otherhand, didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Hokage, we must put an end to that brat's antics! This is the 10th time he has defaced the Hokage Monument! That dem-!\" He was cut short by the sheer Ki given off by The Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry councillor, but I'm afriad that we'll have to cut this short. we can continue this conversation in the next council meeting, understood?\" He said in a deceptively calm voice, but his eyes conveyed the barely held anger. The Councillor hastily nodded and fled out the door. The aging man sighed and pinched his brow before addressing the hidden child. \"You can come out now\" He called as out of the corner of the room, a boy emerged, clad in black and grey with hood and mask drawn over his face. ANBU, not having seen the potential threat, appeared and drew their blades on the boy. Ryu looked at the agents with a cold calculating glare. \"Drop your weapons, he is a guest. You are all dismissed, i will call for you again afterwards.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the assembled ninja nodded and sheathed their blades before Sushining out of the office, which aloud the Hokage to activate the hidden silenceing seals in the office. Ryu turned to him and gave a deep bow in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Hokage, a pleasure to see you again. How are you?\" Ryu asked as he straightened and set himself in a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, my boy, just getting tired of all this paperwork and the civilian council's constant pushing toward more power for themselves, or in regard of action towards a certain jinchuriki we both know.\" Saratobi said as he took out his pipe. His guest chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Naruto. We actually saw him on the way here today, defacing the Hokage Monument yet again.\" He laughed as the man slowly cocked a brow in question at the mention of 'we'. \"Forgot about my own tenant, it seems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right. Apologies i'm still not used to having two Jinchuriki in the village, let alone one that no one knows about. How is he?\" He asked while Ryu Rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask him yourself, i'm going to meditate for a few while you talk.\" Ryu said as he closed his eyes and relaxed visiblely before they opened again to reveal completely black eyes as he smirked at the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hello, Lord Hokage.</b> Ryu said in a voice far too deep for his body to create at the current time. \"<b>As for how i am, I'm perfectly fine. Ryu on the other hand, could be much better.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hello, sorry i wasn't expecting an actual face to face conversation. But besides that, what do you mean? is something wrong with him?\" Saratobi asked as he look a long drag of his pipe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Physically, no nothing is wrong at all. But mentally, especially  when he is asleep, he's in turmoil. While it's very subdued when awake, it manifests itself in his sleep as nightmares. The frequency of them has increased in the past year.</b>\" Kai said as he sat cross legged on the floor. \"<b>I've decided to keep a closer eye on him at night after the last one.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe he would need to go into the hospital or see someone about it?\" The Hokage asked as he leaned on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>no no no, i'll be fine with him for awhile. if it gets any worse, i'll have him see one of the Yamanakas. Either way, we're here to get Ryu enrolled into the academy as a last year student.</b> Kai held up a hand to stop the coming protest. \"<b>And you know very well that he is more then prepared for it. I've been training for years, as you know, and he's easily a low Chunin level</b> Saratobi sighed in response and nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"fine, He starts next week with everyone else. If that is all, you are dismissed. Come by whenever you like, Ryu and it was a pleasure to talk to you Kai.\" He said as the boy nodded and thanked him at the same time, making an odd echo of voice as he disappeared again into his Jutsu.</span></div></div>",

Iruka believed in a simple little saying: \"Prior planning prevents piss poor performance\" or the \"6 Ps\", hence he was getting a head start and making sure everything was in order before the last year students arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was organizing a few forms, he was suddenly joined in the room by an ANBU agent with purple hair and a feline mask. Iruka quickly turned to the ANBU in question and gave a polite bow. \"Neko-san, to what do i owe the pleasure?\" The ANBU held out a letter baring the Hokage's seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hokage-sama has asked i deliver this to you along with a message: <i>'be prepared for an interesting year'</i>\" With her package and message delivered, she disappeared in a flurry of leaves. Iruka's face became one of curiosity as he opened the letter, before contorting into one of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm... Ryuza Seishin. Why would Hokage-sama want to put this boy into a last year class? Though he does mention that he has prior training, it doesn't say how much and from who. Well, at least i'll be able to gauge his skills first hand later today...\" He sighed as he disposed of the letter with a small Katon Jutsu and went back to preparing for the year and his mysterious new student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~(Class start)~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all the students were slowly finding thier ways into the classroom towards thier seats, they mingled casually, sharing stories from the break and catching up with friends they hadn't seen. The relative calm of the seen was broken when one Naruto Uzumaki burst in the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Just one more year and i'll finally be a ninja!\" He shouted while wearing a large grin and making his way towards the end of the room and the ever brooding Sasuke Uchiha. \"Just you wait, Teme! I'll show you i'm way better then you could ever hope to be!\" Naruto continued on his mini-rant as he sat next to the emo prince who only spared his a side-long glare and a single thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hn, Dobe...' Sasuke went right back to his brooding. The class, after Naruto's outburst died down, went back to it's peaceful atmosphere. Again it wasn't destined to last as two kunochi's to-be burst into the room screaming. One was Blond hair blue eyed and dressed in deep purple clothing, while her suposed opponent was jade eyed and very peculiarly pink-haired. The girls were apparently having a race to see who would sit next to \"Thier precious Sasuke-kun\" and niether would say if the other won. This was the scene that Iruka walked in on before a very large tick-mark appeared on his head and used one of his favorite jutsu to calm the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN, YOU BRATS!\"</b> He screamed using his <b>Big head jutsu</b>. Everyone froze in place before instantly finding thier seats across the room. A winner seemed to be chosen as the pink haired girl sat down on the other side of Sasuke and the blond sat next to a boy who's black hair was done up to look like a pineapple. Iruka nodded as he stood in front of the class and cleared his voice. \"Ahem. Very good, now that you are all seated, i'd like to make an announcement before class begins. We'll be having a new student join our class this year, so i expect you to show them the respect that a future comrade in owed.\" At this many in the class began to whisper to eachother, wondering who the new student was and where they were from and the like. Iruka turned to look at the door, having sensed being told that Ryuza was waiting just beyond threshold. \"You may come in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone instantly turned towards the door to see who would enter, even Sasuke showed interest in the new addition, wondering if they would be strong. The door slid open to reveal a boy in thier age group. He was wearing a black short sleeved zip-up hoodie, dark grey shorts with many pockets, standard blue ninja sandles and something wrapped around his neck. The things that drew everyone's attention were the fact that his hood was drawn to hide the upper half of his face and that his left hand, wrist and forearm was wrapped in a black bandage. The youth closed the door, walked to the center of the room and bowed to Iruka before turning towards the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, I'd like to introduce your new classmate, Ryuza Seishin.\" Iruka said as he looked at Ryuza and politely asked him if he would remove the hood. He was given a \"Hai, sensei.\" as Ryuza took off his hood to reveal black hair that was swept back and reached his neck. His eyes were a steely gunmetal blue that showed hints on interest as he looked about the room. \"Thank you Ryu. Now, would you mind telling us a bit about yourself? likes, dislikes, hobbies, dreams, that sort of thing.\" Ryu nodded as he bowed toward the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone. My name is, as you know, Ryuza Seishin. I'm functionally the last remaining member of the recently... Defuncted Seishin monestary to the west.\" There was a few gasps around the room and muttering about \"another clan heir\" and \"functionally the last member\". Ryu gave a sigh before regaining composer. \"My likes are training, meditating, helping others and teriaki beef. My dislikes are arrogent self-centered people, seeing my friends in pain, and particularly loud noises. My hobbies include Cooking, meditating, training visiting my father in the hospital and tending to the monestary. Finally, my dreams are to find justice for my fallen clansmen, master my clan's sacred tools and Bloodline limit  and to someday rebuild the Seishin monestary and clan so we may help any who need it for generations to come.\" With that he gave a deep bow to the class and looked at Iruka, who motioned for him to take a seat. Ryu opted to sit directly behind Sasuke, who had been watching him closely since he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I wonder if his interest in a good or a bad thing...'</i> He though as he took his seat. Ryu of course noticed the looks he was receiving from some of the girls in the class. '<i>Ah, fuck. I think i have fangirls, juuuust great</i>. He inwardly groaned as he heard the cackling of his tenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'Oh, i can already tell this is going to be a fun year!'</i></b> Kai said as he laughed at his container's misery. Iruka took this moment to address the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that everyone is here, i'd like to welcome you back to your final year here at the academy. Before we get into the lessons, myself and Mizuki-sensei, who is waiting outside, will be testing you on the basic ninja skills you have thus far, including shuriken and kunai throwing, the acedemy three and any other ninjutsu you know, as well as your taijutsu in one-on-one spars. This will be done to gauge your skills and rank you in the class anew, in case anyone improved over the break. We'll be starting with your Shuriken and kunai throwing. Please follow me down to the training fields.\" As he said that everyone stood and followed him out, Ryuza took up the back so he could keep an eye on everyone and keep a certain pineapple headed boy from lagging too far behind the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was Mizuki, the light blue haired assistant teacher Chunin. He gaze a curious look at the newly arrived Seishin but giving a barely noticeable look of disgust towards Naruto. Ryuza saw this and cocked his head ay the Chunin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Distain towards the Kyuubi it seems. I have to wonder what else my fellow demon container has experienced.' Thought Ryu as he and the other students lined up before boxes of kunai and shuriken as instructed by Iruka-sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>From what i heard in my time with your clan, the lives of the other 9 were nowhere near as good as ours. While constaining me at the monestary was considered an honor, elsewhere it was a curse and as such the others were treated as outcasts. It seems Kyuubi's is no different. That poor boy.</b> Kai sighed within the mindscape and receded back to watch the proceedings of the tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, the tests will go as follows; first is the accuracy test. You'll each throw 5 shuriken and 5 kunai at the designated targets. You will points for each successful hit and bonus points for bullseyes. The girls will go first then the boys. After that will be the jutsu test in which you all will attempt to preform the three jutsu we teach here at the academy as well as any other jutsu you may learned away from class. Finally, the last test will be the taijutsu tournament.\" Iruka explained in front of the assembled students, getting nods and looks of both boredom and excitement at the coming tests. \"Alright, we'll begin with the accuracy test. Ladies, please come up and grab 5 shuriken and kunai from the boxes. One at a time, come up, and throw at the target when you are ready.\" With this all the girls went and collected thier weapons before throwing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with navy blue hair and pale lavender eyes, Hinata Hyuuga, got 6/10 with 2 bonus points for two bullseyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka scored 4/10 with no bonus, only to yell at the the pink haired girl that she should try to top that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno, the pink haired girl from earlier, scored equal to Ino much to her dismay. She gave a strangled yell which caused everyone to flinch while Ryu and the boy with shaggy brown hair and triangle tattoos on his cheeks covered thier ears to lessen the pain. The rest of the civilian girls scored 3/10 on average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys then followed suit and the results are as follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba Inuzuka, the aforementioned triangle faced boy, scored equal to Hinata with 6/10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji Akimchi, a rather rotund boy, scored 5/10 with one bullseye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru Nara, the lazy pineapple haired boy got 6/10 but it was obvious he could have done better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki, though most likely spelt as Maelstrom the other spelling gave Ryu and Kai a little bit of a laugh. He scored 5/10 just barely before challenging the Uchiha to do better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke Uchiha, the ever brooding \"prodigy\" scored a steller 8/10 with 4 bullseyes, much to the delight of his fangirls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Sasuke, now Ryuza, please come up and show us what you have.\" Iruka said, grabbing the attention of everyone. They all wanted to see that the new kid could do and where he stands. Ryuza nodded and grabbed his weapons, throwing them up and down and spinning them on his fingers to test thier weight and balance. Satisfied, he walked up the line and stared at his target. He threw three shuriken at once, quickly followed by the other two. The first three landed dead center while the other two shuriken ebbed deep into the target on either side. The Kunai soon followed, two hit the bullseyes while two others stuck just as deep and the final one missed by a very narrow margin. 9/10 with 5 bullseyes, exemplary for a fresh to the academy student. Ryu breathed out as he turned to at shellshocked Iruka, bowed and returned to the line of equally shocked classmates. The Seishin chuckled to himself while his tenat laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think w<b>e broke them' </b> They thought and laughed more as the others recovered. Almost immediately afterwards, the poor boy was set upon by the Yamanaka and Haruno, screeching about how he had cheated and that \"there was no way that you could better than our Sasuke-kun!\" The volume was starting to cause the Seishin great pain and even greater irritation. After about a minute of the screeching, Ryu and Kai both had had enough and expressed it in the best of ways, with in a voice that was chillingly calm, it struck the girls to thier very cores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies. I'm only going to say this once. No, i did not cheat, yes i beat the Uchiha, no there is nothing either of you could possibly do to change that. Now you will both kindly shup your mouths and leave me be, lest you become my next target. Am i understood?\" Ryu asked as he glared deeply into both thier eyes. The hurriedly nodded thier heads and retreated away from the frighteningly calm new arrival. With that settled, Iruka shrugged off the feeling suspiously like Killing Intent and regathered the attention of his students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after that amazing performance, I'd say it's time to move on to the jutsu test. Do we have any volunteers to start us off?\"</span></div></div>",

You immediately spit out an enormous amount of water at the floor in front of you. You shouted , 'water style water wall. ' as the water began to make a wall in front of you. The water shielded you from the lava. The office room filled with steam as your water wall countered her lava. The mizukage gave a slight grin as she stared at you from on top of her desk.

You concentrated and converted a large amount of your chakra into mist. This was your special mist , nothing could see through your mist. The entire village instantly began to fill up with you mist.

You sneaked up behind and thought you were undetected by her. Just before you were about to grab her she rapidly turned around and out of her right sleeve shot five snakes at you. Each of their fangs sinked into your flesh. ' Got you! ', she shouted . You were caught off guard by her snake senses that was able to detect you . Out of your wounds began to leak a strange kind of water. You felt how your body began to change into water. ' If this is a water clone, then where is the real you. ' , she asked herself looking around. This was no water clone your entire body became water . You immediately began to manipulate your water form, you quickly covered her entire body with your water form. It was as if she was trapped inside a water bubble. You then forced yourself into her mouth and down her throat, her body became numb as you entered her. When all of you entered her body she dropped to her knees and began gasping for air. ' Get ... out... of ... my body. ', she said coughing. She could feel you slowly evading her mind and taking control of her body. She then got up to her feet with a new conscious .
