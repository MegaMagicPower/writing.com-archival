Not only was it really awkward to have to sit by a girl you just made a terrible first impression on, you were also greeted to the breathtaking sight (in more ways than one) of her thick, enormous bare soles. They're so big that you can't even see her face past them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I just 'ad to pick the seat behind this bumbling bugger...\" she mumbled to herself, apparently not even deigning to speak to you. Seriously, how rude could she be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled and flexed her toes, making sure to get them up in your face. At one point, she even pinched your nose between them! The worst part was that your body was reacting on its own; you involuntarily inhaled her sweaty, vinegary stench\u2014it was so potent that you thought she had ran more than a mile non-stop just to get here\u2014and soon after felt a tent begin to grow in your pants. A luminescent blush spread across your cheeks. What the hell was going on?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sides of her lips perk up. \"...well, at least I'll 'ave fun messin' wit 'im.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to defend yourself, only to have a couple of her meaty digits pop in past your teeth, introducing their rich, salty flavor to your poor taste buds. You sputter, too stunned to push her feet away. The invading toes rest comfortably on your tongue for a few seconds, scrubbing across it, even squeezing it a bit, before they pull back out. They leave a strong aftertaste that makes you feel weird and fuzzy inside, and that blush is <i>definitely</i>not going away any time soon. The goblin parts her feet to smirk at you, obviously pleased with her handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the sight leads you to absentmindedly conclude that she could fit your face snugly in the arches of her soles. Your erection grows tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're no' worthless after all, 'umie,\" she states, looking quite proud of herself. \"You migh' be a dope, but you know how to 'elp a girl out. Maybe you can work on these numbers after school, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've come back to reality, at least for now. Instead of yelling at her (something you really wanted to do, but you refrained from for some odd reason), you just give her a questioning look; she rolls her eyes in return. She moves her hand down to pick up her brown leather sandals, which she left down at the side of her desk, and shakes them. \"These numbers down here, you dim-witted bellend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the side, embarrassed\u2014wait, why are you letting her get to you this way?\u2014and stutter out a simple, \"I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bops your nose with one of her big toes and moves it back down to your lips, which you keep closed this time. Your tormentor looks unamused. \"Shut up, I like you be'er when you're silent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little charade goes on a bit longer before class actually starts. What happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A) The goblin is stopped by your 1st hour teacher, Ms. Keri. She is a young, but firm tiefling with small red horns on her forehead. She's sympathetic to your plight, but is also rather turned on by the little display you and your goblin 'friend' are giving. She might prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future, but the slight sexual awakening she's had from witnessing you getting dominated might not end in a way that is convenient for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B) One of your classmates butts into the conversation. Whether that's to your benefit or detriment is up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C) This goblin girl gets you all to herself for the rest of the day. She's in your other classes, too!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There you stare face to face of a young teenaged Amazon. Her skin was a light olive color with long light sandy blond hair that looks so soft. The ten foot and half tall girl's lips were a slightly shiny, a clear sign of lip gloss. What she wears for clothing on their slim yet muscular body of hers was a simple pink shirt and yellow skirt. Her bust were plump yet tamed, complementing her athletic frame very nicely. On her mighty feet, were a pair of sparkly white mules. Her right foot has a golden anklet with pink heart shaped gems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026I'm fine.\" You weezed as look away from the girl and quickly walk away.

The class went normally and you noticed a few things: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some teen orcs (boys) who were even taller than Alondra (the smallest orc is easily 14 ft tall perhaps even more), they do not seem very brilliant in class but they weren't dunces neither. You also noticed a short (5 ft tall) harpie girl with glasses who seemed very good in class: she answered more than half of questions herself. There were some teen ogres (boys) who seemed even taller than orcs who're themselves already taller than Alondra (the smallest one seems to be at least 20 ft tall). Orcs and ogres seemed quite popular among other students: perhaps because they're in a sports club or something. There were also some goths students (both females and males): some mouse boys/girls, rat boys/girls as well as some goblin boys/girls, all of them seemed rather short (the tallest of their group being 5 ft tall at best). There are also some gnolls who seemed \"average\" (neither popular nor popular). They were taller than humans (9 ft tall) but still smaller than amazons like Alondra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genius harpie girl also seemed to be friend with some elves (boys and girls) with a classic human size but they all seemed smart and elegant. You took some time to observe the group of goths and you noticed they were joined by a few dark elves and vampires who had a human size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you noticed that some demons (boys/girls) of various races and heights were talking with some yokais (girls/boys of various heights races) and some dragons (boys and girls). They seemed to be specialists in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also a few more races/groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two hours of maths class were over, the recreation was about to start.

There might be more races/genders during the recreation, this is only for your class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrainies: not the most popular ones, they're good in class and have good grades. Expect a harpie girl as well as some elves (both genders). There might be more races/genders during the recreation, this is only for your class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecialists in magic: mystic group of students who try to master great powers. People think they're cool but only a few persons know what they really do. You can expect demons of various genders, heights and races as well as dragons (various genders, heights and races but they're all tall). There might be more races/genders during the recreation, this is only for your class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoths: Neither popular nor impopular. They're quite discreet ... expect vampires (both genders), dark elves (both genders), goblins (both genders), mourse and rats (both genders). All of them are either quite shrot or average in size. There might be more races/genders during the recreation, this is only for your class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverage: people who're neither popular nor impopular. You can find some gnolls among the ones in your class (there might be more). There might be more races/genders during the recreation, this is only for your class.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yo Writing com! This is my second interactive. This one is inspired by Kamu's monster stories and Brainsewage. Well here are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Please for the love of god, know how to use grammar, spacing, and punctuations. I'm not saying ya have to be Stephen Hawking, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No short chapters! Keep a minimum of two to three paragraphs. I will give leniency on choice chapters, bjt don't continuously make them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sexual content in the Middle school choices will be a strong Pg-13 and maybe borderline rated R. While the high school will be rated R <i>lite</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No toilet, TG, limb expansion or inflation, or vore whatsoever. I will allow moderate muscle growth, some shrinking/growing, and other stuff like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. And for size changing and giants are allowed since are monsters and aliens walk the earth and intend the school as students or faculty. And thus coexisting with humans. But you can definitely change back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Make character act their age and such. No super badass ten years wielding guns and acting like hardened soldiers. :v<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. And while I'm straight. You can play and interact with both boys and girl characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. And while foot fetish is the main kink of this story. It doesn't mean that you blind to a character's other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't exactly pure smut(and it can be close). But playful mocking and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. Same goes for size and texture. Think for example orges! Do you really think those big brutes would have soft dainty feet that smell like roses do you?<br>\r\n10.1. Note for certain creatures their definition of \"big feet\" is going to be a little bit different from ours...heh.<br>\r\n10.2. This extends also to people as a whole. Not everyone is a short and slim elf nor is a tall and buff minotaur. People are different. Be descriptive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Your choices do matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n11.1. The protagonist is going through puberty...take that as you will. :v<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Keep it either first person pov or second person pov. And that has a name. And their age in the middle school storylines are going to be twelve to thirteen years and for high school ones, it is going to be fifteen to sixteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. No crossovers. This is a purely original story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Final rule! Where a monster is from will decide their ancestry. For example, a Kyuubi would be a Japanese American and A dark elf will be Nordic American.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTO PROMOTE STORY GROWTH, I WILL BE GIVING OUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GIFT POINTS TO GOOD ADDITIONS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are monthly lists for creatures of interest. Any good chapter for these will be rewarded with three and four hundred gp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>June</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Fish people <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Undead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.
