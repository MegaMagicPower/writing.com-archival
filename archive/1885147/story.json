Exhausted, out of breath, and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the basket. You shoot the ball upward as it arcs toward the hoop. Seconds on the clock count down as it nears the goal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stumble out of the Bone Hallway, feeling unusually warm. Strangely, it feels like you\u2019re wearing a costume, even though you weren\u2019t. You reach up to wipe your brow, only to be greeted by what feels like rubber, unnerving you. Even more disturbingly, as you look down at your hands, you notice they seem different somehow, like gloves almost. You shake your head. That\u2019s impossible, you think; the haunted mansion must just be getting to you. Still, it feels unnerving, and your skin feels unusually itchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the end of the hall, still a bit nervous, you\u2019re surprised as you see a mirror hanging on the wall. Hopefully that would assuage your fears, right? There was still a sense of trepidation as you walked up to it. You weren\u2019t sure you wanted to see, but you took a peek anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, you thought you looked normal, and were relieved. Then you took a closer look. Your skin looked paler somehow, and rubbery. And your eyes seemed wider somehow. In fact, you thought there was something underneath them. Cautiously, you reach up, and pick at the dark space, only to feel it peel away from your face. Not off your \u2018face\u2019 itself, but apart from something underneath, and your breath tightened. The skin on your face was like a mask, a mask that you had slowly begun peeling off. You stared in disbelief as your finger pulled at the hole where your eye socket was, before suddenly it ripped, peeling down the side of your mask-like old face, revealing something else beneath; reddish scales where your skin should\u2019ve been. You backed away in a panic, before hearing another tear from your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nail jutted from the wall beside you, which seemed to have gotten hooked on your clothes. In fact, upon closer inspection, it dug into your flesh, or what was your flesh, peeling back what used to be your skin, exposing monstrous, reptilian scales. You stared, horrified as you pulled at the fabric, exposing more of what was underneath. You ripped off the skin across your stomach, causing a bloated, reptilian belly to bulge out, somewhat like a crocodile\u2019s. What was happening to you?! Your skin was now a costume! Even your hands were gloves, which sharp nails quickly jutted out the fingertips. You took one last glance into the mirror, seeing the remains of your old face hanging limply around some beast\u2019s. You couldn\u2019t believe it, but it looked like you were a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a tutting from off to the side, and turned to look, seeing another unbelievable sight. A large, green skinned man, with horns jutting from his bald head. He didn\u2019t look human, and it didn\u2019t look like he was wearing a costume either. He was like an orc, fat, green, and disgustingly slimy, with lumpy skin, varicose veins, and oozing sores, wearing a surprisingly dapper, if ill-fitting suit. He smelled awful, like sewage. The fat monster approached from the shadows as you backed away in fear, unable to process what was going on. He suddenly spoke, with a bone-chillingly deep, gravely voice, \u201cWell, well, seems you accidentally tore your human skin.\u201d, he sounded vaguely sympathetic as he grabbed the tattered remains of your old skin and clothing, and ripped it off your torso, showing off more of your new scales as he looked at it. You could only gawk at him before finally blurting out, \u201cW-Who are you\u2026? What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster stopped, \u201cDon\u2019t worry boy, my name is Costington. I\u2019m here to help.\u201d, \u201cHelp\u2026?\u201d You muttered, afraid of what \u2018help\u2019 was. \u201cYep, your old human skin was getting a bit worn out boy. Judging by the smell, it\u2019s a bit past it\u2019s expiration date.\u201d He disgustingly took a few sniffs of it, before recoiling, \u201cHow long have you had this?\u201d, \u201cEr, my whole life?\u201d You said, confused, causing Costington\u2019s eyes to widen, \u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely in need of replacing then.\u201d You watched, horrified and repulsed as Costington suddenly ate the skin and clothing he held in his hands, slurping it up into his large, fanged mouth, letting out a large BURRRRRP as he was finished, and wiped away saliva with his sleeve. \u201cWell, no worries. I\u2019ve got just the thing. Follow me.\u201d The fat monster grabbed your scaly hand and pulled you down a second corridor, despite your reluctance. Soon, you found yourself outside what looked like a costume shop? In the middle of a haunted house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCostington gestured proudly, \u201cCostington\u2019s Costumes, fitting monsters of all sizes into any disguises.\u201d You stared in disbelief. \u201cW-Wait, monsters? What\u2019s going on. Just a second ago, I was human. Then I came here and\u2026 this place\u2026. And my skin.\u201d Costington chuckled, \u201cYou must be confused. Well, you can drop the act. You\u2019re among your own kind now.\u201d He laughed, \u201cWe\u2019ve been disguising ourselves as humans for the longest time. But inevitably these disguises can wear down, particularly one of such cheap quality like your own, and inevitably they eventually just rip apart. I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t do it sooner honestly, but you needn\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you a new one.\u201d He peeled a piece of your old \u2018skin\u2019 off your scaly face and ate it, chuckling again, while you were still struggling to wrap your mind around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCostington dragged you into the store, where you could see what initially looked like other humans, before you noticed they were all standing completely still on top of platforms, and you realized they were probably just mannequins dressed up like humans. The clothing racks all had skins hanging on wires, and there were packages lined up, like Halloween costumes, except showing off rather mundane individuals. It even smelled like cheap rubber costumes in a Halloween store (apart from the uncomfortable stench Costington was giving off that is). Costington just smiled, barring a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth that made you cringe, \u201cWelcome.\u201d He said, practically bouncing over to one of the racks and motioning you to follow him, \u201cI think you\u2019ll be delighted in our wide selection of human disguises.  We fit all kinds. And our skins have been very well preserved, of course, we get new arrivals daily, freshly peeled.\u201d You didn\u2019t think you wanted to think over that last part as you stumbled around, disturbed at the sight of human skin on hooks around the lair. Costington held up a few from a rack that he observed, \u201cOf course, your old one has been out of production for a while, dunno when we\u2019ll see it again, but hey, we got plenty of other good ones. They\u2019re much less restrictive too.\u201d, \u201cLess restrictive?\u201d You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCostington poked your new chubby belly, \u201cWell of course. We plus sized monsters need some special care after all. Even if you want one that\u2019s skinny, if it\u2019s not roomy enough, it\u2019ll feel too constriction, leading to discomfort, and probably rip too.\u201d He laughed, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, if you still want a \u2018slim\u2019 look, I think I can accommodate. Of course, we\u2019ll have to see what I have in stock. There\u2019s been an increasing demand for big-fitting skins lately, so no promises.\u201d Costington rambled as you stood, uncomfortably. You weren\u2019t sure what had happened, or what you should be doing now. You weren\u2019t even sure you trusted him. Costington grabbed a few more off the rack, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d He said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see what we can scourge up. I\u2019m certain there\u2019s something here you\u2019ll like. Give me a moment to set up a few models, and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d He chuckled as he darted off to a back room with the skins, leaving you standing in the costume shop, uncertain about everything going on. This wasn\u2019t right though; you knew you weren\u2019t a monster. But what should you do about your current predicament? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bone-filled hallway seemed too ominous, and the other smelled too nauseating, so you decided to go down the slime-covered corridor in the center, deeming it the lesser of the three evils; or the option that would lead to less potential injury to yourself anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole hallway an eerie glow, and bright green slime slowly crept down the stained walls perpetually onto the cobblestone floor; which looked more like a mud slick than anything now. It stunk, not as bad as the other corridor, but the slime seemed to be giving off a funky smell, and it was strangely, and uncomfortably, hot and humid as well. Taking a few cautious steps forward, you find that the floor is slicker than you thought, and struggle to balance yourself and avoid falling face-first into the ooze. Your shoes are already coated in the gunk, and disgustingly squelch with each step forward. You look around, and see a guardrail along the wall. At least it has though you supposed, and you instinctively grab it, only the find the rail is also coated in a thick layer of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly withdraw your hand, seeing sticky strands of stringy goo peeling away from your fingertips, and stare at your slime-covered palm in disgust. \u201cIck. Gross\u2026\u201d You mumble as you start to wipe if off on your jeans, only to realize that, as disgusting as it is, holding onto the handrail is probably the only way you\u2019ll make it down the hall without tripping and falling repeatedly into gunk, and getting yourself even dirtier. Might as well keep holding on and hope they have paper towels for afterwards. You quickly remove your hand, only to see a dark green print of it on your pants and angrily curse to yourself. That\u2019s definitely going to stain. And the goo on your hand didn\u2019t even come off. Well, there are probably bathrooms here, so hopefully you can wash it off later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping the rail again, cringing as you feel gunk ooze between your fingers, you trudge on through the slime, going further down the hall. The sludge still squishes unpleasantly under your shoes, and your hand only gets slimier as it slides along the rail. You weren\u2019t sure what was at the end of the hall, but hopefully it\u2019d be more tolerable. Of course, as soon as you think that, some ooze drops down onto your head, and you cringe at the cold, viscous substance in your hair, dribbling down your face and shirt. \u201cAw, damnit!\u201d You angrily cuss as you try to get it off. So much for trying to stay clean you guess. You pulled away the gummy substance in revulsion and try to shake it off. For some reason it seems to be sticking to you. Your free hand still feels slimy, and even though you try, some of the gel still clings to your hair desperately. It all oozes down your face, onto the front of your shirt, covering it in dark green slimy stains. Great, you\u2019ll definitely need a bath when you get home. You attempt to wipe it off your face, but it still seems to stay sticky; and accidentally end up wiping your free hand on your pants, with the same results as last time, leaving another big stain. Grumbling, you reluctantly trudge on. The sooner out of here, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t realize that your body has slowly begun changing. For some reason, your clothes feel a bit tighter, but you just dismiss it as nerves and continue on. The slimy stains spread across, making your shirt and pants looser, and significantly dirtier, to accommodate a slowly expanding midsection. Your slime-covered hands start to look a bit more swollen; which just travels up your arms, making them puffier too. Suddenly you start to notice that the hallway is seemingly even more humid now. Was it always this hot? You huff, walking further. Although you haven\u2019t been walking too long, you still feel strangely out of breath, and particularly sweaty. Sweat drips down your sides and down your red face as you pant. Something felt definitely off. You had to get out of there; the heat felt like it was killing you, but you couldn\u2019t run, lest you slip into the\u2026 suddenly very refreshing-seeming slime. As cool as it felt against your hand, it didn\u2019t seem like that long a walk to the end, so you mustered your strength and plowed on, hot and sweaty as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absentmindedly ran your slimy hand through your hair, which had suddenly become thick and greasy, though somehow you didn\u2019t fully care. In fact, all of you felt disgustingly greasy and disturbingly damp. You couldn\u2019t see your cheeks puffing out with each breath, your neck and chin plumping up and outwards as red pimples began forming across your face. Your arms, and your whole body, somehow felt so much heavier now, as your clothes shifted too, becoming even sweatier and filthier. Your shirt became a filthy, sweat and food stained sleeveless T, while your jeans became ripped up and equally dirty. Your shoes seemed to take the most drastic change, melting down around your socks, which became hole-filled and dark with sweat, turning into a pair of flip-flops and leaving your feet to be exposed to more disgustingly squishy, yet somehow cooling slime. You couldn\u2019t remember wearing socks with sandals, but somehow it felt\u2026 right\u2026 Not that you could see them anymore if you looked down. Your gut had ballooned even further. It expanded outward, draping across your new shorts like a apron; a true waterfall of flab. Still exhausted from the walk, you obliviously rubbed the blubber with your hand, coating it in more greasy sludge and feeling it squish and jiggle, uncontrollably moaning as you did. Your chest had equally fattened, tuning into two massive moobs that rested on the overflowing potbelly. Sweat flowed down the slippery fat rolls and flab by your side from your dank armpits, forming huge stains in your new dirty shirt. You were so exhausted. Although a small part of your mind felt that this was wrong. \u201cOh god\u2026\u2019 You moaned, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to-BWOOOOOOOORRRRRRRPPP-me?!\u201d You yelled, uncontrollably belching as you waddled towards the end of the corridor. Suddenly there was a pain in your gargantuan gut that made you pause, \u201cOh god\u2026.URRRRP-no!\u201d You belched uncontrollably again, before bracing yourself, bending over and ripping an enormous, 15-second long trumpeting fart that seemed to shake the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in relief, yet reeled in disgust and embarrassment at what you just did. It smelled awful, although you didn\u2019t think you had eaten anything before now. And somehow, as much as it stunk, you didn\u2019t care, still trying to catch your breath from being overheated, you still huffed it, noting, to your dismay, it became more and more bearable with each sniff. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 happening\u2026 to\u2026. me?!\u201d You panted, trying to resume your escape. You wanted out ASAP. Although it didn\u2019t end there, with another few waddling steps forwards, sending your massive belly swaying, you felt another gurgle, and this time lifted up your leg, releasing another booming blast of gas that filled the room with an even greater stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMPPPPPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrounged your face in disgust. \u201cUgh, why am I so gassy\u2026?\u201d You muttered, noticing you were slurring your words a bit. That didn\u2019t matter though; you were almost at the end of the hallway now. Huffing and panting, you managed to make it to the threshold into a large chamber. A few more farts and belches escaped as you stopped for breath; panting and extremely sweaty. Your B.O. was almost as pungent as your flatulence. You gag as you waddle further, noticing a large mirror on the wall, and seeing, to your disbelief, the massive, gross, sweaty, greasy slob that you now were in it. Your face was riddled in red zits. Your hair was tangled, matted, and slimy. Your ill-fitting clothes were stretched, torn, covered in stains and looked like they hadn\u2019t been washed in ages. And of course was your newfound obesity. You were as big as a whale, a true lardass, probably the fattest person you\u2019d ever seen. Fat skin drooped down, particularly on your apron belly, which was like a waterfall of disgusting flab. Everything about you seemed greasy and slimy, like there was some sort of film over you that left your pale skin even more discolored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, no\u2026 No, no, no\u2026\u201d You whimpered, gazing, repulsed at he sight, \u201cWhat the hell happened to me?!\u201d As you moaned that, there was another gurgle in your massive belly, followed by another particularly loud and grotesque fart from your ass. BLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTT. You whimpered, not sure how this had happened or why, but there had to be some way to undo this. You were a complete slob now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, you looked around the rest of the chamber. There were two other hallways on either side. One, dyed an eerie red, had claw marks and animal heads on the walls. The other, dyed blue, was a vortex tunnel\u2014a steel walkway through a moving spiral, which seemed to draw you in. Besides them, there was also the slime tunnel you had come in at. You weren\u2019t sure what would happen going down any of them, but anything would be better than being a fat slob like this, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
